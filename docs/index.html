<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Previous evidence has shown a link between neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), and melatonin. The data in the literature about the impact of the hormone under different experimental PD conditions are quite controversial, and its effect on memory impairment in the disease is very poorly explored. The current research was aimed at investigating the role of melatonin pretreatment on memory and motor behavior in healthy rats and those with the partial 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of PD. All rodents were pretreated with melatonin (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) for 5 days. At 24 h and 7 days after the first treatment for healthy rats, and at the second and third week post-lesion for those with PD, the animals were tested behaviorally (apomorphine-induced rotations, rotarod, and passive avoidance tests). The neurochemical levels of dopamine (DA), acetylcholine (ACh), noradrenaline (NA), and serotonin (Sero) in the brain were also determined. The results showed that in healthy animals, melatonin pretreatment had amnestic and motor-suppressive effects and did not change the levels of measured brain neurotransmitters. In animals with PD, melatonin pretreatment exerted a neuroprotective effect, manifested as a significantly decreased number of apomorphine-induced rotations, reduced number of falls in the rotarod test, and improved memory performance. The brain DA and ACh concentrations in the same animals were restored to the control levels, and those of NA and Sero did not change. Our results demonstrate a beneficial effect of melatonin on memory and motor disturbance in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using potential biomarkers may help with implementing early therapeutic interventions, monitoring, and ultimately disease treatment. The current study aimed to evaluate serum levels of DKK-1, TNC, and oxidative stress markers, as well as analyzing the expression of LRP6, GSK3A, and GSK3B genes in patients with AD. Serum levels of DKK-1, TNC, TOS, TAC, and MDA were measured in 40 AD patients and 40 healthy individuals. Additionally, the relative expressions of LRP6, GSK3A, and GSK3B genes in whole blood were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to investigate the incremental diagnostic value of each factor in the study groups. Mean serum levels of DKK-1, TNC, TOS, TAC, and MDA were significantly higher in the AD group compared to the healthy group (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001). Moreover, a significant difference was observed in the expression of LRP6 and GSK3A genes (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001) between patients and healthy groups. However, the expression of GSK3B did not significantly differ between the two groups (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &gt; 0.05). With considerable sensitivity and specificity, ROC analysis demonstrated the diagnostic efficacy of DKK-1 and TNC serum levels in AD within an area under the ROC curve of ≥ 0.98 (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> ˂ 0.001). The results showed that evaluating serum levels of DKK-1 and TNC, as well as assessing the expression of LRP6, could be utilized for diagnosis and monitoring of AD patients.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Dietary zinc deficiency may lead to olfactory deficits, whose mechanism remains largely elusive. Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), a type of glial cells that support the function and neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb (OB), may play a pivotal role in the maintenance of the olfactory system. In the present study, we established a rat model of dietary zinc deficiency and found that severe zinc deficiency, but not marginal zinc deficiency, caused significantly reduced food intake, growth retardation, and apparent olfactory deficit in growing rats. We showed that severe zinc deficiency resulted in the loss of OECs in the olfactory nerve layer (ONL) of the olfactory bulb. In addition, we revealed that the number of TUNEL-positive cells increased markedly in the region, suggesting an involvement of apoptotic cell death in zinc deficiency-induced loss of OECs. Moreover, we found that treatment with zinc chelator <em class="a-plus-plus">N</em>,<em class="a-plus-plus">N</em>,<em class="a-plus-plus">N</em>′<em class="a-plus-plus">N</em>′,-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) triggered the apoptosis of in vitro-cultured primary OECs. The apoptosis of OECs was correlated with significantly elevated expression of p53. Importantly, TUNEL and CCK-8 assays both demonstrated that treatment with p53 antagonist pifithrin-α (PFT-α) markedly attenuated TPEN-induced OEC apoptosis. These findings implicated that p53-triggered apoptosis of OECs might play an integral role in zinc deficiency-induced olfactory malfunction.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Astrocyte activation is characterized by hypertrophy with increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), whose expression may involve pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, the effects of pro-inflammatory IL-6 and TNF-α and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 on nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signalling, intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup>]<sub class="a-plus-plus">i</sub>) and GFAP expression were investigated. In human glioblastoma astrocytoma U-373 MG cells, IL-6 and TNF-α, but not IL-4 or IL-10, increased iNOS, cGMP, [Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup>]<sub class="a-plus-plus">i</sub> and GFAP expression. The inhibitors of iNOS (1400 W), soluble guanylyl cyclase (ODQ) and IP3 receptors (ryanodine and 2-APB) reversed the increase in cGMP or [Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup>]<sub class="a-plus-plus">i</sub>, respectively, and prevented GFAP expression. In rat striatal slices, IL-6 and TNF-α, at variance with IL-4 and IL-10, promoted a concentration-dependent increase in Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup> efflux, an effect prevented by 1400 W, ODQ and RY/2APB. These data were confirmed by in vivo studies, where IL-6, TNF-α or the NO donor DETA/NO injected in the striatum of anaesthetised rats increased cGMP levels and increased GFAP expression. The present findings point to NO/cGMP-dependent calcium signalling as part of the mechanism mediating IL-6- and TNF-α-induced GFAP expression. As this process plays a fundamental role in driving neurotoxicity, targeting NO/cGMP-dependent calcium signalling may constitute a new approach for therapeutic interventions in neurological disorders.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Serum miRNAs (miRs) have gained consideration as encouraging molecular markers for cancer diagnosis and prediction of prognosis. The authors aimed to identify the exact role of miR-17-5p, miR-125b, and miR-221 among glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients before and after standard treatment, and correlate their expression with survival pattern. The study included 25 GBM patients and 20 healthy controls. Serum miR-17-5p, miR-125b, and miR-221 expression were analyzed before and after treatment using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The diagnostic efficacy for the tested miRs was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the relation of miRs expression versus clinical criteria for GBM was assessed. Patients’ survival patterns were examined versus miRs expression levels. A significant difference was reported between miRs expression among the enrolled individuals. Both miR-17-5p and miR-221 reported significant elevations in GBM patients who: are above 60 years old, underwent biopsy resection, have a non-frontal lesion, with tumor size above 5 cm, and with performance status equals 2 according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status. With regard to miR-125b, a significant difference was detected according to surgery strategy, primary lesion of the tumor, and ECOG status. MiRs levels were significantly decreased for GBM patients after treatment. Survival patterns demonstrated an increase in miR-17-5p, miR-125b, and miR-221 in GBM patients with worse progression-free survival and among those with worse overall survival. Detection of serum miR-17-5p, miR-125b, and miR-221 aids in the prediction of prognosis and response to treatment strategy for GBM patients.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Neurotrauma is among the main causes of human disability and mortality. Nerve injury impairs not only neurons but also causes death of satellite glial cells remote from the injury site. We studied the dynamics of expression of different proapoptotic proteins (E2F1, p53, caspase 3) in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of a rat after sciatic nerve transection. TUNEL staining and immunoblotting were used for analysis of cell apoptosis and axotomy-induced biochemical changes. Apoptosis of glial cells was observed at 24 h after sciatic nerve transection and increased on day 7, when apoptosis of some neurons only started. The earliest proapoptotic event in the injured DRG was overexpression of transcription factor E2F1 at 4 h after sciatic nerve transection. This preceded the induction of p53 and cleavage of caspase 3 at 24-h post-axotomy. The nerve injury marker amyloid precursor protein and the nerve regeneration marker GAP-43 were overexpressed in DRG on day 7 after sciatic nerve transection. We also developed a novel fluorescence method for differential visualization of the rat DRG and nerves by means of double staining with propidium iodide and Hoechst 33342 that impart red and blue-green fluorescence, respectively. The present experiments showed that glial cells remote from the nerve transection site were more vulnerable to axotomy than DRG neurons. E2F1 and p53 may be considered promising molecular targets for development of potential neuroprotective agents.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects male and female patients differently. Several studies have been performed to explain the gender differences in MS susceptibility, but the genetic causes underlying gender differences remain unknown. The association between multiple sclerosis and the HLA-DRB1*15:01 haplotype has been confirmed to be female-specific. We hypothesized other immunological components such as lnc-DC may be gender-specific among multiple sclerosis patients, especially when MS patients are negative for the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele. Therefore, the current study, considering the results of previous studies, aimed to evaluate the expression level of the lnc-DC gene in HLA-DRB1*15:01-negative female patients with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS). A total of 50 MS female patients and 50 female healthy controls were enrolled in this observational case-control study. HLA-DRB1*15:01, as a critical risk factor for MS, was ruled out in all patients. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from all patients and total RNA was isolated and cDNA synthesis was carried out. The gene expression of lnc-DC was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR. Our results have shown that lnc-DC expression level was significantly higher in total MS female patients compared with female controls (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 0.0044). In addition, the correlation between lnc-DC with disease duration, EDSS, and age at onset did not reach a statistical significance in our study (r = 0.0336, <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 0.817; r = 0.0914, <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 0.5278 and r = 0.0743, <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 0.6083, respectively). Our results give further evidence that lnc-DC may play a gender-dependent role in MS pathogenesis.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">In this study, we explored the effects of propofol on oxidative stress response, cytokine secretion, and autophagy in rats with ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury and oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)-stimulated primary microglia and analyzed the role of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway in this process. Rat models of I/R injury and OGD models of primary microglia were established. Neurobehavioral scores were evaluated 24 h after reperfusion, and oxidative stress indicators, cytokine levels, and autophagy-related markers of rats and OGD-activated primary microglia were evaluated. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway was also assessed. The results showed that propofol pretreatment can improve nerve function in rats with I/R injury, inhibit oxidative stress response and inflammatory cytokine secretion, and promote autophagy in rats with I/R injury and OGD-activated primary microglia, and that the PI3K-Akt pathway was activated in this process. Following the addition of a PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor, the effects of propofol on autophagy in rats with I/R injury and primary microglia were inhibited significantly. The results indicate that propofol promotes autophagy via the PI3K/Akt pathway in cerebral I/R injury.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Stress is considered as an important risk factor in the progression and the onset of many disorders such as multiple sclerosis. However, metabolite changes as a result of demyelination under the detrimental effects of stress are not well understood. Thus, 36 female Wistar rats (i.e., groups (1) no-cuprizone (Cont), (2) no-stress + cuprizone-treated (Cup), (3) physical stress + cuprizone-treated (P-Cup), (4) psychological stress + cuprizone-treated (Psy-Cup), (5) physical stress + no-cuprizone-treated (P), (6) psychological stress + no-cuprizone-treated (Psy)) were used in this study. Following induction of repetitive stress, cuprizone treatment was carried out for 6 weeks to instigate demyelination in all groups except the control animal. Relative metabolite concentrations of the brain were investigated by single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (reporting <em class="a-plus-plus">N</em>-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), glycerophosphocholine with phosphocholine (tCho) relative to total creatine (tCr)). According to <sup class="a-plus-plus">1</sup>H-MRS, rats in the Cup group indicated a reduction in NAA/ tCr (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001) as well as tCho/ tCr (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.05) compared with that in the Cont group. In contrast, in both stress + cuprizone-treated groups, NAA/tCr and tCho/tCr ratios remarkably increased versus the Cup group (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001) and the Cont group (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001 for the Psy-Cup group and <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.05 for the P-Cup group). Both P and Psy groups revealed normal metabolite concentrations similar to the Cont group 6 weeks post stress. Seemingly, in the case of cuprizone alone, decreased level of metabolites is mainly relevant to neuronal cell impairments. Meanwhile, as a result of oxidative stress enhancement due to stress exposure, oligodendrocyte becomes the main victim indicating the increased level of metabolite ratios.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Exosomes are cell-derived membrane vesicles with cargo that can be transported into receiver cells to exert their biological roles. Exosomal RNA signature profiles and exosome-derived proteomics are often used to explore the molecular regulation of diseases, and can mirror the conditional state of their tissue of origin, thus serving as biomarkers. The onset of meningeal carcinomatosis (MC) is concealed, and early diagnosis is difficult. To enable early diagnosis of MC, it is essential to identify new biomarkers. Few studies have investigated the function of exosomes in MC. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to examine the mRNA profiles of exosomes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with MC. We further analyzed the functions and signaling pathways associated with the differentially expressed genes in exosomes to reveal the putative mechanisms by which the exosomal mRNAs function in MC. In summary, this study identified biomarker candidates for MC, and provided new insights into the significant role of exosomal mRNA regulation in MC.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Stroke is one of the highest incidence neurological disorder with great morbidity and mortality rate. The secondary neuroinflammation contributed by microglial activation is a consequential response observed in the pathogenesis of stroke. High-mobility group box 1, a non-histone nuclear protein, interacts with immune cells, such as microglia, and leads to a cascade amplification of the secondary neuroinflammatory responses, which are related to neuronal damage later. Melatonin is a neurohormone, well-known as its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. However, until now, more findings are required for better understanding about anti-inflammatory effect of melatonin on HMGB1 and HMGB1-triggered pathway in LPS-induced microglial activation. Melatonin effect on the viability of BV2 microglial cells was measured by CCK-8 assay; mRNA levels of HMGB1 and other inflammatory cytokines were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; the protein expression levels of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB and SIRT1 were detected by Western blot, and HMGB1 translocation and release from BV2 microglial cells were examined by immunofluorescence assay. The results of this study demonstrated that melatonin suppressed LPS-triggered BV2 microglial activation-mediated inflammation by inhibiting high expression and release of HMGB1 and moderating the activation of subsequent TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, which was activated by SIRT1 elevation. Furthermore, LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) was notably reversed by melatonin pre-treatment. In summary, our findings suggest that melatonin may act as a promising therapeutic agent for reducing post-stroke neuroinflammation by targeting HMGB1 and the subsequent signaling axis.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of circRNA cerebellar degeneration–related protein 1 antisense RNA(CDR1as)/miR-671/GSK3β signaling pathway on PC12 cell injury and the mechanism of Exendin-4 (Ex-4) in PC12 cell injury protection. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression levels of circular RNA CDR1as and miR-671 in PC12 cells. By overexpressing or knocking out CDR1as, miR-671, and GSK3β, the role of CDR1as, miR-671, and GSK3β in PC12 cell injury was analyzed. The binding of CDR1as to miR-671 and GSK3β to miR-671 was verified by dual luciferase reporter assay. PC12 cells were treated with 1-methyl-4 phenyl-pyridine ion (MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>) to construct a PC12 cell damage model. PC12 cell transfection experiments were used to confirm the role of CDR1as/miR-671/GSK3β signal axis in PC12 cell damage, and the role of Ex-4 in the association of circRNA CDR1as/miR-671/GSK3β signaling axis and PC12 cell damage. PC12 cell damage was detected by 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and cellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Ex-4 reversed the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, and GSK-3β in MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-treated PC12 cells, and reduced MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-induced PC12 cell damage. CircRNA CDR1as upregulated the expression of GSK3β by sponge miR-671. Ex-4 downregulated CDR1as expression and upregulated miR-671 expression in MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-induced PC12 cell. Silencing of CDR1as reduced MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-induced PC12 cell damage. CDR1as transfection downregulated the expression of miR-671 in PC12 cells, promoted the expression and phosphorylated of GSK3β, and induced PC12 cell damage. GSK3β silencing reversed CDR1as-induced PC12 cell damage. CDR1as promoted the phosphorylation level of GSK3β in PC12 cells to cause cell damage; Ex-4 reversed the phosphorylation of GSK3β caused by CDR1as in PC12 cells and reduced the PC12 cell damage caused by CDR1as. Ex-4 reverses the damage of PC12 cells induced by CDR1as/miR-671/GSK3β signaling pathway.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Ischemic stroke is the primary cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced microcirculatory dysfunction and organ injury generally occur after ischemic stroke. Several studies have shown that intermedin (IMD) has a regulating function on cerebral microcirculation and blood-brain barrier via relaxing cerebral vessels and improving the local blood supply after cerebral ischemia. However, a unified conclusion has not been reached, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To observe and analyze the changes of cerebral microcirculation perfusion of cerebral IRI by IMD post-treatment in the rats and further explore the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of IMD on cerebral IRI. Thirty-nine rats were divided into three groups: sham, I/R, and I/R + IMD groups. After IMD ischemia post-treatment, the rat cerebral infarction rate and the degree of neurological deficit were evaluated by TTC staining and neurological function score; the changes in the amount of cerebral microcirculation implantation on the injured side of the rats were observed by laser Doppler; the pathological changes and cell ultrastructure of rat cortex and hippocampus were observed by HE staining and transmission electron microscopy; the neuron apoptosis in the rat cortex and hippocampus was detected by TUNEL staining and immunohistochemical staining. Impaired neurological function, abnormal cortical/hippocampal neuron morphology, and the proportion of cerebral infarction were significantly improved in the IMD group compared with the I/R group, which suggested a possible neuroprotective role of IMD. IMD treatment also increased the average perfusion of cerebral surface microcirculation in rats by astonished 42.7 times. Finally, IMD administration decreased the caspase-3- and Bax-positive cell numbers and apoptotic cell ratio. IMD has a significant protective effect on neuronal damage caused by cerebral I/R in rats by improving cerebral microcirculation and inhibiting apoptosis.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a destructive neuropsychiatric illness affecting millions of people worldwide. The correlation between RELN gene polymorphisms and SCZ was investigated by previous researches, though the results remained conflicting. Based on the available studies, we conducted this meta-analysis to provide a more comprehensive outcome on whether the RELN gene polymorphisms (rs7341475 and rs262355) are associated with SCZ. A total of 15 studies with 25,403 subjects (9047 cases and 16,356 controls) retrieved from PubMed, ScienceDirect, EMBASE, Wiley, BMC, Cochrane, Springer, MDPI, SAGE, and Google Scholar up to June 2020 were included. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3. The heterogeneity was checked using <em class="a-plus-plus">I</em><sup class="a-plus-plus">2</sup> statistics and <em class="a-plus-plus">Q</em>-test, whereas publication bias was also measured. The rs7341475 polymorphism showed a significantly lower risk for SCZ for the allele (A vs. G: OR = 0.93, 95%CI = 0.87–0.99), codominant 1 (AG vs. GG: OR = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.85–0.99), dominant model (AA+AG vs. GG: OR = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.86–0.98), and over dominant model (AG vs. AA+GG: OR = 0.92, 95%Cl = 0.86–0.99). The allele, codominant model 1, and dominant models remained statistically significant after the correction of the Bonferroni (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.025). Subgroup analysis confirmed the association of allele and dominant models in the Caucasian after Bonferroni correction. For rs262355 polymorphism, a significantly increased risk of SCZ was found only in Caucasians for codominant 2, dominant, and allele models, but significance exists only for the allele model after Bonferroni correction. Publication bias was found in the case of codominant 2 and recessive models for rs7341475 in the overall population, but this publication was not found after performing the Bonferroni correction or after performing the subgroup analysis. No such publication was found for rs262355. The results suggest that RELN rs7341475 is associated with a lower risk of SCZ in the overall population and Caucasian population, but rs262355 is associated with an increased risk of SCZ only in the Caucasian population.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Implantation of a nerve guidance conduit (NGC) carrying neuroprotective factors is promising for repairing peripheral nerve injury. Here, we developed a novel strategy for repairing peripheral nerve injury by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)–encapsulated chitosan in laminin-coated nanofiber of Poly(l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) conduit and transplantation of rat adipose–derived stem cells (r-ADSCs) suspended in alginate. Then, the beneficial effect of AuNPs, BDNF, and r-ADSCs on nerve regeneration was evaluated in rat sciatic nerve transection model. In vivo experiments showed that the combination of AuNPs- and BDNF-encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles in laminin-coated nanofiber of PLGA conduit with r-ADSCs could synergistically facilitate nerve regeneration. Furthermore, the in vivo histology, immunohistochemistry, and behavioral results demonstrated that the AuNPs- and BDNF-encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles in NGC could significantly reinforce the repair performance of r-ADSCs, which may also contribute to the therapeutic outcome of the AuNPs, BDNF, and r-ADSCs strategies. In this study, we found that the combination of AuNPs and BDNF releases in NGC with r-ADSCs may represent a new potential strategy for peripheral nerve regeneration.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most common devastating injuries, with little possibility of recovery in humans. However, zebrafish efficiently regenerate functional nervous system tissue after SCI. Therefore, the spinal cord transection model of adult zebrafish was applied to explore the role of ATF6 in neuro-recovery. Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is a type-II transmembrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ATF6 target genes could improve ER homeostasis, which contributes to cytoprotection. Herein, we found that the ATF6 level increased at 12 h and 3 days post SCI, and returned to sham levels at 7 days post SCI. ATF6-expressing motor neurons were present in the central canal of the spinal cord and increased at 12 h post SCI. ATF6 morpholino treatment showed that inhibition of ATF6 delayed locomotor recovery and hindered neuron axon regrowth in SCI zebrafish. Furthermore, we investigated the role of both binding immunoglobulin protein (Bip) and C/EBP homologous transcription factor protein (CHOP), the two target genes of ATF6. We found that Bip expression significantly increased in the spinal cord at 7 days after SCI, which served as a pro-survival chaperone. Our results also showed that CHOP expression significantly decreased in the spinal cord at 7 days after SCI, which was identified as a protein involved in apoptosis. Taken together, our data demonstrate that ATF6 may contribute to the functional recovery after SCI in adult zebrafish, via up-regulation of Bip and down-regulation of CHOP to restore the homeostasis of ER.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Malignant astrocytomas presenting in humans of any age group are a challenge to diagnose and treat. Hence, there is a quest for new markers to ascertain their grades and predict disease outcomes. Proline, glutamic acid, and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1), a nuclear receptor co-regulator, is an oncogene found in various cancers. We postulate that by screening for PELP1, its correlation with survival outcomes of patients across various grades can indicate a plausible novel diagnostic marker and a potential therapeutic target in gliomas. Immunostaining of 100 cases of astrocytomas for PELP1 was performed on paraffin-embedded sections. Results showed that PELP1 expression increases with higher grades; the mean H-score of PELP1 in grade-I astrocytomas was determined to be 112.3, whereas in grade-IV it was 235.1 (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> value = 0.0001). Survival analysis of patients with H-score of 200–300 was only 8.8% and 68.8% in patients with scores of 0–100. PELP1 expression in high-grade astrocytomas is an important factor in determining the outcomes.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Nerve demyelination or axonal lesions are characteristic of experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN). Previous studies have demonstrated that microRNA-338 can regulate the differentiation and maturation of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells and promote injured peripheral nerves in rats. In this study, we used microRNA-338 coded lentivirus vector (miR-338-LV) in a Lewis rat EAN model, in with the conjunction P0 peptide 180–199 which was injected into the footpads of animals to induce immunization. The clinical scores of miR-338-LV and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (positive drug) groups were significantly superior to those of untreated group at disease peak and disease plateau (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.05). The nerve conduction velocity and the compound nerve action potential amplitude of miR-338-LV and IVIg groups increased significantly compared to those of the untreated group at disease peak (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.01). At disease peak, myelin swelling, cavity formation, and lamellae separation showed improvement in miR-338-LV and IVIg groups compared to untreated group. S100 and NF200 expression in miR-338-LV and IVIg groups increased compared to that in untreated group. Iba1 and S100 co-expression in Schwann cells in miR-338-LV and IVIg groups decreased compared to that in untreated group, which was indicative of the reduced conversion of Schwann cells into inflammatory cells. Overall, miR-338-LV in sciatic nerves might improve neuromuscular function in EAN by inhibiting the conversion of Schwann cells into inflammatory cells.</p>

Male mice were trained either in the delayed alternation task (fully‐adapted) or the alternation task without any delays (partially‐adapted) for 9 days. The control group remained in their homecage for the same time. The fully adapted group exhibited improved cognitive flexibility, increased long‐term potentiation and dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex and increased mature dendritic spine density in the hippocampus, compared ot the other two groups.

Abstract
Working memory (WM) is the ability to hold on‐line and manipulate information. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a key brain region involved in WM, while the hippocampus is also involved, particularly, in spatial WM. Although several studies have investigated the neuronal substrates of WM in trained animals, the effects and the mechanisms underlying learning WM tasks have not been explored. In our study, we investigated the effects of learning WM tasks in mice on the function of PFC and hippocampus, by training mice in the delayed alternation task for 9 days (adaptive group). This group was compared to naïve mice (which stayed in their homecage) and mice trained in the alternation procedure only (non‐adaptive). Following training, a cohort of mice (Experiment A) was tested in the left–right discrimination task and the reversal learning task, while another cohort (Experiment B) was tested in the attention set‐shifting task (AST). The adaptive group performed significantly better in the reversal learning task (Experiment A) and AST (Experiment B), compared to non‐adaptive and naïve groups. At the end of the behavioral experiments in Experiment A, field excitatory post‐synaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings were performed in PFC and hippocampal brain slices. The adaptive group had enhanced the long‐term potentiation (LTP) in the PFC, compared to the other groups. In the hippocampus, both the adaptive and the non‐adaptive groups exhibited increased fEPSP compared to the naïve group, but no differences in LTP. In Experiment B, the dendritic spine density was measured, which, in the PFC, was found increased in the adaptive group, compared to the non‐adaptive and naïve groups. In the hippocampus, there was an increase in mature dendritic spine density in the adaptive group, compared to the other two groups. Our results indicate a role for LTP and dendritic spine density in learning WM tasks.

Adenosine receptors (ARs) have been demonstrated to be potential therapeutic targets against Parkinson’s disease (PD). In the present study, we describe a multistage virtual screening approach that identifies dual adenosine A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonists using deep learning, pharmacophore models, and molecular docking methods. Nineteen hits from the ChemDiv library containing 1,178,506 compounds were selected and further tested by <i>in vitro</i> assays (cAMP functional assay and radioligand binding assay); of these hits, two compounds (C8 and C9) with 1,2,4-triazole scaffolds possessing the most potent binding affinity and antagonistic activity for A<sub>1</sub>/A<sub>2A</sub> ARs at the nanomolar level (pK<sub>i</sub> of 7.16–7.49 and pIC<sub>50</sub> of 6.31–6.78) were identified. Further molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggested similarly strong binding interactions of the complexes between the A<sub>1</sub>/A<sub>2A</sub> ARs and two compounds (C8 and C9). Notably, the 1,2,4-triazole derivatives (compounds C8 and C9) were identified as the most potent dual A<sub>1</sub>/A<sub>2A</sub> AR antagonists in our study and could serve as a basis for further development. The effective multistage screening approach developed in this study can be utilized to identify potent ligands for other drug targets.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NMtYLjJHLwM" width="1" />

Spinal microglia are highly responsive to peripheral nerve injury and are known to be a key player in pain. However, there has not been any direct evidence showing that selective microglial activation in vivo is sufficient to induce chronic pain. Here, we used optogenetic approaches in microglia to address this question employing CX3CR1<sup>creER/+</sup>: R26<sup>LSL-ReaChR/+</sup> transgenic mice, in which red-activated channelrhodopsin (ReaChR) is inducibly and specifically expressed in microglia. We found that activation of ReaChR by red light in spinal microglia evoked reliable inward currents and membrane depolarization. In vivo optogenetic activation of microglial ReaChR in the spinal cord triggered chronic pain hypersensitivity in both male and female mice. In addition, activation of microglial ReaChR up-regulated neuronal c-Fos expression and enhanced C-fiber responses. Mechanistically, ReaChR activation led to a reactive microglial phenotype with increased interleukin (IL)-1β production, which is likely mediated by inflammasome activation and calcium elevation. IL-1 receptor antagonist (<i>IL-1ra</i>) was able to reverse the pain hypersensitivity and neuronal hyperactivity induced by microglial ReaChR activation. Therefore, our work demonstrates that optogenetic activation of spinal microglia is sufficient to trigger chronic pain phenotypes by increasing neuronal activity via IL-1 signaling.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dO-FcSRwXwg" width="1" />

Abstract
In mammalian cochlea, sound‐induced vibration is amplified by a three‐row lattice of Y‐shaped microstructures consisting of electromotile outer hair cell and supporting Deiters cell. This highly organized structure is thought to be essential for hearing of low‐level sounds. Prior studies reported differences in geometry and synaptic innervation of the outer hair cells between rows, but how these fine features are achieved at subcellular level still remains unclear. Using serial block‐face electron microscopy, we acquired few‐hundred‐micron‐sized cytoarchitecture of mouse organ of Corti at nanometer resolution. Structural quantifications were performed on the Y‐shapes as well as afferent and efferent projections to outer hair cells (OHCs). Several new features, which support the previously observed inter‐row heterogeneity, are described. Our result provides structural bases for the gradient of mechanical properties and diverse centrifugal regulation of OHC rows.

<p>We analyse the impact of the selective pressure for the global optimisation
capabilities of steady-state EAs. For the standard bimodal benchmark function
\twomax we rigorously prove that using uniform parent selection leads to
exponential runtimes with high probability to locate both optima for the
standard ($\mu$+1)~EA and ($\mu$+1)~RLS with any polynomial population sizes.
On the other hand, we prove that selecting the worst individual as parent leads
to efficient global optimisation with overwhelming probability for reasonable
population sizes. Since always selecting the worst individual may have
detrimental effects for escaping from local optima, we consider the performance
of stochastic parent selection operators with low selective pressure for a
function class called \textsc{TruncatedTwoMax} where one slope is shorter than
the other. An experimental analysis shows that the EAs equipped with inverse
tournament selection, where the loser is selected for reproduction and small
tournament sizes, globally optimise \textsc{TwoMax} efficiently and effectively
escape from local optima of \textsc{TruncatedTwoMax} with high probability.
Thus they identify both optima efficiently while uniform (or stronger)
selection fails in theory and in practice. We then show the power of inverse
selection on function classes from the literature where populations are
essential by providing rigorous proofs or experimental evidence that it
outperforms uniform selection equipped with or without a restart strategy. We
conclude the paper by confirming our theoretical insights with an empirical
analysis of the different selective pressures on standard benchmarks of the
classical MaxSat and Multidimensional Knapsack Problems.

<p>We establish a direct connection between general tensor networks and deep
feed-forward artificial neural networks. The core of our results is the
construction of neural-network layers that efficiently perform tensor
contractions, and that use commonly adopted non-linear activation functions.
The resulting deep networks feature a number of edges that closely matches the
contraction complexity of the tensor networks to be approximated. In the
context of many-body quantum states, this result establishes that
neural-network states have strictly the same or higher expressive power than
practically usable variational tensor networks. As an example, we show that all
matrix product states can be efficiently written as neural-network states with
a number of edges polynomial in the bond dimension and depth logarithmic in the
system size. The opposite instead does not hold true, and our results imply
that there exist quantum states that are not efficiently expressible in terms
of matrix product states or practically usable PEPS, but that are instead
efficiently expressible with neural network states.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09954">Analytic model for feature maps in the primary visual cortex. (arXiv:2103.09954v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>A compact analytic model is proposed to describe the combined orientation
preference (OP) and ocular dominance (OD) features of simple cells and their
layout in the primary visual cortex (V1). This model consists of three parts:
(i) an anisotropic Laplacian (AL) operator that represents the local neural
sensitivity to the orientation of visual inputs; (ii) a receptive field (RF)
operator that models the anisotropic spatial RF that projects to a given V1
cell over scales of a few tenths of a millimeter and combines with the AL
operator to give an overall OP operator; and (iii) a map that describes how the
parameters of these operators vary approximately periodically across V1. The
parameters of the proposed model maximize the neural response at a given OP
with an OP tuning curve fitted to experimental results. It is found that the
anisotropy of the AL operator does not significantly affect OP selectivity,
which is dominated by the RF anisotropy, consistent with Hubel and Wiesel's
original conclusions that orientation tuning width of V1 simple cell is
inversely related to the elongation of its RF. A simplified OP-OD map is then
constructed to describe the approximately periodic OP-OD structure of V1 in a
compact form. Specifically, the map is approximated by retaining its dominant
spatial Fourier coefficients, which are shown to suffice to reconstruct the
overall structure of the OP-OD map. This representation is a suitable form to
analyze observed maps compactly and to be used in neural field theory of V1.
Application to independently simulated V1 structures shows that observed
irregularities in the map correspond to a spread of dominant coefficients in a
circle in Fourier space.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">The inhomogeneous Poisson point process is a common model for time series of discrete, stochastic events. When an event from a point process is detected, it may trigger a random dead time in the detector, during which subsequent events will fail to be detected. It can be difficult or impossible to obtain a closed-form expression for the distribution of intervals between detections, even when the rate function (often referred to as the intensity function) and the dead-time distribution are given. Here, a method is presented to numerically compute the interval distribution expected for any arbitrary inhomogeneous Poisson point process modified by dead times drawn from any arbitrary distribution. In neuroscience, such a point process is used to model trains of neuronal spikes triggered by the detection of excitatory events while the neuron is not refractory. The assumptions of the method are that the process is observed over a finite observation window and that the detector is not in a dead state at the start of the observation window. Simulations are used to verify the method for several example point processes. The method should be useful for modeling and understanding the relationships between the rate functions and interval distributions of the event and detection processes, and how these relationships depend on the dead-time distribution.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Quercetin is a polyphenolic flavonoid that has reported to block the binding of adenosine to A1 receptors at central nervous system and increase calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum at skeletal muscle. The aim of the present study was to investigate the acute effect of quercetin ingestion on motor unit activation and muscle contractile properties. High-density surface electromyography during submaximal contractions and electrically elicited contraction torque in knee extensor muscles were measured before (PRE) and 60 min after (POST) quercetin glycosides or placebo ingestions in 13 young males. Individual motor units of the vastus lateralis muscle were identified from high-density surface electromyography by the Convolution Kernel Compensation technique. Firing rates of motor units recruited at 30–50% of the maximal voluntary contraction torque (MVC) were increased from PRE to POST only with quercetin (9.0 ± 2.3 to 10.5 ± 2.0 pps, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.034). Twitch torque during doublet stimulation was decreased from PRE to POST with placebo (77.1 ± 17.1 to 73.9 ± 17.6 Nm, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.005), but not with quercetin (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &gt; 0.05). For motor units recruited at &lt; 10% of MVC, normalized firing rate were decreased with quercetin (1.52 ± 0.33 to 1.58 ± 0.35%MVC/pps, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.002) but increased with placebo (1.61 ± 0.32 to 1.57 ± 0.31%MVC/pps, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.005). These results suggest that ingested quercetin has the functional roles to: mitigate reduction in the muscle contractile properties, enhance activations of relatively higher recruitment threshold motor units, and inhibit activation of relatively lower recruitment threshold motor units.</p>

Objective<p>Auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is a gamma oscillation evoked by periodic auditory stimuli, which is commonly used in clinical electroencephalographic examination to evaluate the neurological functions. Though it has been suggested that auditory cortex is the origin of ASSR, how the laminar architecture of the neocortex contributes to the ASSR recorded from the brain surface remains unclear.</p>Methods<p>We used a 16-channel silicon probe to record the local field potential and the single-unit spike activity in the different layers of the auditory cortex of unanesthetized mice. Click-trains with a repetition rate at 40-Hz were present as sound stimuli to evoke ASSR.</p>Results<p>We found that the LFPs of all cortical layers showed a stable ASSR synchronizing to the 40-Hz click stimuli, while the ASSR was strongest in the granular (thalamorecipient) layer. Furthermore, time-frequency analyses also revealed the strongest coherence between the signals recorded from the granular layer and pial surface.</p>Conclusion<p>Our results reveal that the 40-Hz ASSR primarily shows the evoked gamma oscillation of thalamorecipient layers in the neocortex, and that the ASSR may be a biomarker to detect the cognitive deficits associated with impaired thalamo-cortical connection.</p>

<p>Over four decades ago, in vitro experiments showed that tau protein interacts with and stabilizes microtubules in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This observation fueled the widespread hypotheses that these properties extend to living neurons and that reduced stability of microtubules represents a major disease-driving event induced by pathological forms of tau in Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies. Accordingly, most research efforts to date have addressed this protein as a substrate, focusing on evaluating how specific mutations, phosphorylation, and other post-translational modifications impact its microtubule-binding and stabilizing properties. In contrast, fewer efforts were made to illuminate potential mechanisms linking physiological and disease-related forms of tau to the normal and pathological regulation of kinases and phosphatases. Here, we discuss published work indicating that, through interactions with various kinases and phosphatases, tau may normally act as a scaffolding protein to regulate phosphorylation-based signaling pathways. Expanding on this concept, we also review experimental evidence linking disease-related tau species to the misregulation of these pathways. Collectively, the available evidence supports the participation of tau in multiple cellular processes sustaining neuronal and glial function through various mechanisms involving the scaffolding and regulation of selected kinases and phosphatases at discrete subcellular compartments. The notion that the repertoire of tau functions includes a role as a signaling hub should widen our interpretation of experimental results and increase our understanding of tau biology in normal and disease conditions.</p>

<p>The ability of tau aggregates to recruit and misfold monomeric tau and propagate across brain regions has been studied extensively and is now recognized as a critical pathological step in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Recent evidence suggests that the detection of tau seeds in human samples may be relevant and correlate with clinical data. Here, we review the available methods for the measurement of such tau seeds, their limitations and their potential implementation for the development of the next-generation biomarkers.</p>

<p>Although animal studies and studies on Parkinson’s disease (PD) suggest that dopamine deficiency slows the pace of the internal clock, which is corrected by dopaminergic medication, timing deficits in parkinsonism remain to be characterized with diverse findings. Here we studied patients with PD and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 3–4 h after drug intake, and normal age-matched subjects. We contrasted perceptual (temporal bisection, duration comparison) and motor timing tasks (time production/reproduction) in supra- and sub-second time domains, and automatic versus cognitive/short-term memory–related tasks. Subjects were allowed to count during supra-second production and reproduction tasks. In the time production task, linearly correlating the produced time with the instructed time showed that the “subjective sense” of 1 s is slightly longer in PD and shorter in PSP than in normals. This was superposed on a prominent trend of underestimation of longer (supra-second) durations, common to all groups, suggesting that the pace of the internal clock changed from fast to slow as time went by. In the time reproduction task, PD and, more prominently, PSP patients over-reproduced shorter durations and under-reproduced longer durations at extremes of the time range studied, with intermediate durations reproduced veridically, with a shallower slope of linear correlation between the presented and produced time. In the duration comparison task, PD patients overestimated the second presented duration relative to the first with shorter but not longer standard durations. In the bisection task, PD and PSP patients estimated the bisection point (BP50) between the two supra-second but not sub-second standards to be longer than normal subjects. Thus, perceptual timing tasks showed changes in opposite directions to motor timing tasks: underestimating shorter durations and overestimating longer durations. In PD, correlation of the mini-mental state examination score with supra-second BP50 and the slope of linear correlation in the reproduction task suggested involvement of short-term memory in these tasks. Dopamine deficiency didn’t correlate significantly with timing performances, suggesting that the slowed clock hypothesis cannot explain the entire results. Timing performance in PD may be determined by complex interactions among time scales on the motor and sensory sides, and by their distortion in memory.</p>

<p>Background: Studies in animal models have suggested that aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (encoded by ALDH1A1) protects against Parkinson’s disease (PD) by reducing toxic metabolites of dopamine. Herein we aimed to investigate whether ALDH1A1 was genetically associated with PD susceptibility in humans.</p><p>Methods: A Han Chinese population of 1,039 subjects was recruited to analyze six tag-single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), followed by haplotype analyses and variants interaction analyses. Real-time PCR was used to analyze mRNA levels of ALDH1A1 in peripheral blood of 42 subjects.</p><p>Results: The tag-SNP rs7043217 of ALDH1A1 was significantly associated with PD susceptibility with the T serving as a risk allele (genotype frequency, P = 0.030; allele frequency, P = 0.013, OR = 1.258, 95% CI = 1.050–1.508). Multiple haplotypes were linked to abnormalities of PD risk, topped by a 4-SNP GGTA module in the order of rs4646547, rs1888202, rs7043217, and rs647880 (P = 9.610 × 10<sup>–8</sup>, OR = 6.420, 95% CI = 2.944–13.998). Interaction analyses showed that a simultaneous presence of the CC genotype of rs7043217 and the TT genotype of ALDH2 variant rs4767944 conferred an elevated protection against PD (P = 4.68 × 10<sup>–4</sup>, OR = 0.378, 95% CI = 0.219–0.652). The mRNA expression of ALDH1A1 showed a trend of reduction (P = 0.084) in PD patients compared to the controls.</p><p>Conclusion: Our results provide novel genetic insights into the role of ALDH1 in PD pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Although the increased expression of members of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan family, such as neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2), have been well documented after an injury to the spinal cord, a complete picture as to the cellular origins and function of this NG2 expression has yet to be made. Using a spinal cord injury (SCI) mouse model, we describe that some infiltrated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMΦ) are early contributors to NG2/CSPG4 expression and secretion after SCI. We demonstrate for the first time that a lesion-related form of cellular debris generated from damaged myelin sheaths can increase NG2/CSPG4 expression in BMDMΦ, which then exhibit enhanced proliferation and decreased phagocytic capacity. These results suggest that BMDMΦ may play a much more nuanced role in secondary spinal cord injury than previously thought, including acting as early contributors to the NG2 component of the glial scar.</p>

<p>An active lifestyle as well as cognitive and physical training (PT) may benefit cognition by increasing cognitive reserve, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of this reserve capacity are not well understood. To investigate these mechanisms of cognitive reserve, we focused on electrophysiological correlates of cognitive performance, namely on an event-related measure of auditory memory and on a measure of global coherence. Both measures have shown to be sensitive markers for cognition and might therefore be suitable to investigate potential training- and lifestyle-related changes. Here, we report on the results of an electrophysiological sub-study that correspond to previously published behavioral findings. Altogether, 65 older adults with subjective or objective cognitive impairment and aged 60–88 years were assigned to a 10-week cognitive (n = 19) or a 10-week PT (n = 21) or to a passive control group (n = 25). In addition, self-reported lifestyle was assessed at baseline. We did not find an effect of both training groups on electroencephalography (EEG) measures of auditory memory decay or global coherence (ps ≥ 0.29) and a more active lifestyle was not associated with improved global coherence (p = 0.38). Results suggest that a 10-week unimodal cognitive or PT and an active lifestyle in older adults at risk for dementia are not strongly related to improvements in electrophysiological correlates of cognition.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65751">Visualizing anatomically registered data with Brainrender</a></h4>

Three-dimensional (3D) digital brain atlases and high-throughput brain wide imaging techniques generate large multidimensional datasets that can be registered to a common reference frame. Generating insights from such datasets depends critically on visualization and interactive data exploration, but this a challenging task. Currently available software is dedicated to single atlases, model species or data types, and generating 3D renderings that merge anatomically registered data from diverse sources requires extensive development and programming skills. Here, we present <i>brainrender</i>: an open-source Python package for interactive visualization of multidimensional datasets registered to brain atlases. <i>Brainrender</i> facilitates the creation of complex renderings with different data types in the same visualization and enables seamless use of different atlas sources. High-quality visualizations can be used interactively and exported as high-resolution figures and animated videos. By facilitating the visualization of anatomically registered data, <i>brainrender</i> should accelerate the analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of brain-wide multidimensional data.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64541">Global gradients in intertidal species richness and functional groups</a></h4>

Whether global latitudinal diversity gradients exist in rocky intertidal a-diversity and across functional groups remains unknown. Using literature data from 433 intertidal sites, we investigated α-diversity patterns across 155° of latitude, and whether local-scale or global-scale structuring processes control α-diversity. We, furthermore, investigated how the relative composition of functional groups changes with latitude. α-diversity differed among hemispheres with a mid-latitudinal peak in the north, and a non-significant unimodal pattern in the south, but there was no support for a tropical-to-polar decrease in α-diversity. Although global-scale drivers had no discernible effect, the local-scale drivers significantly affected α-diversity, and our results reveal that latitudinal diversity gradients are outweighed by local-processes. In contrast to α-diversity patterns, three functional groups: predators, grazers and suspension-feeders diversity declined with latitude, coinciding with an inverse gradient in algae. Polar and tropical intertidal data were sparse, and more sampling is required to improve knowledge of marine biodiversity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63335">Tuning self-renewal in the <i>Arabidopsis</i> stomatal lineage by hormone and nutrient regulation of asymmetric cell division</a></h4>

Asymmetric and self-renewing divisions build and pattern tissues. In the <i>Arabidopsis </i>stomatal lineage, asymmetric cell divisions, guided by polarly localized cortical proteins, generate most cells on the leaf surface. Systemic and environmental signals modify tissue development, but the mechanisms by which plants incorporate such cues to regulate asymmetric divisions are elusive. In a screen for modulators of cell polarity, we identified <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</i>, a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. We subsequently revealed antagonistic impacts of ethylene and glucose signaling on the self-renewing capacity of stomatal lineage stem-cells. Quantitative analysis of cell polarity and fate dynamics showed that developmental information may be encoded in both the spatial and temporal asymmetries of polarity proteins. These results provide a framework for a mechanistic understanding of how nutritional status and environmental factors tune stem-cell behavior in the stomatal lineage, ultimately enabling flexibility in leaf size and cell-type composition.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60515">Switch-like control of helicase processivity by single-stranded DNA binding protein</a></h4>

Helicases utilize NTP hydrolysis to translocate along single-stranded nucleic acids (NA) and unwind the duplex. In the cell, helicases function in the context of other NA-associated proteins such as single-stranded DNA binding proteins. Such encounters regulate helicase function, although the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. <i>F. acidarmanus</i> XPD helicase serves as a model for understanding the molecular mechanisms of Superfamily 2B helicases, and its activity is enhanced by the cognate single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA2. Here, optical trap measurements of the unwinding activity of a single XPD helicase in the presence of RPA2 reveal a mechanism in which XPD interconverts between two states with different processivities and transient RPA2 interactions stabilize the more processive state, activating a latent 'processivity switch' in XPD. A point mutation at a regulatory DNA binding site on XPD similarly activates this switch. These findings provide new insights on mechanisms of helicase regulation by accessory proteins.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58565">Enhanced insulin signalling ameliorates C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion toxicity in <i>Drosophila</i></a></h4>

G4C2 repeat expansions within the <i>C9orf72</i> gene are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The repeats undergo repeat-associated non-ATG translation to generate toxic dipeptide repeat proteins. Here, we show that insulin/Igf signalling is reduced in fly models of <i>C9orf72</i> repeat expansion using RNA-sequencing of adult brain. We further demonstrate that activation of insulin/Igf signalling can mitigate multiple neurodegenerative phenotypes in flies expressing either expanded G4C2 repeats or the toxic dipeptide repeat protein poly-GR. Levels of poly-GR are reduced when components of the insulin/Igf signalling pathway are genetically activated in the diseased flies, suggesting a mechanism of rescue. Modulating insulin signalling in mammalian cells also lowers poly-GR levels. Remarkably, systemic injection of insulin improves the survival of flies expressing G4C2<sub> </sub>repeats. Overall, our data suggest that modulation of insulin/Igf signalling could be an effective therapeutic approach against <i>C9orf72</i> ALS/FTD.

A rare coding variant of Abelson-interactor gene family member 3 (Abi3) is associated with increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Although Abi3 is recognised as a core microglial gene, its role in microglia is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that Abi3 is crucial for normal microglial morphology, distribution, and homeostatic tissue surveillance activity in vivo.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia have been conceived as partly opposing disorders in terms of systemizing versus empathizing cognitive styles, with resemblances to male versus female average sex differences. Left-right asymmetry of the brain is an important aspect of its organization that shows average differences between the sexes, and can be altered in both ASD and schizophrenia. Here we mapped multivariate associations of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for ASD and schizophrenia with asymmetries of regional cerebral cortical surface area, thickness and subcortical volume measures in 32,256 participants from the UK Biobank. PRS for the two disorders were positively correlated (r=0.08, p=7.13E-50), and both were higher in females compared to males, consistent with biased participation against higher-risk males. Each PRS was associated with multivariate brain asymmetry after adjusting for sex, ASD PRS r=0.03, p=2.17E-9, schizophrenia PRS r=0.04, p=2.61E-11, but the multivariate patterns were mostly distinct for the two PRS, and neither resembled average sex differences. Annotation based on meta-analyzed functional imaging data showed that both PRS were associated with asymmetries of regions important for language and executive functions, consistent with behavioural associations that arose in phenome-wide association analysis. Overall, the results indicate that distinct patterns of subtly altered brain asymmetry may be functionally relevant manifestations of polygenic risk for ASD and schizophrenia, but do not support brain masculinization or feminization in their etiologies.

Objective: To compare the frequency and impact on channel function of KCNH2 variants in SUDEP patients with epilepsy controls comprising patients older than 50 years, a group with low SUDEP risk, and establish loss-of-function KCNH2 variants as predictive biomarkers of SUDEP risk. Methods: We searched for KCNH2 variants with a minor allele frequency of &lt; 5%. Functional analysis in Xenopus laevis oocytes was performed for all KCNH2 variants identified. Results: KCNH2 variants were found in 11.1% (10/90) of SUDEP individuals compared to 6.0% (20/332) of epilepsy controls (p = 0.11). Loss-of-function KCNH2 variants, defined as causing &gt; 20% reduction in maximal amplitude, were observed in 8.9% (8/90) SUDEP patients compared to 3.3% (11/332) epilepsy controls suggesting about three-fold enrichment (nominal p = 0.04). KCNH2 variants that did not change channel function occurred at a similar frequency in SUDEP (2.2%; 2/90) and epilepsy control (2.7%; 9/332) cohorts (p &gt; 0.99). Rare KCNH2 variants (&lt; 1% allele frequency) associated with greater loss of function and an ~11-fold enrichment in the SUDEP cohort (nominal p = 0.03). In silico tools were unable to predict the impact of a variant on function highlighting the need for electrophysiological analysis. Conclusions: These data show that loss-of-function KCNH2 variants are enriched in SUDEP patients and suggest that cardiac mechanisms contribute to SUDEP risk. We propose that genetic screening in combination with functional analysis can identify loss-of-function KCNH2 variants that could act as biomarkers of an individual's SUDEP risk.

Cognitive impairment is a debilitating non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). The diagnosis of PD with cognitive impairment (PDCI) is essentially through clinical and neuropsychological examinations. There is an emerging need to identify biomarker(s) to foresee cognitive decline in PD patients, at an early stage. We performed label-free unbiased non-targeted proteomics (Q-TOF LC/MS-MS) in CSF of non-neurological control (NNC); PDCI; PD and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), followed by targeted ELISA for validation. The diagnosis was confirmed by neuropsychological and MRI assessments prior to CSF collection. Of the 282 proteins identified by mass spectrometry, 42 were differentially altered in PD, PDCI and NPH. Further, 28 proteins were altered in PDCI and 25 in NPH. An interesting overlap of certain proteins was noted both in PDCI and NPH. Five significantly upregulated proteins in PDCI were fibrinogen, gelsolin, complement factor-H, apolipoprotein A-IV and apolipoprotein A-I. Whereas carnosine dipeptidase 1, carboxypeptidase E, dickkpof 3 and secretogranin 3 precursor proteins were down-regulated. NPH also had few uniquely altered proteins viz. insulin-like growth factor-binding protein, ceruloplasmin, -1 antitrypsin, VGF nerve growth factor, neural cell adhesion molecule L1 like protein. Interestingly, the ELISA-derived protein concentrations correlated well with the neuropsychological scores of certain cognitive domains. Executive function was affected both in PDCI and NPH. In PD, Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST) percentile correlated positively with ApoA-IV and negatively with the ratio of ApoA-I:ApoA-IV. Thus assessment of a battery of proteins like fibrinogen--chain, CFAH and ApoA-I:ApoA-IV ratio alongside neuropsychological could be reliable biomarkers to distinguish PDCI and NPH.

Successful engagement with the world requires the ability to predict what will happen next. Here we investigate how the brain makes the most basic prediction about the physical world: whether the situation in front of us is stable, and hence likely to stay the same, or unstable, and hence likely to change in the immediate future. Specifically, we ask if judgements of stability can be supported by the kinds of representations that have proven to be highly effective at visual object recognition in both machines and brains, or instead if the ability to determine the physical stability of natural scenes may require generative algorithms that simulate the physics of the world. To find out, we measured responses in both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the brain (using fMRI) to natural images of physically stable versus unstable scenarios. We find no evidence for generalizable representations of physical stability in either standard CNNs trained on visual object and scene classification (ImageNet), or in the human ventral visual pathway, which has long been implicated in the same process. However, in fronto-parietal regions previously implicated in intuitive physical reasoning we find both scenario-invariant representations of physical stability, and higher univariate responses to unstable than stable scenes. These results demonstrate abstract representations of physical stability in the dorsal but not ventral pathway, consistent with the hypothesis that the computations underlying stability entail not just pattern classification but forward physical simulation.

This work employs Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease (APBD) models to explore the efficacy and mechanism of action of 144DG11, a new polyglucosan-reducing lead compound discovered by a high-throughput screen (HTS). APBD is an adult onset glycogen storage disorder (GSD) manifesting as a debilitating progressive axonopathic leukodystrophy. APBD is caused by glycogen branching enzyme (GBE) deficiency leading to poorly branched and insoluble glycogen inclusions, which precipitate as neuropathogenic polyglucosans (PG). 144DG11 led to prolonged survival and improved motor parameters in a GBE knockin (Gbeys/ys) APBD mouse model. Histopathologically, 144DG11 reduced PG and glycogen levels in brain, liver, heart, and peripheral nerve. Indirect calorimetry experiments revealed that 144DG11 increases carbohydrate burn at the expense of fat burn, suggesting metabolic mobilization of pathogenic PG. These results were also reflected at the cellular level by increased glycolytic, mitochondrial and total ATP production. Mechanistically, we show that the molecular target of 144DG11 is the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP1, whose interaction with the compound, similar to LAMP1 knockdown, enhanced autolysosomal degradation of glycogen and lysosomal acidification. Enhanced mitochondrial activity and lysosomal modifications were also the most pronounced effects of 144DG11 in APBD patient fibroblasts as discovered by image-based multiparametric phenotyping analysis and corroborated by proteomics. In summary, this work presents a broad mechanistic and target-based characterization of 144DG11 in in vivo and cell models of the prototypical GSD APBD. This investigation warrants development of 144DG11 into a safe and efficacious GSD therapy.

Cigarette smoking and alcohol use are among the most prevalent substances used worldwide and account for a substantial proportion of preventable morbidity and mortality, underscoring the public health significance of understanding their etiology. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified genetic variants associated with cigarette smoking and alcohol use traits. However, the vast majority of risk variants reside in non-coding regions of the genome, and their target genes and neurobiological mechanisms are unknown. Chromosomal conformation mappings can address this knowledge gap by charting the interaction profiles of risk-associated regulatory variants with target genes. To investigate the functional impact of common variants associated with cigarette smoking and alcohol use traits, we applied Hi-C coupled MAGMA (H-MAGMA) built upon cortical and midbrain dopaminergic neuronal Hi-C datasets to GWAS summary statistics of nicotine dependence, cigarettes per day, problematic alcohol use, and drinks per week. The identified risk genes mapped to key pathways associated with cigarette smoking and alcohol use traits, including drug metabolic processes and neuronal apoptosis. Risk genes were highly expressed in cortical glutamatergic, midbrain dopaminergic, GABAergic, and serotonergic neurons, suggesting them as relevant cell types in understanding the mechanisms by which genetic risk factors influence cigarette smoking and alcohol use. Lastly, we identified pleiotropic genes between cigarette smoking and alcohol use traits under the assumption that they may reveal substance-agnostic, shared neurobiological mechanisms of addiction. The number of pleiotropic genes was ~26-fold higher in dopaminergic neurons than in cortical neurons, emphasizing the critical role of ascending dopaminergic pathways in mediating general addiction phenotypes. Collectively, brain region- and neuronal subtype-specific 3D genome architecture refines neurobiological hypotheses for smoking, alcohol, and general addiction phenotypes by linking genetic risk factors to their target genes.

Neuronal oscillations route external and internal information across brain regions. In the olfactory system, the two central nodes-the olfactory bulb (OB) and the piriform cortex (PC)-communicate with each other via neural oscillations to shape the olfactory percept. Communication between these nodes have been well characterized in non-human animals but less is known about their role in the human olfactory system. Using a recently developed and validated EEG-based method to extract signals from the OB and PC sources, we show in healthy human participants that there is a bottom-up information flow from the OB to the PC in the beta and gamma frequency bands, while top-down information from the PC to the OB is facilitated by delta and theta oscillations. Importantly, we demonstrate that there was enough in-formation to decipher odor identity above chance from the low gamma in the OB-PC oscillatory circuit as early as 100ms after odor onset. These data further our understanding of the critical role of bidirectional information flow in human sensory systems to produce perception. However, future studies are needed to determine what specific odor information is extracted and communicated in the information exchange.

Human and animal EEG data demonstrate that focal seizures start with low-voltage fast activity, evolve into rhythmic burst discharges and are followed by a period of suppressed background activity. This suggests that processes with dynamics in the range of tens of seconds govern focal seizure evolution. We investigate the processes associated with seizure dynamics by complementing the Hodgkin-Huxley mathematical model with the physical laws that dictate ion movement and maintain ionic gradients. We show that the disturbance of K+ and Cl- homeostasis by the fast discharge of inhibitory interneurons is sufficient to initiate seizures, which are maintained by positive feedback between ion concentration changes and neuronal activity. Gradual Na+ accumulation increases the rate of the Na+/K+-pump, creating negative feedback which slows down and terminates ictal discharges and contributes to the postictal state. Our results emphasize ionic dynamics as elementary processes behind seizure generation and indicate targets for new therapeutic strategies.

Humans are able to adapt their locomotion to a variety of novel circumstances, for instance, walking on diverse terrain and walking with new footwear. During locomotor adaptation, humans have been shown to exhibit stereotypical changes in their movement patterns. Here, we provide a theoretical account of such locomotor adaptation, positing that the nervous system prioritizes stability in the short timescale and improves energy expenditure over a longer timescale. The resulting mathematical model has two processes: a stabilizing controller which is gradually changed by a reinforcement learner that exploits local gradients to lower energy expenditure, estimating gradients indirectly via intentional exploratory noise. We consider this model walking and adapting under three novel circumstances: walking on a split-belt treadmill (walking with each foot on a different belt, each belt at different speeds), walking with an exoskeleton, and walking with an asymmetric leg mass. This model predicts the short and long timescale changes observed in walking symmetry on the split-belt treadmill and while walking with the asymmetric mass. The model exhibits energy reductions with exoskeletal assistance, as well as entrainment to time-periodic assistance. We show that such exploration-based learning is degraded in the presence of large sensorimotor noise, providing a potential account for some impairments in learning.

Individual differences in impatience - how much we discount future compared to immediate rewards - are associated with general life outcomes and related to substance use, psychiatric diseases, and obesity. Here, we use machine-learning on fMRI activity during an intertemporal choice task to develop a brain marker of individual differences in delay discounting. Study 1 (N=110) was used as a training and cross-validation set, resulting in significant prediction accuracy (r = 0.49) and suggesting an interplay between brain regions associated with affect, value, and cognitive control. The validity of the brain marker was replicated in an independent data set (Study 2, N=145, r = 0.45). In both studies, responses of the marker significantly differed between overweight and lean individuals. This pattern is a first step towards a generalizable neuromarker of delay discounting and a potentially transdiagnostic phenotype, which can be used as a brain-based target measure in future studies.

A number of recent studies have investigated machine learning techniques for predicting individual behaviour from fMRI. Even though encouraging results have been obtained, excessive scan times -- especially in resting state fMRI -- are a limiting factor. Here we present a new machine learning algorithm for predicting individual behaviour of healthy human subjects using both resting state (rsfMRI) as well as task-based fMRI (tfMRI). It achieves dimensionality reduction via ensemble learning and partial least squares regression rather than via brain parcellations or ICA decompositions. In addition, it introduces Ricci-Forman curvature as a novel type of edge weight. As a proof of concept, we focus on predicting fluid, crystallized and general intelligence scores. In a cohort of 390 unrelated test subjects of the Human Connectome Project, we found correlations between the observed and the predicted general intelligence of more than 50~percent in tfMRI, and of around 59~percent (R2~0.29) when results from two tasks are combined. We compare these results against a benchmark of existing methods that produced correlations below 50~percent in both rsfMRI and tfMRI. We conclude that with novel machine learning techniques applied to tfMRI it is possible to obtain significantly better prediction accuracies at a fraction of the scan time.

Working memory is active short-term memory storage that is easily accessible and underlies various activities, such as maintaining phone numbers in mind for a short period [1,2]. There is accumulating theoretical and physiological evidence that memorized items are represented rhythmically by neural oscillation in the theta range (4-7 Hz) [3,4]. However, the impact of this process on human behavior is yet to be examined. Here we show that simply memorizing sequential information affects a behavioral index (i.e., reaction time, RT) in a rhythmic manner. In the main experiment (Experiment 1), we measured RTs to a visual probe that appeared at one of two sequentially memorized locations after a random interval. Consequently, RTs to the first and second probes each fluctuated in the theta range as a function of the random interval, and the phases of the two theta fluctuations were not in phase or anti-phase, but shifted by approximately 270 degree. Interestingly, the 270 degree phase difference corresponded to the rhythm of "phase coding", where sequential information is represented on the specific phase of theta oscillation [5-7]. These relationships were not observed in tasks simply requiring attention (Experiment 2) or memorization (Experiment 3) of spatial locations without sequential order. In conclusion, the current results demonstrate that our behavior fluctuates when recalling memorized sequential items in the theta-range, suggesting that accessibility to sequential working memory is rhythmic rather than stable, possibly reflecting theta-phase coding.

Emerging evidence suggests that aging processes may be altered in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, it remains unclear if oscillatory slowing, a key neurophysiological change in the aging brain, manifests atypically in this population. This study sought to examine patterns of age-related oscillatory slowing in adults with ASD, captured by reductions in the brain's peak alpha frequency. Resting-state EEG data from adults (18-70 years) with ASD (N=93) and age-matched neurotypical (NT) controls (N=87) were pooled from three independent datasets. A robust curve-fitting procedure quantified the peak frequency of alpha oscillations (7-13Hz) across all brain regions. Associations between peak alpha frequency and age were assessed and compared between groups. Consistent with characteristic patterns of oscillatory slowing, peak alpha frequency was negatively associated with age across the entire sample (p&lt;.0001). A significant group by age interaction revealed that this relationship was more pronounced in adults with ASD ( p&lt;.01), suggesting that that age-related oscillatory slowing may be accelerated in this population. Scalable EEG measures such as peak alpha frequency could provide insights into neural aging that are crucially needed to inform care plans and preventive interventions that can promote successful aging in ASD.

Large data initiatives and high-powered brain imaging analyses require the pooling of MR images acquired across multiple scanners, often using different protocols. Prospective cross-site harmonization often involves the use of a phantom or traveling subjects. However, as more datasets are becoming publicly available, there is a growing need for retrospective harmonization, pooling data from sites not originally coordinated together. Several retrospective harmonization techniques have shown promise in removing cross-site image variation. However, most unsupervised methods cannot distinguish between image-acquisition based variability and cross-site population variability, so they require that datasets contain subjects or patient groups with similar clinical or demographic information. To overcome this limitation, we consider cross-site MRI image harmonization as a style transfer problem rather than a domain transfer problem. Using a fully unsupervised deep-learning framework based on a generative adversarial network (GAN), we show that MR images can be harmonized by inserting the style information encoded from a reference image directly, without knowing their site/scanner labels a priori. We trained our model using data from five large-scale multi-site datasets with varied demographics. Results demonstrated that our style-encoding model can harmonize MR images, and match intensity profiles, successfully, without relying on traveling subjects. This model also avoids the need to control for clinical, diagnostic, or demographic information. Moreover, we further demonstrated that if we included diverse enough images into the training set, our method successfully harmonized MR images collected from unseen scanners and protocols, suggesting a promising novel tool for ongoing collaborative studies.

When investigating connectivity and microstructure of white matter pathways of the brain using diffusion tractography bundle segmentation, it is important to understand potential confounds and sources of variation in the process. While cross-scanner and cross-protocol effects on diffusion microstructure measures are well described (in particular fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity), it is unknown how potential sources of variation effect bundle segmentation results, which features of the bundle are most affected, where variability occurs, nor how these sources of variation depend upon the method used to reconstruct and segment bundles. In this study, we investigate four potential sources of variation, or confounds, for bundle segmentation: variation (1) across scan repeats, (2) across scanners, (3) across acquisition protocol, and (4) across diffusion sensitization. We employ four different bundle segmentation workflows on two benchmark multi-subject cross-scanner and cross-protocol databases, and investigate reproducibility and biases in volume overlap, shape geometry features of fiber pathways, and microstructure features within the pathways. We find that the effects of acquisition protocol, in particular acquisition resolution, result in the lowest reproducibility of tractography and largest variation of features, followed by scanner-effects, and finally b-value effects which had similar reproducibility as scan-rescan variation. However, confounds varied both across pathways and across segmentation workflows, with some bundle segmentation workflows more (or less) robust to sources of variation. Despite variability, bundle dissection is consistently able to recover the same location of pathways in the deep white matter, with variation at the gray matter/ white matter interface. Next, we show that differences due to the choice of bundle segmentation workflows are larger than any other studied confound, with low-to-moderate overlap of the same intended pathway when segmented using different methods. Finally, quantifying microstructure features within a pathway, we show that tractography adds variability over-and-above that which exists due to noise, scanner effects, and acquisition effects. Overall, these confounds need to be considered when harmonizing diffusion datasets, interpreting or combining data across sites, and when attempting to understand the successes and limitations of different methodologies in the design and development of new tractography or bundle segmentation methods.

Vigor reflects how motivated one is to respond to a stimulus. We previously showed that humans are more vigorous when more reward is available on average, and that this relationship is modulated by the dopamine precursor levodopa. Dopamine signalling and probabilistic reward learning degrade with age, so the relationship between vigor and reward should change with age. We test this and assess whether the relationship between vigor and reward correlates with D1 dopamine receptor availability measured using Positron Emission Tomography. We measured response times of 30 older and 30 younger subjects during an oddball discrimination task where rewards varied systematically between trial. Reward rate had a similar impact on the vigor of both groups. We observed a weak positive association across subjects between ventral striatal dopamine receptor availability and effect of average reward rate on response time, which was in the opposite direction to our prediction. Overall, the effect of reward on response vigor is similar between younger and older humans and is weakly sensitive to dopamine D1 receptor availability.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.435797v1?rss=1">Longitudinal allometry of sulcal morphology in health and schizophrenia</a></h4>

Scaling between subcomponents of cortical folding and total brain volume (TBV) in healthy individuals (HI) is allometric, i.e. non-linear. It is unclear whether this is also true in individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) or first-episode psychosis (FEP). The current study first confirmed normative allometric scaling norms in HI using discovery and replication samples. Cross-sectional and longitudinal diagnostic differences in folding subcomponents were then assessed using an allometric analytic framework.

Structural imaging from a longitudinal (sample 1: HI and SZ, nHI Baseline = 298, nSZ Baseline = 169, nHI Follow-up = 293, nSZ Follow-up = 168, a total of 1087 images, all individuals [≥] 2 images, age 16-69 years) and a cross-sectional sample (sample 2: nHI = 61 and nFEP = 89, age 10-30 years) is leveraged to calculate global folding and its nested subcomponents: sulcation index (SI, total sulcal/cortical hull area) and determinants of sulcal area; sulcal length and sulcal depth.

Scaling of the SI, sulcal area, and sulcal length with TBV in SZ and FEP was allometric and did not differ from HI. Longitudinal age trajectories demonstrated steeper loss of SI and sulcal area through adulthood in SZ. Longitudinal allometric analysis revealed that both annual change in SI and sulcal area was significantly stronger related to change in TBV in SZ compared to HI.

Our results detail the first evidence of the disproportionate contribution of changes in SI and sulcal area to TBV changes in SZ. Longitudinal allometric analysis of sulcal morphology provides deeper insight into lifespan trajectories of cortical folding in SZ.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) explore the genetic causes of complex diseases. However, classical approaches ignore the biological context of the genetic variants and genes under study. To address this shortcoming, one can use biological networks, which model functional relationships, to search for functionally related susceptibility loci. Many such network methods exist, each arising from different mathematical frameworks, pre-processing steps, and assumptions about the network properties of the susceptibility mechanism. Unsurprisingly, this results in disparate solutions. To explore how to exploit these heterogeneous approaches, we selected six network methods and applied them to GENESIS, a nationwide French study on familial breast cancer. First, we verified that network methods recovered more interpretable results than a standard GWAS. We addressed the heterogeneity of their solutions by studying their overlap, computing what we called the <i>consensus</i>. The key gene in this consensus solution was <i>COPS5</i>, a gene related to multiple cancer hallmarks. Another issue we observed was that network methods were unstable, selecting very different genes on different subsamples of GENESIS. Therefore, we proposed a <i>stable consensus</i> solution formed by the 68 genes most consistently selected across multiple subsamples. This solution was also enriched in genes known to be associated with breast cancer susceptibility (<i>BLM</i>, <i>CASP8</i>, <i>CASP10</i>, <i>DNAJC1</i>, <i>FGFR2</i>, <i>MRPS30</i>, and <i>SLC4A7</i>, P-value = 3 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). The most connected gene was <i>CUL3</i>, a regulator of several genes linked to cancer progression. Lastly, we evaluated the biases of each method and the impact of their parameters on the outcome. In general, network methods preferred highly connected genes, even after random rewirings that stripped the connections of any biological meaning. In conclusion, we present the advantages of network-guided GWAS, characterize their shortcomings, and provide strategies to address them. To compute the consensus networks, implementations of all six methods are available at https://github.com/hclimente/gwas-tools.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IvWhAxDfMiU" width="1" />

<p>by Olga A. Nev, Richard J. Lindsay, Alys Jepson, Lisa Butt, Robert E. Beardmore, Ivana Gudelj</p>

Developing mathematical models to accurately predict microbial growth dynamics remains a key challenge in ecology, evolution, biotechnology, and public health. To reproduce and grow, microbes need to take up essential nutrients from the environment, and mathematical models classically assume that the nutrient uptake rate is a saturating function of the nutrient concentration. In nature, microbes experience different levels of nutrient availability at all environmental scales, yet parameters shaping the nutrient uptake function are commonly estimated for a single initial nutrient concentration. This hampers the models from accurately capturing microbial dynamics when the environmental conditions change. To address this problem, we conduct growth experiments for a range of micro-organisms, including human fungal pathogens, baker’s yeast, and common coliform bacteria, and uncover the following patterns. We observed that the maximal nutrient uptake rate and biomass yield were both decreasing functions of initial nutrient concentration. While a functional form for the relationship between biomass yield and initial nutrient concentration has been previously derived from first metabolic principles, here we also derive the form of the relationship between maximal nutrient uptake rate and initial nutrient concentration. Incorporating these two functions into a model of microbial growth allows for variable growth parameters and enables us to substantially improve predictions for microbial dynamics in a range of initial nutrient concentrations, compared to keeping growth parameters fixed.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vGlKY91L79U" width="1" />

<p>by Sara Stoudt, Váleri N. Vásquez, Ciera C. Martinez</p>

A systematic and reproducible “workflow”—the process that moves a scientific investigation from raw data to coherent research question to insightful contribution—should be a fundamental part of academic data-intensive research practice. In this paper, we elaborate basic principles of a reproducible data analysis workflow by defining 3 phases: the Explore, Refine, and Produce Phases. Each phase is roughly centered around the audience to whom research decisions, methodologies, and results are being immediately communicated. Importantly, each phase can also give rise to a number of research products beyond traditional academic publications. Where relevant, we draw analogies between design principles and established practice in software development. The guidance provided here is not intended to be a strict rulebook; rather, the suggestions for practices and tools to advance reproducible, sound data-intensive analysis may furnish support for both students new to research and current researchers who are new to data-intensive work.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oLH_lynFcp4" width="1" />

Extensive amounts of multi-omics data and multiple cancer subtyping methods have been developed rapidly, and generate discrepant clustering results, which poses challenges for cancer molecular subtype research. Thus, the development of methods for the identification of cancer consensus molecular subtypes is essential. The lack of intuitive and easy-to-use analytical tools has posed a barrier. Here, we report on the development of the COnsensus Molecular SUbtype of Cancer (COMSUC) web server. With COMSUC, users can explore consensus molecular subtypes of more than 30 cancers based on eight clustering methods, five types of omics data from public reference datasets or users’ private data, and three consensus clustering methods. The web server provides interactive and modifiable visualization, and publishable output of analysis results. Researchers can also exchange consensus subtype results with collaborators via project IDs. COMSUC is now publicly and freely available with no login requirement at http://comsuc.bioinforai.tech/ (IP address: http://59.110.25.27/).

<p>by Francesco Di Lauro, István Z. Kiss, Joel C. Miller</p>

The interventions and outcomes in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are highly varied. The disease and the interventions both impose costs and harm on society. Some interventions with particularly high costs may only be implemented briefly. The design of optimal policy requires consideration of many intervention scenarios. In this paper we investigate the optimal timing of interventions that are not sustainable for a long period. Specifically, we look at at the impact of a single short-term non-repeated intervention (a “one-shot intervention”) on an epidemic and consider the impact of the intervention’s timing. To minimize the total number infected, the intervention should start close to the peak so that there is minimal rebound once the intervention is stopped. To minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, leading to initial reduction and then having a rebound to the same prevalence as the pre-intervention peak rather than one very large peak. To delay infections as much as possible (as might be appropriate if we expect improved interventions or treatments to be developed), earlier interventions have clear benefit. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each subcommunity separately.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3XSe9-HIZSg" width="1" />

<p>by Christina R. Hall, Philippa C. Griffin, Andrew J. Lonie, Jeffrey H. Christiansen</p>

Many initiatives have addressed the global need to upskill biologists in bioinformatics tools and techniques. Australia is not unique in its requirement for such training, but due to its large size and relatively small and geographically dispersed population, Australia faces specific challenges. A combined training approach was implemented by the authors to overcome these challenges. The “hybrid” method combines guidance from experienced trainers with the benefits of both webinar-style delivery and concurrent face-to-face hands-on practical exercises in classrooms. Since 2017, the hybrid method has been used to conduct 9 hands-on bioinformatics training sessions at international scale in which over 800 researchers have been trained in diverse topics on a range of software platforms. The method has become a key tool to ensure scalable and more equitable delivery of short-course bioinformatics training across Australia and can be easily adapted to other locations, topics, or settings.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JTKfdcHOEms" width="1" />

<p>by Brandon Lieberthal, Allison M. Gardner</p>

Disease epidemic outbreaks on human metapopulation networks are often driven by a small number of superspreader nodes, which are primarily responsible for spreading the disease throughout the network. Superspreader nodes typically are characterized either by their locations within the network, by their degree of connectivity and centrality, or by their habitat suitability for the disease, described by their reproduction number (<i>R</i>). Here we introduce a model that considers simultaneously the effects of network properties and <i>R</i> on superspreaders, as opposed to previous research which considered each factor separately. This type of model is applicable to diseases for which habitat suitability varies by climate or land cover, and for direct transmitted diseases for which population density and mitigation practices influences <i>R</i>. We present analytical models that quantify the superspreader capacity of a population node by two measures: probability-dependent superspreader capacity, the expected number of neighboring nodes to which the node in consideration will randomly spread the disease per epidemic generation, and time-dependent superspreader capacity, the rate at which the node spreads the disease to each of its neighbors. We validate our analytical models with a Monte Carlo analysis of repeated stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) simulations on randomly generated human population networks, and we use a random forest statistical model to relate superspreader risk to connectivity, <i>R</i>, centrality, clustering, and diffusion. We demonstrate that either degree of connectivity or <i>R</i> above a certain threshold are sufficient conditions for a node to have a moderate superspreader risk factor, but both are necessary for a node to have a high-risk factor. The statistical model presented in this article can be used to predict the location of superspreader events in future epidemics, and to predict the effectiveness of mitigation strategies that seek to reduce the value of <i>R</i>, alter host movements, or both.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rNQctTQRavE" width="1" />

<p>by Yangxiaolu Cao, John Neu, Andrew E. Blanchard, Ting Lu, Lingchong You</p>

Spatial expansion of a population of cells can arise from growth of microorganisms, plant cells, and mammalian cells. It underlies normal or dysfunctional tissue development, and it can be exploited as the foundation for programming spatial patterns. This expansion is often driven by continuous growth and division of cells within a colony, which in turn pushes the peripheral cells outward. This process generates a repulsion velocity field at each location within the colony. Here we show that this process can be approximated as coarse-grained repulsive-expansion kinetics. This framework enables accurate and efficient simulation of growth and gene expression dynamics in radially symmetric colonies with homogenous z-directional distribution. It is robust even if cells are not spherical and vary in size. The simplicity of the resulting mathematical framework also greatly facilitates generation of mechanistic insights.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S1mxnnhNbIg" width="1" />

<p>Western tonality provides a hierarchy of stability among melodic
scale-degrees, from the maximally stable tonic to unstable chromatic notes.
Tonal stability has been linked to emotion, yet systematic investigations of
the associations between the hierarchy of melodic scale-degrees and perceived
emotional valence are lacking. Here, we examined such associations in three
experiments, in musicians and in non-musicians. We used an explicit task, in
which participants matched probe tones following key-establishing sequences to
facial expressions ranging from sad to happy, and an implicit speeded task, a
variant of the Implicit Association Test. Stabler scale-degrees were associated
with more positive valence in all experiments, for both musicians and
nonmusicians. This notwithstanding, results significantly differed from those
of a comparable goodness-of-fit task, suggesting that perceived tonal valence
is not reducible to tonal fit. Comparisons of the explicit and implicit
measures suggest that associations of tonality and emotional valence may rely
on two distinct mechanisms, one mediated by conceptual musical knowledge and
conscious decisional processes, the other - largely by non-conceptual and
involuntary processes. The joint experimental paradigms introduced here may
help mapping additional connotative meanings, both emotional and cross-modal,
embedded in tonal structure, thus suggesting how extra-musical meanings are
conveyed to listeners through musical syntax.

<p>This communication describes a preliminary research on detection of big
masses of plastic (marine litter) on the oceans and seas using EO (Earth
Observation) satellite systems. Free images from the Sentinel 2 (Copernicus
Project) platform are used. To develop a plastic recognizer, we start with an
image where we can find a big accumulation of "nonfloating" plastic: Almer\'ia
greenhouses. We made a test using remote sensing differential indexes, but we
got much better results using all available wavelengths (thirteen frequency
bands) and applying Neural Networks to that feature vector.

<p>Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are usually designed specifically for
each subject based on motor imagery. Therefore, the usability of these networks
has become a significant challenge. The network has to be designed separately
for each user, which is time-consuming for the user. Therefore, this study
proposes a method by which the calibration time is significantly reduced while
the classification accuracy is increased. In this method, we calibrated the
features extracted from the motor imagery task by dividing the features
extracted from the resting-state into both open-eye and closed-eye modes and
the state in which the subject moves his eyes. The best classification accuracy
was obtained using the SVM classifier using the resting-state signal in the
open eye, which increased by 3.64% to 74.04%. In this paper, we also
investigated the effect of recording time of the resting-state signal and the
impact of eye state on the classification accuracy.

<p>We simulated our nanomagnet reservoir computer (NMRC) design on benchmark
tasks, demonstrating NMRC's high memory content and expressibility. In support
of the feasibility of this method, we fabricated a frustrated nanomagnet
reservoir layer. Using this structure, we describe a low-power, low-area system
with an area-energy-delay product $10^7$ lower than conventional RC systems,
that is therefore promising for size, weight, and power (SWaP) constrained

<p>We define a notion of complexity, which quantifies the nonlinearity of the
computation of a neural network, as well as a complementary measure of the
effective dimension of feature representations. We investigate these
observables both for trained networks for various datasets as well as explore
their dynamics during training, uncovering in particular power law scaling.
These observables can be understood in a dual way as uncovering hidden internal
structure of the datasets themselves as a function of scale or depth. The
entropic character of the proposed notion of complexity should allow to
transfer modes of analysis from neuroscience and statistical physics to the
domain of artificial neural networks. The introduced observables can be applied
without any change to the analysis of biological neuronal systems.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.592235">Greater Reduction in Contralesional Hand Use After Frontoparietal Than Frontal Motor Cortex Lesions in Macaca mulatta</a></h4>

<p>We previously reported that rhesus monkeys recover spontaneous use of the more impaired (contralesional) hand following neurosurgical lesions to the arm/hand representations of primary motor cortex (M1) and lateral premotor cortex (LPMC) (F2 lesion) when tested for reduced use (RU) in a fine motor task allowing use of either hand. Recovery occurred without constraint of the less impaired hand and with occasional forced use of the more impaired hand, which was the preferred hand for use in fine motor tasks before the lesion. Here, we compared recovery of five F2 lesion cases in the same RU test to recovery after unilateral lesions of M1, LPMC, S1 and anterior portion of parietal cortex (F2P2 lesion – four cases). Average and highest %use of the contralesional hand in the RU task in F2 cases were twice that in F2P2 cases (p &lt; 0.05). Recovery in the RU task was closely associated with volume and percentage of lesion to caudal (new) M1 (M1c) in both F2 and F2P2 lesion cases. One F2P2 case, with the largest M1c lesion and a large rostral somatosensory cortex (S1r) lesion developed severe contralesional hand non-use despite exhibiting some recovery of fine motor function initially. We conclude that the degree of reduced use of the contralesional hand is primarily related to the volume of M1c injury and that severe non-use requires extensive injury to M1c and S1r. Thus, assessing peri-Rolandic injury extent in stroke patients may have prognostic value for predicting susceptibility to RU and non-use in rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Dysfunction at synapses is thought to be an early change contributing to cognitive, psychiatric and motor disturbances in Huntington’s disease (HD). In neurons, mutant Huntingtin collects in aggregates and distributes to the same sites as wild-type Huntingtin including on membranes and in synapses. In this study, we investigated the biochemical integrity of synapses in HD mouse striatum. We performed subcellular fractionation of striatal tissue from 2 and 6-month old knock-in Q175/Q7 HD and Q7/Q7 mice. Compared to striata of Q7/Q7 mice, proteins including GLUT3, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase, NMDAR 2b, PSD95, and VGLUT1 had altered distribution in Q175/Q7 HD striata of 6-month old mice but not 2-month old mice. These proteins are found on plasma membranes and pre- and postsynaptic membranes supporting hypotheses that functional changes at synapses contribute to cognitive and behavioral symptoms of HD. Lipidomic analysis of mouse fractions indicated that compared to those of wild-type, fractions 1 and 2 of 6 months Q175/Q7 HD had altered levels of two species of PIP2, a phospholipid involved in synaptic signaling, increased levels of cholesterol ester and decreased cardiolipin species. At 2 months, increased levels of species of acylcarnitine, phosphatidic acid and sphingomyelin were measured. EM analysis showed that the contents of fractions 1 and 2 of Q7/Q7 and Q175/Q7 HD striata had a mix of isolated synaptic vesicles, vesicle filled axon terminals singly or in clusters, and ER and endosome-like membranes. However, those of Q175/Q7 striata contained significantly fewer and larger clumps of particles compared to those of Q7/Q7. Human HD postmortem putamen showed differences from control putamen in subcellular distribution of two proteins (Calnexin and GLUT3). Our biochemical, lipidomic and EM analysis show that the presence of the HD mutation conferred age dependent disruption of localization of synaptic proteins and lipids important for synaptic function. Our data demonstrate concrete biochemical changes suggesting altered integrity of synaptic compartments in HD mice that may mirror changes in HD patients and presage cognitive and psychiatric changes that occur in premanifest HD.</p>

<p>Based on early evidence of in vitro neurotoxicity following exposure to serum derived from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), several studies have attempted to explore whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from people with ALS could possess similar properties. Although initial findings proved inconclusive, it is now increasingly recognized that ALS-CSF may exert toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying CSF-induced neurodegeneration remains unclear. This review aims to summarize the 40-year long history of CSF toxicity studies in ALS, while discussing the various mechanisms that have been proposed, including glutamate excitotoxicity, proteotoxicity and oxidative stress. Furthermore, we consider the potential implications of a toxic CSF circulatory system in the pathophysiology of ALS, and also assess its significance in the context of current ALS research.</p>

<p>Core spliceosome and related RNA-binding proteins aggregate in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain even in early asymptomatic stages (AsymAD) of disease. To assess the specificity of RNA-binding protein aggregation in AD, we developed a targeted mass spectrometry approach to quantify broad classes of RNA-binding proteins with other pathological proteins including tau and amyloid beta (Aβ) in detergent insoluble fractions from control, AsymAD, AD and Parkinson’s disease (PD) brain. Relative levels of specific insoluble RNA-binding proteins across different disease groups correlated with accumulation of Aβ and tau aggregates. RNA-binding proteins, including splicing factors with homology to the basic-acidic dipeptide repeats of U1-70K, preferentially aggregated in AsymAD and AD. In contrast, PD brain aggregates were relatively depleted of many RNA-binding proteins compared to AsymAD and AD groups. Correlation network analyses resolved 29 distinct modules of co-aggregating proteins including modules linked to spliceosome assembly, nuclear speckles and RNA splicing. Modules related to spliceosome assembly and nuclear speckles showed stage-specific enrichment of insoluble RBPs from AsymAD and AD brains, whereas the RNA splicing module was reduced specifically in PD. Collectively, this work identifies classes of RNA-binding proteins that distinctly co-aggregate in detergent-insoluble fractions across the specific neurodegenerative diseases we examined.</p>

<p>A majority of blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients experience persistent neurological dysfunction with no findings on conventional structural MR imaging. It is urgent to develop advanced imaging modalities to detect and understand the pathophysiology of blast-induced mTBI. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET) could detect neuronal function and activity of the injured brain, while MR spectroscopy provides complementary information and assesses metabolic irregularities following injury. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of combining <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET with MR spectroscopy to evaluate acute and subacute metabolic cerebral alterations caused by blast-induced mTBI. Thirty-two adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were exposed to a single blast (mTBI group) and 32 rats were not exposed to the blast (sham group), followed by <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET, MRI, and histological evaluation at baseline, 1–3 h, 1 day, and 7 days post-injury in three separate cohorts. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake showed a transient increase in the amygdala and somatosensory cortex, followed by a gradual return to baseline from day 1 to 7 days post-injury and a continuous rise in the motor cortex. In contrast, decreased <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake was seen in the midbrain structures (inferior and superior colliculus). Analysis of MR spectroscopy showed that inflammation marker myo-inositol (Ins), oxidative stress marker glutamine + glutamate (Glx), and hypoxia marker lactate (Lac) levels markedly elevated over time in the somatosensory cortex, while the major osmolyte taurine (Tau) level immediately increased at 1–3 h and 1 day, and then returned to sham level on 7 days post-injury, which could be due to the disruption of the blood–brain barrier. Increased <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake and elevated Ins and Glx levels over time were confirmed by histology analysis which showed increased microglial activation and gliosis in the frontal cortex. These results suggest that <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET and MR spectroscopy can be used together to reflect more comprehensive neuropathological alterations in vivo, which could improve our understanding of the complex alterations in the brain after blast-induced mTBI.</p>

<p>While often presented as promising assistive technologies for motor-impaired users, electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) remain barely used outside laboratories due to low reliability in real-life conditions. There is thus a need to design long-term reliable BCIs that can be used outside-of-the-lab by end-users, e.g., severely motor-impaired ones. Therefore, we propose and evaluate the design of a multi-class Mental Task (MT)-based BCI for longitudinal training (20 sessions over 3 months) of a tetraplegic user for the CYBATHLON BCI series 2019. In this BCI championship, tetraplegic pilots are mentally driving a virtual car in a racing video game. We aimed at combining a progressive user MT-BCI training with a newly designed machine learning pipeline based on adaptive Riemannian classifiers shown to be promising for real-life applications. We followed a two step training process: the first 11 sessions served to train the user to control a 2-class MT-BCI by performing either two cognitive tasks (REST and MENTAL SUBTRACTION) or two motor-imagery tasks (LEFT-HAND and RIGHT-HAND). The second training step (9 remaining sessions) applied an adaptive, session-independent Riemannian classifier that combined all 4 MT classes used before. Moreover, as our Riemannian classifier was incrementally updated in an unsupervised way it would capture both within and between-session non-stationarity. Experimental evidences confirm the effectiveness of this approach. Namely, the classification accuracy improved by about 30% at the end of the training compared to initial sessions. We also studied the neural correlates of this performance improvement. Using a newly proposed BCI user learning metric, we could show our user learned to improve his BCI control by producing EEG signals matching increasingly more the BCI classifier training data distribution, rather than by improving his EEG class discrimination. However, the resulting improvement was effective only on synchronous (cue-based) BCI and it did not translate into improved CYBATHLON BCI game performances. For the sake of overcoming this in the future, we unveil possible reasons for these limited gaming performances and identify a number of promising future research directions. Importantly, we also report on the evolution of the user's neurophysiological patterns and user experience throughout the BCI training and competition.</p>

<p>Due to the individual differences controlling brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), the applicability and accuracy of BCIs based on motor imagery (MI-BCIs) are limited. To improve the performance of BCIs, this article examined the effect of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) on brain activity during MI. This article designed an experimental paradigm that combines tES and MI and examined the effects of tES based on the measurements of electroencephalogram (EEG) features in MI processing, including the power spectral density (PSD) and dynamic event-related desynchronization (ERD). Finally, we investigated the effect of tES on the accuracy of MI classification using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The results showed that the ERD of the μ and β rhythms in the left-hand MI task was enhanced after electrical stimulation with a significant effect in the tDCS group. The average classification accuracy of the transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) group and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) group (88.19% and 89.93% respectively) were improved significantly compared to the pre-and pseudo stimulation groups. These findings indicated that tES can improve the performance and applicability of BCI and that tDCS was a potential approach in regulating brain activity and enhancing valid features during noninvasive MI-BCI processing.</p>

<p>Psychedelics have been recognized as model interventions for studying altered states of consciousness. However, few empirical studies of the shamanic state of consciousness, which is anecdotally similar to the psychedelic state, exist. We investigated the neural correlates of shamanic trance using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in 24 shamanic practitioners and 24 healthy controls during rest, shamanic drumming, and classical music listening, followed by an assessment of altered states of consciousness. EEG data were used to assess changes in absolute power, connectivity, signal diversity, and criticality, which were correlated with assessment measures. We also compared assessment scores to those of individuals in a previous study under the influence of psychedelics. Shamanic practitioners were significantly different from controls in several domains of altered states of consciousness, with scores comparable to or exceeding that of healthy volunteers under the influence of psychedelics. Practitioners also displayed increased gamma power during drumming that positively correlated with elementary visual alterations. Furthermore, shamanic practitioners had decreased low alpha and increased low beta connectivity during drumming and classical music and decreased neural signal diversity in the gamma band during drumming that inversely correlated with insightfulness. Finally, criticality in practitioners was increased during drumming in the low and high beta and gamma bands, with increases in the low beta band correlating with complex imagery and elementary visual alterations. These findings suggest that psychedelic drug-induced and non-pharmacologic alterations in consciousness have overlapping phenomenal traits but are distinct states of consciousness, as reflected by the unique brain-related changes during shamanic trance compared to previous literature investigating the psychedelic state.</p>

<p>Purpose: Studies of reactive and proactive modes of inhibitory control tend to show age-related declines and are accompanied by abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex. We explored which mode of inhibitory control would be more amenable to change and accrue greater benefits following engagement in a 4-week theater acting intervention in older adults. These gains were evaluated by performance on the AX-CPT task. We hypothesized that an increase in proactive control would relate to an increase in AY errors and a decrease in BX errors. In contrast, an increase in reactive control would be associated with a decrease in AY errors, no change in AY reaction time, and an increase in BX response time. Further, we posited that an increase in behavioral proactive control would accompany greater cue versus probe activity for previously identified regions in the prefrontal cortex. In contrast, an increase in behavioral reactive control would be accompanied by greater probe activation in these identified brain areas.</p><p>Materials and Methods: The participants were 179 community-dwelling adults aged 60–89 years who were on average, college-educated. Participants were pseudo-randomly assigned to either an active-experiencing acting intervention condition (n = 93) or the active control condition (n = 86); participant assignment was subject to time of enrollment. Participants in both groups were trained by theater-actor researchers with expertise in acting interventions. In contrast to the active control participants who attended a course on theater acting, the acting-intervention group was required to consistently deploy proactive and reactive control mechanisms. Both groups met two times/week for 75-min for 4 weeks. Participant brain-behavioral performance on the AX-CPT task was evaluated prior to and after this four-week period.</p><p>Results: No intervention effects were found in favor of proactive control. Behavioral evidence in favor of reactive control was weak. Brain-related benefits to reactive control was illustrated by greater probe-activation in Brodmann areas 6 and 8, relative to controls and pre-intervention.</p><p>Conclusion: We found some evidence for improvements in reactive control via brain measures, attributed to engagement in the acting intervention.</p>

<p>Background: Schizophrenia affects around 1% of the global population. Functional connectivity extracted from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has previously been used to study schizophrenia and has great potential to provide novel insights into the disorder. Some studies have shown abnormal functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) of individuals with schizophrenia, and more recent studies have shown abnormal dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) in individuals with schizophrenia. However, DMN dFC and the link between abnormal DMN dFC and symptom severity have not been well-characterized.</p><p>Method: Resting-state fMRI data from subjects with schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy controls (HC) across two datasets were analyzed independently. We captured seven maximally independent subnodes in the DMN by applying group independent component analysis and estimated dFC between subnode time courses using a sliding window approach. A clustering method separated the dFCs into five reoccurring brain states. A feature selection method modeled the difference between SZs and HCs using the state-specific FC features. Finally, we used the transition probability of a hidden Markov model to characterize the link between symptom severity and dFC in SZ subjects.</p><p>Results: We found decreases in the connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and increases in the connectivity between the precuneus (PCu) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (i.e., PCu/PCC) of SZ subjects. In SZ, the transition probability from a state with weaker PCu/PCC and stronger ACC connectivity to a state with stronger PCu/PCC and weaker ACC connectivity increased with symptom severity.</p><p>Conclusions: To our knowledge, this was the first study to investigate DMN dFC and its link to schizophrenia symptom severity. We identified reproducible neural states in a data-driven manner and demonstrated that the strength of connectivity within those states differed between SZs and HCs. Additionally, we identified a relationship between SZ symptom severity and the dynamics of DMN functional connectivity. We validated our results across two datasets. These results support the potential of dFC for use as a biomarker of schizophrenia and shed new light upon the relationship between schizophrenia and DMN dynamics.</p>

<p>Objective: We aimed to examine the effects of repetitive peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation (rPNMS) on the excitability of the contralateral motor cortex and motor function of the upper limb in healthy subjects.</p><p>Methods: Forty-six healthy subjects were randomly assigned to either a repetitive peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation group (n = 23) or a sham group (n = 23). The repetitive peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation group received stimulation using magnetic pulses at 20 Hz, which were applied on the median nerve of the non-dominant hand, whereas the sham group underwent the same protocol without the stimulation output. The primary outcome was contralateral transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced corticomotor excitability for the abductor pollicis brevis of the stimulated hand in terms of resting motor threshold (rMT), the slope of recruitment curve, and peak amplitude of motor evoked potential (MEP), which were measured at baseline and immediately after each session. The secondary outcomes were motor hand function including dexterity and grip strength of the non-dominant hand assessed at baseline, immediately after stimulation, and 24 h post-stimulation.</p><p>Results: Compared with the sham stimulation, repetitive peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation increased the peak motor evoked potential amplitude immediately after the intervention. The repetitive peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation also increased the slope of the recruitment curve immediately after intervention and enhanced hand dexterity after 24 h. However, the between-group difference for the changes was not significant. The significant changes in hand dexterity and peak amplitude of motor evoked potential after repetitive peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation were associated with their baseline value.</p><p>Conclusions: Repetitive peripheral nerve magnetic stimulation may modulate the corticomotor excitability together with a possible lasting improvement in hand dexterity, indicating that it might be helpful for clinical rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Primary dissociated neuronal cultures have become a standard model for studying central nervous system (CNS) development. Such cultures are predominantly prepared from the hippocampus or cortex of rodents (mice and rats), while other mammals are less used. Here, we describe the establishment and extensive characterization of the primary dissociated neuronal cultures derived from the cortex of the gray South American short-tailed opossums, Monodelphis domestica. Opossums are unique in their ability to fully regenerate their CNS after an injury during their early postnatal development. Thus, we used cortex of postnatal day (P) 3–5 opossum to establish long-surviving and nearly pure neuronal cultures, as well as mixed cultures composed of radial glia cells (RGCs) in which their neurogenic and gliogenic potential was confirmed. Both types of cultures can survive for more than 1 month in vitro. We also prepared neuronal cultures from the P16–18 opossum cortex, which were composed of astrocytes and microglia, in addition to neurons. The long-surviving opossum primary dissociated neuronal cultures represent a novel mammalian in vitro platform particularly useful to study CNS development and regeneration.</p>

<p>Human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived organoids have become increasingly used systems allowing 3D-modeling of human organ development, and disease. They are also a reliable source of cells for transplantation in cell therapy and an excellent model to validate gene therapies. To make full use of these systems, a toolkit of genetic modification techniques is necessary to control their activity in line with the downstream application. We have previously described adeno-associated viruse (AAV) vectors for efficient targeting of cells within human retinal organoids. Here, we describe biological restriction and enhanced gene expression in cone cells of such organoids thanks to the use of a 1.7-kb L-opsin promoter. We illustrate the usefulness of implementing such a promoter to enhance the expression of the red-shifted opsin Jaws in fusion with a fluorescent reporter gene, enabling cell sorting to enrich the desired cell population. Increased Jaws expression after transplantation improved light responses promising better therapeutic outcomes in a cell therapy setting. Our results point to the importance of promoter activity in restricting, improving, and controlling the kinetics of transgene expression during the maturation of hiPSC retinal derivatives. Differentiation requires mechanisms to initiate specific transcriptional changes and to reinforce those changes when mature cell states are reached. By employing a cell-type-specific promoter we put transgene expression under the new transcriptional program of mature cells.</p>

<p>Ischemic stroke has been reported to cause significant changes to memory, thinking, and behavior. Intriguingly, recently reported studies have indicated the association of Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) with the acute phase of ischemic stroke. However, the comprehensive underlying mechanism remained unknown. The objective of the present study was to investigate the association between TMAO and recovery of neurological function after ischemic stroke. For this purpose, a middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) rat model was established and treated with TMAO or/and sh-ALK5, followed by the neurological function evaluation. Behaviors of rats were observed through staircase and cylinder tests. Moreover, the expression of Smurf2 and ALK5 was detected by immunohistochemistry while expression of GFAP, Neurocan, and Phosphacan in brain tissues was determined by immunofluorescence. Thereafter, gain- and loss-of-function assays in astrocytes, the proliferation, viability, and migration were evaluated by the EdU, CCK-8, and Transwell assays. Besides, Smurf2 mRNA expression was determined by the RT-qPCR, whereas, Smurf2, ALK5, GFAP, Neurocan, and Phosphacan expression was evaluated by the Western blotting. Finally, the interaction of Smurf2 with ALK5 and ALK5 ubiquitination was assessed by the co-immunoprecipitation. Notably, our results showed that TMAO promoted the proliferation of reactive astrocyte and formation of glial scar in MCAO/R rats. However, this effect was abolished by the Smurf2 overexpression or ALK5 silencing. We further found that TMAO upregulated the ALK5 expression by inhibiting the ubiquitination role of Smurf2. Overexpression of ALK5 reversed the inhibitory effect of Smurf2 on astrocyte proliferation, migration, and viability. Collectively, our work identifies the evolutionarily TMAO/Smurf2/ALK5 signaling as a major genetic factor in the control of reactive astrocyte proliferation and glial scar formation in ischemic stroke, thus laying a theoretical foundation for the identification of ischemic stroke.</p>

<p>Telencephalic cognitive and emotional circuits/functions are strongly modulated by subcortical inputs. The main focus of past research on the nature of this modulation has been on the widespread monoamine projections to the telencephalon. However, the nucleus incertus (NI) of the pontine tegmentum provides a strong GABAergic and peptidergic innervation of the hippocampus, basal forebrain, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and related regions; and represents a parallel source of ascending modulation of cognitive and emotional domains. NI GABAergic neurons express multiple peptides, including neuromedin-B, cholecystokinin, and relaxin-3, and receptors for stress and arousal transmitters, including corticotrophin-releasing factor and orexins/hypocretins. A functional relationship exists between NI neurons and their associated peptides, relaxin-3 and neuromedin-B, and hippocampal theta rhythm, which in turn, has a key role in the acquisition and extinction of declarative and emotional memories. Furthermore, RXFP3, the cognate receptor for relaxin-3, is a G<sub>i/o</sub> protein-coupled receptor, and its activation inhibits the cellular accumulation of cAMP and induces phosphorylation of ERK, processes associated with memory formation in the hippocampus and amygdala. Therefore, this review summarizes the role of NI transmitter systems in relaying stress- and arousal-related signals to the higher neural circuits and processes associated with memory formation and retrieval.</p>

<p>Background: Brain iron deposition, low hemoglobin (HGB), and increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) have been implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the association among them in PD is poorly studied.</p><p>Objective: To explore the association of the level of HO-1 with brain iron deposition and low level of HGB in PD.</p><p>Methods: A total of 32 patients with PD and 26 controls were recruited for this study. C57BL/6 male mice were used in generating 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced chronic PD model. The Levels of serum HO-1 and HGB of human subjects and mice were assayed by ELISA, blood routine test, respectively. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) was used to quantitatively analyze brain iron deposition in human subjects and mice. HO-1 inhibitor (Sn-protoporphyrin, SnPP) was used to suppress the function and expression of HO-1 in PD mice. Correlations between the concentration of serum HO-1 and iron deposition of the region of interests (ROIs), levels of HGB, between the three factors mentioned above, and scores of clinical scales were explored in PD patients.</p><p>Results: This study revealed significant elevation of the serum HO-1 concentration, iron deposition within bilateral substantial nigra (SN), red nucleus (RN), and putamen (PUT) and decrease of HGB level in PD patients. There was a significantly positive correlation between the serum HO-1 concentration and iron deposition within SN, an inverse correlation between the serum HO-1 concentration and HGB level in PD patients. A significant increase in HO-1 expression of serum and iron deposition in SN was also observed in the PD mouse model, and the SnPP could significantly reduce iron deposition in the SN.</p><p>Conclusions: The high level of HO-1 may be the common mechanism of iron deposition and low HGB in PD. Therefore, the findings presented in this study indicate that HO-1 correlates with brain iron deposition and anemia in PD.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease, affecting a significant part of the population. The majority of AD cases occur in the elderly with a typical age of onset of the disease above 65 years. AD presents a major burden for the healthcare system and since population is rapidly aging, the burden of the disease will increase in the future. However, no effective drug treatment for a full-blown disease has been developed to date. The genetic background of AD is extensively studied; numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified significant genes associated with increased risk of AD development. This review summarizes more than 100 risk loci. Many of them may serve as biomarkers of AD progression, even in the preclinical stage of the disease. Furthermore, we used GWAS data to identify key pathways of AD pathogenesis: cellular processes, metabolic processes, biological regulation, localization, transport, regulation of cellular processes, and neurological system processes. Gene clustering into molecular pathways can provide background for identification of novel molecular targets and may support the development of tailored and personalized treatment of AD.</p>

<p>Background: White matter hyperintensities (WMH)s is a very common neuroradiological manifestation in the elderly and is an increased risk of dementia and cognitive decline. As we all know, the thalamocortical circuit plays an important part in cognition regulation. However, the role of this circuit in WMHs and its related cognitive deficits is still unclear.</p><p>Method: Eighty WMH patients and 37 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in the current study. WMH patients were divided into a mild WMH group (n = 33) and moderate-severe WMH group (n = 47) according to Fazekas scores. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data of all participants were collected for thalamocortical functional connectivity (FC) analysis. The analysis was performed in two steps. First, the whole cerebral cortex was divided into six regions of interest (ROIs), which were used as seeds to investigate the changes of FC with the thalamus. Then, the subregion of the thalamus generated in the previous step was used as the seed for FC analysis with the whole brain.</p><p>Results: In the first step of FC analysis, it was found that precentral gyrus (PrCG)-interthalamic adhesion (ITA) FC values in moderate-severe WMH group were higher than those in HC and mild WMH groups. However, when compared with the HC group, the increase of PrCG-ITA FC values in mild WMH group was not statistically significant. In the second step of FC analysis, the ITA was set as the seed, and compared with the HC group, the results showed that the FC values of the ITA-medial frontal gyrus (MFG) in mild group and moderate-severe WMH groups were significantly increased. In addition, the FC values in moderate-severe group were significantly higher than those in mild group. Finally, it was also found that FC values (PrCG-ITA and ITA-MFG) were significantly correlated with neuropsychological test results for multiple cognitive functions such as memory, execution and attention in WMH patients.</p><p>Conclusion: Abnormal thalamocortical FC was closely related with cognitive impairments in WMH patients.</p>

Cell division site positioning is precisely regulated but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. In the social bacterium <i>Myxococcus xanthus,</i> the ~15 MDa tripartite PomX/Y/Z complex associates with and translocates across the nucleoid in a PomZ ATPase-dependent manner to directly position and stimulate formation of the cytokinetic FtsZ-ring at midcell, and then undergoes fission during division. Here, we demonstrate that PomX consists of two functionally distinct domains and has three functions. The N-terminal domain stimulates ATPase activity of the ParA/MinD ATPase PomZ. The C-terminal domain interacts with PomY and forms polymers, which serve as a scaffold for PomX/Y/Z complex formation. Moreover, the PomX/PomZ interaction is important for fission of the PomX/Y/Z complex. These observations together with previous work support that the architecturally diverse ATPase activating proteins of ParA/MinD ATPases are highly modular and use the same mechanism to activate their cognate ATPase via a short positively charged N-terminal extension.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65857">Whole-organism eQTL mapping at cellular resolution with single-cell sequencing</a></h4>

Genetic regulation of gene expression underlies variation in disease risk and other complex traits. The effect of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) varies across cell types; however, the complexity of mammalian tissues makes studying cell-type eQTLs highly challenging. We developed a novel approach in the model nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> that uses single cell RNA sequencing to map eQTLs at cellular resolution in a single one-pot experiment. We mapped eQTLs across cell types in an extremely large population of genetically distinct <i>C. elegans </i>individuals. We found cell-type-specific <i>trans</i>-eQTL hotspots that affect the expression of core pathways in the relevant cell types. Finally, we found single-cell-specific eQTL effects in the nervous system, including an eQTL with opposite effects in two individual neurons. Our results show that eQTL effects can be specific down to the level of single cells.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64561">Meta-Research: Weak evidence of country- and institution-related status bias in the peer review of abstracts</a></h4>

Research suggests that scientists based at prestigious institutions receive more credit for their work than scientists based at less prestigious institutions, as do scientists working in certain countries. We examined the extent to which country- and institution-related status signals drive such differences in scientific recognition. In a preregistered survey experiment, we asked 4,147 scientists from six disciplines (astronomy, cardiology materials science, political science, psychology and public health) to rate abstracts that varied on two factors: i) author country (high status vs lower status in science); ii) author institution (high status vs lower status university). We found only weak evidence of country- or institution-related status bias, and mixed regression models with discipline as random-effect parameter indicated that any plausible bias not detected by our study must be small in size.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63751">Learning precise spatiotemporal sequences via biophysically realistic learning rules in a modular, spiking network</a></h4>

Multiple brain regions are able to learn and express temporal sequences, and this functionality is an essential component of learning and memory. We propose a substrate for such representations via a network model that learns and recalls discrete sequences of variable order and duration. The model consists of a network of spiking neurons placed in a modular microcolumn based architecture. Learning is performed via a biophysically realistic learning rule that depends on synaptic ‘eligibility traces’. Before training, the network contains no memory of any particular sequence. After training, presentation of only the first element in that sequence is sufficient for the network to recall an entire learned representation of the sequence. An extended version of the model also demonstrates the ability to successfully learn and recall non-Markovian sequences. This model provides a possible framework for biologically plausible sequence learning and memory, in agreement with recent experimental results.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61230">A nuclear-based quality control pathway for non-imported mitochondrial proteins</a></h4>

Mitochondrial import deficiency causes cellular toxicity due to the accumulation of non-imported mitochondrial precursor proteins, termed mitoprotein-induced stress. Despite the burden mis-localized mitochondrial precursors place on cells, our understanding of the systems that dispose of these proteins is incomplete. Here, we cataloged the location and steady-state abundance of mitochondrial precursor proteins during mitochondrial impairment in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. We found that a number of non-imported mitochondrial proteins localize to the nucleus, where they are subjected to proteasome-dependent degradation through a process we term nuclear-associated mitoprotein degradation (mitoNUC). Recognition and destruction of mitochondrial precursors by the mitoNUC pathway requires the presence of an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) and is mediated by combined action of the E3 ubiquitin ligases San1, Ubr1, and Doa10. Impaired breakdown of precursors leads to alternative sequestration in nuclear-associated foci. These results identify the nucleus as an important destination for the disposal of non-imported mitochondrial precursors.

Precise and reliable spike times are thought to subserve multiple possible functions, including improving the accuracy of encoding stimuli or behaviours relative to other coding schemes. Indeed, repeating sequences of spikes with sub-millisecond precision exist in nature, such as the synfire chain of spikes in area HVC of the zebra-finch mating-song circuit. Here, we analyzed what impact precise and reliable spikes have on the encoding accuracy for both the zebra-finch and more generic neural circuits using computational modelling. Our results show that neural circuits can use precisely timed spikes to encode signals with a higher-order accuracy than a conventional rate code. Circuits with precisely timed and reliably emitted spikes increase their encoding accuracy linearly with network size, which is the hallmark signature of an efficient code. This qualitatively differs from circuits that employ a rate code which increase their encoding accuracy with the square-root of network size. However, this improved scaling is dependent on the spikes becoming more accurate and more reliable with larger networks. Finally, we discuss how to test this scaling relationship in the zebra mating song circuit using both neural data and song-spectrogram-based recordings while taking advantage of the natural fluctuation in HVC network size due to neurogenesis. The zebra-finch mating-song circuit may represent the most likely candidate system for the use of spike-timing-based, efficient coding strategies in nature.

The role of language in mediating or augmenting human thought is the subject of long-standing debate. One specific claim links language and the ability to categorize objects based on a certain feature. According to this view, language resources are critical for feature-based categorization because verbal labels can help maintain focus on the relevant categorization criterion and reduce interference from other (irrelevant) features. As a result, language impairment is expected to affect categorization of items grouped according to a single feature (low-dimensional categories, e.g.,  Things made of wood), where many irrelevant features need to be inhibited, more than categorization of items that share many features (high-dimensional categories, e.g.,  Animals), where few irrelevant features need to be inhibited. We here present findings from individuals with aphasia that go against this hypothesis (Experiments 1 and 2). We also present fMRI data from young healthy adults, showing that the language brain regions exhibit low activity level during categorization, for both low-dimensional and high-dimensional categories (Experiment 3). In tandem, these results demonstrate that language is not critical for object categorization. Our work contributes to the growing evidence that, although language may assist in accessing task-relevant information (e.g., instructions), many cognitive tasks in adult brains proceed without recruiting the language system.

Spontaneous brain activity is characterized by bursts and avalanche-like dynamics, with scale-free features typical of critical behaviour. The stochastic version of the celebrated Wilson-Cowan model has been widely studied as a system of spiking neurons reproducing non-trivial features of the neural activity, from avalanche dynamics to oscillatory behaviours. However, to what extent such phenomena are related to the presence of a genuine critical point remains elusive. Here we address this central issue, providing analytical results in the linear approximation and extensive numerical analysis. In particular, we present results supporting the existence of a bona fide critical point, where a second-order-like phase transition occurs, characterized by scale-free avalanche dynamics, scaling with the system size and a diverging relaxation time-scale. Moreover, our study shows that the observed critical behaviour falls within the universality class of the mean-field branching process, where the exponents of the avalanche size and duration distributions are, respectively, -3/2 and -2. We also provide an accurate analysis of the system behaviour as a function of the total number of neurons, focusing on the time correlation functions of the firing rate in a wide range of the parameter space.

Accumulating evidence from human-based research has highlighted that the prevalent one-size-fits-all approach for neural and behavioral interventions is inefficient. This approach can benefit one individual, but be ineffective or even detrimental for another. Studying the efficacy of the large range of different parameters for different individuals is costly, time-consuming and requires a large sample size that makes such research impractical and hinders effective interventions. Here an active machine learning technique is presented across participants--personalized Bayesian optimization (pBO)--that searches available parameter combinations to optimize an intervention as a function of an individuals ability. This novel technique was utilized to identify transcranial alternating current stimulation frequency and current strength combinations most likely to improve arithmetic performance, based on a subjects baseline arithmetic abilities. The pBO was performed across all subjects tested, building a model of subject performance, capable of recommending parameters for future subjects based on their baseline arithmetic ability. pBO successfully searches, learns, and recommends parameters for an effective neurointervention as supported by behavioral, stimulation, and neural data. The application of pBO in human-based research opens up new avenues for personalized and more effective interventions, as well as discoveries of protocols for treatment and translation to other clinical and non-clinical domains.

How does the human brain manage multiple bits of information to guide goal-directed behaviour? Successful working memory (WM) functioning has consistently been linked to oscillatory power in the theta frequency band (4-8 Hz) over fronto-medial cortex (fronto-medial theta, FMT). Specifically, FMT is thought to reflect the mechanism of an executive sub-system that coordinates maintenance of memory contents in posterior regions. However, direct evidence for the role of FMT in controlling specific WM content is lacking. Here we collected high-density Electroencephalography (EEG) data whilst participants engaged in load-varying WM tasks and then used multivariate decoding methods to examine WM content during the maintenance period. Higher WM load elicited a focal increase in FMT. Importantly, decoding of WM content was driven by posterior/parietal sites, which in turn showed load-induced functional theta coupling with fronto-medial cortex. Finally, we observed a significant slowing of FMT frequency with increasing WM load, consistent with the hypothesised broadening of a theta duty cycle to accommodate additional WM items. Together these findings demonstrate that frontal theta orchestrates posterior maintenance of WM content. Moreover, the observed frequency slowing elucidates the function of FMT oscillations by specifically supporting phase-coding accounts of WM.

Neuronal proton-gated Acid-Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs) participate in the detection of tissue acidosis, a phenomenon often encountered in painful pathological diseases. Such conditions often involve in parallel the activation of various signaling pathways such as the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) that ultimately leads to phenotype modifications of sensory neurons. Here, we identify one member of the MAPKs, c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), as a new post-translational positive regulator of ASIC channels in rodent sensory neurons. Recombinant H+-induced ASIC currents in HEK293 cells are potently inhibited within minutes by the JNK inhibitor SP600125 in a subunit and species dependent manner, targeting both rat and human ASIC1b and ASIC3 subunits but only mouse ASIC1b subunit. The regulation by JNK of recombinant ASIC1b- and ASIC3-containing channels (homomers and heteromers) is lost upon mutation of a putative phosphorylation site within the intracellular N- and the C-terminal domain of the ASIC1b and ASIC3 subunit, respectively. Moreover, short-term JNK activation regulates the activity of native ASIC1b- and ASIC3-containing channels in rodent sensory neurons and is involved in the rapid potentiation of ASIC activity by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF. Local JNK activation in vivo in mice induces a short-term potentiation of the acid-induced cutaneous pain in inflammatory conditions that is partially blocked by the ASIC1-specific inhibitor mambalgin-1. Collectively, our data identify pain-related channels as novel physiological JNK substrates in nociceptive neurons, and propose JNK-dependent phosphorylation as a fast post-translational mechanism of regulation of sensory neuron-expressed ASIC1b- and ASIC3-containing channels that may contribute to peripheral sensitization and pain hypersensitivity.

The Bengalese finch was domesticated more than 250 years ago from the wild white-rumped munia. Similar to other domesticated species, Bengalese finches show a reduced fear response and have lower corticosterone levels, compared to white-rumped munias. Bengalese finches and munias also have different song types. Since oxytocin (OT) has been found to be involved in stress coping and auditory processing, we tested whether the OT sequence and brain expression pattern and content differ in wild munias and domesticated Bengalese finches. We identified intra-strain variability in the untranslated regions of the OT sequence in Bengalese finches in comparison to the munia OT. Several of these changes fall in specific transcription factor binding sites, which show either a conserved or a relaxed evolutionary trend in the avian lineage, and in vertebrates in general. Although in situ hybridization in several hypothalamic nuclei did not reveal significant differences in the number of cells expressing OT between the two strains, real-time quantitative PCR showed significantly lower OT mRNA expression in the diencephalon of the Bengalese finches relative to munias. Our study thus points to a decreased OT synthesis in the domestic strain compared with the wild strain in birds. This is an opposite pattern from that found in some domesticated mammals, suggesting that different processes of OT function might have occurred in mammals and birds under domestication.

Slow waves and cognitive output have been modulated in humans by phase-targeted auditory stimulation. However, to advance its technical development and further our understanding, implementation of the method in animal models is indispensable. Here, we report the successful employment of slow waves phase-targeted closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS) in rats. To validate this new tool both conceptually and functionally, we tested the effects of up- and down-phase CLAS on proportions and spectral characteristics of sleep, and on learning performance in the single pellet-reaching task, respectively. Without affecting 24-h sleep-wake behavior, CLAS specifically altered delta (slow waves) and sigma (sleep spindles) power persistently over chronic periods of stimulation. Down-phase CLAS exerted a detrimental effect on overall engagement and success rate in the behavioral test, and overall CLAS-dependent spectral changes were positively correlated with learning performance. Altogether, our results provide proof-of-principle evidence that phase-targeted CLAS of slow waves in rodents is efficient, safe and stable over chronic experimental periods, enabling the use of this high-specificity tool for basic and preclinical translational sleep research.

The cuneate nucleus (CN) is among the first sites along the neuraxis where proprioceptive signals can be integrated, transformed, and modulated. The objective of the study was to characterize the proprioceptive representations in CN. To this end, we recorded from single CN neurons in three monkeys during active reaching and passive limb perturbation. We found that many neurons exhibited responses that were tuned approximately sinusoidally to limb movement direction, as has been found for other sensorimotor neurons. The distribution of their preferred directions (PDs) was highly non-uniform and resembled that of muscle spindles within individual muscles, suggesting that CN neurons typically receive inputs from only a single muscle. We also found that the responses of proprioceptive CN neurons tended to be modestly amplified during active reaching movements compared to passive limb perturbations, in contrast to cutaneous CN neurons whose responses were not systematically different in the active and passive conditions. Somatosensory signals thus seem to be subject to a "spotlighting" of relevant sensory information rather than uniform suppression as has been suggested previously.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.435850v1?rss=1">Behaviour-driven Arc expression is greater in dorsal than ventral CA1 regardless of task or sex differences.</a></h4>

Evidence from genetic, behavioural, anatomical, and physiological study suggests that the hippocampus functionally differs across its longitudinal (dorsoventral or septotemporal) axis. Although, how to best characterize functional and representational differences in the hippocampus across its long axis remains unclear. While some suggest that the hippocampus can be divided into dorsal and ventral subregions that support distinct cognitive functions, others posit that these regions vary in their granularity of representation, wherein spatial-temporal resolution decreases in the ventral (temporal) direction. Importantly, the cognitive and granular hypotheses make distinct predictions on cellular recruitment dynamics under conditions when animals perform tasks with qualitatively different cognitive-behavioural demands. The cognitive function account implies that dorsal and ventral cellular recruitment differs depending on relevant behavioural demands, while the granularity account suggests similar recruitment dynamics regardless of the nature of the task performed. Here, we quantified cellular recruitment with the immediate early gene (IEG) Arc across the entire longitudinal CA1 axis in female and male rats performing spatial-and fear-guided memory tasks. Our results show that recruitment is greater in dorsal than ventral CA1 regardless of task or sex. This experimentum crucis leads to the strong inference that the granularity hypothesis for functional differences across the longitudinal axis in the rodent hippocampus is correct.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.17.435845v1?rss=1">Proprioception-based movement goals support imitation and are disrupted in apraxia</a></h4>

The ability to imitate observed actions serves as an efficient method for learning novel movements and is specifically impaired (without concomitant gross motor impairments) in the neurological disorder of limb apraxia, a disorder common after left hemisphere stroke. Research with apraxic patients has advanced our understanding of how people imitate. However, the role of proprioception in imitation has been rarely assessed directly. Prior work has proposed that proprioceptively sensed body position is transformed into a visual format, supporting the attainment of a desired imitation goal represented visually (i.e., how the movement should look when performed). In contrast, we hypothesized a more direct role for proprioception: we suggest that movement goals are also represented proprioceptively (i.e., how a desired movement should feel when performed), and the ability to represent or access such proprioceptive goals is deficient in apraxia. Using a novel imitation task in which a robot cued meaningless trajectories purely proprioceptively or visually, we separately probed the role of each sensory modality. We found that patients with left hemisphere stroke were disproportionately worse than controls at imitating when cued proprioceptively versus visually. The proprioceptive versus visual disparity was associated with apraxia severity as assessed by a traditional imitation task, but could not be explained by general proprioceptive impairment or speed-accuracy trade-offs. These data suggest that successful imitation depends in part on the ability to represent movement goals in terms of how those movements should feel, and that deficits in this ability contribute to imitation impairments in patients with apraxia.

<p>by Ruping Sun, Athanasios N. Nikolakopoulos</p>

Can metastatic-primary (M-P) genomic divergence measured from next generation sequencing reveal the natural history of metastatic dissemination? This remains an open question of utmost importance in facilitating a deeper understanding of metastatic progression, and thereby, improving its prevention. Here, we utilize mathematical and computational modeling to tackle this question as well as to provide a framework that illuminates the fundamental elements and evolutionary determinants of M-P divergence. Our framework facilitates the integration of sequencing detectability of somatic variants, and hence, paves the way towards bridging the measurable between-tumor heterogeneity with analytical modeling and interpretability. We show that the number of somatic variants of the metastatic seeding cell that are experimentally undetectable in the primary tumor, can be characterized as the path of the phylogenetic tree from the last appearing variant of the seeding cell back to the most recent detectable variant. We find that the expected length of this path is principally determined by the decay in detectability of the variants along the seeding cell’s lineage; and thus, exhibits a significant dependence on the underlying tumor growth dynamics. A striking implication of this fact, is that dissemination from an advanced detectable subclone of the primary tumor can lead to an abrupt drop in the expected measurable M-P divergence, thereby breaking the previously assumed monotonic relation between seeding time and M-P divergence. This is emphatically verified by our single cell-based spatial tumor growth simulation, where we find that M-P divergence exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with seeding time when the primary tumor grows under branched and linear evolution. On the other hand, a monotonic relationship holds when we condition on the dynamics of progressive diversification, or by restricting the seeding cells to always originate from undetectable subclones. Our results highlight the fact that a precise understanding of tumor growth dynamics is the <i>sine qua non</i> for exploiting M-P divergence to reconstruct the chronology of metastatic dissemination. The quantitative models presented here enable further careful evaluation of M-P divergence in association with crucial evolutionary and sequencing parameters.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KCi63x9YhZA" width="1" />

<p>by Yevhen Tupikov, Dezhe Z. Jin</p>

During development, neurons arrive at local brain areas in an extended period of time, but how they form local neural circuits is unknown. Here we computationally model the emergence of a network for precise timing in the premotor nucleus HVC in songbird. We show that new projection neurons, added to HVC post hatch at early stages of song development, are recruited to the end of a growing feedforward network. High spontaneous activity of the new neurons makes them the prime targets for recruitment in a self-organized process via synaptic plasticity. Once recruited, the new neurons fire readily at precise times, and they become mature. Neurons that are not recruited become silent and replaced by new immature neurons. Our model incorporates realistic HVC features such as interneurons, spatial distributions of neurons, and distributed axonal delays. The model predicts that the birth order of the projection neurons correlates with their burst timing during the song.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wh94un-bhFs" width="1" />

<p>by Alican Gulsevin, Jens Meiler</p>

Amphipathic helices have hydrophobic and hydrophilic/charged residues situated on oppo site faces of the helix. They can anchor peripheral membrane proteins to the membrane, be attached to integral membrane proteins, or exist as independent peptides. Despite the widespread presence of membrane-interacting amphipathic helices, there is no computational tool within Rosetta to model their interactions with membranes. In order to address this need, we developed the AmphiScan protocol with PyRosetta, which runs a grid search to find the most favorable position of an amphipathic helix with respect to the membrane. The performance of the algorithm was tested in benchmarks with the <i>RosettaMembrane</i>, <i>ref2015_memb</i>, and <i>franklin2019</i> score functions on six engineered and 44 naturally-occurring amphipathic helices using membrane coordinates from the OPM and PDBTM databases, OREMPRO server, and MD simulations for comparison. The AmphiScan protocol predicted the coordinates of amphipathic helices within less than 3Å of the reference structures and identified membrane-embedded residues with a Matthews Correlation Constant (MCC) of up to 0.57. Overall, AmphiScan stands as fast, accurate, and highly-customizable protocol that can be pipelined with other Rosetta and Python applications.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hO5eyyEVK1E" width="1" />

Thrombosis is a recognized complication of Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) illness and is often associated with poor prognosis. There is a well-recognized link between coagulation and inflammation, however, the extent of thrombotic events associated with COVID-19 warrants further investigation. Poly(A) Binding Protein Cytoplasmic 4 (PABPC4), Serine/Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitor Clade G Member 1 (SERPING1) and Vitamin K epOxide Reductase Complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), which are all proteins linked to coagulation, have been shown to interact with SARS proteins. We computationally examined the interaction of these with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, in the case of VKORC1, we describe its binding to ORF7a in detail. We examined the occurrence of variants of each of these proteins across populations and interrogated their potential contribution to COVID-19 severity. Potential mechanisms, by which some of these variants may contribute to disease, are proposed. Some of these variants are prevalent in minority groups that are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19. Therefore, we are proposing that further investigation around these variants may lead to better understanding of disease pathogenesis in minority groups and more informed therapeutic approaches.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mvXf7WFaEoI" width="1" />

Non-human primates infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit mild clinical signs. Here we used a mathematical model to characterize in detail the viral dynamics in 31 cynomolgus macaques for which nasopharyngeal and tracheal viral load were frequently assessed. We identified that infected cells had a large burst size (&gt;10<sup>4</sup> virus) and a within-host reproductive basic number of approximately 6 and 4 in nasopharyngeal and tracheal compartment, respectively. After peak viral load, infected cells were rapidly lost with a half-life of 9 hours, with no significant association between cytokine elevation and clearance, leading to a median time to viral clearance of 10 days, consistent with observations in mild human infections. Given these parameter estimates, we predict that a prophylactic treatment blocking 90% of viral production or viral infection could prevent viral growth. In conclusion, our results provide estimates of SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetic parameters in an experimental model of mild infection and they provide means to assess the efficacy of future antiviral treatments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/623KOQ6xXik" width="1" />

There are currently limited Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and vaccines for the treatment or prevention of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Enhanced understanding of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and pathogenesis is critical for the development of therapeutics. To provide insight into viral replication, cell tropism, and host–viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2, we performed single-cell (sc) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of experimentally infected human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in air–liquid interface (ALI) cultures over a time course. This revealed novel polyadenylated viral transcripts and highlighted ciliated cells as a major target at the onset of infection, which we confirmed by electron and immunofluorescence microscopy. Over the course of infection, the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 expands to other epithelial cell types including basal and club cells. Infection induces cell-intrinsic expression of type I and type III interferons (IFNs) and interleukin (IL)-6 but not IL-1. This results in expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in both infected and bystander cells. This provides a detailed characterization of genes, cell types, and cell state changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human airway.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/atRd_kJRPv8" width="1" />

Using genetic deletion in mice, we demonstrate that extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 5 (Erk5) plays important roles in central sensitization in formalin‐induced inflammatory pain. Extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 2 and Erk5 are involved in discrete but parallel mechanisms underlying central sensitization in the early second phase of formalin‐induced nociceptive behaviors. 

Abstract
Nervous systems are designed to become extra sensitive to afferent nociceptive stimuli under certain circumstances such as inflammation and nerve injury. How pain hypersensitivity comes about is key issue in the field since it ultimately results in chronic pain. Central sensitization represents enhanced pain sensitivity due to increased neural signaling within the central nervous system (CNS). Particularly, much evidence indicates that underlying mechanism of central sensitization is associated with the change of spinal neurons. Extracellular signal‐regulated kinases have received attention as key molecules in central sensitization. Previously, we revealed the isoform‐specific function of extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 2 (Erk2) in spinal neurons for central sensitization using mice with Cre‐loxP‐mediated deletion of Erk2 in the CNS. Still, how extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 5 (Erk5) in spinal neurons contributes to central sensitization has not been directly tested, nor is the functional relevance of Erk5 and Erk2 known. Here, we show that Erk5 and Erk2 in the CNS play redundant and/or distinct roles in central sensitization, depending on the plasticity context (cell types, pain types, time, etc.). We used male mice with Erk5 deletion specifically in the CNS and found that Erk5 plays important roles in central sensitization in a formalin‐induced inflammatory pain model. Deletion of both Erk2 and Erk5 leads to greater attenuation of central sensitization in this model, compared to deletion of either isoform alone. Conversely, Erk2 but not Erk5 plays important roles in central sensitization in neuropathic pain, a type of chronic pain caused by nerve damage. Our results suggest the elaborate mechanisms of Erk signaling in central sensitization.

We demonstrate a critical role for ERK signaling in microglia in Alzheimer’s disease using a preclinical model of Alzheimer’s disease pathology and quantitative studies of postmortem human brains.

Abstract
The importance of mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling in regulating microglia‐mediated neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. We examined the role of MAPK signaling in microglia using a preclinical model of AD pathology and quantitative proteomics studies of postmortem human brains. In multiplex immunoassay analyses of MAPK phosphoproteins in acutely isolated microglia and brain tissue from 5xFAD mice, we found phosphorylated extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK) was the most strongly upregulated phosphoprotein within the MAPK pathway in acutely isolated microglia, but not whole‐brain tissue from 5xFAD mice. The importance of ERK signaling in primary microglia cultures was next investigated using transcriptomic profiling and functional assays of amyloid‐β and neuronal phagocytosis, which confirmed that ERK is a critical regulator of IFNγ‐mediated pro‐inflammatory activation of microglia, although it was also partly important for constitutive microglial functions. Phospho‐ERK was an upstream regulator of disease‐associated microglial gene expression (Trem2, Tyrobp), as well as several human AD risk genes (Bin1, Cd33, Trem2, Cnn2), indicative of the importance of microglial ERK signaling in AD pathology. Quantitative proteomic analyses of postmortem human brain showed that ERK1 and ERK2 were the only MAPK proteins with increased protein expression and positive associations with neuropathological grade. In a human brain phosphoproteomic study, we found evidence for increased flux through the ERK signaling pathway in AD. Overall, our analyses strongly suggest that ERK phosphorylation, particularly in microglia in mouse models, is a regulator of pro‐inflammatory immune responses in AD pathogenesis.

In normal rats, ocular dominance columns (ODCs) overlap with callosal patches in V1. ODCs (a) and callosal patches (c) are present by postnatal day 10 (P10).

Abstract
In Long Evans rats, ocular dominance columns (ODCs) in V1 overlap with patches of callosal connections. Using anatomical tracers, we found that ODCs and callosal patches are present at postnatal day 10 (P10), several days before eye opening, and about 10 days before the activation of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity (~P20). In rats monocularly enucleated at P10 and perfused ~P20, ODCs ipsilateral to the remaining eye desegregated, indicating that rat ODCs are highly susceptible to monocular enucleation during a precritical period. Monocular enucleation during the critical period exerted significant, although smaller, effects. Monocular eye lid suture during the critical period led to a significant expansion of the ipsilateral projection from the nondeprived eye, whereas the contralateral projection invaded into, and intermixed with, ipsilateral ODCs innervated by the deprived eye. We propose that this intermixing allows callosal connections to contribute to the effects of monocular deprivation assessed in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the nondeprived eye. The ipsilateral and contralateral projections from the deprived eye did not undergo significant shrinkage. In contrast, we found that callosal patches are less susceptible to imbalance of eye input. In rats monocularly enucleated during either the precritical or critical periods, callosal patches were maintained in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the remaining eye, but desegregated in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the enucleated orbit. Callosal patches were maintained in rats binocularly enucleated at P10 or later. Similarly, monocular deprivation during the critical period had no significant effect on callosal patches in either hemisphere.

<p>Non-von Neumann computational hardware, based on neuron-inspired, non-linear
elements connected via linear, weighted synapses -- so-called neuromorphic
systems -- is a viable computational substrate. Since neuromorphic systems have
been shown to use less power than CPUs for many applications, they are of
potential use in autonomous systems such as robots, drones, and satellites, for
which power resources are at a premium. The power used by neuromorphic systems
is approximately proportional to the number of spiking events produced by
neurons on-chip. However, typical information encoding on these chips is in the
form of firing rates that unarily encode information. That is, the number of
spikes generated by a neuron is meant to be proportional to an encoded value
used in a computation or algorithm. Unary encoding is less efficient (produces
more spikes) than binary encoding. For this reason, here we present
neuromorphic computational mechanisms for implementing binary two's complement
operations. We use the mechanisms to construct a neuromorphic, binary matrix
multiplication algorithm that may be used as a primitive for linear
differential equation integration, deep networks, and other standard
calculations. We also construct a random walk circuit and apply it in Brownian
motion simulations. We study how both algorithms scale in circuit size and
iteration time.

<p>Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is an algorithm intrinsically adapted to the
training of physical networks, in particular thanks to the local updates of
weights given by the internal dynamics of the system. However, the construction
of such a hardware requires to make the algorithm compatible with the existing
neuromorphic CMOS technology, which generally exploits digital communication
between neurons and offers a limited amount of local memory. In this work, we
demonstrate that EP can train dynamical networks with binary activations and
weights. We first train systems with binary weights and full-precision
activations, achieving an accuracy equivalent to that of full-precision models
trained by standard EP on MNIST, and losing only 1.9% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with
equal architecture. We then extend our method to the training of models with
binary activations and weights on MNIST, achieving an accuracy within 1% of the
full-precision reference for fully connected architectures and reaching the
full-precision reference accuracy for the convolutional architecture. Our
extension of EP training to binary networks is consistent with the requirements
of today's dynamic, brain-inspired hardware platforms and paves the way for
very low-power end-to-end learning.

<p>The success of state-of-the-art machine learning is essentially all based on
different variations of gradient descent algorithms that minimize some version
of a cost or loss function. A fundamental limitation, however, is the need to
train these systems in either supervised or unsupervised ways by exposing them
to typically large numbers of training examples. Here, we introduce a
fundamentally novel conceptual approach to machine learning that takes
advantage of a neurobiologically derived model of dynamic signaling,
constrained by the geometric structure of a network. We show that MNIST images
can be uniquely encoded and classified by the dynamics of geometric networks
with nearly state-of-the-art accuracy in an unsupervised way, and without the
need for any training.

<p>To design control strategies that predictably manipulate a system's behavior,
it is first necessary to understand how the system's structure relates to its
response. Many complex systems can be represented as multilayer networks whose
response and control can be studied in the framework of network control theory.
It remains unknown how a system's layered architecture dictates its control
properties, particularly when control signals can only access the system
through a single input layer. Here, we use the framework of linear control
theory to probe the control properties of a duplex network with directed
interlayer links. We determine the manner in which the structural properties of
layers and relative interlayer arrangement together dictate the system's
response. For this purpose, we calculate the exact expression of optimal
control energy in terms of layer spectra and the relative alignment between the
eigenmodes of the input layer and the deeper target layer. For a range of
numerically constructed duplex networks, we then calculate the control
properties of the two layers as a function of target-layer densities and layer
topology. The alignment of layer eigenmodes emerges as an important parameter
that sets the cost and routing of the optimal energy for control. We understand
these results in a simplified limit of a single-mode approximation, and we
build metrics to characterize the routing of optimal control energy through the
eigenmodes of each layer. Our analytical and numerical results together provide
insights into the relationships between structure and control in duplex
networks. More generally, they serve as a platform for future work designing
optimal \emph{interlayer} control strategies.

<p>Brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is an emerging computational
paradigm that mimics brain cognition and leverages hyperdimensional vectors
with fully distributed holographic representation and (pseudo)randomness.
Compared to other machine learning (ML) methods such as deep neural networks
(DNNs), HDC offers several advantages including high energy efficiency, low
latency, and one-shot learning, making it a promising alternative candidate on
a wide range of applications. However, the reliability and robustness of HDC
models have not been explored yet. In this paper, we design, implement, and
evaluate HDTest to test HDC model by automatically exposing unexpected or
incorrect behaviors under rare inputs. The core idea of HDTest is based on
guided differential fuzz testing. Guided by the distance between query
hypervector and reference hypervector in HDC, HDTest continuously mutates
original inputs to generate new inputs that can trigger incorrect behaviors of
HDC model. Compared to traditional ML testing methods, HDTest does not need to
manually label the original input. Using handwritten digit classification as an
example, we show that HDTest can generate thousands of adversarial inputs with
negligible perturbations that can successfully fool HDC models. On average,
HDTest can generate around 400 adversarial inputs within one minute running on
a commodity computer. Finally, by using the HDTest-generated inputs to retrain
HDC models, we can strengthen the robustness of HDC models. To the best of our
knowledge, this paper presents the first effort in systematically testing this
emerging brain-inspired computational model.

<p>In this work we demonstrate the use of autoencoder networks for rapid
extraction of the signal parameters of discretely sampled signals. In
particular, we use dense autoencoder networks to extract the parameters of
interest from exponentially decaying signals and decaying oscillations. Using a
three-stage training method and careful choice of the neural network size, we
are able to retrieve the relevant signal parameters directly from the latent
space of the autoencoder network at significantly improved rates compared to
traditional algorithmic signal-analysis approaches. We show that the achievable
precision and accuracy of this method of analysis is similar to conventional,
algorithm-based signal analysis methods, by demonstrating that, the extracted
signal parameters are approaching their fundamental parameter estimation limit
as provided by the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
autoencoder networks are able to achieve signal analysis, and, hence, parameter
extraction, at rates of 75 kHz, orders-of-magnitude faster than conventional
techniques with equal precision. Finally, we explore the limitations of our
approach, demonstrating that analysis rates of $&gt;$200 kHz are feasible with
further optimization of the transfer rate between the data-acquisition system
and data-analysis system.

<p>Living systems break detailed balance at small scales, consuming energy and
producing entropy in the environment in order to perform molecular and cellular
functions. However, it remains unclear how broken detailed balance manifests at
macroscopic scales, and how such dynamics support higher-order biological
functions. Here we present a framework to quantify broken detailed balance by
measuring entropy production in macroscopic systems. We apply our method to the
human brain, an organ whose immense metabolic consumption drives a diverse
range of cognitive functions. Using whole-brain imaging data, we demonstrate
that the brain nearly obeys detailed balance when at rest, but strongly breaks
detailed balance when performing physically and cognitively demanding tasks.
Using a dynamic Ising model, we show that these large-scale violations of
detailed balance can emerge from fine-scale asymmetries in the interactions
between elements, a known feature of neural systems. Together, these results
suggest that violations of detailed balance are vital for cognition, and
provide a general tool for quantifying entropy production in macroscopic
systems.

<p>Astrocytes are the most widely distributed and abundant glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a class of diseases with a slow onset, progressive progression, and poor prognosis. Common clinical NDDs include Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington’s disease (HD). Although these diseases have different etiologies, they are all associated with neuronal loss and pathological dysfunction. Accumulating evidence indicates that neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors, and toxic metabolites that are produced and released by activated astrocytes affect and regulate the function of neurons at the receptor, ion channel, antigen transfer, and gene transcription levels in the pathogenesis of NDDs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small non-coding RNAs that play a wide range of biological roles by regulating the transcription and post-transcriptional translation of target mRNAs to induce target gene expression and silencing. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs participate in the pathogenesis of NDDs by regulating astrocyte function through different mechanisms and may be potential targets for the treatment of NDDs. Here, we review studies of the role of astrocytes in the pathogenesis of NDDs and discuss possible mechanisms of miRNAs in the regulation of astrocyte function, suggesting that miRNAs may be targeted as a novel approach for the treatment of NDDs.</p>

<p>Vision and hearing disorders comprise the most common sensory disorders found in people. Many forms of vision and hearing loss are inherited and current treatments only provide patients with temporary or partial relief. As a result, developing genetic therapies for any of the several hundred known causative genes underlying inherited retinal and cochlear disorders has been of great interest. Recent exciting advances in gene therapy have shown promise for the clinical treatment of inherited retinal diseases, and while clinical gene therapies for cochlear disease are not yet available, research in the last several years has resulted in significant advancement in preclinical development for gene delivery to the cochlea. Furthermore, the development of somatic targeted genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 has brought new possibilities for the treatment of dominant or gain-of-function disease. Here we discuss the current state of gene therapy for inherited diseases of the retina and cochlea with an eye toward areas that still need additional development.</p>

<p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is mainly manifested as insidious onset, chronic progressive cognitive decline and non-cognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms, which seriously affects the quality of life of the elderly and causes a very large burden on society and families. This paper uses graph theory to analyze the constructed brain network, and extracts the node degree, node efficiency, and node betweenness centrality parameters of the two modal brain networks. The T test method is used to analyze the difference of graph theory parameters between normal people and AD patients, and brain regions with significant differences in graph theory parameters are selected as brain network features. By analyzing the calculation principles of the conventional convolutional layer and the depth separable convolution unit, the computational complexity of them is compared. The depth separable convolution unit decomposes the traditional convolution process into spatial convolution for feature extraction and point convolution for feature combination, which greatly reduces the number of multiplication and addition operations in the convolution process, while still being able to obtain comparisons. Aiming at the special convolution structure of the depth separable convolution unit, this paper proposes a channel pruning method based on the convolution structure and explains its pruning process. Multimodal neuroimaging can provide complete information for the quantification of Alzheimer’s disease. This paper proposes a cascaded three-dimensional neural network framework based on single-modal and multi-modal images, using MRI and PET images to distinguish AD and MCI from normal samples. Multiple three-dimensional CNN networks are used to extract recognizable information in local image blocks. The high-level two-dimensional CNN network fuses multi-modal features and selects the features of discriminative regions to perform quantitative predictions on samples. The algorithm proposed in this paper can automatically extract and fuse the features of multi-modality and multi-regions layer by layer, and the visual analysis results show that the abnormally changed regions affected by Alzheimer’s disease provide important information for clinical quantification.</p>

<p>The human brain grows the most dramatically during the perinatal and early post-natal periods, during which pre-term birth or perinatal injury that may alter brain structure and lead to developmental anomalies. Thus, characterizing cortical thickness of developing brains remains an important goal. However, this task is often complicated by inaccurate cortical surface extraction due to small-size brains. Here, we propose a novel complex framework for the reconstruction of neonatal WM and pial surfaces, accounting for large partial volumes due to small-size brains. The proposed approach relies only on T1-weighted images unlike previous T2-weighted image-based approaches while only T1-weighted images are sometimes available under the different clinical/research setting. Deep neural networks are first introduced to the neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pipeline to address the mis-segmentation of brain tissues. Furthermore, this pipeline enhances cortical boundary delineation using combined models of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/GM boundary detection with edge gradient information and a new skeletonization of sulcal folding where no CSF voxels are seen due to the limited resolution. We also proposed a systematic evaluation using three independent datasets comprising 736 pre-term and 97 term neonates. Qualitative assessment for reconstructed cortical surfaces shows that 86.9% are rated as accurate across the three site datasets. In addition, our landmark-based evaluation shows that the mean displacement of the cortical surfaces from the true boundaries was less than a voxel size (0.532 ± 0.035 mm). Evaluating the proposed pipeline (namely NEOCIVET 2.0) shows the robustness and reproducibility across different sites and different age-groups. The mean cortical thickness measured positively correlated with post-menstrual age (PMA) at scan (p &lt; 0.0001); Cingulate cortical areas grew the most rapidly whereas the inferior temporal cortex grew the least rapidly. The range of the cortical thickness measured was biologically congruent (1.3 mm at 28 weeks of PMA to 1.8 mm at term equivalent). Cortical thickness measured on T1 MRI using NEOCIVET 2.0 was compared with that on T2 using the established dHCP pipeline. It was difficult to conclude that either T1 or T2 imaging is more ideal to construct cortical surfaces. NEOCIVET 2.0 has been open to the public through CBRAIN (https://mcin-cnim.ca/technology/cbrain/), a web-based platform for processing brain imaging data.</p>

Background<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a clinical syndrome with complex biological determinants, but which in most cases is characterized by TDP-43 pathology. The identification in CSF of a protein signature of TDP-43 network dysfunction would have the potential to inform the identification of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets.</p>Methods<p>We compared CSF proteomic data from patients with ALS (n = 41), Parkinson’s disease (n = 19) and healthy control participants (n = 20). Weighted correlation network analysis was used to identify modules within the CSF protein network and combined with gene ontology enrichment analysis to functionally annotate module proteins. Analysis of module eigenproteins and differential correlation analysis of the CSF protein network was used to compare ALS and Parkinson’s disease protein co-correlation with healthy controls. In order to monitor temporal changes in the CSF proteome, we performed longitudinal analysis of the CSF proteome in a subset of ALS patients.</p>Results<p>Weighted correlation network analysis identified 10 modules, including those enriched for terms involved in gene expression including nucleic acid binding, RNA metabolism and translation; humoral immune system function, including complement pathways; membrane proteins, axonal outgrowth and adherence; and glutamatergic synapses. Immune system module eigenproteins were increased in ALS, whilst axonal module eigenproteins were decreased in ALS. The 19 altered protein correlations in ALS were enriched for gene expression (OR 3.05, p = 0.017) and membrane protein modules (OR 17.48, p = 0.011), including intramodular hub proteins previously identified as TDP-43 interactors. Proteins decreasing over longitudinal analysis ALS were enriched in glutamatergic synapse and axonal outgrowth modules. Protein correlation network disruptions in Parkinson’s disease showed no module enrichment.</p>Conclusions<p>Alterations in the co-correlation network in CSF samples identified a set of pathways known to be associated with TDP-43 dysfunction in the pathogenesis of ALS, with important implications for therapeutic targeting and biomarker development.</p>

<p>The assessment of three-dimensional (3D) brain cytoarchitecture at a cellular resolution remains a great challenge in the field of neuroscience and constant development of imaging techniques has become crucial, particularly when it comes to offering direct and clear obtention of data from macro to nano scales. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electron or optical microscopy, although valuable, still face some issues such as the lack of contrast and extensive sample preparation protocols. In this context, x-ray microtomography (μCT) has become a promising non-destructive tool for imaging a broad range of samples, from dense materials to soft biological specimens. It is a new supplemental method to be explored for deciphering the cytoarchitecture and connectivity of the brain. This review aims to bring together published works using x-ray μCT in neurobiology in order to discuss the achievements made so far and the future of this technique for neuroscience.</p>

Background and Purpose<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an emerging non-invasive neuromodulation technique for focal epilepsy. Because epilepsy is a disease affecting the brain network, our study was aimed to evaluate and predict the treatment outcome of cathodal tDCS (ctDCS) by analyzing the ctDCS-induced functional network alterations.</p>Methods<p>Either the active 5-day, −1.0 mA, 20-min ctDCS or sham ctDCS targeting at the most active interictal epileptiform discharge regions was applied to 27 subjects suffering from focal epilepsy. The functional networks before and after ctDCS were compared employing graph theoretical analysis based on the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. A support vector machine (SVM) prediction model was built to predict the treatment outcome of ctDCS using the graph theoretical measures as markers.</p>Results<p>Our results revealed that the mean clustering coefficient and the global efficiency decreased significantly, as well as the characteristic path length and the mean shortest path length at the stimulation sites in the fMRI functional networks increased significantly after ctDCS only for the patients with response to the active ctDCS (at least 20% reduction rate of seizure frequency). Our prediction model achieved the mean prediction accuracy of 68.3% (mean sensitivity: 70.0%; mean specificity: 67.5%) after the nested cross validation. The mean area under the receiver operating curve was 0.75, which showed good prediction performance.</p>Conclusion<p>The study demonstrated that the response to ctDCS was related to the topological alterations in the functional networks of epilepsy patients detected by fMRI. The graph theoretical measures were promising for clinical prediction of ctDCS treatment outcome.</p>

<p>We investigated spectral resting-state EEG in persons with chronic stroke-induced aphasia to determine its reliability, sensitivity, and relationship to functional behaviors. Resting-state EEG has not yet been characterized in this population and was selected given the demonstrated potential of resting-state investigations using other neuroimaging techniques to guide clinical decision-making. Controls and persons with chronic stroke-induced aphasia completed two EEG recording sessions, separated by approximately 1 month, as well as behavioral assessments of language, sensorimotor, and cognitive domains. Power in the classic frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) was examined via spectral analysis of resting-state EEG data. Results suggest that power in the theta, alpha, and beta bands is reliable for use as a repeated measure. Significantly greater theta and lower beta power was observed in persons with aphasia (PWAs) than controls. Finally, in PWAs theta power negatively correlated with performance on a discourse informativeness measure, while alpha and beta power positively correlated with performance on the same measure. This indicates that spectral rsEEG slowing observed in PWAs in the chronic stage is pathological and suggests a possible avenue for directly altering brain activation to improve behavioral function. Taken together, these results suggest that spectral resting-state EEG holds promise for sensitive measurement of functioning and change in persons with chronic aphasia. Future studies investigating the utility of these measures as biomarkers of frank or latent aphasic deficits and treatment response in chronic stroke-induced aphasia are warranted.</p>

<p>We investigated if emotion regulation can be improved through self-regulation training on non-emotional brain regions, as well as how to change the brain networks implicated in this process. During the training period, the participants were instructed to up-regulate their right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) activity according to real-time functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neurofeedback signals, and there was no emotional element. The results showed that the training significantly increased emotion regulation, resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within the emotion regulation network (ERN) and frontoparietal network (FPN), and rsFC between the ERN and amygdala; however, training did not influence the rsFC between the FPN and the amygdala. However, self-regulation training on rDLPFC significantly improved emotion regulation and generally increased the rsFCs within the networks; the rsFC between the ERN and amygdala was also selectively increased. The present study also described a safe approach that may improve emotion regulation through self-regulation training on non-emotional brain regions.</p>

<p>More than 6 million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the incidence is growing rapidly with our aging population. Numerous therapeutics have failed to make it to the clinic, potentially due to a focus on presumptive pathogenic proteins instead of cell-type-specific signaling mechanisms. The tau propagation hypothesis that inter-neuronal tau transfer drives AD pathology has recently garnered attention, as accumulation of pathological tau in the brain has high clinical significance in correlating with progression of cognitive AD symptoms. However, studies on tau pathology in AD are classically neuron-centric and have greatly overlooked cell-type specific effects of tau internalization, degradation, and propagation. While the contribution of microglia to tau processing and propagation is beginning to be recognized and understood, astrocytes, glial cells in the brain important for maintaining neuronal metabolic, synaptic, trophic, and immune function which can produce, internalize, degrade, and propagate tau are understudied in their ability to affect AD progression through tau pathology. Here, we showcase evidence for whether tau uptake by astrocytes may be beneficial or detrimental to neuronal health and how astrocytes and their immunometabolic functions may be key targets for future successful AD therapies.</p>

<p>Chronic stress appears to alter DNA methylation and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in brain regions related to emotion. Collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2) mediates the development of depression by regulating microtubule dynamics. In this study, rats were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). At the end of the CUMS procedure, normal saline or fluoxetine was administered to the rats. Moreover, normal saline or the 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-aza) was administered to the hippocampal CA1 region of the rats. Behavioral tests were performed to evaluate the depressive-like phenotypes. The CRMP2 DNA methylation levels and cytoskeletal microtubular system-related biomarkers were detected by several molecular biology techniques. The results showed that the rat model of depression was successfully established by exposure to CUMS, and fluoxetine treatment exerted an antidepressant-like effect. We observed the upregulation of DNMT1 and DNMT3a in the hippocampus of stressed rats. CUMS induced a decrease in CRMP2 expression and an increase in phosphorylated CRMP2 (pCRMP2) expression in the hippocampus of rats. The rate of DNA methylation in the CpG island of the CRMP2 promoter region in the hippocampus of stressed rats was significantly higher than that in control rats. Moreover, CUMS significantly decreased the interaction between CRMP2 and α-tubulin and decreased the microtubule dynamics. Chronic fluoxetine treatment reversed these changes. Also, hypomethylation induced by 5-aza injection into the hippocampal CA1 region caused antidepressant-like effects and increased CRMP2 expression and microtubule dynamics. These results suggested that CRMP2 DNA methylation may be involved in regulating the cytoskeletal microtubular system and mediating depressive-like behaviors.</p>

<p>Mutations in the MPV17 gene are associated with hepatocerebral form of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. The mechanisms through which MPV17 mutations cause respiratory chain dysfunction and mtDNA depletion is still unclear. The MPV17 gene encodes an inner membrane mitochondrial protein that was recently described to function as a non-selective channel. Although its exact function is unknown, it is thought to be important in the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). To obtain more information about the role of MPV17 in human disease, we investigated the effect of MPV17 knockdown and of selected known MPV17 mutations associated with MPV17 disease in vitro. We used different approaches in order to evaluate the cellular consequences of MPV17 deficiency. We found that lower levels of MPV17 were associated with impaired mitochondrial respiration and with a quiescent energetic metabolic profile. All the mutations studied destabilized the protein, resulting in reduced protein levels. We also demonstrated that different mutations caused different cellular abnormalities, including increased ROS production, decreased oxygen consumption, loss of ΔΨm, and mislocalization of MPV17 protein. Our study provides novel insight into the molecular effects of MPV17 mutations and opens novel possibilities for testing therapeutic strategies for a devastating group of disorders.</p>

<p>The entopeduncular nucleus is one of the basal ganglia's output nuclei, thereby controlling basal ganglia information processing. Entopeduncular nucleus neurons integrate GABAergic inputs from the Striatum and the globus pallidus, together with glutamatergic inputs from the subthalamic nucleus. We show that endocannabinoids and dopamine interact to modulate the long-term plasticity of all these primary afferents to the entopeduncular nucleus. Our results suggest that the interplay between dopamine and endocannabinoids determines the balance between direct pathway (striatum) and indirect pathway (globus pallidus) in entopeduncular nucleus output. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, despite the lack of axon collaterals, information is transferred between neighboring neurons in the entopeduncular nucleus via endocannabinoid diffusion. These results transform the prevailing view of the entopeduncular nucleus as a feedforward “relay” nucleus to an intricate control unit, which may play a vital role in the process of action selection.</p>

<p>Human stem cell derived brain organoids are increasingly gaining attention as an ideal model system for investigating neurological diseases, particularly those that involve myelination defects. However, current protocols for generating brain organoids with sufficiently mature oligodendrocytes that deposit myelin on endogenously produced neurons are lengthy and complicated. Taking advantage of a human pluripotent stem cell line that reports on SOX10 expression, we developed a protocol that involves a 42 day exposure of neuroectoderm-derived organoids to a cocktail of growth factors and small molecules that collectively foster oligodendrocyte specification and survival. Importantly, the resulting day 42 brain organoids contain both myelinating oligodendrocytes, cortical neuronal cells and astrocytes. These oligodendrocyte brain organoids therefore constitute a valuable and tractable platform for functional neurogenomics and drug screening for white matter diseases.</p>

<p>In the central nervous system, myelin is attached to the axon in the paranodal region by a trimolecular complex of Neurofascin155 (NF155) in the myelin membrane, interacting with Caspr1 and Contactin1 on the axolemma. Alternative splicing of a single Neurofascin transcript generates several different Neurofascins expressed by several cell types, but NF155, which is expressed by oligodendrocytes, contains a domain in the third fibronectinIII-like region of the molecule that is unique. The immunoglobulin 5–6 domain of NF155 is essential for binding to Contactin1, but less is known about the functions of the NF155-unique third fibronectinIII-like domain. Mutations and autoantibodies to this region are associated with several neurodevelopmental and demyelinating nervous system disorders. Here we used Crispr-Cas9 gene editing to delete a 9 bp sequence of NF155 in this unique domain, which has recently been identified as a thrombin binding site and implicated in plasticity of the myelin sheath. This small deletion results in dysmyelination, eversion of paranodal loops of myelin, substantial enlargement of the nodal gap, a complete loss of paranodal septate junctions, and mislocalization of Caspr1 and nodal sodium channels. The animals exhibit tremor and ataxia, and biochemical and mass spectrometric analysis indicates that while NF155 is transcribed and spliced normally, the NF155 protein is subsequently degraded, resulting in loss of the full length 155 kDa native protein. These findings reveal that this 9 bp region of NF155 in its unique third fibronectinIII-like domain is essential for stability of the protein.</p>

<p>Abnormal α-Synuclein (α-SYN) aggregates are the pathological hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease (PD), which may affect dopamine (DA) neuron function and DA metabolism. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is an enzyme located on the outer mitochondrial membrane that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of DA. Both α-SYN and MAOA are associated with PD pathogenesis, suggesting possible crosstalk between these two molecules. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential impacts of α-SYN on MAOA function and further explore the underlying mechanisms. Our study showed that overexpression of α-SYN [both wild-type (WT) and A53T] increased MAOA function via upregulating its expression without impacting MAOA stability. Overexpression of α-SYN<sup>WT</sup> or α-SYN<sup>A53T</sup> enhanced the transcription activity of the MAOA promoter region containing the binding sites of cell division cycle associated 7 like (R1, a transcriptional repressor of MAOA) and trans-acting transcription factor 1 (Sp1, a transcription factor of MAOA). Interestingly, α-SYN selectively increased Sp1 expression, thereby enhancing the binding capacity of Sp1 with MAOA promoter to increase MAOA expression. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that α-SYN can upregulate MAOA expression via modulation of Sp1 and may shed light on future studies of α-SYN associated PD pathogenesis.</p>

<p>A correlation between the abnormal cerebral glucose metabolism and the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been found in previous studies, suggesting that glucose alterations may be used to predict the histopathological diagnosis in AD. In this study, we investigated the dynamic changes of cerebral glucose uptake in vivo using MR glucose chemical exchange saturation transfer (glucoCEST) imaging in a rat model of AD with an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injection of amyloid Aβ-protein (25–35), confirmed by Morris water maze and Nissl staining. In total, 6 rats in the AD group and 6 rats in the control group that were given an injection of sterile normal saline were included. At 28 days after injection, all rats performed a 7.0 T MR exanimation, including glucoCEST, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and hippocampus magnetic resonance spectra (MRS), to detect the possible metabolic and structural changes in the rat brain. A significantly elevated brain glucoCEST signal in the brain of AD rats was observed, and a decreased brain glucose uptake was also explored during the progression of glucose infusion compared with those in rats of the control group. In addition, there is a significant positive correlation between glucoCEST enhancement (GCE) and myo-Inosito (Ins) in the AD group and the control group (P &lt; 0.05). A significantly reduced number of neurons in the cortex and hippocampus in AD rats combined with the significantly longer escape and a decreased number of crossings were verified at 28 days after Aβ25–35 injection by Nissl staining and Morris water maze, respectively. Our results indicated that an abnormal brain glucose mechanism in AD rats could be detected by glucoCEST imaging, suggesting a new method to explore the occurrence and progress of diabetes-related AD or dementia.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/67065">Mechanism for differential recruitment of orbitostriatal transmission during actions and outcomes following chronic alcohol exposure</a></h4>

Psychiatric disease often produces symptoms that have divergent effects on neural activity. For example, in drug dependence, dysfunctional value-based decision-making and compulsive-like actions have been linked to hypo- and hyper-activity of orbital frontal cortex (OFC)-basal ganglia circuits, respectively, however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that alcohol exposed mice have enhanced activity in OFC terminals in dorsal striatum (OFC-DS) associated with actions, but reduced activity of the same terminals during periods of outcome retrieval, corresponding with a loss of outcome control over decision-making. Disrupted OFC-DS terminal activity was due to a dysfunction of dopamine-type 1 receptors on spiny projection neurons (D1R SPNs) that resulted in increased retrograde endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling at OFC-D1R SPN synapses reducing OFC-DS transmission. Blocking CB1 receptors restored OFC-DS activity <i>in vivo</i> and rescued outcome-based control over decision-making. These findings demonstrate a circuit-, synapse-, and computation specific mechanism gating OFC activity in alcohol exposed mice.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66488">Kinetic analysis of ASIC1a delineates conformational signaling from proton-sensing domains to the channel gate</a></h4>

Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are neuronal Na<sup>+</sup> channels that are activated by a drop in pH. Their established physiological and pathological roles, involving fear behaviors, learning, pain sensation and neurodegeneration after stroke, make them promising targets for future drugs. Currently, the ASIC activation mechanism is not understood. Here we used voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF) combined with fluorophore-quencher pairing to determine the kinetics and direction of movements. We show that conformational changes with the speed of channel activation occur close to the gate and in more distant extracellular sites, where they may be driven by local protonation events. Further, we provide evidence for fast conformational changes in a pathway linking protonation sites to the channel pore, in which an extracellular interdomain loop interacts via aromatic residue interactions with the upper end of a transmembrane helix and would thereby open the gate.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65797">Stress resets ancestral heritable small RNA responses</a></h4>

Transgenerational inheritance of small RNAs challenges basic concepts of heredity. In <i>C. elegans</i> nematodes, small RNAs are transmitted across generations to establish a transgenerational memory trace of ancestral environments and distinguish self-genes from non-self-elements. Carryover of aberrant heritable small RNA responses was shown to be maladaptive and to lead to sterility. Here we show that various types of stress (starvation, high temperatures, and high osmolarity) induce resetting of ancestral small RNA responses and a genome-wide reduction in heritable small RNA levels. We found that mutants that are defective in various stress pathways exhibit irregular RNAi inheritance dynamics even in the absence of stress. Moreover, we discovered that resetting of ancestral RNAi responses is specifically orchestrated by factors that function in the p38 MAPK pathway and the transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf2. Stress-dependent termination of small RNA inheritance could protect from run-on of environment-irrelevant heritable gene regulation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65453">Genomic and healthcare dynamics of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission</a></h4>

Understanding the effectiveness of infection control methods in reducing and preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in healthcare settings is of high importance. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes for patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) across multiple geographically distinct UK hospitals, obtaining 173 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We integrated patient movement and staff location data into the analysis of viral genome data to understand spatial and temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We identified eight patient contact clusters (PCC) with significantly increased similarity in genomic variants compared to non-clustered samples. Incorporation of HCW location further increased the number of individuals within PCCs and identified additional links in SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathways. Patients within PCCs carried viruses more genetically identical to HCWs in the same ward location. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing integrated with patient and HCW movement data increases identification of outbreak clusters. This dynamic approach can support infection control management strategies within the healthcare setting.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64522">Topological signatures in regulatory network enable phenotypic heterogeneity in small cell lung cancer</a></h4>

Phenotypic (non-genetic) heterogeneity has significant implications for development and evolution of organs, organisms, and populations. Recent observations in multiple cancers have unravelled the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in driving metastasis and therapy recalcitrance. However, the origins of such phenotypic heterogeneity are poorly understood in most cancers. Here, we investigate a regulatory network underlying phenotypic heterogeneity in small cell lung cancer, a devastating disease with no molecular targeted therapy. Discrete and continuous dynamical simulations of this network reveal its multistable behavior that can explain co-existence of four experimentally observed phenotypes. Analysis of the network topology uncovers that multistability emerges from two teams of players that mutually inhibit each other but members of a team activate one another, forming a 'toggle switch' between the two teams. Deciphering these topological signatures in cancer-related regulatory networks can unravel their 'latent' design principles and offer a rational approach to characterize phenotypic heterogeneity in a tumor.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63886">A KDM5-Prospero transcriptional axis functions during early neurodevelopment to regulate mushroom body formation</a></h4>

Mutations in the lysine demethylase 5 (KDM5) family of transcriptional regulators are associated with intellectual disability, yet little is known regarding their spatiotemporal requirements or neurodevelopmental contributions. Utilizing the mushroom body (MB), a major learning and memory center within the <i>Drosophila </i>brain, we demonstrate that KDM5 is required within ganglion mother cells and immature neurons for proper axogenesis. Moreover, the mechanism by which KDM5 functions in this context is independent of its canonical histone demethylase activity. Using <i>in vivo </i>transcriptional and binding analyses, we identify a network of genes directly regulated by KDM5 that are critical modulators of neurodevelopment. We find that KDM5 directly regulates the expression of <i>prospero</i>, a transcription factor that we demonstrate is essential for MB morphogenesis. Prospero functions downstream of KDM5 and binds to approximately half of KDM5-regulated genes. Together, our data provide evidence for a KDM5-Prospero transcriptional axis that is essential for proper MB development.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63387">A conserved cell division protein directly regulates FtsZ dynamics in filamentous and unicellular actinobacteria</a></h4>

Bacterial cell division is driven by the polymerization of the GTPase FtsZ into a contractile structure, the so-called Z-ring. This essential process involves proteins that modulate FtsZ dynamics and hence the overall Z-ring architecture. Actinobacteria like <i>Streptomyces</i> and <i>Mycobacterium</i> lack known key FtsZ-regulators. Here we report the identification of SepH, a conserved actinobacterial protein that directly regulates FtsZ dynamics. We show that SepH is crucially involved in cell division in <i>Streptomyces venezuelae</i> and that it binds FtsZ via a conserved helix-turn-helix motif, stimulating the assembly of FtsZ protofilaments. Comparative <i>in vitro</i> studies using the SepH homolog from <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> further reveal that SepH can also bundle FtsZ protofilaments, indicating an additional Z-ring stabilizing function <i>in vivo</i>. We propose that SepH plays a crucial role at the onset of cytokinesis in actinobacteria by promoting the assembly of FtsZ filaments into division-competent Z-rings that can go on to mediate septum synthesis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63329">Cortical astrocytes independently regulate sleep depth and duration via separate GPCR pathways</a></h4>

Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, characterized by slow-wave electrophysiological activity, underlies several critical functions, including learning and memory. However, NREM sleep is heterogeneous, varying in duration, depth, and spatially across the cortex. While these NREM sleep features are thought to be largely independently regulated, there is also evidence that they are mechanistically coupled. To investigate how cortical NREM sleep features are controlled, we examined the astrocytic network, comprising a cortex-wide syncytium that influences population-level neuronal activity. We quantified endogenous astrocyte activity in mice over natural sleep and wake, then manipulated specific astrocytic G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways in vivo. We find that astrocytic Gi- and Gq-coupled GPCR signaling separately control NREM sleep depth and duration, respectively, and that astrocytic signaling causes differential changes in local and remote cortex. These data support a model in which the cortical astrocyte network serves as a hub for regulating distinct NREM sleep features.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63226">Neural representation of abstract task structure during generalization</a></h4>

Cognitive models in psychology and neuroscience widely assume that the human brain maintains an abstract representation of tasks. This assumption is fundamental to theories explaining how we learn quickly, think creatively, and act flexibly. However, neural evidence for a verifiably generative abstract task representation has been lacking. Here, we report an experimental paradigm that requires forming such a representation to act adaptively in novel conditions without feedback. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we observed that abstract task structure was represented within left mid-lateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral precuneus and inferior parietal cortex. These results provide support for the neural instantiation of the long-supposed abstract task representation in a setting where we can verify its influence. Such a representation can afford massive expansions of behavioral flexibility without additional experience, a vital characteristic of human cognition.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63207">Action detection using a neural network elucidates the genetics of mouse grooming behavior</a></h4>

Automated detection of complex animal behaviors remains a challenging problem in neuroscience, particularly for behaviors that consist of disparate sequential motions. Grooming is a prototypical stereotyped behavior and is often used as an endophenotype in psychiatric genetics. Here, we used mouse grooming behavior as an example and developed a general purpose neural network architecture capable of dynamic action detection at human observer-level performance and operating across dozens of mouse strains with high visual diversity. We provide insights into the amount of human annotated training data that are needed to achieve such performance. We surveyed grooming behavior in the open field in 2,457 mice across 62 strains, determined its heritable components, conducted GWAS to outline its genetic architecture, and performed PheWAS to link human psychiatric traits through shared underlying genetics. Our general machine learning solution that automatically classifies complex behaviors in large datasets will facilitate systematic studies of behavioral mechanisms.

Objectives
Patients with established Parkinson's disease (PD) display differences in peripheral blood markers of immune function, including leukocyte differential counts, compared with controls. These differences may be useful biomarkers to predict PD and may shed light on pathogenesis. We sought to identify whether peripheral immune dysregulation was associated with increased risk of subsequent PD diagnosis.


Methods
We examined the relationship between incident PD, baseline differential leukocyte count and other blood markers of acute inflammation in UK Biobank (UKB), a longitudinal cohort with ~500,000 participants. We used a range of sensitivity analyses and Mendelian randomization (MR) to further explore the nature of associations.


Results
After excluding individuals with comorbidities which could influence biomarkers of inflammation, 465 incident PD cases and 312,125 controls remained. Lower lymphocyte count was associated with increased risk of subsequent PD diagnosis (per 1‐SD decrease in lymphocyte count odds ratio [OR] = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07–1.32, padjusted = 0.01). There was some evidence that reductions in eosinophil counts, monocyte counts and C‐reactive protein (CRP) were associated with increased PD risk, and that higher neutrophil count was also associated. Only the association between lower lymphocyte count and increased PD risk remained robust to sensitivity analyses. MR suggested that the effect of lower lymphocyte count on PD risk may be causal (per 1‐SD decrease in lymphocyte count; ORMR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01–1.18, p = 0.02).


Interpretation
We provide converging evidence from observational analyses in UKB and MR that lower lymphocyte count is associated with an increased risk of subsequent PD. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:803–812

Objective
Perinatal intracranial hemorrhage (pICH) is a rare event that occurs during the fetal/neonatal period with potentially devastating neurological outcome. However, the etiology of pICH is frequently hard to depict. We investigated the role of rare genetic variations in unexplained cases of pICH.


Methods
We performed whole‐exome sequencing (WES) in fetuses and term neonates with otherwise unexplained pICH and their parents. Variant causality was determined according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria, consistency between suggested genes and phenotypes, and mode of inheritance.


Results
Twenty‐six probands (25 families) were included in the study (9 with a prenatal diagnosis and 17 with a postnatal diagnosis). Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) was the most common type of hemorrhage (n = 16, 62%), followed by subpial (n = 4, 15%), subdural (n = 4, 15%), and parenchymal (n = 2, 8%) hemorrhage. Causative/likely causative variants were found in 4 subjects from 3 of the 25 families (12%) involving genes related to the brain microenvironment (COL4A1, COL4A2, and TREX‐1). Additionally, potentially causative variants were detected in genes related to coagulation (GP1BA, F11, Von Willebrand factor [VWF], FGA, and F7; n = 4, 16%). A potential candidate gene for phenotypic expansion related to microtubular function (DNAH5) was identified in 1 case (4%). Fifty‐five percent of the variants were inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Overall, these findings showed a monogenic cause for pICH in 12% to 32% of the families.


Interpretation
Our findings reveal a clinically significant diagnostic yield of WES in apparently idiopathic pICH and support the use of WES in the evaluation of these cases. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:813–822

Objective
The aim of the current study was to evaluate the utility of evoked potentials as a biomarker of cortical function in Rett syndrome (RTT). As a number of disease‐modifying therapeutics are currently under development, there is a pressing need for biomarkers to objectively and precisely assess the effectiveness of these treatments.


Method
Yearly visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were acquired from individuals with RTT, aged 2 to 37 years, and control participants across 5 sites as part of the Rett Syndrome and Related Disorders Natural History Study. Baseline and year 1 data, when available, were analyzed and the repeatability of the results was tested. Two syndrome‐specific measures from the Natural History Study were used for evaluating the clinical relevance of the VEP and AEP parameters.


Results
At the baseline study, group level comparisons revealed reduced VEP and AEP amplitude in RTT compared to control participants. Further analyses within the RTT group indicated that this reduction was associated with RTT‐related symptoms, with greater severity associated with lower VEP and AEP amplitude. In participants with RTT, VEP and AEP amplitude was also negatively associated with age. Year 1 follow‐up data analyses yielded similar findings and evidence of repeatability of EPs at the individual level.


Interpretation
The present findings indicate the promise of evoked potentials (EPs) as an objective measure of disease severity in individuals with RTT. Our multisite approach demonstrates potential research and clinical applications to provide unbiased assessment of disease staging, prognosis, and response to therapy. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:790–802

Objective
This study was undertaken to assess the impact of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies on the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).


Methods
We retrospectively collected data of PwMS with suspected or confirmed COVID‐19. All the patients had complete follow‐up to death or recovery. Severe COVID‐19 was defined by a 3‐level variable: mild disease not requiring hospitalization versus pneumonia or hospitalization versus intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. We evaluated baseline characteristics and MS therapies associated with severe COVID‐19 by multivariate and propensity score (PS)‐weighted ordinal logistic models. Sensitivity analyses were run to confirm the results.


Results
Of 844 PwMS with suspected (n = 565) or confirmed (n = 279) COVID‐19, 13 (1.54%) died; 11 of them were in a progressive MS phase, and 8 were without any therapy. Thirty‐eight (4.5%) were admitted to an ICU; 99 (11.7%) had radiologically documented pneumonia; 96 (11.4%) were hospitalized.
After adjusting for region, age, sex, progressive MS course, Expanded Disability Status Scale, disease duration, body mass index, comorbidities, and recent methylprednisolone use, therapy with an anti‐CD20 agent (ocrelizumab or rituximab) was significantly associated (odds ratio [OR] = 2.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18–4.74, p = 0.015) with increased risk of severe COVID‐19. Recent use (&lt;1 month) of methylprednisolone was also associated with a worse outcome (OR = 5.24, 95% CI = 2.20–12.53, p = 0.001). Results were confirmed by the PS‐weighted analysis and by all the sensitivity analyses.


Interpretation
This study showed an acceptable level of safety of therapies with a broad array of mechanisms of action. However, some specific elements of risk emerged. These will need to be considered while the COVID‐19 pandemic persists. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:780–789

In this work, we describe the association of a novel homozygous VPS11 variant with adult‐onset generalized dystonia, providing a detailed clinical report and biological evidence of disease mechanism. Vps11 is a subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex, which promotes the fusion of late endosomes and autophagosomes with the lysosome. Functional studies on mutated fibroblasts showed marked lysosomal and autophagic abnormalities, which improved after overexpression of the wild type Vps11 protein. In conclusion, a deleterious VPS11 variant, damaging the autophagic and lysosomal pathways, is the probable genetic cause of a novel form of generalized dystonia. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:834–839

Objective
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is still burdened by high mortality in a subset of patients, such as those affected by hematological malignancies. The aim of this study was to analyze the safety and carry out preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of polyomavirus JC (JCPyV)‐specific T cell therapy in a cohort of hematological patients with PML.


Methods
Between 2014 and 2019, 9 patients with a diagnosis of “definite PML” according to the 2013 consensus who were showing progressive clinical deterioration received JCPyV‐specific T cells. Cell lines were expanded from autologous or allogenic peripheral blood mononuclear cells by stimulation with JCPyV antigen‐derived peptides.


Results
None of the patients experienced treatment‐related adverse events. In the evaluable patients, an increase in the frequency of circulating JCPyV‐specific lymphocytes was observed, with a decrease or clearance of JCPyV viral load in cerebrospinal fluid. In responsive patients, transient appearance of punctate areas of contrast enhancement within, or close to, PML lesions was observed, which was interpreted as a sign of immune control and which regressed spontaneously without the need for steroid treatment. Six of 9 patients achieved PML control, with 5 alive and in good clinical condition at their last follow‐up.


Interpretation
Among other novel treatments, T cell therapy is emerging as a viable treatment option in patients with PML, particularly for those not amenable to restoration of specific immunity. Neurologists should be encouraged to refer PML patients to specialized centers to allow access to this treatment strategy. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:769–779

The Mediator multiprotein complex functions as a regulator of RNA polymerase II–catalyzed gene transcription. In this study, exome sequencing detected biallelic putative disease‐causing variants in MED27, encoding Mediator complex subunit 27, in 16 patients from 11 families with a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome. Patient phenotypes are highly homogeneous, including global developmental delay, intellectual disability, axial hypotonia with distal spasticity, dystonic movements, and cerebellar hypoplasia.

Objective
The objective of this study was to evaluate patients with ganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibody (gAChR‐Ab) positive autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy using a multimodal testing protocol to characterize their full clinical phenotype and explore biomarkers to quantify immunotherapy response.


Methods
We conducted a cohort study of 13 individuals (7 women, 21–69 years of age) with autonomic failure and gAChR‐Ab &gt;100 pM identified between 2005 and 2019. From 2018, all patients were longitudinally assessed with cardiovascular, pupillary, urinary, sudomotor, lacrimal and salivary testing, and Composite Autonomic Symptom Score (COMPASS‐31) autonomic symptom questionnaires. The orthostatic intolerance ratio was calculated by dividing change in systolic blood pressure over time tolerated on head‐up tilt. Eleven patients received immunotherapy.


Results
At first assessment, all 13 patients had cardiovascular and pupillary impairments, 7 of 8 had postganglionic sudomotor dysfunction, 9 of 11 had urinary retention and xeropthalmia, and 6 of 8 had xerostomia. After immunotherapy, there were significant improvements in orthostatic intolerance ratio (33.3 [17.8–61.3] to 5.2 [1.4–8.2], p = 0.007), heart rate response to deep breathing (1.5 [0.0–3.3] to 4.5 [3.0–6.3], p = 0.02), pupillary constriction to light (12.0 [5.5–18.0] to 19.0 [10.6–23.8]%, p = 0.02), saliva production (0.01 [0.01–0.05] to 0.08 [0.02–0.20] g/min, p = 0.03), and COMPASS‐31 scores (52 to 17, p = 0.03). Orthostatic intolerance ratio correlated with autonomic symptoms at baseline (r = 0.841, p = 0.01) and following immunotherapy (r = 0.889, p = 0.02). Immunofluorescence analyses of skin samples from a patient 32 years after disease onset showed loss of nerve fibers supplying the dermal autonomic adnexa and epidermis, with clear improvements following immunotherapy.


Interpretation
Patients with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy demonstrated objective evidence of widespread sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic failure, with significant improvements after immunotherapy. Quantitative autonomic biomarkers should be used to define initial deficits, guide therapeutic decisions, and document treatment response. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:753–768

Objective
Discovery of a novel antibody would enable diagnosis and early treatment of autoimmune encephalitis. The aim was to discover a novel antibody targeting a synaptic receptor and characterize the pathogenic mechanism.


Method
We screened for unknown antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from autoimmune encephalitis patients. Samples with reactivity to rat brain sections and no reactivity to conventional antibody tests underwent further processing for antibody discovery, using immunoprecipitation to primary neuronal cells, mass‐spectrometry analysis, an antigen‐binding assay on an antigen‐overexpressing cell line, and an electrophysiological assay with cultured hippocampal neurons.


Results
Two patients had a novel antibody against CaVα2δ (voltage‐gated calcium channel alpha‐2/delta subunit). The patient samples stained neuropils of the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cortex in rat brain sections and bound to a CaVα2δ‐overexpressing cell line. Knockdown of CaVα2δ expression in cultured neurons turned off the immunoreactivity of the antibody from the patients to the neurons. The patients were associated with preceding meningitis or neuroendocrine carcinoma and responded to immunotherapy. In cultured neurons, the antibody reduced neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals by interfering with tight coupling of calcium channels and exocytosis.


Interpretation
Here, we discovered a novel autoimmune encephalitis associated with anti‐CaVα2δ antibody. Further analysis of the antibody in autoimmune encephalitis might promote early diagnosis and treatment. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:740–752

Objective
Neurology residency program websites often serve as the initial face of a program for prospective residents early in the application process. We evaluated adult neurology residency program websites to determine their comprehensiveness to identify areas for improvement.


Methods
A list of adult neurology residency programs in the United States was compiled using information on the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) and Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) websites. A total of 24 website criteria covering educational, recruitment, and compensation content were assessed for comprehensiveness. Programs’ website comprehensiveness was compared based on geographic location, program affiliation (community and/or academic), program size, and program/hospital Doximity and U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings.


Results
A total of 153 US adult neurology residency program websites were evaluated. Fewer than one‐half of program websites were accessible with a direct link from either FREIDA or ERAS. The number of residency program websites reporting each content criterion varied greatly. Mean percentage of overall website comprehensiveness among neurology residency programs was 65.9%. Northeast location, academic affiliation, larger programs, and top‐ranked programs on Doximity were associated with greater program website comprehensiveness.


Interpretation
There is opportunity for all neurology residency programs to improve their websites to provide prospective applicants with a more informed and comprehensive perspective of programs during the application process. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:637–642

Objective
Approximately 50% of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex develop infantile spasms, a sudden onset epilepsy syndrome associated with poor neurological outcomes. An increased burden of tubers confers an elevated risk of infantile spasms, but it remains unknown whether some tuber locations confer higher risk than others. Here, we test whether tuber location and connectivity are associated with infantile spasms.


Methods
We segmented tubers from 123 children with (n = 74) and without (n = 49) infantile spasms from a prospective observational cohort. We used voxelwise lesion symptom mapping to test for an association between spasms and tuber location. We then used lesion network mapping to test for an association between spasms and connectivity with tuber locations. Finally, we tested the discriminability of identified associations with logistic regression and cross‐validation as well as statistical mediation.


Results
Tuber locations associated with infantile spasms were heterogenous, and no single location was significantly associated with spasms. However, &gt;95% of tuber locations associated with spasms were functionally connected to the globi pallidi and cerebellar vermis. These connections were specific compared to tubers in patients without spasms. Logistic regression found that globus pallidus connectivity was a stronger predictor of spasms (odds ratio [OR] = 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10–3.50, p = 0.02) than tuber burden (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 0.90–3.04, p = 0.11), with a mean receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.73 (±0.1) during repeated cross‐validation.


Interpretation
Connectivity between tuber locations and the bilateral globi pallidi is associated with infantile spasms. Our findings lend insight into spasm pathophysiology and may identify patients at risk. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:726–739

Objective
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of unknown etiology. Although the prevalent view regards a CD4+‐lymphocyte autoimmune reaction against myelin at the root of the disease, recent studies propose autoimmunity as a secondary reaction to idiopathic brain damage. To gain knowledge about this possibility we investigated the presence of axonal and myelinic morphological alterations, which could implicate imbalance of axon‐myelin units as primary event in MS pathogenesis.


Methods
Using high resolution imaging histological brain specimens from patients with MS and non‐neurological/non‐MS controls, we explored molecular changes underpinning imbalanced interaction between axon and myelin in normal appearing white matter (NAWM), a region characterized by normal myelination and absent inflammatory activity.


Results
In MS brains, we detected blister‐like swellings formed by myelin detachment from axons, which were substantially less frequently retrieved in non‐neurological/non‐MS controls. Swellings in MS NAWM presented altered glutamate receptor expression, myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) distribution, and lipid biochemical composition of myelin sheaths. Changes in tethering protein expression, widening of nodes of Ranvier and altered distribution of sodium channels in nodal regions of otherwise normally myelinated axons were also present in MS NAWM. Finally, we demonstrate a significant increase, compared with controls, in citrullinated proteins in myelin of MS cases, pointing toward biochemical modifications that may amplify the immunogenicity of MS myelin.


Interpretation
Collectively, the impaired interaction of myelin and axons potentially leads to myelin disintegration. Conceptually, the ensuing release of (post‐translationally modified) myelin antigens may elicit a subsequent immune attack in MS. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:711–725

Objective
Diagnosing autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) is difficult in patients with less fulminant diseases such as epilepsy. However, recognition is important, as patients require immunotherapy. This study aims to identify antibodies in patients with focal epilepsy of unknown etiology, and to create a score to preselect patients requiring testing.


Methods
In this prospective, multicenter cohort study, adults with focal epilepsy of unknown etiology, without recognized AIE, were included, between December 2014 and December 2017, and followed for 1 year. Serum, and if available cerebrospinal fluid, were analyzed using different laboratory techniques. The ACES score was created using factors favoring an autoimmune etiology of seizures (AES), as determined by multivariate logistic regression. The model was externally validated and evaluated using the Concordance (C) statistic.


Results
We included 582 patients, with median epilepsy duration of 8 years (interquartile range = 2–18). Twenty patients (3.4%) had AES, of whom 3 had anti–leucine‐rich glioma inactivated 1, 3 had anti–contactin‐associated protein‐like 2, 1 had anti–N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor, and 13 had anti–glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay concentrations &gt;10,000IU/ml). Risk factors for AES were temporal magnetic resonance imaging hyperintensities (odds ratio [OR] = 255.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 19.6–3332.2, p &lt; 0.0001), autoimmune diseases (OR = 13.31, 95% CI = 3.1–56.6, p = 0.0005), behavioral changes (OR 12.3, 95% CI = 3.2–49.9, p = 0.0003), autonomic symptoms (OR = 13.3, 95% CI = 3.1–56.6, p = 0.0005), cognitive symptoms (OR = 30.6, 95% CI = 2.4–382.7, p = 0.009), and speech problems (OR = 9.6, 95% CI = 2.0–46.7, p = 0.005). The internally validated C statistic was 0.95, and 0.92 in the validation cohort (n = 128). Assigning each factor 1 point, an antibodies contributing to focal epilepsy signs and symptoms (ACES) score ≥ 2 had a sensitivity of 100% to detect AES, and a specificity of 84.9%.


Interpretation
Specific signs point toward AES in focal epilepsy of unknown etiology. The ACES score (cutoff ≥ 2) is useful to select patients requiring antibody testing. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:698–710

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26009?af=R">The Effect of SMN Gene Dosage on ALS Risk and Disease Severity</a></h4>

Objective
The role of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) gene in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is unclear, with several conflicting reports. A decisive result on this topic is needed, given that treatment options are available now for SMN deficiency.


Methods
In this largest multicenter case control study to evaluate the effect of SMN1 and SMN2 copy numbers in ALS, we used whole genome sequencing data from Project MinE data freeze 2. SMN copy numbers of 6,375 patients with ALS and 2,412 controls were called from whole genome sequencing data, and the reliability of the calls was tested with multiplex ligation‐dependent probe amplification data.


Results
The copy number distribution of SMN1 and SMN2 between cases and controls did not show any statistical differences (binomial multivariate logistic regression SMN1 p = 0.54 and SMN2 p = 0.49). In addition, the copy number of SMN did not associate with patient survival (Royston‐Parmar; SMN1 p = 0.78 and SMN2 p = 0.23) or age at onset (Royston‐Parmar; SMN1 p = 0.75 and SMN2 p = 0.63).


Interpretation
In our well‐powered study, there was no association of SMN1 or SMN2 copy numbers with the risk of ALS or ALS disease severity. This suggests that changing SMN protein levels in the physiological range may not modify ALS disease course. This is an important finding in the light of emerging therapies targeted at SMN deficiencies. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:686–697

Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is a rare inherited prion disease characterized by sleep, autonomic, and motor disturbances. Neuro‐ophthalmological abnormalities have been reported at the onset of disease, although not further characterized. We analyzed video recordings of eye movements of 6 patients with FFI from 3 unrelated kindreds, seen within 6 months from the onset of illness. Excessive saccadic intrusions were the most prominent findings. In patients with severe insomnia, striking saccadic intrusions are an early diagnostic clue for FFI. The fact that the thalamus is the first structure affected in FFI also suggests its role in the control of steady fixation. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:823–827

Objective
Limbic encephalitis (LE) comprises a spectrum of inflammatory changes in affected brain structures including the presence of autoantibodies and lymphoid cells. However, the potential of distinct lymphocyte subsets alone to elicit key clinicopathological sequelae of LE potentially inducing temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with chronic spontaneous seizures and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is unresolved.


Methods
Here, we scrutinized pathogenic consequences emerging from CD8+ T cells targeting hippocampal neurons by recombinant adeno‐associated virus‐mediated expression of the model‐autoantigen ovalbumin (OVA) in CA1 neurons of OT‐I/RAG1−/− mice (termed "OVA‐CD8+ LE model").


Results
Viral‐mediated antigen transfer caused dense CD8+ T cell infiltrates confined to the hippocampal formation starting on day 5 after virus transduction. Flow cytometry indicated priming of CD8+ T cells in brain‐draining lymph nodes preceding hippocampal invasion. At the acute model stage, the inflammatory process was accompanied by frequent seizure activity and impairment of hippocampal memory skills. Magnetic resonance imaging scans at day 7 of the OVA‐CD8+ LE model revealed hippocampal edema and blood–brain barrier disruption that converted into atrophy until day 40. CD8+ T cells specifically targeted OVA‐expressing, SIINFEKL‐H‐2Kb–positive CA1 neurons and caused segmental apoptotic neurodegeneration, astrogliosis, and microglial activation. At the chronic model stage, mice exhibited spontaneous recurrent seizures and persisting memory deficits, and the sclerotic hippocampus was populated with CD8+ T cells escorted by NK cells.


Interpretation
These data indicate that a CD8+ T‐cell–initiated attack of distinct hippocampal neurons is sufficient to induce LE converting into TLE‐HS. Intriguingly, the role of CD8+ T cells exceeds neurotoxic effects and points to their major pathogenic role in TLE following LE. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:666–685

Objective
Patients with traumatic brain injury who fail to obey commands after sedation‐washout pose one of the most significant challenges for neurological prognostication. Reducing prognostic uncertainty will lead to more appropriate care decisions and ensure provision of limited rehabilitation resources to those most likely to benefit. Bedside markers of covert residual cognition, including speech comprehension, may reduce this uncertainty.


Methods
We recruited 28 patients with acute traumatic brain injury who were 2 to 7 days sedation‐free and failed to obey commands. Patients heard streams of isochronous monosyllabic words that built meaningful phrases and sentences while their brain activity via electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. In healthy individuals, EEG activity only synchronizes with the rhythm of phrases and sentences when listeners consciously comprehend the speech. This approach therefore provides a measure of residual speech comprehension in unresponsive patients.


Results
Seventeen and 16 patients were available for assessment with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) at 3 months and 6 months, respectively. Outcome significantly correlated with the strength of patients’ acute cortical tracking of phrases and sentences (r &gt; 0.6, p &lt; 0.007), quantified by inter‐trial phase coherence. Linear regressions revealed that the strength of this comprehension response (beta = 0.603, p = 0.006) significantly improved the accuracy of prognoses relative to clinical characteristics alone (eg, Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS], computed tomography [CT] grade).


Interpretation
A simple, passive, auditory EEG protocol improves prognostic accuracy in a critical period of clinical decision making. Unlike other approaches to probing covert cognition for prognostication, this approach is entirely passive and therefore less susceptible to cognitive deficits, increasing the number of patients who may benefit.

Objective
Severe complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) include arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) in adults and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Whether stroke is a frequent complication of pediatric SARS‐CoV‐2 is unknown. This study aimed to determine the proportion of pediatric SARS‐CoV‐2 cases with ischemic stroke and the proportion of incident pediatric strokes with SARS‐CoV‐2 in the first 3 months of the pandemic in an international cohort.


Methods
We surveyed 61 international sites with pediatric stroke expertise. Survey questions included: numbers of hospitalized pediatric (≤ 18 years) patients with SARS‐CoV‐2; numbers of incident neonatal and childhood ischemic strokes; frequency of SARS‐CoV‐2 testing for pediatric patients with stroke; and numbers of stroke cases positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 from March 1 to May 31, 2020.


Results
Of 42 centers with SARS‐CoV‐2 hospitalization numbers, 8 of 971 (0.82%) pediatric patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 had ischemic strokes. Proportions of stroke cases positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 from March to May 2020 were: 1 of 108 with neonatal AIS (0.9%), 0 of 33 with neonatal cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT; 0%), 6 of 166 with childhood AIS (3.6%), and 1 of 54 with childhood CSVT (1.9%). However, only 30.5% of neonates and 60% of children with strokes were tested for SARS‐CoV‐2. Therefore, these proportions represent 2.9, 0, 6.1, and 3.0% of stroke cases tested for SARS‐CoV‐2. Seven of 8 patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 had additional established stroke risk factors.


Interpretation
As in adults, pediatric stroke is an infrequent complication of SARS‐CoV‐2, and SARS‐CoV‐2 was detected in only 4.6% of pediatric patients with ischemic stroke tested for the virus. However, &lt; 50% of strokes were tested. To understand the role of SARS‐CoV‐2 in pediatric stroke better, SARS‐CoV‐2 testing should be considered in pediatric patients with stroke as the pandemic continues. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:657–665

Voluntary ethanol consumption was assessed following short‐ and long‐term abstinence after adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure. * Intermittent vapor ethanol exposure during adolescence induces sexually divergent changes in ethanol consumption in adulthood. Long‐term changes in open field behavior were observed in male and female C57BL/6J mice.

Abstract
With alcohol readily accessible to adolescents, its consumption leads to many adverse effects, including impaired learning, attention, and behavior. Adolescents report higher rates of binge drinking compared to adults. They are also more prone to substance use disorder in adulthood due to physiological changes during the adolescent developmental period. We used C57BL/6J male and female mice to investigate the long‐lasting impact of binge ethanol exposure during adolescence on voluntary ethanol intake and open field behavior during later adolescence (Experiment 1) and during emerging adulthood (Experiment 2). The present set of experiments were divided into four stages: (1) adolescent intermittent vapor inhalation exposure, (2) abstinence, (3) voluntary ethanol intake, and (4) open field behavioral testing. During adolescence, male and female mice were exposed to air or ethanol using intermittent vapor inhalation from postnatal day (PND) 28–42. Following this, mice underwent short‐term abstinence from PND 43–49 (Experiment 1) or protracted abstinence from PND 43–69 (Experiment 2). Beginning on PND 50–76 or PND 70–97, mice were assessed for intermittent voluntary ethanol consumption using a two‐bottle choice drinking procedure over 28 days. Male adolescent ethanol‐exposed mice showed increased ethanol consumption following short‐term abstinence and following protracted abstinence. In contrast, female mice showed no changes in ethanol consumption following short‐term abstinence and decreased ethanol consumption following protracted abstinence. There were modest changes in open field behavior following voluntary ethanol consumption in both experiments. These data demonstrate a sexually divergent shift in ethanol consumption following binge ethanol exposure during adolescence and differences in open field behavior. These results highlight sex‐dependent vulnerability to developing substance use disorders in adulthood.

<p>by Ji Hyun Bak, Min Hyeok Kim, Lei Liu, Changbong Hyeon</p>

Chromosomes are giant chain molecules organized into an ensemble of three-dimensional structures characterized with its genomic state and the corresponding biological functions. Despite the strong cell-to-cell heterogeneity, the cell-type specific pattern demonstrated in high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data hints at a valuable link between structure and function, which makes inference of chromatin domains (CDs) from the pattern of Hi-C a central problem in genome research. Here we present a unified method for analyzing Hi-C data to determine spatial organization of CDs over multiple genomic scales. By applying statistical physics-based clustering analysis to a polymer physics model of the chromosome, our method identifies the CDs that best represent the global pattern of correlation manifested in Hi-C. The multi-scale intra-chromosomal structures compared across different cell types uncover the principles underlying the multi-scale organization of chromatin chain: (i) Sub-TADs, TADs, and meta-TADs constitute a robust hierarchical structure. (ii) The assemblies of compartments and TAD-based domains are governed by different organizational principles. (iii) Sub-TADs are the common building blocks of chromosome architecture. Our physically principled interpretation and analysis of Hi-C not only offer an accurate and quantitative view of multi-scale chromatin organization but also help decipher its connections with genome function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gQ73MGkr-xs" width="1" />

<p>by Hong Seo Lim, Peng Qiu</p>

With the rapid advances of various single-cell technologies, an increasing number of single-cell datasets are being generated, and the computational tools for aligning the datasets which make subsequent integration or meta-analysis possible have become critical. Typically, single-cell datasets from different technologies cannot be directly combined or concatenated, due to the innate difference in the data, such as the number of measured parameters and the distributions. Even datasets generated by the same technology are often affected by the batch effect. A computational approach for aligning different datasets and hence identifying related clusters will be useful for data integration and interpretation in large scale single-cell experiments. Our proposed algorithm called JSOM, a variation of the Self-organizing map, aligns two related datasets that contain similar clusters, by constructing two maps—low-dimensional discretized representation of datasets–that jointly evolve according to both datasets. Here we applied the JSOM algorithm to flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. The resulting JSOM maps not only align the related clusters in the two datasets but also preserve the topology of the datasets so that the maps could be used for further analysis, such as clustering.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kcdFzy3ulfI" width="1" />

Objective
Blood tests to monitor disease activity, attack severity, or treatment impact in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) have not been developed. This study investigated the relationship between serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP) concentration and NMOSD activity and assessed the impact of inebilizumab treatment.


Methods
N‐MOmentum was a prospective, multicenter, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized clinical trial, in adults with NMOSD. sGFAP levels were measured by single‐molecule arrays (SIMOA) in 1260 serial and attack‐related samples from 215 N‐MOmentum participants (92% aquaporin 4‐immunoglobulin G‐seropositive) and in control samples (from healthy donors and patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis).


Results
At baseline, 62 participants (29%) exhibited high sGFAP concentrations (≥170 pg/mL; ≥2 standard deviations above healthy donor mean concentration) and were more likely to experience an adjudicated attack than participants with lower baseline concentrations (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 3.09 [1.6–6.1], p = 0.001). Median (interquartile range [IQR]) concentrations increased within 1 week of an attack (baseline: 168.4 [128.9–449.7] pg/mL; attack: 2160.1 [302.7–9455.0] pg/mL; p = 0.0015) and correlated with attack severity (median fold change from baseline (FC) [IQR], minor attacks: 1.06 [0.9–7.4]; major attacks: 34.32 [8.7–107.5]; p = 0.023). This attack‐related increase in sGFAP occurred primarily in placebo‐treated participants (FC: 20.2 [4.4–98.3]; p = 0.001) and was not observed in inebilizumab‐treated participants (FC: 1.1 [0.8–24.6]; p &gt; 0.05). Five participants (28%) with elevated baseline sGFAP reported neurological symptoms leading to non‐adjudicated attack assessments.


Interpretation
sGFAP may serve as a biomarker of NMOSD activity, attack risk, and treatment effects.

We used intracellular recordings from six thalamic nuclei and compartmental models to investigate the properties of rebound bursts in first order (FO) and higher order (HO) nuclei and the implications of burst properties for thalamocortical transmission and oscillatory bursting. We found that:

Bursts had distinct properties in FO neurons: dLGN had bursts with few spikes/burst (S; figure shows averages) and relatively long latencies to the first spike (L; in ms); bursts in vMGB and VP had shorter latencies, but bursts in VP had more spikes/burst. HO cells had consistent burst properties across sensory modalities; on average, HO neurons had more spikes per burst and longer latencies than FO.
The number of spikes/burst and latency determine different release probabilities and the effectiveness of transmission at thalamocortical synapses.
The latency to burst limits the oscillatory frequency of rebound bursting to about 15 Hz in most FO neurons, and to 10 Hz or less in many HO cells.








Abstract
Thalamic neurons fire spikes in two modes, burst and tonic. The function of burst firing is unclear, but the evidence suggests that bursts are more effective at activating cortical cells, and that post‐inhibition rebound bursting contributes to thalamocortical oscillations during sleep. Bursts are considered stereotyped signals; however, there is limited evidence regarding how burst properties compare across thalamic nuclei of different functional or anatomical organization. Here we used whole‐cell patch clamp recordings and compartmental modeling: to investigate the properties of bursts in six sensory thalamic nuclei, to study the mechanisms that can lead to different burst properties, and to assess the implications of different burst properties for thalamocortical transmission and oscillatory functions. We found that bursts in higher order cells on average had higher number of spikes and longer latency to the first spike. Additionally, burst features in first order neurons were determined by sensory modality. Shifting the voltage‐dependence and density of the T‐channel conductance in a compartmental model replicates the burst properties from the intracellular recordings, pointing to molecular mechanisms that can generate burst diversity. Furthermore, the model predicts that bursts with higher number of spikes will drastically reduce the effectiveness of thalamocortical transmission. In addition, the latency to burst limited the rebound oscillatory frequency in modeled cells. These results demonstrate that burst properties vary according to the thalamocortical hierarchy and with sensory modality. The findings imply that, while in burst mode, thalamocortical transmission and firing frequency will be determined by the number of spikes and latency to burst.

<p>In cerebrovascular networks, some vertices are more connected to each other
than with the rest of the vasculature, defining a community structure. Here, we
introduce a class of model networks built by rewiring Random Regular Graphs,
which enables to reproduce this community structure and other topological
properties of cerebrovascular networks. We use these model networks to study
the global flow reduction induced by the removal of a single edge. We
analytically show that this global flow reduction can be expressed as a
function of the initial flow rate in the removed edge and of a topological
quantity, both of which display probability distributions following Cauchy
laws, i.e. with large tails. As a result, we show that the distribution of
blood flow reductions is strongly influenced by the community structure. In
particular, the probability of large flow reductions increases substantially
when the community structure is stronger, weakening the network resilience to
single capillary occlusions. We discuss the implications of these findings in
the context of Alzheimer's Disease, in which the importance of vascular
mechanisms, including capillary occlusions, is beginning to be uncovered.

<p>In this work, we investigate the universal representation capacity of the
Matrix Product States (MPS) from the perspective of boolean functions and
continuous functions. We show that MPS can accurately realize arbitrary boolean
functions by providing a construction method of the corresponding MPS structure
for an arbitrarily given boolean gate. Moreover, we prove that the function
space of MPS with the scale-invariant sigmoidal activation is dense in the
space of continuous functions defined on a compact subspace of the
$n$-dimensional real coordinate space $\mathbb{R^{n}}$. We study the relation
between MPS and neural networks and show that the MPS with a scale-invariant
sigmoidal function is equivalent to a one-hidden-layer neural network equipped
with a kernel function. We construct the equivalent neural networks for several
specific MPS models and show that non-linear kernels such as the polynomial
kernel which introduces the couplings between different components of the input
into the model appear naturally in the equivalent neural networks. At last, we
discuss the realization of the Gaussian Process (GP) with infinitely wide MPS
by studying their equivalent neural networks.

<p>Researching the conditions for the emergence of life -- not necessarily as it
is, but as it could be -- is one of the main goals of Artificial Life.
Artificial Chemistries are one of the most important tools in this endeavour,
as they allow us to investigate the process by which metabolisms capable of
self-reproduction and -- ultimately -- of evolving, might have emerged. While
previous work has shown promising results in this direction, it is still
unclear which are the fundamental properties of a chemical system that enable
emergent structures to arise. To this end, here we present an Artificial
Chemistry based on Combinatory Logic, a Turing-complete rewriting system, which
relies on a minimal set of possible reactions. Our experiments show that a
single run of this chemistry starting from a tabula rasa state discovers with
no external intervention a wide range of emergent structures, including
autopoietic structures that maintain their organisation unchanged, others that
grow recursively, and most notably, patterns that reproduce themselves,
duplicating their number on each cycle. All of these structures take the form
of recursive algorithms that acquire basic constituents from the environment
and decompose them in a process that is remarkably similar to biological
metabolisms.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08203">Computational timbre and tonal system similarity analysis of the music of Northern Myanmar-based Kachin compared to Xinjiang-based Uyghur ethnic groups. (arXiv:2103.08203v1 [cs.SD])</a></h4>

<p>The music of Northern Myanmar Kachin ethnic group is compared to the music of
western China, Xijiang based Uyghur music, using timbre and pitch feature
extraction and machine learning. Although separated by Tibet, the muqam
tradition of Xinjiang might be found in Kachin music due to myths of Kachin
origin, as well as linguistic similarities, e.g., the Kachin term 'makan' for a
musical piece. Extractions were performed using the apollon and COMSAR
(Computational Music and Sound Archiving) frameworks, on which the Ethnographic
Sound Recordings Archive (ESRA) is based, using ethnographic recordings from
ESRA next to additional pieces. In terms of pitch, tonal systems were compared
using Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM), which clearly clusters Kachin and
Uyghur musical pieces. This is mainly caused by the Xinjiang muqam music
showing just fifth and fourth, while Kachin pieces tend to have a higher fifth
and fourth, next to other dissimilarities. Also, the timbre features of
spectral centroid and spectral sharpness standard deviation clearly tells
Uyghur from Kachin pieces, where Uyghur music shows much larger deviations.
Although more features will be compared in the future, like rhythm or melody,
these already strong findings might introduce an alternative comparison
methodology of ethnic groups beyond traditional linguistic definitions.

<p>Biological neurons have adaptive nature and perform complex computations
involving the filtering of redundant information. Such processing is often
associated with Bayesian inference. Yet most common models of neural cells,
including biologically plausible, such as Hodgkin-Huxley or Izhikevich do not
possess predictive dynamics on the level of a single cell. The modern rules of
synaptic plasticity or interconnections weights adaptation also do not provide
grounding for the ability of neurons to adapt to the ever-changing input signal
intensity. While natural neuron synaptic growth is precisely controlled and
restricted by protein supply and recycling, weight correction rules such as
widely used STDP are efficiently unlimited in change rate and scale. In the
present article, we will introduce new mechanics of interconnection between
neuron firing rate homeostasis and weight change by means of STDP growth
bounded by abstract protein reserve, controlled by the intracellular
optimization algorithm. We will show, how these cellular dynamics help neurons
to filter out the intense signals to help neurons keep a stable firing rate. We
will also examine that such filtering does not affect the ability of neurons to
recognize the correlated inputs in unsupervised mode. Such an approach might be
used in the machine learning domain to improve the robustness of AI systems.

<p>What do humans do when confronted with a common challenge: we know where we
want to go but we are not yet sure the best way to get there, or even if we
can. This is the problem posed to agents during spatial navigation and
pathfinding, and its solution may give us clues about the more abstract domain
of planning in general. In this work, we model pathfinding behavior in a
continuous, explicitly exploratory paradigm. In our task, participants (and
agents) must coordinate both visual exploration and navigation within a
partially observable environment. Our contribution has three primary
components: 1) an analysis of behavioral data from 81 human participants in a
novel pathfinding paradigm conducted as an online experiment, 2) a proposal to
model prospective mental simulation during navigation as particle filtering,
and 3) an instantiation of this proposal in a computational agent. We show that
our model, Active Dynamical Prospection, demonstrates similar patterns of map
solution rate, path selection, and trial duration, as well as attentional
behavior (at both aggregate and individual levels) when compared with data from
human participants. We also find that both distal attention and delay prior to
first move (both potential correlates of prospective simulation) are predictive
of task performance.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07954">Contents, Contexts, and Basics of Contextuality. (arXiv:2103.07954v1 [math.PR])</a></h4>

<p>This is a non-technical introduction into theory of contextuality. More
precisely, it presents the basics of a theory of contextuality called
Contextuality-by-Default (CbD). One of the main tenets of CbD is that the
identity of a random variable is determined not only by its content (that which
is measured or responded to) but also by contexts, systematically recorded
conditions under which the variable is observed; and the variables in different
contexts possess no joint distributions. I explain why this principle has no
paradoxical consequences, and why it does not support the holistic "everything
depends on everything else" view. Contextuality is defined as the difference
between two differences: (1) the difference between content-sharing random
variables when taken in isolation, and (2) the difference between the same
random variables when taken within their contexts. Contextuality thus defined
is a special form of context-dependence rather than a synonym for the latter.
The theory applies to any empirical situation describable in terms of random
variables. Deterministic situations are trivially noncontextual in CbD, but
some of them can be described by systems of epistemic random variables, in
which random variability is replaced with epistemic uncertainty.
Mathematically, such systems are treated as if they were ordinary systems of
random variables.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07772">Heterogeneity in Neuronal Calcium Spike Trains based on Empirical Distance. (arXiv:2103.07772v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Statistical similarities between neuronal spike trains could reveal
significant information on complex underlying processing. In general, the
similarity between synchronous spike trains is somewhat easy to identify.
However, the similar patterns also potentially appear in an asynchronous
manner. However, existing methods for their identification tend to converge
slowly, and cannot be applied to short sequences. In response, we propose
Hellinger distance measure based on empirical probabilities, which we show to
be as accurate as existing techniques, yet faster to converge for synthetic as
well as experimental spike trains. Further, we cluster pairs of neuronal spike
trains based on statistical similarities and found two non-overlapping classes,
which could indicate functional similarities in neurons. Significantly, our
technique detected functional heterogeneity in pairs of neuronal responses with
the same performance as existing techniques, while exhibiting faster
convergence. We expect the proposed method to facilitate large-scale studies of
functional clustering, especially involving short sequences, which would in
turn identify signatures of various diseases in terms of clustering patterns.

<p>Recurrent neural networks are good at solving prediction problems. However,
finding a network that suits a problem is quite hard because their performance
is strongly affected by their architecture configuration. Automatic
architecture optimization methods help to find the most suitable design, but
they are not extensively adopted because of their high computational cost. In
this work, we introduce the Random Error Sampling-based Neuroevolution (RESN),
an evolutionary algorithm that uses the mean absolute error random sampling, a
training-free approach to predict the expected performance of an artificial
neural network, to optimize the architecture of a network. We empirically
validate our proposal on three prediction problems, and compare our technique
to training-based architecture optimization techniques and to neuroevolutionary
approaches. Our findings show that we can achieve state-of-the-art error
performance and that we reduce by half the time needed to perform the
optimization.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.619412">Echo Time Dependency of Local Activity Metrics of Resting-State Functional MRI</a></h4>

<p>Local activity metrics of resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI), such as the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), fractional ALFF (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and degree centrality (DC), are widely used to detect brain abnormalities based on signal fluctuations. Although signal changes with echo time (TE) have been widely studied, the effect of TE on local activity metrics has not been investigated. RS-fMRI datasets from 12 healthy subjects with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) were obtained with a four-echo gradient-echo-planar imaging pulse sequence with the following parameters: repetition time/TE1/TE2/TE3/TE4 = 2,000/13/30.93/48.86/66.79 ms. Six representative regions were selected for simulating the spatial feature of TE dependency of local activity metrics. Moreover, whole-brain local activity metrics were calculated from each echo dataset and compared between EO and EC conditions. Dice overlap coefficient (DOC) was then employed to calculate the overlap between the T maps. We found that all the local activity metrics displayed different TE dependency characteristics, while their overall change patterns were similar: an initial large change followed by a slow variation. The T maps for local activity metrics also varied greatly with TE. For ALFF, fALFF, ReHo, and DC, the DOCs for voxels in four TE datasets were 6.87, 0.73, 5.08, and 0.93%, respectively. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that local metrics are greatly dependent on TE. Therefore, TE should be carefully considered for the optimization of data acquisition and multi-center data analysis in RS-fMRI.</p>

<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most harmful forms of acute brain injury and predicted to be one of the three major neurological diseases that cause neurological disabilities by 2030. A series of secondary injury cascades often cause cognitive dysfunction of TBI patients leading to poor prognosis. However, there are still no effective intervention measures, which drive us to explore new therapeutic targets. In this process, the most part of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is ignored because its initial symptoms seemed not serious. Unfortunately, the ignored mTBI accounts for 80% of the total TBI, and a large part of the patients have long-term cognitive dysfunction. Iron deposition has been observed in mTBI patients and accompanies the whole pathological process. Iron accumulation may affect long-term cognitive dysfunction from three pathways: local injury, iron deposition induces tau phosphorylation, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles; neural cells death; and neural network damage, iron deposition leads to axonal injury by utilizing the iron sensibility of oligodendrocytes. Thus, iron overload and metabolism dysfunction was thought to play a pivotal role in mTBI pathophysiology. Cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons (CSF-cNs) located in the ependyma have bidirectional communication function between cerebral–spinal fluid and brain parenchyma, and may participate in the pathway of iron-induced cognitive dysfunction through projected nerve fibers and transmitted factor, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine, etc. The present review provides an overview of the metabolism and function of iron in mTBI, and to seek a potential new treatment target for mTBI with a novel perspective through combined iron and CSF-cNs.</p>

<p>As multielectrode array technology increases in popularity, accessible analytical tools become necessary. Simultaneous recordings from multiple neurons may produce huge amounts of information. Traditional tools based on classical statistics are either insufficient to analyze multiple spike trains or sophisticated and expensive in computing terms. In this communication, we put to the test the idea that AI algorithms may be useful to gather information about the effective connectivity of neurons in local nuclei at a relatively low computing cost. To this end, we decided to explore the capacity of the algorithm C5.0 to retrieve information from a large series of spike trains obtained from a simulated neuronal circuit with a known structure. Combinatory, iterative and recursive processes using C5.0 were built to examine possibilities of increasing the performance of a direct application of the algorithm. Furthermore, we tested the applicability of these processes to a reduced dataset obtained from original biological recordings with unknown connectivity. This was obtained in house from a mouse in vitro preparation of the spinal cord. Results show that this algorithm can retrieve neurons monosynaptically connected to the target in simulated datasets within a single run. Iterative and recursive processes can identify monosynaptic neurons and disynaptic neurons under favorable conditions. Application of these processes to the biological dataset gives clues to identify neurons monosynaptically connected to the target. We conclude that the work presented provides substantial proof of concept for the potential use of AI algorithms to the study of effective connectivity.</p>

<p>Rotating shifts (mostly 8- or 12-h) are common among nurses to ensure continuity of care. This scheduling system encompasses several adverse health and performance consequences. One of the most injurious effects of night-time shift work is the deterioration of sleep patterns due to both circadian rhythm disruption and increased sleep homeostatic pressure. Sleep problems lead to secondary effects on other aspects of wellbeing and cognitive functioning, increasing the risk of errors and workplace accidents. A wide range of interventions has been proposed to improve the sleep quality of nurses and promote an increase in attention levels. In recent years, particular attention has been paid to individual and environmental factors mediating the subjective ability to cope with sleep deprivation during the night shift. Given the predictive role of these factors on the negative impact of a night shift, an individualized intervention could represent an effective countermeasure by ensuring suitable management of shift schedules. Therefore, the aims of this mini-review are to: (a) provide an updated overview of the literature on sleep problems in night shift nurses and their adverse consequences; and (b) critically analyze the psychosocial factors that mediate the negative impact of shift work with the ultimate goal of defining an effective countermeasure based on an individualized approach.</p>

<p>Neuroscience research has shown that meditation practices have effects on brain structure and function. However, few studies have combined information on the effects on structure and function in the same sample. Long-term daily meditation practice produces repeated activity of specific brain networks over years of practice, which may induce lasting structural and functional connectivity (FC) changes within relevant circuits. The aim of our study was therefore to identify differences in FC during the resting state between 23 Sahaja Yoga Meditation experts and 23 healthy participants without meditation experience. Seed-based FC analysis was performed departing from voxels that had shown structural differences between these same participants. The contrast of connectivity maps yielded that meditators showed increased FC between the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex but reduced FC between the left insula and the bilateral mid-cingulate as well as between the right angular gyrus and the bilateral precuneus/cuneus cortices. It thus appears that long-term meditation practice increases direct FC between ventral and dorsal frontal regions within brain networks related to attention and cognitive control and decreases FC between regions of these networks and areas of the default mode network.</p>

<p>In modern computational modeling, neuroscientists need to reproduce long-lasting activity of large-scale networks, where neurons are described by highly complex mathematical models. These aspects strongly increase the computational load of the simulations, which can be efficiently performed by exploiting parallel systems to reduce the processing times. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) devices meet this need providing on desktop High Performance Computing. In this work, authors describe a novel Granular layEr Simulator development implemented on a multi-GPU system capable of reconstructing the cerebellar granular layer in a 3D space and reproducing its neuronal activity. The reconstruction is characterized by a high level of novelty and realism considering axonal/dendritic field geometries, oriented in the 3D space, and following convergence/divergence rates provided in literature. Neurons are modeled using Hodgkin and Huxley representations. The network is validated by reproducing typical behaviors which are well-documented in the literature, such as the center-surround organization. The reconstruction of a network, whose volume is 600 × 150 × 1,200 μm<sup>3</sup> with 432,000 granules, 972 Golgi cells, 32,399 glomeruli, and 4,051 mossy fibers, takes 235 s on an Intel i9 processor. The 10 s activity reproduction takes only 4.34 and 3.37 h exploiting a single and multi-GPU desktop system (with one or two NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU, respectively). Moreover, the code takes only 3.52 and 2.44 h if run on one or two NVIDIA V100 GPU, respectively. The relevant speedups reached (up to ~38× in the single-GPU version, and ~55× in the multi-GPU) clearly demonstrate that the GPU technology is highly suitable for realistic large network simulations.</p>

<p>Neuropathological diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are frequently associated with impaired differentiation of the oligodendroglial cell lineage and subsequent alterations in white matter structure and dynamics. Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21, is the most common genetic cause for cognitive impairments and intellectual disability (ID) and is associated with a reduction in the number of neurons and oligodendrocytes, as well as with hypomyelination and astrogliosis. Recent studies mainly focused on neuronal development in DS and underestimated the role of glial cells as pathogenic players. This also relates to C21ORF91, a protein considered a key modulator of aberrant CNS development in DS. We investigated the role of C21orf91 ortholog in terms of oligodendrogenesis and myelination using database information as well as through cultured primary oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPCs). Upon modulation of C21orf91 gene expression, we found this factor to be important for accurate oligodendroglial differentiation, influencing their capacity to mature and to myelinate axons. Interestingly, C21orf91 overexpression initiates a cell population coexpressing astroglial- and oligodendroglial markers indicating that elevated C21orf91 expression levels induce a gliogenic shift towards the astrocytic lineage reflecting non-equilibrated glial cell populations in DS brains.</p>

<p>Purkinje cells are critical for the function of cerebellum. The degeneration of Purkinje cells leads to defects in motion control. We have found that Purkinje cells specifically express Ankfy1 protein during development and in adult. This protein seems to play minor functions during development as Ankfy1 knockout mice appear normal till adult. However, at 9-month-old, knockout mice showed abnormal cerebellum with reduced vermis size and developed defective motor function. Further investigation demonstrated that the cerebellum of the mutant mouse has lost most of its Purkinje cells, while other cerebellar cells remained largely normal. Our data suggested that the Ankfy1 might be important for the maintenance of cerebellar Purkinje cells.</p>

<p>Background: The human auditory nerve contains 30,000 nerve fibers (NFs) that relay complex speech information to the brain with spectacular acuity. How speech is coded and influenced by various conditions is not known. It is also uncertain whether human nerve signaling involves exclusive proteins and gene manifestations compared with that of other species. Such information is difficult to determine due to the vulnerable, “esoteric,” and encapsulated human ear surrounded by the hardest bone in the body. We collected human inner ear material for nanoscale visualization combining transmission electron microscopy (TEM), super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM), and RNA-scope analysis for the first time. Our aim was to gain information about the molecular instruments in human auditory nerve processing and deviations, and ways to perform electric modeling of prosthetic devices.</p><p>Material and Methods: Human tissue was collected during trans-cochlear procedures to remove petro-clival meningioma after ethical permission. Cochlear neurons were processed for electron microscopy, confocal microscopy (CM), SR-SIM, and high-sensitive in situ hybridization for labeling single mRNA transcripts to detect ion channel and transporter proteins associated with nerve signal initiation and conductance.</p><p>Results: Transport proteins and RNA transcripts were localized at the subcellular level. Hemi-nodal proteins were identified beneath the inner hair cells (IHCs). Voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) were expressed in the spiral ganglion (SG) and axonal initial segments (AISs). Nodes of Ranvier (NR) expressed Nav1.6 proteins, and encoding genes critical for inter-cellular coupling were disclosed.</p><p>Discussion: Our results suggest that initial spike generators are located beneath the IHCs in humans. The first NRs appear at different places. Additional spike generators and transcellular communication may boost, sharpen, and synchronize afferent signals by cell clusters at different frequency bands. These instruments may be essential for the filtering of complex sounds and may be challenged by various pathological conditions.</p>

<p>Guidance errors and unrefined neural map configurations appear linked to certain neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism spectrum disorders. Deficits in specific multisensory tasks that require midbrain processing are highly predictive of cognitive and behavioral phenotypes associated with such syndromes. The lateral cortex of the inferior colliculus (LCIC) is a shell region of the mesencephalon that integrates converging information from multiple levels and modalities. Mature LCIC sensory maps are discretely-organized, mimicking its compartmental micro-organization. Intermittent modular domains receive patchy somatosensory connections, while inputs of auditory origin terminate in the encompassing extramodular matrix.Eph-ephrin signaling mechanisms instruct comparable topographic arrangements in a variety of other systems. Whether Eph-ephrin interactions also govern the assembly of LCIC multimodal maps remains unaddressed. Previously, we identified EphA4 and ephrin-B2 as key mediators, with overlapping expression patterns that align with emerging LCIC modules. Here, we implicate another member of this guidance family, ephrin-B3, and quantify its transient expression with respect to neurochemically-defined LCIC compartments. Multiple-labeling studies in GAD67-GFP knock-in mice reveal extramodular ephrin-B3 expression, complementary to that of EphA4 and ephrin-B2. This distinctive pattern sharpens over the early postnatal period (birth to P8), prior to ephrin-B3 downregulation once multimodal LCIC inputs are largely segregated (P12). Channel-specific sampling of LCIC ROIs show ephrin-B3 signal periodicities that are out-of-phase with glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD;modular marker) signal fluctuations, and match calretinin (CR) waveforms (matrix marker). Taken together, the guidance mosaic registry with emerging LCIC compartments and its interfacing afferent streams suggest a prominent role for Eph-ephrins in ordering behaviorally significant multisensory midbrain networks.</p>

<p>The reverse transsulfuration pathway has emerged as a central hub that integrates the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids and redox homeostasis. Transsulfuration involves the transfer of sulfur from homocysteine to cysteine. Cysteine serves as the precursor for several sulfur-containing molecules, which play diverse roles in cellular processes. Recent evidence shows that disruption of the flux through the pathway has deleterious consequences. In this review article, I will discuss the actions and regulation of the reverse transsulfuration pathway and its links to other metabolic pathways, which are disrupted in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The potential nodes of therapeutic intervention are also discussed, which may pave the way for the development of novel treatments.</p>

<p>Objective: People with neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) have an increased risk of epilepsy. However, most studies investigating the risk of seizures in people with NCDs are limited to those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD), and those who developed dementia after age 65 years. A knowledge gap exists regarding factors associated with development of epilepsy in people with younger-onset NCD, and those with non-AD and non-VD dementia subtypes. In this study, we aimed to identify the factors associated with the development of epilepsy in people with younger-onset NCDs of varied etiologies, the majority of whom had symptom onset prior to age 65 years.</p><p>Participants and Methods: This was a retrospective study reviewing the medical records of consecutive people admitted with cognitive impairment to a tertiary neuropsychiatry unit between 1 January 2004 and 30 April 2019. People diagnosed with primary NCDs were included in the analysis. The prevalence and characteristics of epilepsy were described. The factors associated with developing epilepsy were identified in a binary logistic regression model.</p><p>Results: A total of 427 people were included. One hundred fourteen had Alzheimer's disease, 104 frontotemporal dementia, 51 vascular dementia, 69 movement disorder-associated dementia, and 89 unspecified NCD. The median age on admission was 59 years (range 33–86) and 75.2% (n = 321/427) had young-onset NCD with onset before 65 years of age. 40/427 (9.4%) people had epilepsy, and epilepsy onset clustered between 2 years before and 6 years after the onset of cognitive decline in 80% (n = 32/40). The most frequent seizure type was focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure (35%, n = 14/40). Most of the people (94.7%, n = 36/38) achieved seizure freedom with one or two antiseizure medications. People with unspecified NCD (compared to frontotemporal dementia and movement disorder-associated dementia, age of onset of NCDs  ≤50 years, and current smoking status were independently associated with higher risk of developing epilepsy.</p><p>Conclusion: Epilepsy is common in people with younger-onset NCDs, and a high index of suspicion is warranted particularly for those with unspecified subtype and smoking status. Smoking reduction or cessation should be further investigated as a potentially modifiable factor for risk reduction.</p>

<p>Introduction: White matter degeneration may contribute to clinical symptoms of parkinsonism.</p><p>Objective: We used fixel-based analysis (FBA) to compare the extent and patterns of white matter degeneration in different parkinsonian syndromes—including idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).</p><p>Methods: This is a retrospective interpretation of prospectively acquired data of patients recruited in previous studies during 2008 and 2019. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired on a 3-Tesla scanner (diffusion weighting b = 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>–applied along either 64 or 30 non-collinear directions) from 53 patients with PD (men/women: 29/24; mean age: 65.06 ± 5.51 years), 47 with MSA (men/women: 20/27; mean age: 63.00 ± 7.19 years), and 50 with PSP men/women: 20/30; mean age: 65.96 ± 3.14 years). Non-parametric permutation tests were used to detect intergroup differences in fixel-related indices—including fiber density, fiber cross-section, and their combination.</p><p>Results: Patterns of white matter degeneration were significantly different between PD and atypical parkinsonisms (MSA and PSP). Compared with patients with PD, those with MSA and PSP showed a more extensive white matter involvement—noticeably descending tracts from primary motor cortex to corona radiata and cerebral peduncle. Lesions of corpus callosum were specific to PSP and absent in both MSA and PD.</p><p>Discussion: FBA identified specific patterns of white matter changes in MSA and PSP patients compared to PD. Our results proved the utility of FBA in evaluation of implied biological processes of white matter changes in parkinsonism. Our study set the stage for future applications of this technique in patients with parkinsonian syndromes.</p>

<p>Beta-amyloid protein [Aβ(1-42)] plays an important role in the disease progress and pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Membrane properties and neuronal excitability are altered in the hippocampus of transgenic AD mouse models that overexpress amyloid precursor protein. Although gap junction hemichannels have been implicated in the early pathogenesis of AD, to what extent Pannexin channels contribute to Aβ(1-42)-mediated brain changes is not yet known. In this study we, therefore, investigated the involvement of Pannexin1 (Panx1) channels in Aβ-mediated changes of neuronal membrane properties and long-term potentiation (LTP) in an animal model of AD. We conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in CA1 pyramidal neurons 1 week after intracerebroventricular treatments of adult wildtype (wt) and Panx1 knockout (Panx1-ko) mice with either oligomeric Aβ(1-42), or control peptide. Panx1-ko hippocampi treated with control peptide exhibited increased neuronal excitability compared to wt. In addition, action potential (AP) firing frequency was higher in control Panx1-ko slices compared to wt. Aβ-treatment reduced AP firing frequency in both cohorts. But in Aβ-treated wt mice, spike frequency adaptation was significantly enhanced, when compared to control wt and to Aβ-treated Panx1-ko mice. Assessment of hippocampal LTP revealed deficits in Aβ-treated wt compared to control wt. By contrast, Panx1-ko exhibited LTP that was equivalent to LTP in control ko hippocampi. Taken together, our data show that in the absence of Pannexin1, hippocampi are more resistant to the debilitating effects of oligomeric Aβ. Both Aβ-mediated impairments in spike frequency adaptation and in LTP that occur in wt animals, are ameliorated in Panx1-ko mice. These results suggest that Panx1 contributes to early changes in hippocampal neuronal and synaptic function that are triggered by oligomeric Aβ.</p>

<p>The donepezil treatment is associated with improved cognitive performance in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and its clinical effectiveness is well-known. However, the impact of the donepezil treatment on the enhanced white matter connectivity in MCI is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the thalamo-cortical white matter (WM) connectivity and cortical thickness and gray matter (GM) volume changes in the cortical regions following donepezil treatment in patients with MCI using probabilistic tractography and voxel-based morphometry. Patients with MCI underwent magnetic resonance examinations before and after 6-month donepezil treatment. Compared with healthy controls, patients with MCI showed decreased WM connectivity of the thalamo-lateral prefrontal cortex, as well as reduced thickness in the medial/lateral orbitofrontal cortices (p &lt; 0.05). The thalamo-lateral temporal cortex connectivity in patients with MCI was negatively correlated with Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) (r = −0.76, p = 0.01). The average score of the Korean version of the mini-mental state examination (K-MMSE) in patients with MCI was improved by 7.9% after 6-months of donepezil treatment. However, the patterns of WM connectivity and brain volume change in untreated and treated patients were not significantly different from each other, resulting from multiple comparison corrections. These findings will be valuable in understanding the neurophysiopathological mechanism on MCI as a prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease in connection with brain functional connectivity and morphometric change.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66230">Prenatal methadone exposure disrupts behavioral development and alters motor neuron intrinsic properties and local circuitry</a></h4>

Despite the rising prevalence of methadone treatment in pregnant women with opioid use disorder, the effects of methadone on neurobehavioral development remain unclear. We developed a translational mouse model of prenatal methadone exposure (PME) that resembles the typical pattern of opioid use by pregnant women who first use oxycodone then switch to methadone maintenance pharmacotherapy, and subsequently become pregnant while maintained on methadone. We investigated the effects of PME on physical development, sensorimotor behavior, and motor neuron properties using a multidisciplinary approach of physical, biochemical, and behavioral assessments along with brain slice electrophysiology and in vivo magnetic resonance imaging. Methadone accumulated in the placenta and fetal brain, but methadone levels in offspring dropped rapidly at birth which was associated with symptoms and behaviors consistent with neonatal opioid withdrawal. PME produced substantial impairments in offspring physical growth, activity in an open field, and sensorimotor milestone acquisition. Furthermore, these behavioral alterations were associated with reduced neuronal density in the motor cortex and a disruption in motor neuron intrinsic properties and local circuit connectivity. The present study adds to the limited body of work examining PME by providing a comprehensive, translationally relevant characterization of how PME disrupts offspring physical and neurobehavioral development.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66097">Architecture and structural dynamics of the heteromeric GluK2/K5 kainate receptor</a></h4>

Kainate receptors (KARs) are L-glutamate-gated ion channels that regulate synaptic transmission and modulate neuronal circuits. KARs have strict assembly rules and primarily function as heteromeric receptors in the brain. A longstanding question is how KAR heteromer subunits organize and coordinate together to fulfill their signature physiological roles. Here we report structures of the GluK2/GluK5 heteromer in apo, antagonist-bound, and desensitized states. The receptor assembles with two copies of each subunit, ligand binding domains arranged as two heterodimers, and GluK5 subunits proximal to the channel. Strikingly, during desensitization GluK2 but not GluK5 subunits undergo major structural rearrangements to facilitate channel closure. We show how the large conformational differences between antagonist-bound and desensitized states are mediated by the linkers connecting the pore helices to the ligand-binding domains. This work presents the first KAR heteromer structure, reveals how its subunits are organized, and resolves how the heteromer can accommodate functionally-distinct closed channel structures.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65508">Seroconversion stages COVID19 into distinct pathophysiological states</a></h4>

COVID19 is a heterogeneous medical condition involving diverse underlying pathophysiological processes including hyperinflammation, endothelial damage, thrombotic microangiopathy, and end-organ damage. Limited knowledge about the molecular mechanisms driving these processes and lack of staging biomarkers hamper the ability to stratify patients for targeted therapeutics. We report here the results of a cross-sectional multi-omics analysis of hospitalized COVID19 patients revealing that seroconversion status associates with distinct underlying pathophysiological states. Low antibody titers associate with hyperactive T cells and NK cells, high levels of IFN alpha, gamma and lambda ligands, markers of systemic complement activation, and depletion of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets. Upon seroconversion, all of these processes are attenuated, observing instead increases in B cell subsets, emergency hematopoiesis, increased D-dimer, and hypoalbuminemia. We propose that seroconversion status could potentially be used as a biosignature to stratify patients for therapeutic intervention and to inform analysis of clinical trial results in heterogenous patient populations.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65228">Egr2 induction in SPNs of the ventrolateral striatum contributes to cocaine place preference in mice</a></h4>

Drug addiction develops due to brain-wide plasticity within neuronal ensembles, mediated by dynamic gene expression. Though the most common approach to identify such ensembles relies on immediate early gene expression, little is known of how the activity of these genes is linked to modified behavior observed following repeated drug exposure. To address this gap, we present a broad-to-specific approach, beginning with a comprehensive investigation of brain-wide cocaine-driven gene expression, through the description of dynamic spatial patterns of gene induction in subregions of the striatum, and finally address functionality of region-specific gene induction in the development of cocaine preference. Our findings reveal differential cell-type specific dynamic transcriptional recruitment patterns within two subdomains of the dorsal striatum following repeated cocaine exposure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that induction of the IEG <i>Egr2</i> in the ventrolateral striatum, as well as the cells within which it is expressed, are required for the development of cocaine seeking.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64670">The global burden of yellow fever</a></h4>

Yellow fever (YF) is a viral, vector-borne, haemorrhagic fever endemic in tropical regions of Africa and South America. The vaccine for YF is considered safe and effective, but intervention strategies need to be optimised; one of the tools for this is mathematical modelling. We refine and expand an existing modelling framework for Africa to account for transmission in South America. We fit to YF occurrence and serology data. We then estimate the subnational forces of infection for the entire endemic region. Finally, using demographic and vaccination data, we examine the impact of vaccination activities. We estimate that there were 109,000 (95% credible interval [CrI] [67,000–173,000]) severe infections and 51,000 (95% CrI [31,000–82,000]) deaths due to YF in Africa and South America in 2018. We find that mass vaccination activities in Africa reduced deaths by 47% (95% CrI [10%–77%]). This methodology allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination and illustrates the need for continued vigilance and surveillance of YF.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64250">Stretch-activated ion channels identified in the touch-sensitive structures of carnivorous Droseraceae plants</a></h4>

In response to touch, some carnivorous plants such as the Venus flytrap have evolved spectacular movements to capture animals for nutrient acquisition. However, the molecules that confer this sensitivity remain unknown. We used comparative transcriptomics to show that expression of three genes encoding homologs of the MscS-Like (MSL) and OSCA/TMEM63 family of mechanosensitive ion channels are localized to touch-sensitive trigger hairs of Venus flytrap. We focus here on the candidate with the most enriched expression in trigger hairs, the MSL homolog FLYCATCHER1 (FLYC1). We show that <i>FLYC1</i> transcripts are localized to mechanosensory cells within the trigger hair, transfecting <i>FLYC1</i> induces chloride-permeable stretch-activated currents in naïve cells, and transcripts coding for <i>FLYC1</i> homologs are expressed in touch-sensing cells of Cape sundew, a related carnivorous plant of the Droseraceae family. Our data suggest that the mechanism of prey recognition in carnivorous Droseraceae evolved by co-opting ancestral mechanosensitive ion channels to sense touch.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63877">Human Cytomegalovirus antagonizes activation of Fcγ receptors by distinct and synergizing modes of IgG manipulation</a></h4>

Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is endowed with multiple highly sophisticated immune evasion strategies. This includes the evasion from antibody mediated immune control by counteracting host Fc-gamma receptor (FcγR) mediated immune control mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). We have previously shown that HCMV avoids FcγR activation by concomitant expression of the viral Fc-gamma binding glycoproteins (vFcγRs) gp34 and gp68. We now show that gp34 and gp68 bind IgG simultaneously at topologically different Fcγ sites and achieve efficient antagonization of host FcγR activation by distinct but synergizing mechanisms. While gp34 enhances immune complex internalization, gp68 acts as inhibitor of host FcγR binding to immune complexes. In doing so, gp68 induces Fcγ accessibility to gp34 and simultaneously limits host FcγR recognition. The synergy of gp34 and gp68 is compelled by the interfering influence of excessive non-immune IgG ligands and highlights conformational changes within the IgG globular chains critical for antibody effector function.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63390">Ancient DNA reveals the lost domestication history of South American camelids in Northern Chile and across the Andes</a></h4>

The study of South American camelids and their domestication is a highly debated topic in zooarchaeology. Identifying the domestic species (alpaca and llama) in archaeological sites based solely on morphological data is challenging due to their similarity with respect to their wild ancestors. Using genetic methods also presents challenges due to the hybridization history of the domestic species, which are thought to have extensively hybridized following the Spanish conquest of South America that resulted in camelids slaughtered en-masse. In this study we generated mitochondrial genomes for 61 ancient South American camelids dated between 3,500 - 2,400 years before the present (Early Formative period) from two archaeological sites in Northern Chile (Tulán-54 and Tulán-85), as well as 66 modern camelid mitogenomes and 815 modern mitochondrial control region sequences from across South America. In addition, we performed osteometric analyses to differentiate big and small body size camelids. A comparative analysis of these data suggests that a substantial proportion of the ancient vicuña genetic variation has been lost since the Early Formative period as it is not present in modern specimens. Moreover, we propose a domestication hypothesis that includes an ancient guanaco population that no longer exists. Finally, we find evidence that interbreeding practices were widespread during the domestication process by the early camelid herders in the Atacama during the Early Formative period and predating the Spanish conquest.

<p>by Pascal P. Klamser, Pawel Romanczuk</p>

According to the <i>criticality hypothesis</i>, collective biological systems should operate in a special parameter region, close to so-called critical points, where the collective behavior undergoes a qualitative change between different dynamical regimes. Critical systems exhibit unique properties, which may benefit collective information processing such as maximal responsiveness to external stimuli. Besides neuronal and gene-regulatory networks, recent empirical data suggests that also animal collectives may be examples of self-organized critical systems. However, open questions about self-organization mechanisms in animal groups remain: Evolutionary adaptation towards a group-level optimum (group-level selection), implicitly assumed in the “criticality hypothesis”, appears in general not reasonable for fission-fusion groups composed of non-related individuals. Furthermore, previous theoretical work relies on non-spatial models, which ignore potentially important self-organization and spatial sorting effects. Using a generic, spatially-explicit model of schooling prey being attacked by a predator, we show first that schools operating at criticality perform best. However, this is not due to optimal response of the prey to the predator, as suggested by the “criticality hypothesis”, but rather due to the spatial structure of the prey school at criticality. Secondly, by investigating individual-level evolution, we show that strong spatial self-sorting effects at the critical point lead to strong selection gradients, and make it an evolutionary unstable state. Our results demonstrate the decisive role of spatio-temporal phenomena in collective behavior, and that individual-level selection is in general not a viable mechanism for self-tuning of unrelated animal groups towards criticality.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WZR0GkV1hEI" width="1" />

<p>by Denis A. Shah, Erick D. De Wolf, Pierce A. Paul, Laurence V. Madden</p>

Ensembling combines the predictions made by individual component base models with the goal of achieving a predictive accuracy that is better than that of any one of the constituent member models. Diversity among the base models in terms of predictions is a crucial criterion in ensembling. However, there are practical instances when the available base models produce highly correlated predictions, because they may have been developed within the same research group or may have been built from the same underlying algorithm. We investigated, via a case study on Fusarium head blight (FHB) on wheat in the U.S., whether ensembles of simple yet highly correlated models for predicting the risk of FHB epidemics, all generated from logistic regression, provided any benefit to predictive performance, despite relatively low levels of base model diversity. Three ensembling methods were explored: soft voting, weighted averaging of smaller subsets of the base models, and penalized regression as a stacking algorithm. Soft voting and weighted model averages were generally better at classification than the base models, though not universally so. The performances of stacked regressions were superior to those of the other two ensembling methods we analyzed in this study. Ensembling simple yet correlated models is computationally feasible and is therefore worth pursuing for models of epidemic risk.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vfgt9krjdr0" width="1" />

<p>by Akseli Niemelä, Artturi Koivuniemi</p>

Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase protein (LCAT) promotes the esterification reaction between cholesterol and phospholipid-derived acyl chains. Positive allosteric modulators have been developed to treat LCAT deficiencies and, plausibly, also cardiovascular diseases in the future. The mechanism of action of these compounds is poorly understood. Here computational docking and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were utilized to study the interactions between LCAT and the activating compounds. Results indicate that all drugs bind to the allosteric binding pocket in the membrane-binding domain in a similar fashion. The presence of the compounds in the allosteric site results in a distinct spatial orientation and sampling of the membrane-binding domain (MBD). The MBD’s different spatial arrangement plausibly affects the lid’s movement from closed to open state and <i>vice versa</i>, as suggested by steered molecular dynamics simulations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9wBB2aaHWyk" width="1" />

<p>by Julian Rossbroich, Daniel Trotter, John Beninger, Katalin Tóth, Richard Naud</p>

Short-term synaptic dynamics differ markedly across connections and strongly regulate how action potentials communicate information. To model the range of synaptic dynamics observed in experiments, we have developed a flexible mathematical framework based on a linear-nonlinear operation. This model can capture various experimentally observed features of synaptic dynamics and different types of heteroskedasticity. Despite its conceptual simplicity, we show that it is more adaptable than previous models. Combined with a standard maximum likelihood approach, synaptic dynamics can be accurately and efficiently characterized using naturalistic stimulation patterns. These results make explicit that synaptic processing bears algorithmic similarities with information processing in convolutional neural networks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/euFoONbqMvk" width="1" />

A forward genetic screening approach identified orf19.2500 as a gene controlling <i>Candida albicans</i> biofilm dispersal and biofilm detachment. Three-dimensional (3D) protein modeling and bioinformatics revealed that orf19.2500 is a conserved mitochondrial protein, structurally similar to, but functionally diverged from, the squalene/phytoene synthases family. The <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> orf19.2500 is distinguished by 3 evolutionarily acquired stretches of amino acid inserts, absent from all other eukaryotes except a small number of ascomycete fungi. Biochemical assays showed that orf19.2500 is required for the assembly and activity of the NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase Complex I (CI) of the respiratory electron transport chain (ETC) and was thereby named <i>NDU1</i>. <i>NDU1</i> is essential for respiration and growth on alternative carbon sources, important for immune evasion, required for virulence in a mouse model of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis, and for potentiating resistance to antifungal drugs. Our study is the first report on a protein that sets the <i>Candida</i>-like fungi phylogenetically apart from all other eukaryotes, based solely on evolutionary “gain” of new amino acid inserts that are also the functional hub of the protein.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/FrpEctA_VYw" width="1" />

Abstract
Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) shows neuronal death in cornu ammonis (CA)1, CA3, and CA4. It is known that granule cells and CA2 neurons survive and their axons, the mossy fibers (MF), lose their target cells in CA3 and CA4 and sprout to the granule cell layer and molecular layer. We examined in TLE patients and in a mouse epilepsy model, whether MF sprouting is directed to the dentate gyrus or extends to distant CA regions and whether sprouting is associated with death of target neurons in CA3 and CA4. In 319 TLE patients, HS was evaluated by Wyler grade and International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) types using immunohistochemistry against neuronal nuclei (NeuN). Synaptoporin was used to colocalize MF. In addition, transgenic Thy1‐eGFP mice were intrahippocampally injected with kainate and sprouting of eGFP‐positive MFs was analyzed together with immunocytochemistry for regulator of G‐protein signaling 14 (RGS14). In human HS Wyler III and IV as well as in ILAE 1, 2, and 3 specimens, we found synaptoporin‐positive axon terminals in CA2 and even in CA1, associated with the extent of granule cell dispersion. Sprouting was seen in cases with cell death of target neurons in CA3 and CA4 (classical severe HS ILAE type 1) but also without this cell death (atypical HS ILAE type 2). Similarly, in epileptic mice eGFP‐positive MFs sprouted to CA2 and beyond. The presence of MF terminals in the CA2 pyramidal cell layer and in CA1 was also correlated with the extent of granule cell dispersion. The similarity of our findings in human specimens and in the mouse model highlights the importance and opens up new chances of using translational approaches to determine mechanisms underlying TLE.

We labelled markers of cell division (PCNA), cell migration (DCX) and neuronal maturation (NeuN) in vocal control brain regions of male and female zebra finch brains at four different stages of song learning. Sex differences in the size of these regions emerged by the onset of song learning, and the rate of neurogenic processes varied across brain regions in a sex‐ and region‐specific manner.






Abstract
The brain regions that control the learning and production of song and other learned vocalizations in songbirds exhibit some of the largest sex differences in the brain known in vertebrates, and are associated with sex differences in singing behaviour. Song learning takes place through multiple stages: an early sensory phase when song models are memorized, followed by a sensorimotor phase in which auditory feedback is used to modify song output through subsong, plastic song, to adult crystalized song. However, how patterns of neurogenesis in these brain regions change through these learning stages, and differ between the sexes, is little explored. We collected brains from 63 young male and female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) over 4 stages of song learning. Using neurogenesis markers for cell division (PCNA), neuron migration (DCX), and mature neurons (NeuN) we demonstrate that there are sex‐specific changes in neurogenesis over song development that differ between the caudal motor pathway and anterior forebrain pathway of the vocal control circuit. In many of these regions sex differences emerged very early in development, by 25 days post hatch, at the beginning of song learning. The emergence of sex differences in other components of the system were more gradual and had specific trajectories depending on the brain region and its function. In conclusion, we found that sex differences occurred early and continued during song learning. Moreover, transitions from the different phases of song development do not seem to depend on large changes in neurogenesis in the vocal control areas measured.

<p>Routing plays a fundamental role in network applications, but it is
especially challenging in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). These are a kind of
mobile ad hoc networks made of e.g. (possibly, unmanned) vehicles and humans
where, despite a lack of continuous connectivity, data must be transmitted
while the network conditions change due to the nodes' mobility. In these
contexts, routing is NP-hard and is usually solved by heuristic "store and
forward" replication-based approaches, where multiple copies of the same
message are moved and stored across nodes in the hope that at least one will
reach its destination. Still, the existing routing protocols produce relatively
low delivery probabilities. Here, we genetically improve two routing protocols
widely adopted in DTNs, namely Epidemic and PRoPHET, in the attempt to optimize
their delivery probability. First, we dissect them into their fundamental
components, i.e., functionalities such as checking if a node can transfer data,
or sending messages to all connections. Then, we apply Genetic Improvement (GI)
to manipulate these components as terminal nodes of evolving trees. We apply
this methodology, in silico, to six test cases of urban networks made of
hundreds of nodes, and find that GI produces consistent gains in delivery
probability in four cases. We then verify if this improvement entails a
worsening of other relevant network metrics, such as latency and buffer time.
Finally, we compare the logics of the best evolved protocols with those of the
baseline protocols, and we discuss the generalizability of the results across
test cases.

<p>Deep neural networks unlocked a vast range of new applications by solving
tasks of which many were previouslydeemed as reserved to higher human
intelligence. One of the developments enabling this success was a boost
incomputing power provided by special purpose hardware, such as graphic or
tensor processing units. However,these do not leverage fundamental features of
neural networks like parallelism and analog state variables.Instead, they
emulate neural networks relying on computing power, which results in
unsustainable energyconsumption and comparatively low speed. Fully parallel and
analogue hardware promises to overcomethese challenges, yet the impact of
analogue neuron noise and its propagation, i.e. accumulation,
threatensrendering such approaches inept. Here, we analyse for the first time
the propagation of noise in paralleldeep neural networks comprising noisy
nonlinear neurons. We develop an analytical treatment for both,symmetric
networks to highlight the underlying mechanisms, and networks trained with back
propagation.We find that noise accumulation is generally bound, and adding
additional network layers does not worsenthe signal to noise ratio beyond this
limit. Most importantly, noise accumulation can be suppressed entirelywhen
neuron activation functions have a slope smaller than unity. We therefore
developed the frameworkfor noise of deep neural networks implemented in analog
systems, and identify criteria allowing engineers todesign noise-resilient
novel neural network hardware.

<p>We constructed a hippocampal formation (HPF)-inspired probabilistic
generative model (HPF-PGM) using the structure-constrained interface
decomposition method. By modeling brain regions with PGMs, this model is
positioned as a module that can be integrated as a whole-brain PGM. We discuss
the relationship between simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in
robotics and the findings of HPF in neuroscience. Furthermore, we survey the
modeling for HPF and various computational models, including brain-inspired
SLAM, spatial concept formation, and deep generative models. The HPF-PGM is a
computational model that is highly consistent with the anatomical structure and
functions of the HPF, in contrast to typical conventional SLAM models. By
referencing the brain, we suggest the importance of the integration of
egocentric/allocentric information from the entorhinal cortex to the
hippocampus and the use of discrete-event queues.

<p>Process monitoring based on neural networks is getting more and more
attention. Compared with classical neural networks, high-order neural networks
have natural advantages in dealing with heteroscedastic data. However,
high-order neural networks might bring the risk of overfitting and learning
both the key information from original data and noises or anomalies. Orthogonal
constraints can greatly reduce correlations between extracted features, thereby
reducing the overfitting risk. This paper proposes a novel fault detection
method called second-order component analysis (SCA). SCA rules out the
heteroscedasticity of pro-cess data by optimizing a second-order autoencoder
with orthogonal constraints. In order to deal with this constrained
optimization problem, a geometric conjugate gradient algorithm is adopted in
this paper, which performs geometric optimization on the combination of Stiefel
manifold and Euclidean manifold. Extensive experiments on the Tennessee-Eastman
benchmark pro-cess show that SCA outperforms PCA, KPCA, and autoencoder in
missed detection rate (MDR) and false alarm rate (FAR).

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07279">Patient-specific virtual spine straightening and vertebra inpainting: An automatic framework for osteoplasty planning. (arXiv:2103.07279v1 [cs.LG])</a></h4>

<p>Symptomatic spinal vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) often require
osteoplasty treatment. A cement-like material is injected into the bone to
stabilize the fracture, restore the vertebral body height and alleviate pain.
Leakage is a common complication and may occur due to too much cement being
injected. In this work, we propose an automated patient-specific framework that
can allow physicians to calculate an upper bound of cement for the injection
and estimate the optimal outcome of osteoplasty. The framework uses the patient
CT scan and the fractured vertebra label to build a virtual healthy spine using
a high-level approach. Firstly, the fractured spine is segmented with a
three-step Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Next, a per-vertebra
rigid registration to a healthy spine atlas restores its curvature. Finally, a
GAN-based inpainting approach replaces the fractured vertebra with an
estimation of its original shape. Based on this outcome, we then estimate the
maximum amount of bone cement for injection. We evaluate our framework by
comparing the virtual vertebrae volumes of ten patients to their healthy
equivalent and report an average error of 3.88$\pm$7.63\%. The presented
pipeline offers a first approach to a personalized automatic high-level
framework for planning osteoplasty procedures.

<p>The transition away from carbon-based energy sources poses several challenges
for the operation of electricity distribution systems. Increasing shares of
distributed energy resources (e.g. renewable energy generators, electric
vehicles) and internet-connected sensing and control devices (e.g. smart
heating and cooling) require new tools to support accurate, datadriven decision
making. Modelling the effect of such growing complexity in the electrical grid
is possible in principle using state-of-the-art power-power flow models. In
practice, the detailed information needed for these physical simulations may be
unknown or prohibitively expensive to obtain. Hence, datadriven approaches to
power systems modelling, including feedforward neural networks and
auto-encoders, have been studied to leverage the increasing availability of
sensor data, but have seen limited practical adoption due to lack of
transparency and inefficiencies on large-scale problems. Our work addresses
this gap by proposing a data- and knowledge-driven probabilistic graphical
model for energy systems based on the framework of graph neural networks
(GNNs). The model can explicitly factor in domain knowledge, in the form of
grid topology or physics constraints, thus resulting in sparser architectures
and much smaller parameters dimensionality when compared with traditional
machine-learning models with similar accuracy. Results obtained from a
real-world smart-grid demonstration project show how the GNN was used to inform
grid congestion predictions and market bidding services for a distribution
system operator participating in an energy flexibility market.

<p>Brain imaging technology is an important means to study brain diseases. The commonly used brain imaging technologies are fMRI and EEG. Clinical practice has shown that although fMRI is superior to EEG in observing the anatomical details of some diseases that are difficult to diagnose, its costs are prohibitive. In particular, more and more patients who use metal implants cannot use this technology. In contrast, EEG technology is easier to implement. Therefore, to break through the limitations of fMRI technology, we propose a brain imaging modality transfer framework, namely BMT-GAN, based on a generative adversarial network. The framework introduces a new non-adversarial loss to reduce the perception and style difference between input and output images. It also realizes the conversion from EEG modality data to fMRI modality data and provides comprehensive reference information of EEG and fMRI for radiologists. Finally, a qualitative and quantitative comparison with the existing GAN-based brain imaging modality transfer approaches demonstrates the superiority of our framework.</p>

Background<p>In recent years, imaging technologies have been rapidly evolving, with an emphasis on the characterization of brain structure changes and functional imaging in patients with autoimmune encephalitis. However, the neural basis of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis and its linked cognitive decline is unclear. Our research aimed to assess changes in the functional brain network in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and whether these changes lead to cognitive impairment.</p>Methods<p>Twenty-one anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients and 22 age-, gender-, and education status-matched healthy controls were assessed using resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning and neuropsychological tests, including the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD<sub>24</sub>), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). A functional brain network was constructed using fMRI, and the topology of the network parameters was analyzed using graph theory. Next, we extracted the aberrant topological parameters of the functional network as seeds and compared causal connectivity with the whole brain. Lastly, we explored the correlation of aberrant topological structures with deficits in cognitive performance.</p>Results<p>Relative to healthy controls, anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients exhibited decreased MoCA scores and increased HAMA and HAMD<sub>24</sub> scores (p &lt; 0.05). The nodal clustering coefficient and nodal local efficiency of the left insula (Insula_L) were significantly decreased in anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients (p &lt; 0.05 following Bonferroni correction). Moreover, anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients showed a weakened causal connectivity from the left insula to the left inferior parietal lobe (Parietal_Inf_L) compared to healthy controls. Conversely, the left superior parietal lobe (Parietal_sup_L) exhibited an enhanced causal connectivity to the left insula in anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients compared to controls. Unexpectedly, these alterations were not correlated with any neuropsychological test scores.</p>Conclusion<p>This research describes topological abnormalities in the functional brain network in anti-NMDAR encephalitis. These results will be conducive to understand the structure and function of the brain network of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and further explore the neuropathophysiological mechanisms.</p>

<p>Clinical responses to dopamine replacement therapy for individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) are often difficult to predict. We characterized changes in MDS-UPDRS motor factor scores resulting from a short-duration L-Dopa response (SDR), and investigated how the inter-subject clinical differences could be predicted from motor cortical magnetoencephalography (MEG). MDS-UPDRS motor factor scores and resting-state MEG recordings were collected during SDR from twenty individuals with a PD diagnosis. We used a novel subject-specific strategy based on linear support vector machines to quantify motor cortical oscillatory frequency profiles that best predicted medication state. Motor cortical profiles differed substantially across individuals and showed consistency across multiple data folds. There was a linear relationship between classification accuracy and SDR of lower limb bradykinesia, although this relationship did not persist after multiple comparison correction, suggesting that combinations of spectral power features alone are insufficient to predict clinical state. Factor score analysis of therapeutic response and novel subject-specific machine learning approaches based on subject-specific neuroimaging provide tools to predict outcomes of therapies for PD.</p>

Aim<p>The present work proposes the study of the neuromotor activity of the masseter-jaw-tongue articulation during diadochokinetic exercising to establish functional statistical relationships between surface Electromyography (sEMG), 3D Accelerometry (3DAcc), and acoustic features extracted from the speech signal, with the aim of characterizing Hypokinetic Dysarthria (HD). A database of multi-trait signals of recordings from an age-matched control and PD participants are used in the experimental study.</p>Hypothesis:<p>The main assumption is that information between sEMG and 3D acceleration, and acoustic features may be quantified using linear regression methods.</p>Methods<p>Recordings from a cohort of eight age-matched control participants (4 males, 4 females) and eight PD participants (4 males, 4 females) were collected during the utterance of a diadochokinetic exercise (the fast repetition of diphthong [aI]). The dynamic and acoustic absolute kinematic velocities produced during the exercises were estimated by acoustic filter inversion and numerical integration and differentiation of the speech signal. The amplitude distributions of the absolute kinematic and acoustic velocities (AKV and AFV) are estimated to allow comparisons in terms of Mutual Information.</p>Results<p>The regression results show the relationships between sEMG and dynamic and acoustic estimates. The projection methodology may help in understanding the basic neuromotor muscle activity regarding neurodegenerative speech in remote monitoring neuromotor and neurocognitive diseases using speech as the vehicular tool, and in the study of other speech-related disorders. The study also showed strong and significant cross-correlations between articulation kinematics, both for the control and the PD cohorts. The absolute kinematic variables presents an observable difference for the PD participants compared to the control group.</p>Conclusion<p>Kinematic distributions derived from acoustic analysis may be useful biomarkers toward characterizing HD in neuromotor disorders providing new insights into PD.</p>

<p>Face recognition is impaired in patients with prosopagnosia, which may occur as a side effect of neurosurgical procedures. Face selective regions on the ventral temporal cortex have been localized with electrical cortical stimulation (ECS), electrocorticography (ECoG), and functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI). This is the first group study using within-patient comparisons to validate face selective regions mapping, utilizing the aforementioned modalities. Five patients underwent surgical treatment of intractable epilepsy and joined the study. Subdural grid electrodes were implanted on their ventral temporal cortices to localize seizure foci and face selective regions as part of the functional mapping protocol. Face selective regions were identified in all patients with fMRI, four patients with ECoG, and two patients with ECS. From 177 tested electrode locations in the region of interest (ROI), which is defined by the fusiform gyrus and the inferior temporal gyrus, 54 face locations were identified by at least one modality in all patients. fMRI mapping showed the highest detection rate, revealing 70.4% for face selective locations, whereas ECoG and ECS identified 64.8 and 31.5%, respectively. Thus, 28 face locations were co-localized by at least two modalities, with detection rates of 89.3% for fMRI, 85.7% for ECoG and 53.6 % for ECS. All five patients had no face recognition deficits after surgery, even though five of the face selective locations, one obtained by ECoG and the other four by fMRI, were within 10 mm to the resected volumes. Moreover, fMRI included a quite large volume artifact on the ventral temporal cortex in the ROI from the anatomical structures of the temporal base. In conclusion, ECS was not sensitive in several patients, whereas ECoG and fMRI even showed activation within 10 mm to the resected volumes. Considering the potential signal drop-out in fMRI makes ECoG the most reliable tool to identify face selective locations in this study. A multimodal approach can improve the specificity of ECoG and fMRI, while simultaneously minimizing the number of required ECS sessions. Hence, all modalities should be considered in a clinical mapping protocol entailing combined results of co-localized face selective locations.</p>

<p>Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) is a diffusion model specifically designed for brain magnetic resonance imaging. Despite recent studies suggesting that NODDI modeling might be more sensitive to brain development than diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), these studies were limited to a relatively small age range and mainly based on the manually operated region of interest analysis. Therefore, this study applied NODDI to investigate brain development in a large sample size of 214 subjects ranging in ages from 0 to 14. The whole brain was automatically segmented into 122 regions. The maturation trajectory of each region was characterized by the time course of diffusion metrics and further quantified using nonlinear regression. The NODDI-derived metrics, neurite density index (NDI) and orientation dispersion index (ODI), increased with age. And these two metrics were superior to the DTI-derived metrics in SVM regression models of age. The NDI in white matter exhibited a more rapid growth than that in gray matter (including the cortex and deep nucleus). These diffusion indicators experienced conspicuous increases during early childhood and the growth speed slowed down in adolescence. Region-specific maturation patterns were described throughout the brain, including white matter, cortical and deep gray matter. These development patterns were evaluated and discussed on the basis of NODDI’s model assumptions. To summarize, this study verified the high sensitivity of NODDI to age over a crucial developmental period from newborn to adolescence. Moreover, the existing knowledge of brain development has been complemented, suggesting that NODDI has a potential capability in the investigation of brain development.</p>

<p>Motor learning is the process of updating motor commands in response to a trajectory error induced by a perturbation to the body or vision. The brain has a great capability to accelerate learning by increasing the sensitivity of the memory update to the perceived trajectory errors. Conventional theory suggests that the statistics of perturbations or the statistics of the experienced errors induced by the external perturbations determine the learning speeds. However, the potential effect of another type of error perception, a self-generated error as a result of motor command updates (i.e., an aftereffect), on the learning speeds has not been examined yet. In this study, we dissociated the two kinds of errors by controlling the perception of the aftereffect using a channel-force environment. One group experienced errors due to the aftereffect of the learning process, while the other did not. We found that the participants who perceived the aftereffect of the memory updates exhibited a significant decrease in error-sensitivity, whereas the participants who did not perceive the aftereffect did not show an increase or decrease in error-sensitivity. This suggests that the perception of the aftereffect of learning attenuated updating the motor commands from the perceived errors. Thus, both self-generated and externally induced errors may modulate learning speeds.</p>

<p>In this systematic review, we collected and analyzed literature works comparing self-reported fatigue and objectively-measured fatigue in individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) and in age-matched typically developing/typically developed (TD) controls (Healthy). The search was conducted on four electronic databases/platforms (PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus) using the key words “cerebral palsy” combined with “fatig<sup>*</sup>,” where the asterisk was used as a wildcard. As a critical appraisal tool, the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Quasi-Experimental Studies (2017) was used. A total of 22 studies passed the critical appraisal rating and were included in both narrative and quantitative analyses. The overall evidence quality of the findings was considered very good. Data of objectively-measured fatigue in performing maximal fatiguing tasks indicated lower fatigue levels in participants with CP, possibly due to their pathological inability to recruit highly fatigable muscle fibers. Highly trained individuals with CP and TD controls performing maximal fatiguing tasks seem to be an exception to this, as they exhibited similar levels of fatigue. In submaximal fatiguing tasks, including daily physical activities, either objectively-measured or self-reported fatigue was higher in participants with CP than in TD controls, indicating a lower ability for development of neurophysiological compensation for fatigue among participants with CP. Further studies on fatigue are needed to gain an insight into the multifold mechanisms of fatigue in individuals with CP. Understanding fatigue mechanisms could help in setting up strategies for effective intervention programs, with benefits in healthcare and improved quality of life of individuals with CP.</p><p>Systematic Review Registration: [PROSPERO 2019], identifier [CRD42019143524].</p>

<p>Neuromodulation by acetylcholine plays a vital role in shaping the physiology and functions of cerebral cortex. Cholinergic neuromodulation influences brain-state transitions, controls the gating of cortical sensory stimulus responses, and has been shown to influence the generation and maintenance of persistent activity in prefrontal cortex. Here we review our current understanding of the role of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in primate prefrontal cortex during its engagement in the performance of working memory tasks. We summarize the localization of muscarinic receptors in prefrontal cortex, review the effects of muscarinic neuromodulation on arousal, working memory and cognitive control tasks, and describe the effects of muscarinic M1 receptor stimulation and blockade on the generation and maintenance of persistent activity of prefrontal neurons encoding working memory representations. Recent studies describing the pharmacological effects of M1 receptors on prefrontal persistent activity demonstrate the heterogeneity of muscarinic actions and delineate unexpected modulatory effects discovered in primate prefrontal cortex when compared with studies in rodents. Understanding the underlying mechanisms by which muscarinic receptors regulate prefrontal cognitive control circuitry will inform the search of muscarinic-based therapeutic targets in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>Trans-regulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) transmembrane proteins has emerged as a novel type of synaptic molecular interaction in the last decade. Several studies on LRR–GPCR interactions have revealed their critical role in synapse formation and in establishing synaptic properties. Among them, LRR–GPCR interactions between extracellular LRR fibronectin domain-containing family proteins (Elfn1 and Elfn2) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are particularly interesting as they can affect a broad range of synapses through the modulation of signaling by glutamate, the principal excitatory transmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Elfn–mGluR interactions have been investigated in hippocampal, cortical, and retinal synapses. Postsynaptic Elfn1 in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex mediates the tonic regulation of excitatory input onto somatostatin-positive interneurons (INs) through recruitment of presynaptic mGluR7. In the retina, presynaptic Elfn1 binds to mGluR6 and is necessary for synapse formation between rod photoreceptor cells and rod-bipolar cells. The repertoire of binding partners for Elfn1 and Elfn2 includes all group III mGluRs (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8), and both Elfn1 and Elfn2 can alter mGluR-mediated signaling through trans-interaction. Importantly, both preclinical and clinical studies have provided support for the involvement of the Elfn1–mGluR7 interaction in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and epilepsy. In fact, Elfn1–mGluR7-associated disorders may reflect the altered function of somatostatin-positive interneuron inhibitory neural circuits, the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, and habenular circuits, highlighting the need for further investigation into this interaction.</p>

<p>We transduced mouse cortical astrocytes cultured from four litters of embryonic wildtype (WT) and connexin43 (Cx43) null mouse pups with lentiviral vector encoding hTERT and measured expression of astrocyte-specific markers up to passage 10 (p10). The immortalized cell lines thus generated (designated IWCA and IKOCA, respectively) expressed biomarkers consistent with those of neonatal astrocytes, including Cx43 from wildtype but not from Cx43-null mice, lack of Cx30, and presence of Cx26. AQP4, the water channel that is found in high abundance in astrocyte end-feet, was expressed at moderately high levels in early passages, and its mRNA and protein declined to low but still detectable levels by p10. The mRNA levels of the astrocyte biomarkers aldehyde dehydrogenase 1L1 (ALDH1L1), glutamine synthetase (GS) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) remained relatively constant during successive passages. GS protein expression was maintained while GFAP declined with cell passaging but was still detectable at p10. Both mRNA and protein levels of glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) declined with passage number. Immunostaining at corresponding times was consistent with the data from Western blots and provided evidence that these proteins were expressed at appropriate intracellular locations. Consistent with our goal of generating immortalized cell lines in which Cx43 was either functionally expressed or absent, IWCA cells were found to be well coupled with respect to intercellular dye transfer and similar to primary astrocyte cultures in terms of time course of junction formation, electrical coupling strength and voltage sensitivity. Moreover, barrier function was enhanced in co-culture of the IWCA cell line with bEnd.3 microvascular endothelial cells. In addition, immunostaining revealed oblate endogenous Cx43 gap junction plaques in IWCA that were similar in appearance to those plaques obtained following transfection of IKOCA cells with fluorescent protein tagged Cx43. Re-expression of Cx43 in IKOCA cells allows experimental manipulation of connexins and live imaging of interactions between connexins and other proteins. We conclude that properties of these cell lines resemble those of primary cultured astrocytes, and they may provide useful tools in functional studies by facilitating genetic and pharmacological manipulations in the context of an astrocyte-appropriate cellular environment.</p>

<p>Microglial cells regulate neural homeostasis by coordinating both immune responses and clearance of debris, and the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor for extracellular ATP plays a central role in both functions. The P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor is primarily known in microglial cells for its immune signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. However, the receptor also affects the clearance of extracellular and intracellular debris through modifications of lysosomal function, phagocytosis, and autophagy. In the absence of an agonist, the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor acts as a scavenger receptor to phagocytose material. Transient receptor stimulation induces autophagy and increases LC3-II levels, likely through calcium-dependent phosphorylation of AMPK, and activates microglia to an M1 or mixed M1/M2 state. We show an increased expression of Nos2 and Tnfa and a decreased expression of Chil3 (YM1) from primary cultures of brain microglia exposed to high levels of ATP. Sustained stimulation can reduce lysosomal function in microglia by increasing lysosomal pH and slowing autophagosome-lysosome fusion. P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor stimulation can also cause lysosomal leakage, and the subsequent rise in cytoplasmic cathepsin B activates the NLRP3 inflammasome leading to caspase-1 cleavage and IL-1β maturation and release. Support for P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor activation of the inflammasome following lysosomal leakage comes from data on primary microglia showing IL-1β release following receptor stimulation is inhibited by cathepsin B blocker CA-074. This pathway bridges endolysosomal and inflammatory roles and may provide a key mechanism for the increased inflammation found in age-dependent neurodegenerations characterized by excessive lysosomal accumulations. Regardless of whether the inflammasome is activated via this lysosomal leakage or the better-known K<sup>+</sup>-efflux pathway, the inflammatory impact of P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor stimulation is balanced between the autophagic reduction of inflammasome components and their increase following P2X<sub>7</sub>-mediated priming. In summary, the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor modulates clearance of extracellular debris by microglial cells and mediates lysosomal damage that can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. A better understanding of how the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor alters phagocytosis, lysosomal health, inflammation, and autophagy can lead to therapies that balance the inflammatory and clearance roles of microglial cells.</p>

<p>Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinase isoform 2 (ROCK2) is a member of the AGC family of serine/threonine kinases and an extensively studied regulator of actin-mediated cytoskeleton contractility. Over the past decade, new evidence has emerged that suggests ROCK2 regulates autophagy. Recent studies indicate that dysregulation of autophagy contributes to the development of misfolded tau aggregates among entorhinal cortex (EC) excitatory neurons in early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). While the accumulation of tau oligomers and fibrils is toxic to neurons, autophagy facilitates the degradation of these pathologic species and represents a major cellular pathway for tau disposal in neurons. ROCK2 is expressed in excitatory neurons and pharmacologic inhibition of ROCK2 can induce autophagy pathways. In this mini-review, we explore potential mechanisms by which ROCK2 mediates autophagy and actin dynamics and discuss how these pathways represent therapeutic avenues for Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p>Cerebrospinal fluid-touching neurons (CSF-cNs) exist in the region surrounding the central canal of the spinal cord, which locate in the adult neurogenic niche. Previous research showed that CSF-cNs expressed the molecular markers of immature neural cells in vivo. Here, we explored the potential of CSF-cNs as neural stem cell in intro. We first found that PKD2L1<sup>+</sup> CSF-cNs, isolating by FACS using the molecular marker PKD2L1 of CSF-cNs, expressed neural stem cells markers like Nestin, Sox2, and GFAP by immunofluorescence staining. PKD2L1<sup>+</sup> CSF-cNs were able to form neurospheres and passaged in vitro. Immunofluorescence staining showed that the neurospheres forming by PKD2L1<sup>+</sup> CSF-cNs also expressed neural stem cell markers Nestin, Sox2 and GFAP. The neurospheres expressed proliferation markers Ki67 and PCNA by immunofluorescence staining, indicating that the neurospheres forming by PKD2L1<sup>+</sup> CSF-cNs were proliferative. The neurospheres, forming by CSF-cNs, had the ability of differentiation into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Collectively, our data suggested that PKD2L1<sup>+</sup> CSF-cNs have the properties of neural stem cells in vitro and may provide a promising approach for the repair of spinal cord injury.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irrevocable neurodegenerative condition characterized by the presence of senile plaques comprising amassed β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles mainly comprising extremely phosphorylated Tau proteins. Recent studies have emphasized the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the development of AD. A number of miRNAs, namely, miR-200a-3p, miR-195, miR-338-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-132, miR-384, miR-339-5p, miR-135b, miR-425-5p, and miR-339-5p, have been shown to participate in the development of AD through interacting with BACE1. Other miRNAs might affect the inflammatory responses in the course of AD. Aberrant expression of several miRNAs in the plasma samples of AD subjects has been shown to have the aptitude for differentiation of AD subjects from healthy subjects. Finally, a number of AD-modifying agents affect miRNA profile in cell cultures or animal models. We have performed a comprehensive search and summarized the obtained data about the function of miRNAs in AD in the current review article.</p>

<p>Well-established literature indicates that older adults have poorer cerebral white matter integrity, as measured through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Age differences in DTI have been observed widely across white matter, although some tracts appear more sensitive to the effects of aging than others. Factors like APOE ε4 status and sex may contribute to individual differences in white matter integrity that also selectively impact certain tracts, and could influence DTI changes in aging. The present study explored the degree to which age, APOE ε4, and sex exerted global vs. tract specific effects on DTI metrics in cognitively healthy late middle-aged to older adults. Data from 49 older adults (ages 54–92) at two time-points separated by approximately 2.7 years were collected. DTI metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), were extracted from nine white matter tracts and global white matter. Results showed that across timepoints, FA and MD increased globally, with no tract-specific changes observed. Baseline age had a global influence on both measures, with increasing age associated with lower FA and higher MD. After controlling for global white matter FA, age additionally predicted FA for the genu, callosum body, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), and both anterior and posterior cingulum. Females exhibited lower global FA on average compared to males. In contrast, MD was selectively elevated in the anterior cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), for females compared to males. APOE ε4 status was not predictive of either measure. In summary, these results indicate that age and sex are associated with both global and tract-specific alterations to DTI metrics among a healthy older adult cohort. Older women have poorer white matter integrity compared to older men, perhaps related to menopause-induced metabolic changes. While age-related alterations to white matter integrity are global, there is substantial variation in the degree to which tracts are impacted, possibly as a consequence of tract anatomical variability. The present study highlights the importance of accounting for global sources of variation in DTI metrics when attempting to investigate individual differences (due to age, sex, or other factors) in specific white matter tracts.</p>

<p>Background and Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the different subtypes of anterior choroidal artery (AChoA) aneurysm based on a new classification and to analyze the risk factors according to individual endovascular treatment (EVT).</p><p>Methods: In the new classification, AChoA aneurysms are classified into independent type (I type) and dependent type (II type) based on the relationship between the AChoA and the aneurysm. II type aneurysms have three subtypes, IIa (neck), IIb (body), and IIc (direct). We retrospectively analyzed 52 cases of AChoA aneurysm treated in our center between 2015 to 2019. There were 13 (25.0%) I type aneurysms, 24 (46.2%) IIa aneurysms, 15 (28.8%) IIb aneurysms, and no IIc type; 28 cases had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. According to our preoperative EVT plan for the different subtypes: II type should achieve Raymond-Roy Occlusion Class 1 (RROC 1) where possible. To protect the AChoA, it is best to preserve the neck of the IIa type aneurysms (RROC 2), and RROC 3 is enough for IIb type.</p><p>Results: Ten asymptomatic cases with minimal aneurysms were treated conservatively. Of the other cases, 42 were treated with individualized EVT (26 with a simple coil, 6 with balloon-assisted coiling, 7 with stent-assisted coiling, and 3 by flow diverter. Different subtypes had different RROC (Z = 14.026, P = 0.001). IIb type aneurysms (χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.54, P = 0.023) were one of the factors related to temporary or permanent AChoA injury during surgery. Overall, two patients (IIa = 1, IIb = 1) developed contralateral hemiparesis.</p><p>Conclusions: The new classification diagram clearly shows the features of all types of AChoA aneurysm and makes EVT planning more explicit. The II type (particularly IIb) was a potential risk factor for AChoA injury.</p>

Abstract
The parabrachial nucleus (PB) is composed of glutamatergic neurons at the midbrain‐hindbrain junction. These neurons form many subpopulations, one of which expresses Calca, which encodes the neuropeptide CGRP. This Calca‐expressing subpopulation has been implicated in a variety of homeostatic functions, but the overall distribution of Calca‐expressing neurons in this region remains unclear. Also, while previous studies in rats and mice have identified output projections from CGRP‐immunoreactive or Calca‐expressing neurons, we lack a comprehensive understanding of their efferent projections. We began by identifying neurons with Calca mRNA and CGRP immunoreactivity in and around the PB, including populations in the locus coeruleus and motor trigeminal nucleus. Calca‐expressing neurons in the PB prominently express the mu opioid receptor (Oprm1) and are distinct from neighboring neurons that express Foxp2 and Pdyn. Next, we used Cre‐dependent anterograde tracing with synaptophysin‐mCherry to map the efferent projections of these neurons. Calca‐expressing PB neurons heavily target subregions of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, basal forebrain, thalamic intralaminar and ventral posterior parvicellular nuclei, and hindbrain, in different patterns depending on the injection site location within the PB region. Retrograde axonal tracing revealed that the previously unreported hindbrain projections arise from a rostral‐ventral subset of CGRP/Calca neurons. Finally, we show that these efferent projections of Calca‐expressing neurons are distinct from those of neighboring PB neurons that express Pdyn. This information provides a detailed neuroanatomical framework for interpreting experimental work involving CGRP/Calca‐expressing neurons and opioid action in the PB region.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24828?af=R">Control of wakefulness by lateral hypothalamic glutamatergic neurons in male mice</a></h4>

The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is a center for the control of wakefulness. The present study reveals an important role of excitatory LH glutamatergic neurons in controlling wakefulness. Activation of LH glutamatergic neurons induces rapid transitions from sleep to wakefulness and maintains wakefulness, whereas their inhibition decreases wakefulness and increases sleep.

Abstract
The lateral hypothalamus (LH) plays a key role in the maintenance of cortical activation and wakefulness. In the LH, the two main neuronal cell populations consist of excitatory glutamatergic neurons and inhibitory GABAergic neurons. Recent studies have shown that inhibitory LH GABAergic neurons are wake‐promoting. However, the mechanism by which excitatory LH glutamatergic neurons contribute to sleep‐wake regulation remains unclear. Using fiber photometry in male mice, we demonstrated that LH glutamatergic neurons exhibited high activities during both wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep. Chemogenetic activation of LH glutamatergic neurons induced an increase in wakefulness that lasted for 6 hr, whereas suppression of LH glutamatergic neuronal activity caused a reduction in wakefulness. Brief optogenetic activation of LH glutamatergic neurons induced an immediate transition from slow‐wave sleep to wakefulness, and long‐lasting optogenetic stimulation of these neurons maintained wakefulness. Moreover, we found that LH‐locus coeruleus/parabrachial nucleus and LH‐basal forebrain projections mediated the wake‐promoting effects of LH glutamatergic neurons. Taken together, our data indicate that LH glutamatergic neurons are essential for the induction and maintenance of wakefulness. The results presented here may advance our understanding of the role of LH in the control of wakefulness.

Chronic epilepsy resulted in behavioral excitability, decreased basal synaptic transmission, and synaptophysin expression, which was ameliorated by exposure to enriched environment.

Abstract
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of focal epilepsies. Pharmacoresistance and comorbidities pose significant challenges to its treatment necessitating the development of non‐pharmacological approaches. In an earlier study, exposure to enriched environment (EE) reduced seizure frequency and duration and ameliorated chronic epilepsy‐induced depression in rats. However, the cellular basis of beneficial effects of EE remains unknown. Accordingly, in the current study, we evaluated the effects of EE in chronic epilepsy‐induced changes in behavioral hyperexcitability, synaptic transmission, synaptophysin (SYN), and calbindin (CB) expression, hippocampal subfield volumes and cell density in male Wistar rats. Epilepsy was induced by lithium–pilocarpine‐induced status epilepticus. Chronic epilepsy resulted in behavioral hyperexcitability, decreased basal synaptic transmission, increased paired‐pulse facilitation ratio, decreased hippocampal subfields volumes. Moreover, epileptic rats showed decreased synaptophysin and CB expression in the hippocampus. Six weeks post‐SE, epileptic rats were exposed to EE for 2 weeks, 6 hr/day. EE significantly reduced the behavioral hyperexcitability and restored basal synaptic transmission correlating with increased expression of SYN and CB. Our results reaffirm the beneficial effects of EE on behavior in chronic epilepsy and establishes some of the putative cellular mechanisms. Since drug resistance and comorbidities are a major concern in TLE, we propose EE as a potent non‐pharmacological treatment modality to mitigate these changes in chronic epilepsy.

<p>by Cosmin Stamate, Joan Saez Pons, David Weston, George Roussos</p>

PDkit is an open source software toolkit supporting the collaborative development of novel methods of digital assessment for Parkinson’s Disease, using symptom measurements captured continuously by wearables (passive monitoring) or by high-use-frequency smartphone apps (active monitoring). The goal of the toolkit is to help address the current lack of algorithmic and model transparency in this area by facilitating open sharing of standardised methods that allow the comparison of results across multiple centres and hardware variations. PDkit adopts the information-processing pipeline abstraction incorporating stages for data ingestion, quality of information augmentation, feature extraction, biomarker estimation and finally, scoring using standard clinical scales. Additionally, a dataflow programming framework is provided to support high performance computations. The practical use of PDkit is demonstrated in the context of the CUSSP clinical trial in the UK. The toolkit is implemented in the python programming language, the de facto standard for modern data science applications, and is widely available under the MIT license.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GvZaZx708vQ" width="1" />

<p>by Konstantin Shestopaloff, Mei Dong, Fan Gao, Wei Xu</p>

Current advances in next-generation sequencing techniques have allowed researchers to conduct comprehensive research on the microbiome and human diseases, with recent studies identifying associations between the human microbiome and health outcomes for a number of chronic conditions. However, microbiome data structure, characterized by sparsity and skewness, presents challenges to building effective classifiers. To address this, we present an innovative approach for distance-based classification using mixture distributions (DCMD). The method aims to improve classification performance using microbiome community data, where the predictors are composed of sparse and heterogeneous count data. This approach models the inherent uncertainty in sparse counts by estimating a mixture distribution for the sample data and representing each observation as a distribution, conditional on observed counts and the estimated mixture, which are then used as inputs for distance-based classification. The method is implemented into a <i>k</i>-means classification and <i>k</i>-nearest neighbours framework. We develop two distance metrics that produce optimal results. The performance of the model is assessed using simulated and human microbiome study data, with results compared against a number of existing machine learning and distance-based classification approaches. The proposed method is competitive when compared to the other machine learning approaches, and shows a clear improvement over commonly used distance-based classifiers, underscoring the importance of modelling sparsity for achieving optimal results. The range of applicability and robustness make the proposed method a viable alternative for classification using sparse microbiome count data.

We introduce poly-adenine CRISPR gRNA-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (pAC-Seq), a method that enables the direct observation of guide RNAs (gRNAs) in scRNA-seq. We use pAC-Seq to assess the phenotypic consequences of CRISPR/Cas9 based alterations of gene cis-regulatory regions. We show that pAC-Seq is able to detect cis-regulatory-induced alteration of target gene expression even when biallelic loss of target gene expression occurs in only ~5% of cells. This low rate of biallelic loss significantly increases the number of cells required to detect the consequences of changes to the regulatory genome, but can be ameliorated by transcript-targeted sequencing. Based on our experimental results we model the power to detect regulatory genome induced transcriptomic effects based on the rate of mono/biallelic loss, baseline gene expression, and the number of cells per target gRNA.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KYWp8O1m05M" width="1" />

Cancer occurs via an accumulation of somatic genomic alterations in a process of clonal evolution. There has been intensive study of potential causal mutations driving cancer development and progression. However, much recent evidence suggests that tumor evolution is normally driven by a variety of mechanisms of somatic hypermutability, which act in different combinations or degrees in different cancers. These variations in mutability phenotypes are predictive of progression outcomes independent of the specific mutations they have produced to date. Here we explore the question of how and to what degree these differences in mutational phenotypes act in a cancer to predict its future progression. We develop a computational paradigm using evolutionary tree inference (tumor phylogeny) algorithms to derive features quantifying single-tumor mutational phenotypes, followed by a machine learning framework to identify key features predictive of progression. Analyses of breast invasive carcinoma and lung carcinoma demonstrate that a large fraction of the risk of future clinical outcomes of cancer progression—overall survival and disease-free survival—can be explained solely from mutational phenotype features derived from the phylogenetic analysis. We further show that mutational phenotypes have additional predictive power even after accounting for traditional clinical and driver gene-centric genomic predictors of progression. These results confirm the importance of mutational phenotypes in contributing to cancer progression risk and suggest strategies for enhancing the predictive power of conventional clinical data or driver-centric biomarkers.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WBJn9WGSS0g" width="1" />

Alzheimer’s disease is associated with the formation of toxic aggregates of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides. Despite tremendous efforts, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aggregation, as well as cofactors that might influence it, remains incomplete. The small cyclic neuropeptide somatostatin-14 (SST<sub>14</sub>) was recently found to be the most selectively enriched protein in human frontal lobe extracts that binds Aβ<sub>42</sub> aggregates. Furthermore, SST<sub>14</sub>’s presence was also found to promote the formation of toxic Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers <i>in vitro</i>. In order to elucidate how SST<sub>14</sub> influences the onset of Aβ oligomerization, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of model mixtures of Aβ<sub>42</sub> or Aβ<sub>40</sub> peptides with SST<sub>14</sub> molecules and analyzed the structure and dynamics of early-stage aggregates. For comparison we also analyzed the aggregation of Aβ<sub>42</sub> in the presence of arginine vasopressin (AVP), a different cyclic neuropeptide. We observed the formation of self-assembled aggregates containing the Aβ chains and small cyclic peptides in all mixtures of Aβ<sub>42</sub>–SST<sub>14</sub>, Aβ<sub>42</sub>–AVP, and Aβ<sub>40</sub>–SST<sub>14</sub>. The Aβ<sub>42</sub>–SST<sub>14</sub> mixtures were found to develop compact, dynamically stable, but small aggregates with the highest exposure of hydrophobic residues to the solvent. Differences in the morphology and dynamics of aggregates that comprise SST<sub>14</sub> or AVP appear to reflect distinct (1) regions of the Aβ chains they interact with; (2) the propensities to engage in hydrogen bonds with Aβ peptides; and (3) solvent exposures of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups. The presence of SST<sub>14</sub> was found to impede aggregation in the Aβ<sub>42</sub>–SST<sub>14</sub> system despite a high hydrophobicity, producing a stronger “sticky surface” effect in the aggregates at the onset of Aβ<sub>42</sub>–SST<sub>14</sub> oligomerization.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GYdp5pngPhM" width="1" />

<p>by Wahbi K. El-Bouri, Andrew MacGowan, Tamás I. Józsa, Matthew J. Gounis, Stephen J. Payne</p>

Many ischaemic stroke patients who have a mechanical removal of
their clot (thrombectomy) do not get reperfusion of tissue despite
the thrombus being removed. One hypothesis for this ‘no-reperfusion’ phenomenon is micro-emboli fragmenting off the large clot during thrombectomy and occluding smaller blood vessels downstream of the clot location. This is impossible to observe in-vivo and so we here develop an in-silico model based on in-vitro experiments to model the effect of micro-emboli on brain tissue. Through in-vitro experiments we obtain, under a variety of clot consistencies and thrombectomy techniques, micro-emboli distributions post-thrombectomy. Blood flow through the microcirculation is modelled for statistically accurate voxels of brain microvasculature including penetrating arterioles and capillary beds. A novel micro-emboli algorithm, informed by the experimental data, is used to simulate the impact of micro-emboli successively entering the penetrating arterioles and the capillary bed. Scaled-up blood flow parameters–permeability and coupling coefficients–are calculated under various conditions. We find that capillary beds are more susceptible to occlusions than the penetrating arterioles with a 4x greater drop in permeability per volume of vessel occluded. Individual microvascular geometries determine robustness to micro-emboli. Hard clot fragmentation leads to larger micro-emboli and larger drops in blood flow for a given number of micro-emboli. Thrombectomy technique has a large impact on clot fragmentation and hence occlusions in the microvasculature. As such, in-silico modelling of mechanical thrombectomy predicts that clot specific factors, interventional technique, and microvascular geometry strongly influence reperfusion of the brain. Micro-emboli are likely contributory to the phenomenon of no-reperfusion following successful removal of a major clot.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SPelYNVHMO0" width="1" />

Virus host shifts are generally associated with novel adaptations to exploit the cells of the new host species optimally. Surprisingly, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has apparently required little to no significant adaptation to humans since the start of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to October 2020. Here we assess the types of natural selection taking place in <i>Sarbecoviruses</i> in horseshoe bats versus the early SARS-CoV-2 evolution in humans. While there is moderate evidence of diversifying positive selection in SARS-CoV-2 in humans, it is limited to the early phase of the pandemic, and purifying selection is much weaker in SARS-CoV-2 than in related bat <i>Sarbecoviruses</i>. In contrast, our analysis detects evidence for significant positive episodic diversifying selection acting at the base of the bat virus lineage SARS-CoV-2 emerged from, accompanied by an adaptive depletion in CpG composition presumed to be linked to the action of antiviral mechanisms in these ancestral bat hosts. The closest bat virus to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 (sharing an ancestor about 1976), is a recombinant with a structure that includes differential CpG content in Spike; clear evidence of coinfection and evolution in bats without involvement of other species. While an undiscovered “facilitating” intermediate species cannot be discounted, collectively, our results support the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 being capable of efficient human–human transmission as a consequence of its adaptive evolutionary history in bats, not humans, which created a relatively generalist virus.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0qRFd_2KaTo" width="1" />

Objective
Intracranial EEG (icEEG) studies show that interictal ripples propagate across the brain of children with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE) and the onset of this propagation (ripple‐onset‐zone, ROZ) estimates the epileptogenic zone. It is still unknown whether we can map this propagation non‐invasively. The goal of this study is to map ripples (ripple‐zone, RZ) and their propagation onset (ROZ) using high‐density EEG (HD‐EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), and to estimate their prognostic value in pediatric epilepsy surgery.


Methods
We retrospectively analyzed simultaneous HD‐EEG and MEG data from 28 children with MRE who underwent icEEG and epilepsy surgery. Using electric and magnetic source imaging, we estimated virtual sensors (VSs) at brain locations that matched the icEEG implantation. We detected ripples on VSs, defined virtual‐RZ and virtual‐ROZ, and estimated their distance from icEEG. We assessed the predictive value of resecting virtual‐RZ and virtual‐ROZ for postsurgical outcome. Interictal spike localization on HD‐EEG and MEG was also performed and compared with ripples.


Results
We mapped ripple propagation in all patients with HD‐EEG and in 27 (96%) patients with MEG. The distance from icEEG did not differ between HD‐EEG and MEG when mapping the RZ (26–27 mm; p = 0.6) or ROZ (22–24 mm; p = 0.4). Resecting the virtual‐ROZ, but not virtual‐RZ or the sources of spikes, was associated with good outcome for HD‐EEG (p = 0.016) and MEG (p = 0.047).


Interpretation
HD‐EEG and MEG can map interictal ripples and their propagation onset (virtual‐ROZ). Mapping non‐invasively the ripple onset may augment epilepsy surgery planning and improve surgical outcome of children with MRE.

<p>It is assumed that the cause of cognitive and behavioral capacities of living systems is to be found in the complex structure-function relationship of their brains; a property that is still difficult to decipher. Based on a neurodynamics approach to embodied cognition this paper introduces a method to guide the development of modular neural systems into the direction of enhanced cognitive abilities. It uses formally the synchronization of subnetworks to split the dynamics of coupled systems into synchronized and asynchronous components. The concept of a synchronization core is introduced to represent a whole family of parameterized neurodynamical systems living in a synchronization manifold. It is used to identify those coupled systems having a rich spectrum of dynamical properties. Special coupling structures—called generative—are identified which allow to make the synchronized dynamics more “complex” than the dynamics of the isolated parts. Furthermore, a criterion for coupling structures is given which, in addition to the synchronized dynamics, allows also for an asynchronous dynamics by destabilizing the synchronization manifold. The large class of synchronization equivalent systems contains networks with very different coupling structures and weights allsharing the same dynamical properties. To demonstrate the method a simple example is discussed in detail.</p>

<p>Epilepsy is the result of a group of transient abnormalities in brain function caused by an abnormal, highly synchronized discharge of brain neurons. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a class of endogenous non-coding single-stranded RNA molecules that participate in a series of important biological processes. Recent studies demonstrated that miRNAs are involved in a variety of central nervous system diseases, including epilepsy. Although the exact mechanism underlying the role of miRNAs in epilepsy pathogenesis is still unclear, these miRNAs may be involved in the inflammatory response in the nervous system, neuronal necrosis and apoptosis, dendritic growth, synaptic remodeling, glial cell proliferation, epileptic circuit formation, impairment of neurotransmitter and receptor function, and other processes. Here, we discuss miRNA metabolism and the roles of miRNA in epilepsy pathogenesis and evaluate miRNA as a potential new biomarker for the diagnosis of epilepsy, which enhances our understanding of disease processes.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by symptoms that impact both motor and non-motor domains. Outside of motor impairments, PD patients are at risk for impulse control disorders (ICDs), which include excessively disabling impulsive and compulsive behaviors. ICD symptoms in PD (PD + ICD) can be broadly conceptualized as a synergistic interaction between dopamine agonist therapy and the many molecular and circuit-level changes intrinsic to PD. Aside from discontinuing dopamine agonist treatment, there remains a lack of consensus on how to best address ICD symptoms in PD. In this review, we explore recent advances in the molecular and neuroanatomical mechanisms underlying ICD symptoms in PD by summarizing a rapidly accumulating body of clinical and preclinical studies, with a special focus on the utility of rodent models in gaining new insights into the neurochemical basis of PD + ICD. We also discuss the relevance of these findings to the broader problem of impulsive and compulsive behaviors that impact a range of neuropsychiatric syndromes.</p>

<p>Rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) is an umbrella term referring to several conditions causing a rapid neurological deterioration associated with cognitive decline and short disease duration. They comprise Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), the archetypal RPD, rapidly progressive variants of the most common neurodegenerative dementias (NDs), and potentially treatable conditions such as infectious or autoimmune encephalitis and cerebrovascular disease. Given the significant clinical and, sometimes, neuroradiological overlap between these different disorders, biofluid markers also contribute significantly to the differential diagnosis. Among them, the neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) has attracted growing attention in recent years as a biofluid marker of neurodegeneration due to its sensitivity to axonal damage and the reliability of its measurement in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. Here, we summarize current knowledge regarding biological and clinical implications of NfL evaluation in biofluids across RPDs, emphasizing CJD, and other prion diseases. In the latter, NfL demonstrated a good diagnostic and prognostic accuracy and a potential value as a marker of proximity to clinical onset in pre-symptomatic PRNP mutation carriers. Similarly, in Alzheimer’s disease and other NDs, higher NfL concentrations seem to predict a faster disease progression. While increasing evidence indicates a potential clinical value of NfL in monitoring cerebrovascular disease, the association between NfL and prediction of outcome and/or disease activity in autoimmune encephalitis and infectious diseases has only been investigated in few cohorts and deserves confirmatory studies. In the era of precision medicine and evolving therapeutic options, CSF and blood NfL might aid the diagnostic and prognostic assessment of RPDs and the stratification and management of patients according to disease progression in clinical trials.</p>

<p>Many neurodegenerative diseases are associated with chronic inflammation in the brain and periphery giving rise to a continuous imbalance of immune processes. Next to inflammation markers, activation of transposable elements, including long intrespersed nuclear elements (LINE) elements and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), has been identified during neurodegenerative disease progression and even correlated with the clinical severity of the disease. ERVs are remnants of viral infections in the human genome acquired during evolution. Upon activation, they produce transcripts and the phylogenetically youngest ones are still able to produce viral-like particles. In addition, ERVs can bind transcription factors and modulate immune response. Being between own and foreign, ERVs are reviewed in the context of viral infections of the central nervous system, in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, this review tests the hypothesis that viral infection may be a trigger at the onset of neuroinflammation and that ERVs sustain the inflammatory imbalance by summarizing existing data of neurodegenerative diseases associated with viruses and/or ERVs.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, as well as stereotyped and repetitive behaviors. ASDs affect nearly 2% of the United States child population and the worldwide prevalence has dramatically increased in recent years. The etiology is not clear but ASD is thought to be caused by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Circadian rhythms are the ∼24 h rhythms driven by the endogenous biological clock, and they are found in a variety of physiological processes. Growing evidence from basic and clinical studies suggest that the dysfunction of the circadian timing system may be associated with ASD and its pathogenesis. Here we review the findings that link circadian dysfunctions to ASD in both experimental and clinical studies. We first introduce the organization of the circadian system and ASD. Next, we review physiological indicators of circadian rhythms that are found disrupted in ASD individuals, including sleep–wake cycles, melatonin, cortisol, and serotonin. Finally, we review evidence in epidemiology, human genetics, and biochemistry that indicates underlying associations between circadian regulation and the pathogenesis of ASD. In conclusion, we propose that understanding the functional importance of the circadian clock in normal and aberrant neurodevelopmental processes may provide a novel perspective to tackle ASD, and clinical treatments for ASD individuals should comprise an integrative approach considering the dynamics of daily rhythms in physical, mental, and social processes.</p>

<p>Multimodal heterogeneous data, such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), are effective in improving the performance of automated dementia diagnosis by providing complementary information on degenerated brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment. Effectively integrating multimodal data has remained a challenging problem, especially when these heterogeneous data are incomplete due to poor data quality and patient dropout. Besides, multimodal data usually contain noise information caused by different scanners or imaging protocols. The existing methods usually fail to well handle these heterogeneous and noisy multimodal data for automated brain dementia diagnosis. To this end, we propose a high-order Laplacian regularized low-rank representation method for dementia diagnosis using block-wise missing multimodal data. The proposed method was evaluated on 805 subjects (with incomplete MRI, PET, and CSF data) from the real Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Experimental results suggest the effectiveness of our method in three tasks of brain disease classification, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

Introduction<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)–evoked potentials (TEPs) allow for probing cortical functions in health and pathology. However, there is uncertainty whether long-latency TMS-evoked potentials reflect functioning of the targeted cortical area. It has been suggested that components such as the TMS-evoked N100 are stereotypical and related to nonspecific sensory processes rather than transcranial effects of the changing magnetic field. In contrast, TEPs that vary according to the targeted brain region and are systematically lateralized toward the stimulated hemisphere can be considered to reflect activity in the stimulated brain region resulting from transcranial electromagnetic induction.</p>Methods<p>TMS with concurrent 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) was sequentially performed in homologous areas of both hemispheres. One sample of healthy adults received TMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; another sample received TMS to the temporo-occipital cortex. We analyzed late negative TEP deflections corresponding to the N100 component in motor cortex stimulation.</p>Results<p>TEP topography varied according to the stimulation target site. Long-latency negative TEP deflections were systematically lateralized (higher in ipsilateral compared to contralateral electrodes) in electrodes over the stimulated brain region. A calculation that removes evoked components that are not systematically lateralized relative to the stimulated hemisphere revealed negative maxima located around the respective target sites.</p>Conclusion<p>TEPs contain long-latency negative components that are lateralized toward the stimulated hemisphere and have their topographic maxima at the respective stimulation sites. They can be differentiated from co-occurring components that are invariable across different stimulation sites (probably reflecting coactivation of peripheral sensory afferences) according to their spatiotemporal patterns. Lateralized long-latency TEP components located at the stimulation site likely reflect activity evoked in the targeted cortex region by direct transcranial effects and are therefore suitable for assessing cortical functions.</p>

<p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has attracted increasing attention in the field of brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) owing to their advantages such as non-invasiveness, user safety, affordability, and portability. However, fNIRS signals are highly subject-specific and have low test-retest reliability. Therefore, individual calibration sessions need to be employed before each use of fNIRS-based BCI to achieve a sufficiently high performance for practical BCI applications. In this study, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for implementing a subject-independent fNIRS-based BCI. A total of 18 participants performed the fNIRS-based BCI experiments, where the main goal of the experiments was to distinguish a mental arithmetic task from an idle state task. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was employed to evaluate the average classification accuracy of the proposed subject-independent fNIRS-based BCI. As a result, the average classification accuracy of the proposed method was reported to be 71.20 ± 8.74%, which was higher than the threshold accuracy for effective BCI communication (70%) as well as that obtained using conventional shrinkage linear discriminant analysis (65.74 ± 7.68%). To achieve a classification accuracy comparable to that of the proposed subject-independent fNIRS-based BCI, 24 training trials (of approximately 12 min) were necessary for the traditional subject-dependent fNIRS-based BCI. It is expected that our CNN-based approach would reduce the necessity of long-term individual calibration sessions, thereby enhancing the practicality of fNIRS-based BCIs significantly.</p>

<p>The ipsilesional arm of stroke patients often has functionally limiting deficits in motor control and dexterity that depend on the side of the brain that is lesioned and that increase with the severity of paretic arm impairment. However, remediation of the ipsilesional arm has yet to be integrated into the usual standard of care for upper limb rehabilitation in stroke, largely due to a lack of translational research examining the effects of ipsilesional-arm intervention. We now ask whether ipsilesional-arm training, tailored to the hemisphere-specific nature of ipsilesional-arm motor deficits in participants with moderate to severe contralesional paresis, improves ipsilesional arm performance and generalizes to improve functional independence. We assessed the effects of this intervention on ipsilesional arm unilateral performance [Jebsen–Taylor Hand Function Test (JHFT)], ipsilesional grip strength, contralesional arm impairment level [Fugl–Meyer Assessment (FM)], and functional independence [Functional independence measure (FIM)] (N = 13). Intervention occurred over a 3 week period for 1.5 h/session, three times each week. All sessions included virtual reality tasks that targeted the specific motor control deficits associated with either left or right hemisphere damage, followed by graded dexterity training in real-world tasks. We also exposed participants to 3 weeks of sham training to control for the non-specific effects of therapy visits and interactions. We conducted five test-sessions: two pre-tests and three post-tests. Our results indicate substantial improvements in the less-impaired arm performance, without detriment to the paretic arm that transferred to improved functional independence in all three posttests, indicating durability of training effects for at least 3 weeks. We provide evidence for establishing the basis of a rehabilitation approach that includes evaluation and remediation of the ipsilesional arm in moderately to severely impaired stroke survivors. This study was originally a crossover design; however, we were unable to complete the second arm of the study due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We report the results from the first arm of the planned design as a longitudinal study.</p>

<p>Synchronous oscillations are ubiquitous throughout the cortex, but the frequency of oscillations differs from area to area. To elucidate the mechanistic architectures underlying various rhythmic activities, we tested whether spontaneous neural oscillations in different local cortical areas and large-scale networks can be phase-entrained by direct perturbation with distinct frequencies of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). While recording the electroencephalogram (EEG), we applied single-pulse TMS (sp-TMS) and rTMS at 5, 11, and 23 Hz over the motor or visual cortex. We assessed local and global modulation of phase dynamics using the phase-locking factor (PLF). sp-TMS to the motor and the visual cortex triggered a transient increase in PLF in distinct frequencies that peaked at 21 and 8 Hz, respectively. rTMS at 23 Hz over the motor cortex and 11 Hz over the visual cortex induced a prominent and progressive increase in PLF that lasted for a few cycles after the termination of rTMS. Moreover, the local increase in PLF propagated to other cortical areas. These results suggest that distinct cortical areas have area-specific oscillatory frequencies, and the manipulation of oscillations in local areas impacts other areas through the large-scale oscillatory network with the corresponding frequency specificity. We speculate that rTMS that is close to area-specific frequencies (natural frequencies) enables direct manipulation of brain dynamics and is thus useful for investigating the causal roles of synchronous neural oscillations. Moreover, this technique could be used to treat clinical symptoms associated with impaired oscillations and synchrony.</p>

<p>Accumulating evidence suggests that schizophrenia is a disorder of the brain’s communication, a result of functional and structural dysconnectivities. Patients with schizophrenia exhibit irregular neuronal circuit and network activity, but the causes and consequences of such activity remain largely unknown. Inhibition of 14-3-3 proteins in the mouse brain leads to the expression of multiple schizophrenia endophenotypes. Here we investigated how 14-3-3 inhibition alters neuronal network activity in the mouse hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), key brain regions implicated in schizophrenia pathophysiology. We implanted monopolar recording electrodes in these two regions to record local field potentials both at rest and during a cognitive task. Through our assessment of band power, coherence, and phase-amplitude coupling, we found that neural oscillations in the theta and gamma frequency ranges were altered as a result of 14-3-3 dysfunction. Utilizing transgenic and viral mouse models to assess the effects of chronic and acute 14-3-3 inhibition on oscillatory activities, respectively, we observed several fundamental similarities and differences between the two models. We localized viral mediated 14-3-3 protein inhibition to either the HPC or PFC, allowing us to assess the individual contributions of each region to the observed changes in neural oscillations. These findings identify a novel role of 14-3-3 proteins in neural oscillations that may have implications for our understanding of schizophrenia neurobiology.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.644743">Adjudicating Between Local and Global Architectures of Predictive Processing in the Subcortical Auditory Pathway</a></h4>

<p>Predictive processing, a leading theoretical framework for sensory processing, suggests that the brain constantly generates predictions on the sensory world and that perception emerges from the comparison between these predictions and the actual sensory input. This requires two distinct neural elements: generative units, which encode the model of the sensory world; and prediction error units, which compare these predictions against the sensory input. Although predictive processing is generally portrayed as a theory of cerebral cortex function, animal and human studies over the last decade have robustly shown the ubiquitous presence of prediction error responses in several nuclei of the auditory, somatosensory, and visual subcortical pathways. In the auditory modality, prediction error is typically elicited using so-called oddball paradigms, where sequences of repeated pure tones with the same pitch are at unpredictable intervals substituted by a tone of deviant frequency. Repeated sounds become predictable promptly and elicit decreasing prediction error; deviant tones break these predictions and elicit large prediction errors. The simplicity of the rules inducing predictability make oddball paradigms agnostic about the origin of the predictions. Here, we introduce two possible models of the organizational topology of the predictive processing auditory network: (1) the global view, that assumes that predictions on the sensory input are generated at high-order levels of the cerebral cortex and transmitted in a cascade of generative models to the subcortical sensory pathways; and (2) the local view, that assumes that independent local models, computed using local information, are used to perform predictions at each processing stage. In the global view information encoding is optimized globally but biases sensory representations along the entire brain according to the subjective views of the observer. The local view results in a diminished coding efficiency, but guarantees in return a robust encoding of the features of sensory input at each processing stage. Although most experimental results to-date are ambiguous in this respect, recent evidence favors the global model.</p>

<p>Neurons in the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus (Vme) have axons that branch peripherally to innervate the orofacial region and project centrally to several motor nuclei in brainstem. The dorsal motor nucleus of vagus nerve (DMV) resides in the brainstem and takes a role in visceral motor function such as pancreatic exocrine secretion. The present study aimed to demonstrate the presence of Vme–DMV circuit, activation of which would elicit a trigeminal neuroendocrine response. A masticatory dysfunctional animal model termed unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) model created by disturbing the dental occlusion was used. Cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) was injected into the inferior alveolar nerve of rats to help identify the central axon terminals of Vme neurons around the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) positive motor neurons in the DMV. The level of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) expressed in DMV, the level of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expressed in pancreas, the level of glucagon and insulin expression in islets and serum, and the blood glucose level were detected and compared between UAC and the age matched sham-operation control mice. Data indicated that compared with the controls, there were more CTb/VGLUT1 double labeled axon endings around the ChAT positive neurons in the DMV of UAC groups. Mice in UAC group expressed a higher VGLUT1 protein level in DMV, AChE protein level in pancreas, glucagon and insulin level in islet and serum, and higher postprandial blood glucose level, but lower fasting blood glucose level. All these were reversed at 15-weeks when UAC cessation was performed from 11-weeks (all, P &lt; 0.05). Our findings demonstrated Vme–DMV circuit via which the aberrant occlusion elicited a trigeminal neuroendocrine response such as alteration in the postprandial blood glucose level. Dental occlusion is proposed as a potential therapeutic target for reversing the increased postprandial glucose level.</p>

<p>Objective: Brain-computer interface (BCI) training is becoming increasingly popular in neurorehabilitation. However, around one third subjects have difficulties in controlling BCI devices effectively, which limits the application of BCI training. Furthermore, the effectiveness of BCI training is not satisfactory in stroke rehabilitation. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a powerful neural modulatory approach with strong facilitatory effects. Here, we investigated whether iTBS would improve BCI accuracy and boost the neuroplastic changes induced by BCI training.</p><p>Methods: Eight right-handed healthy subjects (four males, age: 20–24) participated in this two-session study (BCI-only session and iTBS+BCI session in random order). Neuroplastic changes were measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In BCI-only session, fNIRS was measured at baseline and immediately after BCI training. In iTBS+BCI session, BCI training was followed by iTBS delivered on the right primary motor cortex (M1). Single-pulse TMS was measured at baseline and immediately after iTBS. fNIRS was measured at baseline, immediately after iTBS, and immediately after BCI training. Paired-sample t-tests were used to compare amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials, cortical silent period duration, oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) concentration and functional connectivity across time points, and BCI accuracy between sessions.</p><p>Results: No significant difference in BCI accuracy was detected between sessions (p &gt; 0.05). In BCI-only session, functional connectivity matrices between motor cortex and prefrontal cortex were significantly increased after BCI training (p's &lt; 0.05). In iTBS+BCI session, amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials were significantly increased after iTBS (p's &lt; 0.05), but no change in HbO2 concentration or functional connectivity was observed throughout the whole session (p's &gt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study that investigated how iTBS targeted on M1 influences BCI accuracy and the acute neuroplastic changes after BCI training. Our results revealed that iTBS targeted on M1 did not influence BCI accuracy or facilitate the neuroplastic changes after BCI training. Therefore, M1 might not be an effective stimulation target of iTBS for the purpose of improving BCI accuracy or facilitate its effectiveness; other brain regions (i.e., prefrontal cortex) are needed to be further investigated as potentially effective stimulation targets.</p>

<p>The pericyte is a perivascular cell type that encapsulates the microvasculature of the brain and spinal cord. Pericytes play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and have a multitude of important functions in the brain. Recent evidence indicates that pericyte impairment has been implicated in neurovascular pathology associated with various human diseases such as diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and stroke. Although the pericyte is essential for normal brain function, knowledge about its developmental trajectory and anatomical distribution is limited. This review article summarizes the scientific community’s current understanding of pericytes’ regional heterogeneity in the brain and their changes during major life stages. More specifically, this review article focuses on pericyte differentiation and migration during brain development, regional population differences in the adult brain, and changes during normal and pathological aging. Most of what is known about pericytes come from studies of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Therefore, we highlight the need to expand our understanding of pericyte distribution and function in the whole brain to better delineate this cell type’s role in the normal brain and pathological conditions.</p>

<p>Cerebellar hypoplasia is a major characteristic of the Down syndrome (DS) brain. However, the consequences of trisomy upon cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC) and interneurons in DS are unclear. The present study performed a quantitative and qualitative analysis of cerebellar neurons immunostained with antibodies against calbindin D-28k (Calb), parvalbumin (Parv), and calretinin (Calr), phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated intermediate neurofilaments (SMI-34 and SMI-32), and high (TrkA) and low (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) affinity nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors as well as tau and amyloid in DS (n = 12), Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 10), and healthy non-dementia control (HC) (n = 8) cases. Our findings revealed higher Aβ<sub>42</sub> plaque load in DS compared to AD and HC but no differences in APP/Aβ plaque load between HC, AD, and DS. The cerebellar cortex neither displayed Aβ<sub>40</sub> containing plaques nor pathologic phosphorylated tau in any of the cases examined. The number and optical density (OD) measurements of Calb immunoreactive (-ir) PC soma and dendrites were similar between groups, while the number of PCs positive for Parv and SMI-32 were significantly reduced in AD and DS compared to HC. By contrast, the number of SMI-34-ir PC dystrophic axonal swellings, termed torpedoes, was significantly greater in AD compared to DS. No differences in SMI-32- and Parv-ir PC OD measurements were observed between groups. Conversely, total number of Parv- (stellate/basket) and Calr (Lugaro, brush, and Golgi)-positive interneurons were significantly reduced in DS compared to AD and HC. A strong negative correlation was found between counts for Parv-ir interneurons, Calr-ir Golgi and brush cells, and Aβ<sub>42</sub> plaque load. Number of TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> positive PCs were reduced in AD compared to HC. These findings suggest that disturbances in calcium binding proteins play a critical role in cerebellar neuronal dysfunction in adults with DS.</p>

Risk factors for developing dementia from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) likely differ between MCI subtypes. We investigated how frailty relates to dementia risk in amnestic MCI (a‐MCI; N = 2799) and non‐amnestic MCI (na‐MCI; N = 629) in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. Even though higher frailty increased dementia risk for people with either a‐MCI or na‐MCI, the larger risk was in na‐MCI (interaction HR = 1.35 [95% confidence interval = 1.15–1.59], P &lt; .001). Even after the onset of clinically significant cognitive impairment, poor general health, quantified by a high degree of frailty, is a significant risk for dementia.

Although Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is hypothesized to be a prerequisite for multiple sclerosis (MS), up to 15% of children with a diagnosis of MS were reported to be EBV‐seronegative. When re‐evaluating 25 EBV‐seronegative children out of 189 pediatric patients with a diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome/MS, we found anti‐myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody in 11/25 (44%) EBV‐seronegative, but only 9/164 (5.5%, p &lt; 0.001) EBV‐seropositive patients. After critical review, MS remained a plausible diagnosis in only four of 14 EBV‐seronegative/MOG antibody‐negative patients. In children with an MS‐like presentation, EBV seronegativity should alert clinicians to consider diagnoses other than MS, especially MOG‐antibody disease.

Objective
Many multiple sclerosis (MS) genetic susceptibility variants have been identified, but understanding disease heterogeneity remains a key challenge. Relapses are a core feature of MS and a common primary outcome of clinical trials, with prevention of relapses benefiting patients immediately and potentially limiting long‐term disability accrual. We aim to identify genetic variation associated with relapse hazard in MS by analyzing the largest study population to date.


Methods
We performed a genome‐wide association study (GWAS) in a discovery cohort and investigated the genome‐wide significant variants in a replication cohort. Combining both cohorts, we captured a total of 2231 relapses occurring before the start of any immunomodulatory treatment in 991 patients. For assessing time to relapse, we applied a survival analysis utilizing Cox proportional hazards models. We also investigated the association between MS genetic risk scores and relapse hazard and performed a gene ontology pathway analysis.


Results
The low‐frequency genetic variant rs11871306 within WNT9B reached genomewide significance in predicting relapse hazard and replicated (meta‐analysis hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.70–2.78, p = 2.07 × 10−10). A pathway analysis identified an association of the pathway “response to vitamin D" with relapse hazard (p = 4.33 × 10−6). The MS genetic risk scores, however, were not associated with relapse hazard.


Interpretation
Genetic factors underlying disease heterogeneity differ from variants associated with MS susceptibility. Our findings imply that genetic variation within the Wnt signaling and vitamin D pathways contributes to differences in relapse occurrence. The present study highlights these cross‐talking pathways as potential modulators of MS disease activity.

Objective
To determine the prevalence and risk factors for electrographic seizures and other EEG patterns in patients with COVID‐19 undergoing clinically indicated continuous electroencephalogram monitoring (cEEG), and to assess whether EEG findings are associated with outcomes.


Methods
We identified 197 patients with COVID‐19 referred for cEEG at 9 participating centers. Medical records and EEG reports were reviewed retrospectively to determine the incidence of and clinical risk factors for seizures and other epileptiform patterns. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis assessed the relationship between EEG patterns and clinical outcomes.


Results
Electrographic seizures were detected in 19 (9.6%) patients, including nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in 11 (5.6%). Epileptiform abnormalities (either ictal or interictal) were present in 96 (48.7%). Preceding clinical seizures during hospitalization were associated with both electrographic seizures (36.4% in those with versus 8.1% in those without prior clinical seizures, Odds Ratio (OR) 6.51, p = 0.01) and NCSE (27.3% vs 4.3%, OR 8.34, p = 0.01). A preexisting intracranial lesion on neuroimaging was associated with NCSE (14.3% vs 3.7%; OR 4.33, p = 0.02). In multivariate analysis of outcomes, electrographic seizures were an independent predictor of in‐hospital mortality (Hazard Ratio (HR) 4.07 [1.44‐11.51], p &lt; 0.01). In competing risks analysis, hospital length‐of‐stay increased in the presence of NCSE (30 day proportion discharged with vs without NCSE: 0.21 [0.03‐0.33] vs 0.43 [0.36‐0.49])


Interpretation
This multi‐center retrospective cohort study demonstrates that seizures and other epileptiform abnormalities are common in patients with COVID‐19 undergoing clinically‐indicated cEEG, and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

<p>by Warren Woodrich Pettine, Kenway Louie, John D. Murray, Xiao-Jing Wang</p>

We are constantly faced with decisions between alternatives defined by multiple attributes, necessitating an evaluation and integration of different information sources. Time-varying signals in multiple brain areas are implicated in decision-making; but we lack a rigorous biophysical description of how basic circuit properties, such as excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) tone and cascading nonlinearities, shape attribute processing and choice behavior. Furthermore, how such properties govern choice performance under varying levels of environmental uncertainty is unknown. We investigated two-attribute, two-alternative decision-making in a dynamical, cascading nonlinear neural network with three layers: an input layer encoding choice alternative attribute values; an intermediate layer of modules processing separate attributes; and a final layer producing the decision. Depending on intermediate layer E/I tone, the network displays distinct regimes characterized by linear (I), convex (II) or concave (III) choice indifference curves. In regimes I and II, each option’s attribute information is additively integrated. In regime III, time-varying nonlinear operations amplify the separation between offer distributions by selectively attending to the attribute with the larger differences in input values. At low environmental uncertainty, a linear combination most consistently selects higher valued alternatives. However, at high environmental uncertainty, regime III is more likely than a linear operation to select alternatives with higher value. Furthermore, there are conditions where readout from the intermediate layer could be experimentally indistinguishable from the final layer. Finally, these principles are used to examine multi-attribute decisions in systems with reduced inhibitory tone, leading to predictions of different choice patterns and overall performance between those with restrictions on inhibitory tone and neurotypicals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/L4auDjXY9Hc" width="1" />

<p>by Casey M. Zipfel, Vittoria Colizza, Shweta Bansal</p>

The lower an individual’s socioeconomic position, the higher their risk of poor health in low-, middle-, and high-income settings alike. As health inequities grow, it is imperative that we develop an empirically-driven mechanistic understanding of the determinants of health disparities, and capture disease burden in at-risk populations to prevent exacerbation of disparities. Past work has been limited in data or scope and has thus fallen short of generalizable insights. Here, we integrate empirical data from observational studies and large-scale healthcare data with models to characterize the dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of health disparities in an infectious disease case study: influenza. We find that variation in social and healthcare-based determinants exacerbates influenza epidemics, and that low socioeconomic status (SES) individuals disproportionately bear the burden of infection. We also identify geographical hotspots of influenza burden in low SES populations, much of which is overlooked in traditional influenza surveillance, and find that these differences are most predicted by variation in susceptibility and access to sickness absenteeism. Our results highlight that the effect of overlapping factors is synergistic and that reducing this intersectionality can significantly reduce inequities. Additionally, health disparities are expressed geographically, and targeting public health efforts spatially may be an efficient use of resources to abate inequities. The association between health and socioeconomic prosperity has a long history in the epidemiological literature; addressing health inequities in respiratory-transmitted infectious disease burden is an important step towards social justice in public health, and ignoring them promises to pose a serious threat.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bQ2CRQXRBBc" width="1" />

Loss in intraspecific diversity can alter ecosystem functions, but the underlying mechanisms are still elusive, and intraspecific biodiversity–ecosystem function (iBEF) relationships have been restrained to primary producers. Here, we manipulated genetic and functional richness of a fish consumer (<i>Phoxinus phoxinus</i>) to test whether iBEF relationships exist in consumer species and whether they are more likely sustained by genetic or functional richness. We found that both genotypic and functional richness affected ecosystem functioning, either independently or interactively. Loss in genotypic richness reduced benthic invertebrate diversity consistently across functional richness treatments, whereas it reduced zooplankton diversity only when functional richness was high. Finally, losses in genotypic and functional richness altered functions (decomposition) through trophic cascades. We concluded that iBEF relationships lead to substantial top-down effects on entire food chains. The loss of genotypic richness impacted ecological properties as much as the loss of functional richness, probably because it sustains “cryptic” functional diversity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dncfvEH8D4E" width="1" />

Apicomplexan parasites are defined by complex apical structures, which are necessary for interaction with incredibly diverse host cells. Two studies now amend a long-standing paradigm by showing conservation of an essential ring structure in the entire phylum.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LcGzorwOdsM" width="1" />

The regulation of protein synthesis is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, especially during stress responses, and its dysregulation could underlie the development of human diseases. The critical step during translation regulation is the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α). Here we report the identification of a direct kinase of eIF2α, microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2 (MARK2), which phosphorylates eIF2α in response to proteotoxic stress. The activity of MARK2 was confirmed in the cells lacking the 4 previously known eIF2α kinases. MARK2 itself was found to be a substrate of protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), which serves as a sensor for protein misfolding stress through a dynamic interaction with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Both MARK2 and PKCδ are activated via phosphorylation in proteotoxicity-associated neurodegenerative mouse models and in human patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These results reveal a PKCδ-MARK2-eIF2α cascade that may play a critical role in cellular proteotoxic stress responses and human diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rN8bCJUYr8E" width="1" />

The apical complex is the instrument of invasion used by apicomplexan parasites, and the conoid is a conspicuous feature of this apparatus found throughout this phylum. The conoid, however, is believed to be heavily reduced or missing from <i>Plasmodium</i> species and other members of the class Aconoidasida. Relatively few conoid proteins have previously been identified, making it difficult to address how conserved this feature is throughout the phylum, and whether it is genuinely missing from some major groups. Moreover, parasites such as <i>Plasmodium</i> species cycle through 3 invasive forms, and there is the possibility of differential presence of the conoid between these stages. We have applied spatial proteomics and high-resolution microscopy to develop a more complete molecular inventory and understanding of the organisation of conoid-associated proteins in the model apicomplexan <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. These data revealed molecular conservation of all conoid substructures throughout Apicomplexa, including <i>Plasmodium</i>, and even in allied Myzozoa such as <i>Chromera</i> and dinoflagellates. We reporter-tagged and observed the expression and location of several conoid complex proteins in the malaria model <i>P</i>. <i>berghei</i> and revealed equivalent structures in all of its zoite forms, as well as evidence of molecular differentiation between blood-stage merozoites and the ookinetes and sporozoites of the mosquito vector. Collectively, we show that the conoid is a conserved apicomplexan element at the heart of the invasion mechanisms of these highly successful and often devastating parasites.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/PlLVXG812RY" width="1" />

Malaria is caused by unicellular <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites. <i>Plasmodium</i> relies on diverse microtubule cytoskeletal structures for its reproduction, multiplication, and dissemination. Due to the small size of this parasite, its cytoskeleton has been primarily observable by electron microscopy (EM). Here, we demonstrate that the nanoscale cytoskeleton organisation is within reach using ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM). In developing microgametocytes, U-ExM allows monitoring the dynamic assembly of axonemes and concomitant tubulin polyglutamylation in whole cells. In the invasive merozoite and ookinete forms, U-ExM unveils the diversity across <i>Plasmodium</i> stages and species of the subpellicular microtubule arrays that confer cell rigidity. In ookinetes, we additionally identify an apical tubulin ring (ATR) that colocalises with markers of the conoid in related apicomplexan parasites. This tubulin-containing structure was presumed to be lost in <i>Plasmodium</i> despite its crucial role in motility and invasion in other apicomplexans. Here, U-ExM reveals that a divergent and considerably reduced form of the conoid is actually conserved in <i>Plasmodium</i> species.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3UYvvaReJU0" width="1" />

Custom made antibodies against four putative neuropeptides where used on whole mounts of the box jellyfish, Tripedalia cystophora, and revealed new details of the neuroanatomy in both the rhopalium and in the bell. These neuropeptides are most likely neurotransmitters in most stained neurons but might also be involved in neuronal development.







Abstract
Box jellyfish have an elaborate visual system and perform advanced visually guided behaviors. However, the rhopalial nervous system (RNS), believed to be the main visual processing center, only has 1000 neurons in each of the four eye carrying rhopalia. We have examined the detailed structure of the RNS of the box jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora, using immunolabeling with antibodies raised against four putative neuropeptides (T. cystophora RFamide, VWamide, RAamide, and FRamide). In the RNS, T. cystophora RF‐, VW‐, and RAamide antibodies stain sensory neurons, the pit eyes, the neuropil, and peptide‐specific subpopulations of stalk‐associated neurons and giant neurons. Furthermore, RFamide ir+ neurites are seen in the epidermal stalk nerve, whereas VWamide antibodies stain the gastrodermal stalk nerve. RFamide has the most widespread expression including in the ring and radial nerves, the pedalium nerve plexus, and the tentacular nerve net. RAamide is the putative neurotransmitter in the motor neurons of the subumbrellar nerve net, and VWamide is a potential marker for neuronal differentiation as it is found in subpopulations of undifferentiated cells both in the rhopalia and in the bell. The results from the FRamide antibodies were not included as only few cells were stained, and in an unreproducible way. Our studies show hitherto‐unseen details of the nervous system of T. cystophora and allowed us to identify specific functional groups of neurons. This identification is important for understanding visual processing in the RNS and enables experimental work, directly addressing the role of the different neuropeptides in vision.

A rapidly expanding catalogue of neurogenetic disorders has encouraged a diagnostic shift towards early clinical whole exome sequencing (WES). Adult primary mitochondrial diseases (PMDs) frequently exhibit neurological manifestations that overlap with other nervous system disorders. However, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is not routinely analyzed in standard clinical WES bioinformatic pipelines. We reanalyzed 11,424 exomes, enriched with neurological diseases, for pathogenic mtDNA variants. Twenty‐four different mtDNA mutations were detected in 64 exomes, 11 of which were considered disease causing based on the associated clinical phenotypes. These findings highlight the diagnostic uplifts gained by analyzing mtDNA from WES data in neurological diseases.

<p>Current neural network based algorithmic composition methods are very different compared to human brain's composition process, while the biological plausibility of composition and generative models are essential for the future of Artificial Intelligence. To explore this problem, this paper presents a spiking neural network based on the inspiration from brain structures and musical information processing mechanisms at multiple scales. Unlike previous methods, our model has three novel characteristics: (1) Inspired by brain structures, multiple brain regions with different cognitive functions, including musical memory and knowledge learning, are simulated and cooperated to generate stylistic melodies. A hierarchical neural network is constructed to formulate musical knowledge. (2) Biologically plausible neural model is employed to construct the network and synaptic connections are modulated using spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule. Besides, brain oscillation activities with different frequencies perform importantly during the learning and generating process. (3) Based on significant musical memory and knowledge learning, genre-based and composer-based melody composition can be achieved by different neural circuits, the experiments show that the model can compose melodies with different styles of composers or genres.</p>

<p>Human cortical and subcortical areas integrate emotion, memory, and cognition when interpreting various environmental stimuli for the elaboration of complex, evolved social behaviors. Pyramidal neurons occur in developed phylogenetic areas advancing along with the allocortex to represent 70–85% of the neocortical gray matter. Here, we illustrate and discuss morphological features of heterogeneous spiny pyramidal neurons emerging from specific amygdaloid nuclei, in CA3 and CA1 hippocampal regions, and in neocortical layers II/III and V of the anterolateral temporal lobe in humans. Three-dimensional images of Golgi-impregnated neurons were obtained using an algorithm for the visualization of the cell body, dendritic length, branching pattern, and pleomorphic dendritic spines, which are specialized plastic postsynaptic units for most excitatory inputs. We demonstrate the emergence and development of human pyramidal neurons in the cortical and basomedial (but not the medial, MeA) nuclei of the amygdala with cells showing a triangular cell body shape, basal branched dendrites, and a short apical shaft with proximal ramifications as “pyramidal-like” neurons. Basomedial neurons also have a long and distally ramified apical dendrite not oriented to the pial surface. These neurons are at the beginning of the allocortex and the limbic lobe. “Pyramidal-like” to “classic” pyramidal neurons with laminar organization advance from the CA3 to the CA1 hippocampal regions. These cells have basal and apical dendrites with specific receptive synaptic domains and several spines. Neocortical pyramidal neurons in layers II/III and V display heterogeneous dendritic branching patterns adapted to the space available and the afferent inputs of each brain area. Dendritic spines vary in their distribution, density, shapes, and sizes (classified as stubby/wide, thin, mushroom-like, ramified, transitional forms, “atypical” or complex forms, such as thorny excrescences in the MeA and CA3 hippocampal region). Spines were found isolated or intermingled, with evident particularities (e.g., an extraordinary density in long, deep CA1 pyramidal neurons), and some showing a spinule. We describe spiny pyramidal neurons considerably improving the connectional and processing complexity of the brain circuits. On the other hand, these cells have some vulnerabilities, as found in neurodegenerative Alzheimer’s disease and in temporal lobe epilepsy.</p>

<p>Optogenetic stimulation of type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) promises an alternative to the electrical stimulation by current cochlear implants (CIs) for improved hearing restoration by future optical CIs (oCIs). Most of the efforts in using optogenetic stimulation in the cochlea so far used early postnatal injection of viral vectors carrying blue-light activated channelrhodopsins (ChRs) into the cochlea of mice. However, preparing clinical translation of the oCI requires (i) reliable and safe transduction of mature SGNs of further species and (ii) use of long-wavelength light to avoid phototoxicity. Here, we employed a fast variant of the red-light activated channelrhodopsin Chrimson (f-Chrimson) and different AAV variants to implement optogenetic SGN stimulation in Mongolian gerbils. We compared early postnatal (p8) and adult (&gt;8 weeks) AAV administration, employing different protocols for injection of AAV-PHP.B and AAV2/6 into the adult cochlea. Success of the optogenetic manipulation was analyzed by optically evoked auditory brainstem response (oABR) and immunohistochemistry of mid-modiolar cryosections of the cochlea. In order to most efficiently evaluate the immunohistochemical results a semi-automatic procedure to identify transduced cells in confocal images was developed. Our results indicate that the rate of SGN transduction is significantly lower for AAV administration into the adult cochlea compared to early postnatal injection. SGN transduction upon AAV administration into the adult cochlea was largely independent of the chosen viral vector and injection approach. The higher the rate of SGN transduction, the lower were oABR thresholds and the larger were oABR amplitudes. Our results highlight the need to optimize viral vectors and virus administration for efficient optogenetic manipulation of SGNs in the adult cochlea for successful clinical translation of SGN-targeting gene therapy and of the oCI.</p>

<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in the adult population and it carries a dismal prognosis. Inefficient drug delivery across the blood brain barrier (BBB), an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and development of drug resistance are key barriers to successful glioma treatment. Since gliomas occur through sequential acquisition of genetic alterations, gene therapy, which enables to modification of the genetic make-up of target cells, appears to be a promising approach to overcome the obstacles encountered by current therapeutic strategies. Gene therapy is a rapidly evolving field with the ultimate goal of achieving specific delivery of therapeutic molecules using either viral or non-viral delivery vehicles. Gene therapy can also be used to enhance immune responses to tumor antigens, reprogram the TME aiming at blocking glioma-mediated immunosuppression and normalize angiogenesis. Nano-particles-mediated gene therapy is currently being developed to overcome the BBB for glioma treatment. Another approach to enhance the anti-glioma efficacy is the implementation of viro-immunotherapy using oncolytic viruses, which are immunogenic. Oncolytic viruses kill tumor cells due to cancer cell-specific viral replication, and can also initiate an anti-tumor immunity. However, concerns still remain related to off target effects, and therapeutic and transduction efficiency. In this review, we describe the rationale and strategies as well as advantages and disadvantages of current gene therapy approaches against gliomas in clinical and preclinical studies. This includes different delivery systems comprising of viral, and non-viral delivery platforms along with suicide/prodrug, oncolytic, cytokine, and tumor suppressor-mediated gene therapy approaches. In addition, advances in glioma treatment through BBB-disruptive gene therapy and anti-EGFRvIII/VEGFR gene therapy are also discussed. Finally, we discuss the results of gene therapy-mediated human clinical trials for gliomas. In summary, we highlight the progress, prospects and remaining challenges of gene therapies aiming at broadening our understanding and highlighting the therapeutic arsenal for GBM.</p>

<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability around the world and contributes greatly to the global burden of disease. Mounting evidence suggests that gut microbiota dysbiosis may be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD through the microbiota–gut–brain axis. Recent research suggests that epigenetic modifications might relate to depression. However, our knowledge of the role of epigenetics in host–microbe interactions remains limited. In the present study, we used a combination of affinity enrichment and high-resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis to identify hippocampal acetylated proteins in germ-free and specific pathogen-free mice. In total, 986 lysine acetylation sites in 543 proteins were identified, of which 747 sites in 427 proteins were quantified. Motif analysis identified several conserved sequences surrounding the acetylation sites, including D<sup>∗</sup>Kac, DKac, KacY, KacD, and D<sup>∗∗</sup>Kac. Gene ontology annotations revealed that these differentially expressed acetylated proteins were involved in multiple biological functions and were mainly located in mitochondria. In addition, pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle II (eukaryotic), both of which are exclusively localized to the mitochondria, were the primarily disturbed functions. Taken together, this study indicates that lysine acetylation alterations may play a pivotal role in mitochondrial dysfunction and may be a mechanism by which gut microbiota regulate brain function and behavioral phenotypes.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no definite molecular markers for diagnosis. Metal exposure may alter cellular proteins that contribute to PD. Exploring the cross-talk between metal and its binding proteins in PD could reveal a new strategy for PD diagnosis. We performed a meta-analysis from different PD tissue microarray datasets to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common to the blood and brain. Among common DEGs, we extracted 280 metalloprotein-encoding genes to construct protein networks describing the regulation of metalloproteins in the PD blood and brain. From the metalloprotein network, we identified three important functional hubs. Further analysis shows 60S ribosomal protein L6 (RPL6), a novel intermediary molecule connecting the three hubs of the metalloproteins network. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that RPL6 was downregulated in PD peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples. Simultaneously, trace element analysis revealed altered serum zinc and magnesium concentrations in PD samples. The Pearson’s correlation analysis shows that serum zinc and magnesium regulate the RPL6 gene expression in PBMC. Thus, metal-regulating RPL6 acts as an intermediary molecule connecting the three hubs that are functionally associated with PD. Overall our study explores the understanding of metal-mediated pathogenesis in PD, which provides a serum metal environment regulating the cellular gene expression that may light toward metal and gene expression-based biomarkers for PD diagnosis.</p>

<p>Functional constipation (FCon) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder. A considerable portion of patients with FCon is associated with anxiety/depressive status (FCAD). Previous neuroimaging studies mainly focused on patients with FCon without distinguishing FCAD from FCon patients without anxiety/depressive status (FCNAD). Differences in brain functions between these two subtypes remain unclear. Thus, we employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) and graph theory method to investigate differences in brain network connectivity and topology in 41 FCAD, 42 FCNAD, and 43 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs). FCAD/FCNAD showed significantly lower normalized clustering coefficient and small-world-ness. Both groups showed altered nodal degree/efficiency mainly in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), precentral gyrus (PreCen), supplementary motor area (SMA), and thalamus. In the FCAD group, nodal degree in the SMA was negatively correlated with difficulty of defecation, and abdominal pain was positively correlated with nodal degree/efficiency in the rACC, which had a lower within-module nodal degree. The salience network (SN) exhibited higher functional connectivity (FC) with the sensorimotor network (SMN) in FCAD/FCNAD, and FC between these two networks was negatively correlated with anxiety ratings in FCAD group. Additionally, FC of anterior insula (aINS)–rACC was only correlated with constipation symptom (i.e., abdominal pain) in the FCNAD group. In the FCAD group, FCs of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex–rACC, PreCen–aINS showed correlations with both constipation symptom (i.e., difficulty of defecation) and depressive status. These findings indicate the differences in FC of the SN–SMN between FCAD and FCNAD and provide neuroimaging evidence based on brain function, which portrays important clues for improving new treatment strategies.</p>

<p>Advances in large-scale proteomics analysis have been very useful in understanding pathogenesis of diseases and elaborating therapeutic strategies. Proteomics has been employed to study Parkinson disease (PD); however, sparse studies reported proteome investigation after cell therapy approaches. In this study, we used liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry and systems biology to identify differentially expressed proteins in a translational mouse model of PD after cell therapy. Proteins were extracted from five nigrostriatal-related brain regions of mice previously lesioned with 6-hydroxydopamine in the substantia nigra. Protein expression was compared in non-grafted brain to 1 and 7 days after intranigral grafting of E12.5 embryonic ventral mesencephalon (VM). We found a total of 277 deregulated proteins after transplantation, which are enriched for lipid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and PD, thus confirming that our animal model is similar to human PD and that the presence of grafted cells modulates the expression of these proteins. Notably, seven proteins (Acta1, Atp6v1e1, Eci3, Lypla2, Pip4k2a, Sccpdh, and Sh3gl2) were commonly down-regulated after engraftment in all studied brain regions. These proteins are known to be involved in the formation of lipids and recycling of dopamine (DA) vesicle at the synapse. Moreover, intranigral transplantation of VM cells decreased the expression of proteins related to oxidative stress, especially in the nigrostriatal pathway containing the DA grafted neurons. In the same regions, an up-regulation of several proteins including α-synuclein and tyrosine hydroxylase was observed, whereas expression of tetraspanin 7 was shut down. Overall, these results suggest that intranigral transplantation of VM tissue in an animal model of PD may induce a decrease of oxidative stress in the nigrostriatal pathway and a restoration of the machinery of neurotransmitters, particularly DA release to promote DA transmission through a decrease of D2 DA receptors endocytosis. Identification of new mechanistic elements involved in the nigrostriatal reconstruction process, using translational animal models and systems biology, is a promising approach to enhance the repair of this pathway in PD patients undergoing cell therapy.</p>

<p>The quality and quantity of training data are crucial to the performance of a deep-learning-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system. However, it is not practical to record EEG data over several long calibration sessions. A promising time- and cost-efficient solution is artificial data generation or data augmentation (DA). Here, we proposed a DA method for the motor imagery (MI) EEG signal called brain-area-recombination (BAR). For the BAR, each sample was first separated into two ones (named half-sample) by left/right brain channels, and the artificial samples were generated by recombining the half-samples. We then designed two schemas (intra- and adaptive-subject schema) corresponding to the single- and multi-subject scenarios. Extensive experiments using the classifier of EEGnet were conducted on two public datasets under various training set sizes. In both schemas, the BAR method can make the EEGnet have a better performance of classification (p &lt; 0.01). To make a comparative investigation, we selected two common DA methods (noise-added and flipping), and the BAR method beat them (p &lt; 0.05). Further, using the proposed BAR for augmentation, EEGnet achieved up to 8.3% improvement than a typical decoding algorithm CSP-SVM (p &lt; 0.01), note that both the models were trained on the augmented dataset. This study shows that BAR usage can significantly improve the classification ability of deep learning to MI-EEG signals. To a certain extent, it may promote the development of deep learning technology in the field of BCI.</p>

<p>Developmental Coordination Disorder and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder are unique neurodevelopmental disorders with overlaps in executive functions and motor control. The conditions co-occur in up to 50% of cases, raising questions of the pathological mechanisms of DCD versus ADHD. Few studies have examined these overlaps in adults with DCD and/or ADHD. Therefore, to provide insights about executive functions and motor control between adults with DCD, ADHD, both conditions (DCD + ADHD), or typically developed controls, this study used a stop-signal task and parallel EEG measurement. We assessed executive performance via go accuracy and go reaction time, as well as motor response inhibition via stop-signal reaction time. This was complemented with analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs). Based on existing investigations of adults with DCD or ADHD, we expected (1) groups would not differ in behavioral performance on stop and go trials, but (2) differences in ERPs, particularly in components N200 (index of cognitive control) and P300 (index of attention and inhibition) would be evident. The sample included N = 50 adults with DCD (n = 12), ADHD (n = 9), DCD + ADHD (n = 7), and control participants (n = 22). We replicated that there were no between-group differences for behavioral-level executive performance and motor response inhibition. However, on a physiological level, ERP components N200 and P300 differed between groups, particularly during successful response inhibition. These ERPs reflect potential endophenotypic differences not evident in overt behavior of participants with ADHD and/or DCD. This suggests a disorder specific employment of inhibition or general executive functions in groups of adults with DCD, DCD + ADHD, ADHD, or control participants.</p>

<p>The lateralized ERP N2pc component has been shown to be an effective marker of attentional object selection when elicited in a visual search task, specifically reflecting the selection of a target item among distractors. Moreover, when targets are known in advance, the visual search process is guided by representations of target features held in working memory at the time of search, thus guiding attention to objects with target-matching features. Previous studies have shown that manipulating working memory availability via concurrent tasks or within task manipulations influences visual search performance and the N2pc. Other studies have indicated that visual (non-spatial) vs. spatial working memory manipulations have differential contributions to visual search. To investigate this the current study assesses participants' visual and spatial working memory ability independent of the visual search task to determine whether such individual differences in working memory affect task performance and the N2pc. Participants (n = 205) completed a visual search task to elicit the N2pc and separate visual working memory (VWM) and spatial working memory (SPWM) assessments. Greater SPWM, but not VWM, ability is correlated with and predicts higher visual search accuracy and greater N2pc amplitudes. Neither VWM nor SPWM was related to N2pc latency. These results provide additional support to prior behavioral and neural visual search findings that spatial WM availability, whether as an ability of the participant's processing system or based on task demands, plays an important role in efficient visual search.</p>

<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a clinically effective tool for treating medically refractory Parkinson’s disease (PD), but its neural mechanisms remain debated. Previous work has demonstrated that STN DBS results in evoked potentials (EPs) in the primary motor cortex (M1), suggesting that modulation of cortical physiology may be involved in its therapeutic effects. Due to technical challenges presented by high-amplitude DBS artifacts, these EPs are often measured in response to low-frequency stimulation, which is generally ineffective at PD symptom management. This study aims to characterize STN-to-cortex EPs seen during clinically relevant high-frequency STN DBS for PD. Intraoperatively, we applied STN DBS to 6 PD patients while recording electrocorticography (ECoG) from an electrode strip over the ipsilateral central sulcus. Using recently published techniques, we removed large stimulation artifacts to enable quantification of STN-to-cortex EPs. Two cortical EPs were observed – one synchronized with DBS onset and persisting during ongoing stimulation, and one immediately following DBS offset, here termed the “start” and the “end” EPs respectively. The start EP is, to our knowledge, the first long-latency cortical EP reported during ongoing high-frequency DBS. The start and end EPs differ in magnitude (p &lt; 0.05) and latency (p &lt; 0.001), and the end, but not the start, EP magnitude has a significant relationship (p &lt; 0.001, adjusted for random effects of subject) to ongoing high gamma (80–150 Hz) power during the EP. These contrasts may suggest mechanistic or circuit differences in EP production during the two time periods. This represents a potential framework for relating DBS clinical efficacy to the effects of a variety of stimulation parameters on EPs.</p>

<p>Among many artificial neural networks, the research on Spike Neural Network (SNN), which mimics the energy-efficient signal system in the brain, is drawing much attention. Memristor is a promising candidate as a synaptic component for hardware implementation of SNN, but several non-ideal device properties are making it challengeable. In this work, we conducted an SNN simulation by adding a device model with a non-linear weight update to test the impact on SNN performance. We found that SNN has a strong tolerance for the device non-linearity and the network can keep the accuracy high if a device meets one of the two conditions: 1. symmetric LTP and LTD curves and 2. positive non-linearity factors for both LTP and LTD. The reason was analyzed in terms of the balance between network parameters as well as the variability of weight. The results are considered to be a piece of useful prior information for the future implementation of emerging device-based neuromorphic hardware.</p>

<p>Visual selection in primates is intricately linked to eye movements, which are generated by a network of cortical and subcortical neural circuits. When visual selection is performed covertly, without foveating eye movements toward the selected targets, a class of fixational eye movements, called microsaccades, is still involved. Microsaccades are small saccades that occur when maintaining precise gaze fixation on a stationary point, and they exhibit robust modulations in peripheral cueing paradigms used to investigate covert visual selection mechanisms. These modulations consist of changes in both microsaccade directions and frequencies after cue onsets. Over the past two decades, the properties and functional implications of these modulations have been heavily studied, revealing a potentially important role for microsaccades in mediating covert visual selection effects. However, the neural mechanisms underlying cueing effects on microsaccades are only beginning to be investigated. Here we review the available causal manipulation evidence for these effects’ cortical and subcortical substrates. In the superior colliculus (SC), activity representing peripheral visual cues strongly influences microsaccade direction, but not frequency, modulations. In the cortical frontal eye fields (FEF), activity only compensates for early reflexive effects of cues on microsaccades. Using evidence from behavior, theoretical modeling, and preliminary lesion data from the primary visual cortex and microstimulation data from the lower brainstem, we argue that the early reflexive microsaccade effects arise subcortically, downstream of the SC. Overall, studying cueing effects on microsaccades in primates represents an important opportunity to link perception, cognition, and action through unaddressed cortical-subcortical neural interactions. These interactions are also likely relevant in other sensory and motor modalities during other active behaviors.</p>

<p>Preservation of the excitability of spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) may contribute to an improved speech perception after cochlear implantation. Thus, the application of exogenous neurotrophic factors such as the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to increase SGN survival in vitro and in vivo is a promising pharmacological approach in cochlear implant (CI) research. Due to the difficult pharmacokinetic profile of proteins such as BDNF, there is a quest for small molecules to mediate the survival of SGN or to increase the efficacy of BDNF. The C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum could be a potential new candidate for the protection and regeneration of SGN. Inhibition of the RhoA GTPase pathway which can be mediated by C3 is described as a promising strategy to enhance axonal regeneration and to exert pro-survival signals in neurons. Nanomolar concentrations of C3, its enzymatically inactive form C3<sup>E174Q</sup>, and a 26mer C-terminal peptide fragment covering amino acid 156–181 (C3<sup>156-181</sup>) potentiated the neuroprotective effect on SGN mediated by BDNF in vitro. The neuroprotective effect of C3/BDNF was reduced to the neuroprotective effect of BDNF alone after the treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K).The exoenzyme C3 (wild-type and enzyme-deficient) and the C3 peptide fragment C3<sup>154–181</sup> present novel biologically active compounds for the protection of the SGN. The exact underlying intracellular mechanisms that mediate the neuroprotective effect are not clarified yet, but the combination of BDNF (TrkB stimulation) and C3 exoenzyme (RhoA inhibition) can be used to protect SGN in vitro.</p>

<p>Repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) is highly expressed in the dorsal raphe where serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) neurons are located. REST works as a transcription factor for the 5-HT receptor and tryptophan hydroxylase two-gene expression. We hypothesized that REST is co-expressed in 5-HT neurons, which, if demonstrated, would be useful to understand the mechanism of 5-HT dysfunction-related disorders such as negative emotions and depression. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the expression of the REST gene in the brain (forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain) of adult male Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) using rt-PCR. Besides, using immunocytochemistry, co-localization of the REST gene was examined in 5-HT neurons and with neuronal-/glial-cell markers. We found a high expression of the REST gene in the midbrain region of the dorsal raphe, an area of 5-HT neurons. Double-label immunocytochemistry showed neuron-specific expression of REST co-localized in 5-HT neurons in the dorsal and ventral parts of the periventricular pretectal nucleus, paraventricular organ, and dorsal and medial raphe nucleus. Since midbrain 5-HT neurons express REST, we speculate that REST may control 5-HT neuronal activity related to negative emotions, including depression.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the growing population of elderly people, is still lacking minimally-invasive circulating biomarkers that could facilitate the diagnosis and the monitoring of disease progression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as tissue-specific and/or circulating biomarkers of several age-related diseases, but evidence on AD is still not conclusive. Since a systemic pro-inflammatory status was associated with an increased risk of AD development and progression, we focused our investigation on a subset of miRNAs modulating the inflammatory process, namely inflamma-miRNAs. The expression of inflamma-miR-17-5p, -21-5p, -126-3p, and -146a-5p was analyzed in plasma samples from 116 patients with AD compared with 41 age-matched healthy control (HC) subjects. MiR-17-5p, miR-21-5p, and miR-126-3p plasma levels were significantly increased in AD patients compared to HC. Importantly, a strong inverse relationship was observed between miR-21-5p and miR-126-3p, and the cognitive impairment, assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Notably, miR-126-3p was able to discriminate between mild and severe cognitive impairment. Overall, our results reinforce the hypothesis that circulating inflamma-miRNAs could be assessed as minimally invasive tools associated with the development and progression of cognitive impairment in AD.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by specific alterations of brain DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns. Age and sex, two major risk factors for AD, are also known to largely affect the epigenetic profiles in brain, but their contribution to AD-associated DNAm changes has been poorly investigated. In this study we considered publicly available DNAm datasets of four brain regions (temporal, frontal, entorhinal cortex, and cerebellum) from healthy adult subjects and AD patients, and performed a meta-analysis to identify sex-, age-, and AD-associated epigenetic profiles. In one of these datasets it was also possible to distinguish 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) profiles. We showed that DNAm differences between males and females tend to be shared between the four brain regions, while aging differently affects cortical regions compared to cerebellum. We found that the proportion of sex-dependent probes whose methylation is modified also during aging is higher than expected, but that differences between males and females tend to be maintained, with only a few probes showing age-by-sex interaction. We did not find significant overlaps between AD- and sex-associated probes, nor disease-by-sex interaction effects. On the contrary, we found that AD-related epigenetic modifications are significantly enriched in probes whose DNAm varies with age and that there is a high concordance between the direction of changes (hyper or hypo-methylation) in aging and AD, supporting accelerated epigenetic aging in the disease. In summary, our results suggest that age-associated DNAm patterns concur to the epigenetic deregulation observed in AD, providing new insights on how advanced age enables neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Background: Growing evidence indicates that cognitive decline and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) share common vascular risk factors.

Endogenous PCSK9 levels were higher in female (p = 0.005). On linear regression analysis PCSK9 predicts short term memory only in females (Beta = 0.408, p = 0.001), with an interaction between PCSK9 and gender (p = 0.004 for interaction PCSK9 by sex). The association of PCSK9 with FDS in female was partially mediated by waist circumference (mediation effect 8.5%).</p><p>Conclusions: In patients at high CV risk short term memory was directly related to PCSK9 levels only in women, revealing the relevance of sex in this relationship. The association of PCSK9 with memory function may be mediated, at least in part, by waist circumference.</p>

<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical technique that regulates neuron activity by using internal pulse generators to electrodes in specific target areas of the brain. As a blind treatment, DBS is widely used in the field of mental and neurological diseases, although its mechanism of action is still unclear. In the past 10 years, DBS has shown a certain positive effect in animal models and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but there are also different results that may be related to the stimulation parameters of DBS. Based on this, determining the optimal stimulation parameters for DBS in AD and understanding its mechanism of action are essential to promote the clinical application of DBS in AD. This review aims to explore the therapeutic effect of DBS in AD, and to analyze its stimulation parameters and potential mechanism of action. The keywords “Deep brain stimulation” and “Alzheimer's Disease” were used for systematic searches in the literature databases of Web of Science and PubMed (from 1900 to September 29, 2020). All human clinical studies and animal studies were reported in English, including individual case studies and long-term follow-up studies, were included. These studies described the therapeutic effects of DBS in AD. The results included 16 human clinical studies and 14 animal studies, of which 28 studies clearly demonstrated the positive effect of DBS in AD. We analyzed the current stimulation parameters of DBS in AD from stimulation target, stimulation frequency, stimulation start time, stimulation duration, unilateral/bilateral treatment and current intensity, etc., and we also discussed its potential mechanism of action from multiple aspects, including regulating related neural networks, promoting nerve oscillation, reducing β-amyloid and tau levels, reducing neuroinflammation, regulating the cholinergic system, inducing the synthesis of nerve growth factor.</p>

<p>The hypothalamus plays a central role in homeostasis and aging. The hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) controls homeostasis of food intake and energy expenditure and retains adult neural stem cells (NSCs)/progenitor cells. Aging induces the loss of NSCs and the enhancement of inflammation, including the activation of glial cells in the ARC, but aging-associated alterations of the hypothalamic cells remain obscure. Here, we identified Sox2 and NeuN double-positive cells in a subpopulation of cells in the mouse ARC. These cells were reduced in number with aging, although NeuN-positive neuronal cells were unaltered in the total number. Diet-induced obesity mice fed with high-fat diet presented a similar hypothalamic alteration to aged mice. This study provides a new insight into aging-induced changes in the hypothalamus.</p>

<p>by Lucas A. Meirelles, Elena K. Perry, Megan Bergkessel, Dianne K. Newman</p>

Bacterial opportunistic human pathogens frequently exhibit intrinsic antibiotic tolerance and resistance, resulting in infections that can be nearly impossible to eradicate. We asked whether this recalcitrance could be driven by these organisms’ evolutionary history as environmental microbes that engage in chemical warfare. Using <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> as a model, we demonstrate that the self-produced antibiotic pyocyanin (PYO) activates defenses that confer collateral tolerance specifically to structurally similar synthetic clinical antibiotics. Non-PYO-producing opportunistic pathogens, such as members of the <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> complex, likewise display elevated antibiotic tolerance when cocultured with PYO-producing strains. Furthermore, by widening the population bottleneck that occurs during antibiotic selection and promoting the establishment of a more diverse range of mutant lineages, PYO increases apparent rates of mutation to antibiotic resistance to a degree that can rival clinically relevant hypermutator strains. Together, these results reveal an overlooked mechanism by which opportunistic pathogens that produce natural toxins can dramatically modulate the efficacy of clinical antibiotics and the evolution of antibiotic resistance, both for themselves and other members of clinically relevant polymicrobial communities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/sZfpVaR26SM" width="1" />

Daily rhythms are disrupted in patients with mood disorders. The lateral habenula (LHb) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) contribute to circadian timekeeping and regulate mood. Thus, pathophysiology in these nuclei may be responsible for aberrations in daily rhythms during mood disorders. Using the 15-day chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) paradigm and in vitro slice electrophysiology, we measured the effects of stress on diurnal rhythms in firing of LHb cells projecting to the DRN (cells<sup>LHb→DRN</sup>) and unlabeled DRN cells. We also performed optogenetic experiments to investigate if increased firing in cells<sup>LHb→DRN</sup> during exposure to a weak 7-day social defeat stress (SDS) paradigm induces stress-susceptibility. Last, we investigated whether exposure to CSDS affected the ability of mice to photoentrain to a new light–dark (LD) cycle. The cells<sup>LHb→DRN</sup> and unlabeled DRN cells of stress-susceptible mice express greater blunted diurnal firing compared to stress-näive (control) and stress-resilient mice. Daytime optogenetic activation of cells<sup>LHb→DRN</sup> during SDS induces stress-susceptibility which shows the direct correlation between increased activity in this circuit and putative mood disorders. Finally, we found that stress-susceptible mice are slower, while stress-resilient mice are faster, at photoentraining to a new LD cycle. Our findings suggest that exposure to strong stressors induces blunted daily rhythms in firing in cells<sup>LHb→DRN</sup>, DRN cells and decreases the initial rate of photoentrainment in susceptible-mice. In contrast, resilient-mice may undergo homeostatic adaptations that maintain daily rhythms in firing in cells<sup>LHb→DRN</sup> and also show rapid photoentrainment to a new LD cycle.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/th3sChYCH5s" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25114?af=R">Functional alterations of retinal neurons and vascular involvement progress simultaneously in the Psammomys obesus model of diabetic retinopathy</a></h4>

The diabetic retinopathy in the diurnal rodent Psammomys obesus is manifested by a functional and structural dysfunction. The functional alteration detected by the decrease in the amplitude of the ERG components over time following the diabetic induction. Whereas the structural dysfunction is evinced by the disruption of retinal architecture and the appearance of exudates at an advanced stage of the disease progression as well as the decrease of the retinal thinness.







Abstract
To investigate the progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in a new diurnal animal model, we monitored clinically the DR in Psammomys obesus (P. obesus) during 7 months using electroretinography (ERG) and imaging techniques. After the onset of DR, all ERG components decreased progressively. In scotopic conditions, by 3‐months of disease progression, the diabetic P. obesus displayed a significant decrease in amplitude of b‐max, b‐wave responses, and mixed b‐waves. While mixed a‐wave decreased between 4 and 7 months. Significant differences of OP2 appeared following 1 month of disease. In photopic conditions, we noticed a decrease in the a‐wave at 2 months, while it took more than 5 months in b‐wave amplitude. The photopic negative response (PhNR) and the i‐wave amplitudes decreased following 4 and 5 months. OP1 and OP2 were the first to be altered and a significant decrease in the amplitude started after 3 months. Finally, 30 Hz‐flicker and photopic S‐cone were impaired after 2 and 3 months, respectively. The assessment of the eye fundus of the retina revealed an abnormal vascular architecture appeared at Months 6 and 7. In addition, we noticed exudates in the superior periphery of the retina at the same stage. The retina thickness showed a significant reduction at Month 7. Our results indicate that the clinical correlates of human DR are present in diabetic P. obesus. The depressed of ERGs, disruption of retinal architecture, and the appearance of exudates may reflect vascular and neuronal damage throughout the retina as are seen in the advanced stages of human DR.

<p>This case-control study is aimed to investigate the correlation of altered functional connectivity (FC) in cerebellum with cognitive impairment in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The morphometric and resting-state FC MRI analysis including 46 participants with AD, 32 with aMCI and 42 age-matched normal controls (NCs) were conducted. We compared the cerebellar gray matter volume and cerebellar FC with cerebral cortical regions among three groups. To investigate the relationship of cerebellar FC with cognition, we measure the correlation of significant altered FC and individual cognitive domain. No significant morphometric differences of cerebellum was observed across three groups. The patients with AD had weaker cerebral cortical FCs in bilateral Crus I and left VIIb compared to NCs, and in bilateral Crus I compared to patients with aMCI. For patients with aMCI, the weaker FC were found between right Crus I, left VIIb and cerebral cortical regions compared to NCs. The strength of left cerebellar FC positively correlated with specific cognitive subdomains, including memory, executive function, visuospatial function, and global cognition in AD and aMCI. These findings demonstrated the alteration of cerebellar FC with cerebral cortical regions, and the correlation of cerebellar FC and cognitive impairment in AD and aMCI.</p>
