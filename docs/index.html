              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20216">Ising dynamics on multilayer networks with heterogeneous layers</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.20216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilayer networks provide a framework to study complex systems with multiple types of interactions, multiple dynamical processes, and/or multiple subsystems. When studying a dynamical process on a multilayer network, it is important to consider how both layer structure and heterogeneity across layers impacts the overall dynamics. As a concrete example, we study Ising dynamics on multilayer networks and investigate how network structure affects its qualitative features. We focus primarily on multiplex networks, which are multilayer networks in which interlayer edges occur only between manifestations of the same entity on different layers, although we also consider one empirical example with a more general multilayer structure. We use numerical simulations and a mean-field approximation to examine the steady-state behavior of the Ising dynamics as a function of temperature (which is a key model parameter) for a variety of two-layer multilayer networks from both models and empirical data. We examine both the steady-state behavior and a metastable state in which the two layers are anti-aligned, and we explore the effects of interlayer coupling strength and structural heterogeneity. In synthetic multilayer networks with core--periphery structure, we show that interlayer edges that involve peripheral nodes can exert more influence than interlayer edges that involve only core nodes. Finally, we consider empirical multilayer networks from biological and social systems. Our work illustrates how heterogeneity across the layers of a multilayer network influences dynamics on the whole network.

Abstract: The burgeoning growth of open-sourced vision-language models (VLMs) has catalyzed a plethora of applications across diverse domains. Ensuring the transparency and interpretability of these models is critical for fostering trustworthy and responsible AI systems. In this study, our objective is to delve into the internals of VLMs to interpret the functions of individual neurons. We observe the activations of neurons with respects to the input visual tokens and text tokens, and reveal some interesting findings. Particularly, we found that there are neurons responsible for only visual or text information, or both, respectively, which we refer to them as visual neurons, text neurons, and multi-modal neurons, respectively. We build a framework that automates the explanation of neurons with the assistant of GPT-4o. Meanwhile, for visual neurons, we propose an activation simulator to assess the reliability of the explanations for visual neurons. System statistical analyses on top of one representative VLM of LLaVA, uncover the behaviors/characteristics of different categories of neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08599">Geometric Hyperscanning of Affect under Active Inference</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.08599v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Second-person neuroscience holds social cognition as embodied meaning co-regulation through reciprocal interaction, modeled here as coupled active inference with affect emerging as inference over identity-relevant surprise. Each agent maintains a self-model that tracks violations in its predictive coherence while recursively modeling the other. Valence is computed from self-model prediction error, weighted by self-relevance, and modulated by prior affective states and by what we term temporal aiming, which captures affective appraisal over time. This accommodates shifts in the self-other boundary, allowing affect to emerge at individual and dyadic levels. We propose a novel method termed geometric hyperscanning, based on the Forman-Ricci curvature, to empirically operationalize these processes: it tracks topological reconfigurations in inter-brain networks, with its entro-py serving as a proxy for affective phase transitions such as rupture, co-regulation, and re-attunement.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19351">The Impact of Structural Changes on Learning Capacity in the Fly Olfactory Neural Circuit</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.19351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Drosophila mushroom body (MB) is known to be involved in olfactory learning and memory; the synaptic plasticity of the Kenyon cell (KC) to mushroom body output neuron (MBON) synapses plays a key role in the learning process. Previous research has focused on projection neuron (PN) to Kenyon cell (KC) connectivity within the MB; we examine how perturbations to the mushroom body circuit structure and changes in connectivity, specifically within the KC to mushroom body output neuron (MBON) neural circuit, affect the MBONs' ability to distinguish between odor classes. We constructed a neural network that incorporates the connectivity between PNs, KCs, and MBONs. To train our model, we generated ten artificial input classes, which represent the projection neuron activity in response to different odors. We collected data on the number of KC-to-MBON connections, MBON error rates, and KC-to-MBON synaptic weights, among other metrics. We observed that MBONs with very few presynaptic KCs consistently performed worse than others in the odor classification task. The developmental types of KCs also played a significant role in each MBON's output. We performed random and targeted KC ablation and observed that ablating developmentally mature KCs had a greater negative impact on MBONs' learning capacity than ablating immature KCs. Random and targeted pruning of KC-MBON synaptic connections yielded results largely consistent with the ablation experiments. To further explore the various types of KCs, we also performed rewiring experiments in the PN to KC circuit. Our study furthers our understanding of olfactory neuroplasticity and provides important clues to understanding learning and memory in general. Understanding how the olfactory circuits process and learn can also have potential applications in artificial intelligence and treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19339">Multi-population Ensemble Genetic Programming via Cooperative Coevolution and Multi-view Learning for Classification</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.19339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Multi-population Ensemble Genetic Programming (MEGP), a computational intelligence framework that integrates cooperative coevolution and the multiview learning paradigm to address classification challenges in high-dimensional and heterogeneous feature spaces. MEGP decomposes the input space into conditionally independent feature subsets, enabling multiple subpopulations to evolve in parallel while interacting through a dynamic ensemble-based fitness mechanism. Each individual encodes multiple genes whose outputs are aggregated via a differentiable softmax-based weighting layer, enhancing both model interpretability and adaptive decision fusion. A hybrid selection mechanism incorporating both isolated and ensemble-level fitness promotes inter-population cooperation while preserving intra-population diversity. This dual-level evolutionary dynamic facilitates structured search exploration and reduces premature convergence. Experimental evaluations across eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEGP consistently outperforms a baseline GP model in terms of convergence behavior and generalization performance. Comprehensive statistical analyses validate significant improvements in Log-Loss, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and AUC. MEGP also exhibits robust diversity retention and accelerated fitness gains throughout evolution, highlighting its effectiveness for scalable, ensemble-driven evolutionary learning. By unifying population-based optimization, multi-view representation learning, and cooperative coevolution, MEGP contributes a structurally adaptive and interpretable framework that advances emerging directions in evolutionary machine learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19821">Fully Tensorized GPU-accelerated Multi-population Evolutionary Algorithm for Constrained Multiobjective Optimization Problems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.19821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real world constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs) are prevalent and often come with stringent time-sensitive requirements. However, most contemporary constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) suffer from a number of drawbacks, including complex designs, low computational efficiency, and long convergence times, which are particularly pronounced when addressing time-sensitive CMOPs. Although research on accelerating evolutionary algorithms using GPU parallelism has advanced, existing CMOEAs still face significant limitations within GPU frameworks. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a GPU-accelerated multi-population evolutionary algorithm, termed GMPEA. We first systematically analyze the performance bottlenecks of representative CMOEAs when implemented in a GPU environment. To address the trade-off between computational speed and solution performance, GMPEA introduces a decomposition-based multi-population approach that is fully parallelized across its entire workflow. We conducted comparative experiments on various benchmark tests and real world applications: the Weapon Target Assignment Problems. The results demonstrate that GMPEA achieves competitive performance even without time constraints, while its computational speed significantly surpasses that of the compared algorithms. More critically, under a strict time limit, the performance of GMPEA drastically outperforms its counterparts. This work provides compelling evidence of GMPEA's superiority in solving time-sensitive CMOPs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20049">Projective Kolmogorov Arnold Neural Networks (P-KANs): Entropy-Driven Functional Space Discovery for Interpretable Machine Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.20049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) relocate learnable nonlinearities from nodes to edges, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in scientific machine learning and interpretable modeling. However, current KAN implementations suffer from fundamental inefficiencies due to redundancy in high-dimensional spline parameter spaces, where numerous distinct parameterisations yield functionally equivalent behaviors. This redundancy manifests as a "nuisance space" in the model's Jacobian, leading to susceptibility to overfitting and poor generalization. We introduce Projective Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (P-KANs), a novel training framework that guides edge function discovery towards interpretable functional representations through entropy-minimisation techniques from signal analysis and sparse dictionary learning. Rather than constraining functions to predetermined spaces, our approach maintains spline space flexibility while introducing "gravitational" terms that encourage convergence towards optimal functional representations. Our key insight recognizes that optimal representations can be identified through entropy analysis of projection coefficients, compressing edge functions to lower-parameter projective spaces (Fourier, Chebyshev, Bessel). P-KANs demonstrate superior performance across multiple domains, achieving up to 80% parameter reduction while maintaining representational capacity, significantly improved robustness to noise compared to standard KANs, and successful application to industrial automated fiber placement prediction. Our approach enables automatic discovery of mixed functional representations where different edges converge to different optimal spaces, providing both compression benefits and enhanced interpretability for scientific machine learning applications.

                arXiv:2509.20284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing biologically plausible learning algorithms that can achieve performance comparable to error backpropagation remains a longstanding challenge. Existing approaches often compromise biological plausibility by entirely avoiding the use of spikes for error propagation or relying on both positive and negative learning signals, while the question of how spikes can represent negative values remains unresolved. To address these limitations, we introduce Bidirectional Spike-based Distillation (BSD), a novel learning algorithm that jointly trains a feedforward and a backward spiking network. We formulate learning as a transformation between two spiking representations (i.e., stimulus encoding and concept encoding) so that the feedforward network implements perception and decision-making by mapping stimuli to actions, while the backward network supports memory recall by reconstructing stimuli from concept representations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks, including image recognition, image generation, and sequential regression, show that BSD achieves performance comparable to networks trained with classical error backpropagation. These findings represent a significant step toward biologically grounded, spike-driven learning in neural networks.

                arXiv:2509.20269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As deep neural networks are increasingly deployed in dynamic, real-world environments, relying on a single static model is often insufficient. Changes in input data distributions caused by sensor drift or lighting variations necessitate continual model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid training methodology that enables efficient on-device domain adaptation by combining the strengths of Backpropagation and Predictive Coding. The method begins with a deep neural network trained offline using Backpropagation to achieve high initial performance. Subsequently, Predictive Coding is employed for online adaptation, allowing the model to recover accuracy lost due to shifts in the input data distribution. This approach leverages the robustness of Backpropagation for initial representation learning and the computational efficiency of Predictive Coding for continual learning, making it particularly well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices or future neuromorphic accelerators. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that this hybrid strategy enables effective adaptation with a reduced computational overhead, offering a promising solution for maintaining model performance in dynamic environments.

                arXiv:2206.15238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Co-evolutionary algorithms have a wide range of applications, such as in hardware design, evolution of strategies for board games, and patching software bugs. However, these algorithms are poorly understood and applications are often limited by pathological behaviour, such as loss of gradient, relative over-generalisation, and mediocre objective stasis. It is an open challenge to develop a theory that can predict when co-evolutionary algorithms find solutions efficiently and reliable.
  This paper provides a first step in developing runtime analysis for population-based competitive co-evolutionary algorithms. We provide a mathematical framework for describing and reasoning about the performance of co-evolutionary processes. To illustrate the framework, we introduce a population-based co-evolutionary algorithm called \pdcoea, and prove that it obtains a solution to a bilinear maximin optimisation problem in expected polynomial time. Finally, we describe settings where \pdcoea needs exponential time with overwhelmingly high probability to obtain a solution.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08437">A Detection Region Method-Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Binary Constrained Multiobjective Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.08437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) is a challenging task. While many practical algorithms have been developed to tackle CMOPs, real-world scenarios often present cases where the constraint functions are unknown or unquantifiable, resulting in only binary outcomes (feasible or infeasible). This limitation reduces the effectiveness of constraint violation guidance, which can negatively impact the performance of existing algorithms that rely on this approach. Such challenges are particularly detrimental for algorithms employing the epsilon-based method, as they hinder effective relaxation of the feasible region. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel algorithm called DRMCMO based on the detection region method. In DRMCMO, detection regions dynamic monitor feasible solutions to enhance convergence, helping the population escape local optima. Additionally, these regions collaborate with the neighbor pairing strategy to improve population diversity within narrow feasible areas. We have modified three existing test suites to serve as benchmark test problems for CMOPs with binary constraints(CMOP/BC) and conducted comprehensive comparative experiments with state-of-the-art algorithms on these test suites and real-world problems. The results demonstrate the strong competitiveness of DRMCMO against state-of-the-art algorithms. Given the limited research on CMOP/BC, our study offers a new perspective for advancing this field.

Abstract: In the evolutionary computing community, the remarkable language-handling capabilities and reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the functionality of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), enabling them to tackle optimization problems involving structured language or program code. Although this field is still in its early stages, its impressive potential has led to the development of various LLM-based EAs. To effectively evaluate the performance and practical applicability of these LLM-based EAs, benchmarks with real-world relevance are essential. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based recommender systems (RSs) and introduce a benchmark problem set, named RSBench, specifically designed to assess the performance of LLM-based EAs in recommendation prompt optimization. RSBench emphasizes session-based recommendations, aiming to discover a set of Pareto optimal prompts that guide the recommendation process, providing accurate, diverse, and fair recommendations. We develop three LLM-based EAs based on established EA frameworks and experimentally evaluate their performance using RSBench. Our study offers valuable insights into the application of EAs in LLM-based RSs. Additionally, we explore key components that may influence the overall performance of the RS, providing meaningful guidance for future research on the development of LLM-based EAs in RSs. The source code of the proposed RSBench can be found at https://github.com/LiuJ-2023/RSBench/tree/main.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15147">The Iterative Chainlet Partitioning Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone and Neural Acceleration</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.15147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces the Iterative Chainlet Partitioning (ICP) algorithm and its neural acceleration for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone (TSP-D). The proposed ICP algorithm decomposes a TSP-D solution into smaller segments called chainlets, each optimized individually by a dynamic programming subroutine. The chainlet with the highest improvement is updated, and the procedure is repeated until no further improvement is possible. We show that the subroutine runs in quadratic time and the number of subroutine calls is bounded linearly in problem size for the first iteration and remains constant in subsequent iterations, ensuring algorithmic scalability. Empirical results show that ICP outperforms existing algorithms in both solution quality and computational time. Tested over 1,249 benchmark instances, ICP yields an average improvement of 2.6\% in solution quality over the previous state-of-the-art algorithm while reducing computational time by 91.3\%. The procedure is deterministic, ensuring reliability without requiring multiple runs. The subroutine is the computational bottleneck in the already efficient ICP algorithm. To reduce the necessity of subroutine calls, we integrate a graph neural network (GNN) to predict incremental improvements. We demonstrate that the resulting Neuro ICP (NICP) achieves substantial acceleration while maintaining solution quality. Compared to ICP, NICP reduces the total computational time by 28.6\%, while the objective function value increase is limited to 0.14\%. A transfer learning framework enables efficient extension to various operational constraints, making this a valuable foundation for developing efficient algorithms for truck-drone synchronized routing problems.

">Calpain-2 inhibition or deletion enhances levels of the transcription Factor, MEIS2, and stimulates neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Neurogenesis takes place in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus of many adult mammalian species. Recent findings indicate that calpain-2 could participate in neurogenesis regulation through the truncation of the transcription factor, Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 2 (MEIS2). The present study aimed to test the effects of calpain-2 inhibition/deletion on MEIS2 levels and neurogenesis in adult mice. Two-to-three month-old mice were injected with a selective calpain-2 inhibitor, NA-184, and sacrificed 24 h later. In addition, two-to-three month-old conditional calpain-2 knock-out (C2KO) and calpain-1 knock-out (C1KO) mice were used. Levels of MEIS2 and of cell markers for neurogenesis were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and western blots. Dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons were also analyzed by Golgi staining. Acute treatment of wild-type (WT) mice with NA-184 increased levels of MEIS2 in various brain structures. It also increased numbers of neurons immunopositive for Ki67 and DCX, two markers for neurogenesis, in both the SVZ and DG. MEIS2 levels were elevated in C2KO mouse brain, while they were decreased in C1KO mouse brain. Compared to those in WT mice, neurons from C2KO mice exhibited a decrease in the number of filipodia spines and an increase in the number of mushroom spines, while those from C1KO exhibited opposite changes. These findings further emphasize the critical and opposite roles of calpain-1 and calpain-2 in brain functions in general, and in neurogenesis in particular with MEIS2 as a major downstream mediator. These findings also underline previous conclusions that calpain-1 promotes spine maturation and synaptic plasticity while calpain-2 hinders spine maturation and synaptic plasticity. These results indicate that calpain-2 inhibition/deletion results in increased neurogenesis, as well as in increased maturation of dendritic spines, potentially due to increased levels and activation of MEIS2.

                <p>Perisynaptic astroglia provide critical molecular and structural support to regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity in the nanodomain of the axon&ndash;spine interface. Three-dimensional reconstruction from serial section electron microscopy (3DEM) was used to investigate relationships between perisynaptic astroglia and dendritic spine synapses undergoing plasticity in the adult hippocampus. Delta-burst stimulation (DBS) of the medial perforant pathway induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the middle molecular layer and concurrent long-term depression (cLTD) in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in awake male rats. The contralateral hippocampus received baseline stimulation as a within-animal control. Brains were obtained 30&nbsp;min or 2&nbsp;h after DBS onset. An automated 3DEM pipeline was developed to enable unbiased quantification of astroglial coverage at the perimeter of the axon&ndash;spine interface. Under all conditions, &gt;85% of synapses had perisynaptic astroglia processes within 120&nbsp;nm of some portion of the perimeter. LTP broadened the distribution of spine sizes while reducing the presence and proximity of perisynaptic astroglia near the axon&ndash;spine interface of large spines. In contrast, cLTD transiently reduced the length of the axon&ndash;spine interface perimeter without substantially altering astroglial apposition. The postsynaptic density was discovered to be displaced from the center of the axon&ndash;spine interface, with this offset increasing during LTP and decreasing during cLTD. Astroglial access to the postsynaptic density was diminished during LTP and enhanced during cLTD, in parallel with changes in spine size. Thus, access of perisynaptic astroglia to synapses is dynamically modulated during LTP and cLTD alongside synaptic remodeling.</p>

                <p>Aggressive behavior can be acquired through observation, providing adaptive advantages but also posing significant social risks. In humans, individuals repeatedly exposed to aggression are more likely to engage in violent behavior later in life. Yet, the environmental factors and neural mechanisms underlying observationally acquired aggression remain unclear. Here, we propose that social familiarity with an aggressor is critical for activating neural circuits in observers that primes aggression. To investigate this, we established a novel behavioral paradigm termed "socially transmitted aggression (STA)," in which witness mice observed either familiar or unfamiliar demonstrators attacking intruder mice. Remarkably, male, but not female, witnesses displayed increased aggression only after observing familiar demonstrators, with no effect from unfamiliar ones. Given that excitatory neurons in the posterior&ndash;ventral segment of the medial amygdala (MeApv) have been implicated in aggression priming, we hypothesized these neurons might be involved in STA as well. Supporting this hypothesis, fiber photometry revealed selective activation of excitatory MeApv neurons during familiar, but not unfamiliar, demonstrator attacks. Chemogenetically and optogenetically inhibiting these neurons suppressed STA, while activating them during unfamiliar demonstrator attacks promoted aggression. These results establish social familiarity as essential for the observational transmission of aggression and identify excitatory MeApv neurons as critical mediators of this phenomenon, offering potential avenues for clinical intervention.</p>

                <p>Attention can be deployed in advance of visual stimuli based on features such as color or direction of motion. This anticipatory feature-based attention involves top-down neural control signals from the frontoparietal network that bias visual cortex to enhance attended information and suppress distraction. For example, anticipatory attention control can enable effective selection based on stimulus color while ignoring distracting information about stimulus motion. Anticipatory attention can also be focused more narrowly, for example, to select specific colors or motion directions that define task-relevant aspects of the stimuli. One important question that remains open is whether anticipatory attention control first biases broad feature dimensions such as color versus motion before biasing the specific feature attributes (e.g., blue vs green). To investigate this, we recorded EEG activity during a task where human participants of either sex were cued to either attend to a motion direction (up or down) or a color (blue or green) on a trial-by-trial basis. Applying multivariate decoding approaches to the EEG alpha band activity (8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) during attention control (cue-target interval), we observed significant decoding for both the attended dimensions (motion vs color) and specific feature attributes (up vs down; blue vs green). Importantly, the temporal onset of the dimension-level biasing (motion vs color) preceded that of the attribute-level biasing (up vs down and blue vs green). These findings demonstrate that the top-down control of feature-based attention proceeds in a hierarchical fashion, first biasing the broad feature dimension, and then narrowing to the specific feature attribute.</p>

                <p>The human brain must add information to the acoustic speech signal in order to understand language. Many accounts propose that the prosodic structure of utterances (including their syllabic rhythm and speech melody), in combination with stored lexical knowledge, cue and interact with higher order abstract semantic and syntactic information. While cortical rhythms, particularly in the delta and theta band, synchronize to quasi-rhythmic low-level acoustic speech features, it remains unclear how the human brain encodes abstract speech properties in neural rhythms in the absence of an acoustic signal, i.e., when speakers hold planned sentences in working memory. This study disentangles the contributions of prosodic and syntactic features in cortical rhythms during delayed sentence repetition. Using high-resolution ECoG during awake tumor surgery in the left perisylvian cortex in nine patients (five female), we show that the phase of neural rhythms with frequencies ranging from 1 to 48&nbsp;Hz and the broadband gamma power envelope code both low-level acoustic and abstract syntactic speech features during sentence processing and retention. Syntax and prosody coding occurred in the same frequency bands, which argues against the assumption of different frequency channels for processing and representing these speech features. Our data suggest the brain leverages the phase of various neural rhythms to code both acoustic and abstract linguistic features.</p>

                <p>Much research has focused on how perceptual, cognitive, and attentional processes modulate microsaccades, the small rapid gaze shifts that humans perform when attempting to maintain steady gaze on a point. Yet the reasons why these fixational saccades occur in the first place have remained unclear. Long-standing theories have argued for either spatial (i.e., gaze centering) or temporal mechanisms (i.e., a periodical release process). However, this debate has never been resolved, primarily because of uncertainty in determining where the observer looks. Whereas modern eye-trackers enable detection of small eye movements, accurate localization of the line of sight remains challenging. Here, rather than indirectly inferring gaze position from oculomotor activity, we used a gaze-contingent procedure to directly estimate the perceived center of the visual field, a method that has been previously shown to effectively reduce uncertainty. Our results from subjects of both sexes show that the generation of fixational saccades depends on the interaction of spatial and temporal factors. Fixational saccades are remarkably accurate in correcting for fixation errors, even when gaze is minimally displaced. However, fixational saccades also occur when gaze is centered, but their latency increases as the fixation error decreases. These results suggest that fixational saccades serve an important corrective function when needed, but they can only be avoided for a limited period of time when fixation is already accurate.</p>

                <p>In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) motor cortex, hyperexcitability is detected in both familial and sporadic cases, suggesting its centrality in the ALS phenotype; the underlying mechanisms, however, remain largely obscure. Here we utilize male and female UCHL1-eGFP (UeGFP) mice, in which the corticospinal neurons of the motor cortex are labeled with green fluorescent protein, to investigate the intrinsic excitability and synaptic inhibitory inputs on distinct neuron populations in WT-UeGFP and presymptomatic AlsinKO-UeGFP mice, which lack Alsin function and are a well-characterized mouse model for juvenile cases of ALS. We show that in the motor cortex of AlsinKO-UeGFP mice, eGFP-positive layer 5 pyramidal neurons, which represent upper motor neurons, show a decrease in intrinsic excitability compared with WT, whereas the electrophysiological properties of eGFP-negative cells, which identify callosal projection neurons, are unaffected. This alteration in intrinsic excitability, however, is counterbalanced by a decrease in the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory currents due to a cell-specific reduction in the number of inhibitory synaptic contacts on upper motor neurons. Thus, the overall excitability of upper motor neurons only displays negligible changes despite large alterations in intrinsic excitability and inhibitory synaptic input, which may explain why mice do not exhibit a prominent motor phenotype. The presence of this homeostatic interaction between intrinsic excitability and synaptic inhibition raises the question of which of the two changes is primary, and which is secondary, and shows that decreased function of motor cortex interneurons is an early event in ALS with Alsin mutations.</p>

                <p>Finding what you are looking for is a ubiquitous task in everyday life that relies on a two-way comparison between what is currently viewed and internal search goals held in memory. Despite a wealth of studies tracking visual verification among external contents of perception, complementary verification processes among internal contents of memory remain elusive. Building on a recently established gaze marker of internal visual focusing in working memory, we uncover the internal inspection process associated with confirming or dismissing potential search targets. We show how male and female human participants "look back" into working memory when faced with external stimuli that are perceived as potential targets and link such internal inspection to the time needed for visual verification. A direct comparison between visual verification among the contents of working memory or perception further revealed how verification in both domains engages frontal theta activity in scalp electroencephalography but also how mnemonic verification is slower to deploy than perceptual verification. This establishes internal verification as an integral component of visual search and provides new ways to look into this underexplored component of human search behavior.</p>

                <p>Changes in emotion recognition are observed in aging, in dementia, after brain lesions and as a function of mental health factors, such as depression. In aging, older adults have been argued to show a "positivity bias," which has been associated with a relatively spared recognition accuracy for positive emotion and an increased tendency to label emotions as positive. This bias has been suggested to support mental well-being. However, it has also been found in association with cognitive decline and brain lesions. Here, we investigated the behavioral and brain correlates of this age-related positivity bias. We used multimodal brain imaging in a large group of human adults (<I>n</I> = 665, 333 females) drawn from a population-derived cohort across the lifespan, together with a psychometric analysis of an emotion recognition task using facial expressions. Beyond reductions in expression recognition accuracy, older adults showed increased perceptual thresholds for negative emotions and a reduced threshold for the positive emotion, even after accounting for general face recognition abilities. This positivity bias in labeling emotions was strongly associated with lower cognitive performance in older people, but not with (nonclinical) depressive symptoms. It was also associated with reduced gray matter volume in the bilateral anterior hippocampus&ndash;amygdala and increased functional connectivity between these regions and the orbitofrontal cortex. Together, age-related positivity bias is associated with cognitive decline and structural and functional brain differences. A positivity bias in emotion recognition may therefore reflect an early marker of neurodegeneration, a hypothesis that could be tested in future longitudinal studies.</p>

                <p>Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) face an increased risk of cognitive impairment, dementia, and stroke. While white matter (WM) lesions are frequently reported in patients with CAD, the effects on WM microstructure alterations remain largely unknown. We aimed to identify WM microstructural alterations in individuals with CAD compared with healthy controls (HC) and to examine their relationships with cognitive performance. Forty-three (43) patients with CAD (35 males and 8 females) and 36 HC (26 males and 10 females) aged 50 and older underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing and multimodal 3&nbsp;T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A novel multivariate approach&mdash;the Mahalanobis distance (D2)&mdash;was used to quantify WM abnormalities as the amount of deviation from the HC reference group. D2 integrates multiple MRI-derived diffusion-weighted imaging, R1 relaxometry, and magnetization transfer imaging metrics, while accounting for covariance between metrics. Relationships between WM D2 and cognition (executive function and processing speed) were also assessed. Compared with HCs, patients with CAD had higher D2 values in the whole WM (<I>p</I> = 0.015) and in the right anterior and bilateral middle cerebral artery territories (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05). Myelin-sensitive metrics, particularly R1 relaxation rate and MT saturation, were the most important contributors to D2. Processing speed was positively associated with greater R1 in both the whole WM and left middle cerebral artery territory. These findings suggest that greater WM microstructural alterations observed in patients with CAD were mainly driven by differences in myelin content. These alterations may contribute to a heightened risk of cognitive impairment.</p>

                <p>The early onset of peripheral deafness significantly alters the proper development of the auditory system. Likewise, exposure to loud noise during early development produces a similar disruptive effect. Before hearing onset in altricial mammals, cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) exhibit spontaneous electrical activity that drives auditory circuit development. This activity is modulated by medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent feedback through &alpha;9&alpha;10 nicotinic cholinergic receptors in IHCs. In adults, these receptors are restricted to outer hair cells, where they mediate MOC feedback to regulate cochlear amplification. Although the MOC system's protective role to prevent noise-induced hearing loss in adulthood is well established, its influence during early developmental stages&mdash;especially in response to exposure to loud noise&mdash;remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the role of MOC feedback during early postnatal development using &alpha;9 knock-out (KO) and &alpha;9 knock-in (KI) mice of either sex, which respectively lack or exhibit enhanced cholinergic activity. Our findings reveal that both increased and absent olivocochlear activity result in altered auditory sensitivity at the onset of hearing, along with long-range alterations in the number and morphology of ribbon synapses. Early noise exposure caused lasting auditory damage in both wild-type and &alpha;9KO mice, with deficits persisting into adulthood. In contrast, &alpha;9KI mice were protected from noise-induced damage, with no long-term effects on auditory function. These results highlight the increased susceptibility of the auditory system during early postnatal development. Moreover, they indicate that an enhanced MOC feedback shields the auditory system from noise damage during this period.</p>

[version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Medicinal plants play a crucial role in pharmacological research, as many pharmaceutical companies rely on them for raw materials. Collard greens, also known as “Sukuma wiki,” are a member of the Brassica oleracea var. viridis family and are known for their medicinal properties. The aim of this study was to identify phytochemicals in the ethanol extract of collard green leaves that has traditional use in treating male infertility in Uganda. Method The leaves were dried and crushed into fine powder and the powdered leaves (800 g) A was cold macerated in 5 liters of 99% ethanol (1:5 w/v) for 72 hours in sterile glass container. The ethanol extract (5g) was subjected to Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Results Phytochemical analysis of the Ethanol extract from Brassica oleracea var. viridis (Collard green) leaves revealed the presence of various compounds, including flavonoids, alkaloids, phenolic compounds, fatty acids, and terpenoids. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified 77 bioactive compounds, such as 2-Methoxy-4-vinylphenol, 2, 7-Dimethyl-1, 7-octadien-3-amine, Octadecanoic acid, 9, 12, 15-Octadecatrienoic acid, Pentadecanoic acid, and several phenolic derivatives. Conclusion In conclusion, the phytochemicals identified in Brassica oleracea var. viridis (Collard greens), including Phytol, Omega-3 fatty acids, phenols, flavonoids, and sterols, demonstrate potential benefits for enhancing male fertility and reproductive health. These phytochemicals exert their beneficial action through their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and possibly neuroprotective properties. There is need for further research to establish the effectiveness of these phytochemicals in clinical settings and provide concrete guidelines for their use in treating male infertility.

                Background Early and accurate prediction of Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) is critical to reducing cardiovascular mortality through timely intervention. While deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in disease prediction, many lack interpretability, generalizability, and fairness—particularly when deployed across demographically diverse populations. These shortcomings limit clinical adoption and risk reinforcing healthcare disparities. Methods This study proposes a novel model: X-TLRABiLSTM (Explainable Transfer Learning–based Residual Attention Bidirectional LSTM). The architecture integrates transfer learning from pre-trained cardiovascular models into a BiLSTM framework with residual attention layers to improve temporal feature extraction and convergence. To ensure transparency, the model incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify the contribution of each clinical feature to the final prediction. Additionally, a demographic reweighting strategy is applied to the training process to reduce bias across subgroups defined by age, gender, and ethnicity. The model was evaluated on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 10-fold cross-validation. Results The X-TLRABiLSTM model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.2%, with an F1-score of 98.1% and an AUC of 99.1%, outperforming standard ML classifiers and state-of-the-art DL baselines. SHAP-based interpretability analysis highlighted clinically relevant predictors such as chest pain type, ST depression, and thalassemia. A fairness-aware reweighting strategy was applied during training, and fairness evaluation revealed minimal performance disparity across demographic subgroups, with F1-score gaps ≤ 0.6% and error rate gaps ≤ 0.4%. Confusion matrix analysis demonstrated low false-positive and false-negative rates, reinforcing the model’s reliability for clinical deployment. Conclusions X-TLRABiLSTM offers a highly accurate, interpretable, and demographically fair framework for IHD prognosis. By combining transfer learning, residual attention, explainable AI, and fairness-aware optimization, this model advances trustworthy AI in healthcare. Its successful performance on benchmark clinical data supports its potential for real-world integration in ethical, AI-assisted cardiovascular diagnostics.

                Background Corporate markups have risen markedly since the 1980s, widening the gap between profits and wages and fuelling income inequality. Counterbalance Economics (CBE) converts a portion of those markup rents into firm-redeemable vouchers for low-income households, promising redistribution without incurring large public budgets. This paper tests whether in-kind financed voucher scheme can neutralise the inequality effect of markups across advanced and emerging OECD economies. Methodology We assemble an unbalanced panel of 12 countries (1982–2016) that combines Study/World Bank Gini indices with De Loecker–Eeckhout aggregate markups, macro controls (log GDP per capita, terms of trade, R&D intensity, unemployment) and a newly coded CBE dummy capturing six staggered adoptions of mark-up-funded voucher programmes. A two-way fixed-effects difference-in-differences model estimates the causal impact of markups, CBE, and their interaction on inequality, controlling for country–clustered errors. Results In the absence of a policy, a 10-percentage-point rise in markups increases the Gini coefficient by 1.23 points. Where CBE is in force, the interaction term turns significantly negative implying the same markup increase now lowers the Gini by 2.9 points. Disaggregating the data reveals a more minor but still significant reduction in developed economies and a larger effect in emerging economies, consistent with higher initial inequality and weaker traditional safety nets. Placebo and pre-trend tests detect no spurious effects, and synthetic-control replications for early adopters confirm the magnitude of the effect. Conclusions Markup rents are a potent driver of inequality, yet a modest, rule-based in-kind mechanism that recycles those rents into vouchers can more than offset their distributive harm. CBE, therefore, offers policymakers a scalable, market-compatible complement to progressive taxation—especially valuable in emerging economies where fiscal capacity is limited. Future research should pair industry-level markups with micro-data on voucher use to refine targeting and assess long-run growth effects.

                Obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women are associated with significant reproductive dysfunction, manifesting as hormonal imbalances, anovulation, and subfertility. These conditions not only impair reproductive outcomes but also contribute to a reduced quality of life. Crucially, obesity and PCOS share a bidirectional relationship. While obesity can trigger and worsen PCOS manifestations, the convergence of these two conditions has contributed significantly to the growing incidence of female infertility. This review critically examines liraglutide’s mechanistic role and therapeutic potential in mediating metabolic restoration and improving the fertility outcomes in women burdened by obesity and PCOS. A literature search was conducted in original databases until March 2025 in PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science using the following keywords pertinently: ‘obesity’, ‘GLP-1R’, ‘liraglutide’, ‘female reproductive system’, ‘polycystic ovarian syndrome’, ‘ovarian function’, and ‘pregnancy outcomes’. Accumulated evidence suggests that liraglutide promotes greater weight loss and improves reproductive outcomes in women with obesity and PCOS by regulating endocrine parameters, reducing systemic inflammation, restoring menstrual cyclicity, and supporting folliculogenesis. It improves reproductive outcomes by increasing natural conception rates and improving responses to assisted reproductive techniques (ART). However, with all the positive outcomes, the major limitations using this drug for weight loss are the need for daily subcutaneous injections, cost, and gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term assessment of the sustained efficacy and impact on reproductive outcomes, including the pattern of ovulation and offspring health, is warranted. This review consolidated present findings and emphasized areas for further exploration to better inform clinical decision-making and future research directions.

                Background Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) diagnosis relies on observing acute neurological signs including loss of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia, confusion and transient motor signs. Current guidelines assume real-time observation, creating systematic underdiagnosis when emergency medical services (EMS) arrival exceeds transient qualifying sign duration—particularly problematic in rural systems with transport delays. Objective To model the missed-diagnosis window — the probability that qualifying signs resolve before first medical contact. Methods We synthesized published EMS response distributions, acute neurological sign durations, and consensus guideline criteria to model the missed-diagnosis window—the probability that qualifying signs resolve before first medical contact. Analysis incorporated systematic review evidence from 37 studies (n=239,464,121 patients). Results Critical neurological signs resolve rapidly: median loss of consciousness <1 minute, altered mental status ~5 minutes, brief post-traumatic amnesia <30 minutes. EMS arrival approximates 15 minutes (urban) versus 25 minutes (rural). This temporal mismatch produces P (missed diagnosis) >0.70 in rural systems when arrival exceeds 20 minutes—representing systematic 70% underdiagnosis where guidelines default to “sign absent” rather than “sign unobserved.” Conclusions Implementing time-sensitive, retrospective, and telehealth-supported pathways within existing EMS protocols is both feasible and defensible, reducing missed diagnoses of mild traumatic brain injury in rural settings. By addressing EMS delays directly, this approach strengthens diagnostic accuracy, advances equity in rural health, and moves toward a new standard of care in emergency medicine.

                Background With rising health awareness and achieving SDGs on improve nutrition for all at all ages, consumers are increasingly seeking functional foods that offer nutritional benefits beyond basic sustenance. Edible gel beads enriched with nutrients represent an innovative option in the functional food market. However, limited research exists on consumer attitudes and the factors driving their purchase intention for such products. Objective This study aims to explore consumer attitudes and identify the key factors that influence the purchase intention of nutrient-enriched edible gel beads. Methodology A quantitative research approach was employed using a questionnaire distributed to 256 participants. This research was approved by the Human Research Ethics Review Committee, Multi-Institutional Group No.1, Chulalongkorn University COA No.165/67, Belmont Report 1979, Declaration of Helsinki 2013, Council for International organization of Medical Sciences (CIOM) 2016. The survey measured variables such as product knowledge, health consciousness, perceived benefits, price sensitivity, and attitude toward the product. Data were analyzed to identify significant predictors of purchase intention. Result The study confirms that Thai consumers’ purchase intentions for nutrient-enriched edible gel beads are strongly influenced by perceived health benefits, trust in health claims, and product attributes such as taste and labeling. Demographic factors like gender and education also play a role. These insights underscore opportunities for product innovation and targeted marketing, while highlighting the need for clearer labeling and broader consumer education to support informed health choices. Unique Contribution This research contributes to the emerging body of knowledge on functional food products by highlighting the specific psychological and economic factors that shape consumer behavior toward innovative health-oriented foods in the Thai context.

                Abstract* The Global Artery Project (GAP) launched by the Institute of Continuing Medical Education (ICME) in Cote d’Ivoire, a West African country aims to fill the gap between needs and contributions in the knowledge, diagnosis, and management of acquired degenerative arterial diseases. This project will have a progressive implementation in three phases and will focus on the main arterial diseases caused by atherosclerosis and mediacalcosis. It will concern Peripheral Artery Diseases, Coronary Artery Diseases and Carotid Artery Stenosis. Thus, we will have Phase -1 dedicated to Peripheral Artery Diseases (PAD), Phase -2 dedicated to Coronary Artery Diseases (CAD), and Phase -3 dedicated to Carotid Artery Stenosis (CAS). This protocol is related to Phase-1 and aims to set out objectives by explaining the actions to be taken, the rationale, and the tactics of these objectives.

                <p>by Joshua Looker, Kat S. Rock, Louise Dyson</p>

The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has had catastrophic effects on public health and economies. Around the world, many countries employed modelling efforts to help guide pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures designed to reduce the spread of the virus. Modelling efforts for future pandemics could use the theory of early warning signals (EWS), which aims to predict ‘critical transitions’ in complex dynamical systems. In infectious disease systems, such transitions correspond to (re-)emergence, peaks and troughs in infections which can be indirectly observed through the reported case data. There is increasing evidence that including EWS in modelling can help improve responses to upcoming increases or decreases in case reporting. Here, we present both theoretical and data-driven analyses of the suitability of EWS to predict epidemic transitions in reported case data. We derive analytical statistics for a variety of infectious disease models and show, through stochastic simulations of different modelling scenarios, the applicability of EWS in such contexts. Using the COVID-19 reported case dataset from the United Kingdom, we demonstrate the performance of a range of temporal and spatial statistics to anticipate transitions in the case data. Finally, we also investigate the applicability of using EWS analysis of hospitalisation data to anticipate transitions in the corresponding case data. Together, our findings indicate that EWS analysis could be a vital addition to future modelling analysis for real-world infection data.

Energy metabolism is essential to brain function, but its study is experimentally challenging. Similarly, biologically accurate computational models are too complex for simple investigations. Here, we analyse an experimentally-calibrated multiscale model of human brain energy metabolism using Computational Singular Perturbation. This approach leads to the novel identification of functional periods during and after synaptic activation, and highlights the central reactions and metabolites controlling the system’s behaviour within those periods. We identify a key role for both oxidative and glycolytic astrocytic metabolism in driving the brain’s metabolic circuitry. We also identify phosphocreatine as the main endogenous energy supply to brain cells, and propose revising our view of brain energy metabolism accordingly. Our approach highlights the importance of glial cells in brain metabolism, and introduces a systematic and unbiased methodology to study the dynamics of complex biochemical networks that can be scaled, in principle, to metabolic networks of any size and complexity.

                <p>by Bevelynn Whaler, Grant Lythe, Joseph J. Gillard, Thomas R. Laws, Jonathan Carruthers, Thomas Finnie, Carmen Molina-París, Martín López-García</p>

We present a mathematical model of the dynamics of <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> bacteria within the lymph nodes and blood of a host, following inhalation of an initial dose of spores. We also incorporate the dynamics of protective antigen, which is the binding component of the anthrax toxin produced by the bacteria. The model offers a mechanistic description of the early infection dynamics of inhalational anthrax, while its stochastic nature allows us to study the probabilities of different outcomes (for example, how likely it is that the infection will be cleared for a given inhaled dose of spores) in order to explain dose-response data for inhalational anthrax. The model is calibrated via a Bayesian approach, using <i>in vivo</i> data from New Zealand white rabbit and guinea pig infection studies, enabling within-host parameters to be estimated. We also leverage incubation-period data from the Sverdlovsk 1979 anthrax outbreak to show that the model can accurately describe human time-to-symptoms data under reasonable parameter regimes. Finally, we derive a simple approximate formula for the probability of symptom onset before time <i>t</i>, assuming that the number of inhaled spores has a Poisson distribution.

                <p>by Delaney E. Miller, Ashley E. Brown, Nicholas A. Bianco, Rucha Bhise, Scott L. Delp, Steven H. Collins</p>

For individuals with knee osteoarthritis, increased knee loading is linked to disease progression and pain. Some approaches to treating osteoarthritis, such as specialized footwear, braces, and powered exoskeletons, also increase the mass of the lower limbs, which could lead to increases in knee loads. Prior studies have investigated the effect of changes in torso mass and total body mass on peak knee contact forces, but the effects of increased leg mass remain unclear. In this study, we created musculoskeletal simulations informed by experimental data to estimate tibiofemoral knee contact force under different lower-limb segment mass conditions. The mass of the foot, shank, and thigh were varied by adding weights to each segment, separately and concurrently, as healthy young adults (N = 10) walked on a treadmill. Kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity were recorded. Our simulations used an optimal control framework that enforced experimental kinematics while minimizing a combination of net joint moment errors and mismatch between measured and estimated muscle activity. The simulations revealed that adding mass to the lower-limb segments linearly increased early- and late-stance peaks in knee contact force, but that the slope of this relationship was different for each peak and each mass placement location. For each 1% of body weight (BW) added per limb (2% BW total) at the thigh, shank, and foot, early-stance peak knee contact force increased by 1.5%, 2.1%, and 5.9% (<i>r</i> = 0.71), while late-stance peak contact force increased by 1.6%, 0.9% and 3.0% (<i>r</i> = 0.67), respectively. Adding mass to the thigh and shank increases peak contact force at or below the rate of increase in body mass, while adding mass to the foot disproportionately increases peak knee contact force. These detrimental effects should be considered when designing interventions for osteoarthritis.

                <p>by Jennifer Snoozy, Sushila Bhattacharya, Brandon Johnson, Robin R. Fettig, Ashley Van Asma, Chloe Brede, Sophia G. Miller, Martina Ralle, Kurt Warnhoff</p>

Xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) is a molybdenum cofactor (Moco) requiring enzyme that catabolizes hypoxanthine into xanthine and xanthine into uric acid, the final steps in purine catabolism. Human patients with mutations in XDH develop xanthinuria which can lead to xanthine stones in the kidney, recurrent urinary tract infections, and renal failure. Currently, there are no therapies for treating human XDH deficiency. Thus, understanding mechanisms that maintain purine homeostasis is an important goal of human health. Here, we used the nematode Caenorhabditis <i>elegans</i> to model human XDH deficiency using two clinically relevant paradigms: Moco deficiency or loss-of-function mutations in <i>xdh-1</i>, the <i>C. elegans</i> ortholog of XDH<i>.</i> Both Moco deficiency and <i>xdh-1</i> loss of function caused the formation of autofluorescent xanthine stones in <i>C. elegans</i>. Surprisingly, only 2% of <i>xdh-1</i> null mutant <i>C. elegans</i> developed a xanthine stone, suggesting additional pathways may regulate this process. To uncover such pathways, we performed a forward genetic screen for mutations that enhance the penetrance of xanthine stone formation in <i>xdh-1</i> null mutant <i>C. elegans</i>. We isolated multiple loss-of-function mutations in the gene <i>sulp-4</i> which encodes a sulfate permease homologous to human SLC26 anion exchange proteins. We demonstrated that SULP-4 acts cell-nonautonomously in the excretory cell to limit xanthine stone accumulation. Interestingly, <i>sulp-4</i> mutant phenotypes were suppressed by mutations in genes that encode for cystathionase (<i>cth-2)</i> or cysteine dioxygenase (<i>cdo-1</i>), members of the sulfur amino acid catabolism pathway required for production of sulfate, a substrate of SULP-4. We propose that sulfate accumulation caused by <i>sulp-4</i> loss of function promotes xanthine stone accumulation. We speculate that sulfate accumulation causes osmotic imbalance, creating conditions in the intestinal lumen that favor xanthine stone accumulation. Supporting this model, a mutation in <i>osm-8</i> that constitutively activates the osmotic stress response also promoted xanthine stone accumulation in an <i>xdh-1</i> mutant background. Thus, our work establishes a <i>C. elegans</i> model for human XDH deficiency and identifies the sulfate permease <i>sulp-4</i> as a critical player controlling xanthine stone accumulation.

Animals rely on innate and learned behavior to respond to their environment, but how the brain balances hardwired responses with adaptive flexibility remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that innate looming stimulus responses in <i>Mus musculus</i> can be attenuated via repeated unreinforced presentation. This attenuation is long-lasting and generalizing, but is rapidly recovered when the stimulus is paired with an electric foot-shock. Fiber photometry recordings reveal attenuation of responses to visual looming stimuli in the SC and PAG, which do not recover following recovery of behavioral responses. Analysis of c-Fos expression uncovered a ventral CA1 (vCA1) ensemble that is active during both innate and learned looming fear responses. We report that this vCA1 engram is not necessary for innate defensive behavior but is necessary for learned fear responses. These findings reveal a novel role of the hippocampus in adapting to looming stimuli, and provide a platform for understanding the interaction of memory and instinct.

Sharing knowledge is a basic tenet of the scientific community, yet publication bias arising from the reluctance or inability to publish negative or null results remains a long-standing and deep-seated problem, albeit one that varies in severity between disciplines and study types. Recognizing that previous endeavors to address the issue have been fragmentary and largely unsuccessful, this Consensus View proposes concrete and concerted measures that major stakeholders can take to create and incentivize new pathways for publishing negative results. Funders, research institutions, publishers, learned societies, and the research community all have a role in making this an achievable norm that will buttress public trust in science.

                Introduction Research suggests that scientific output may play a role in reducing mortality rates; however, this relationship has not been extensively explored at the national level. This observational study investigated the association between research output and mortality rates in Arab countries, focusing on the top ten causes of death. Methods Mortality rate data for the leading causes of death were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO). The research output on these causes was retrieved using the SCOPUS database through Python™, and weighted citation ratios were gathered from SciVal. Spearman’s correlation test, performed in R, was used to measure the relationship between the research output and mortality rates. Results Over the past two decades, research output has grown significantly in Arab countries. Most countries showed an inverse correlation between research output and mortality rates, indicating that increased research output coincided with lower mortality rates. However, four countries demonstrated statistically significant increases in mortality despite higher research output. Among these, Algeria and Morocco had the lowest overall research outputs. Public health challenges, including a high prevalence of heart disease and risk factors, along with poor adherence to non-communicable disease prevention guidelines, have contributed to the rising mortality in these countries. Conclusions The findings suggest that research output is associated with improved mortality outcomes in Arab countries. However, these exceptions highlight the importance of public health infrastructure and disease-prevention efforts. A national focus on biomedical research, combined with effective health policies, may help further reduce mortality rates in the region.

                Background This study used ChatGPT for sentiment analysis to investigate the possible links between online sentiments and COVID-19 vaccination rates. It also examines Internet posts to understand the attitudes and reasons associated with vaccine-related opinions. Methods We collected 500,558 posts over 60 weeks from the Blind platform, mainly used by working individuals, and 854 relevant posts were analyzed. After excluding duplicates and irrelevant content, attitudes toward and reasons for vaccine opinions were studied through sentiment analysis. The study further correlated these categorized attitudes with the actual vaccination data. Results The proportions of posts expressing positive, negative, and neutral attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines were 5%, 83%, and 12%, respectively. The total post count showed a positive correlation with the vaccination rate, indicating a high correlation between the number of negative posts about the vaccine and the vaccination rate. Negative attitudes were predominantly associated with societal distrust and perceived oppression. Conclusions This study demonstrates the interplay between public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines as expressed through social media and vaccination behavior. These correlations can serve as useful clues for devising effective vaccination strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1297/v2?src=rss">Chest Wall Hydatid Disease: Surgical management and risk Factors for Recurrence and Mortality [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Hydatidosis of the thoracic wall differs from other hydatid localizations in its pathophysiology, diagnostic, and therapeutic management. It is a little-studied entity. The objectives of our work were to describe its surgical management and to analyze the factors that may influence recurrence and mortality. Methods A retrospective, descriptive, longitudinal, and multicenter study on four university hospital surgical centers of Tunis, from January 1995 to December 2022 including operated hydatid cysts of the thoracic wall. Overall survival (OS) and cumulative recurrence rates were calculated. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify recurrence and mortality risk factors. Results Forty-nine patients were included. The mean age was 41 ± 17 years [8-76]. The main presenting sign was thoracic parietal swelling (n=22). Chest ultrasound and CT scan showed multivesicular formation in 17 and 33 cases, respectively. Muscle involvement was in the intercostal (n=4), paravertebral (n=13), and pectoralis major (n=3) muscles. Bone involvement was vertebral (n=11), costal (n=12), costo-vertebral (n=21) and sternal (n=2). A posterolateral thoracotomy was performed (n=20). Surgical excision at various levels of the chest wall with spinal stabilization (n=15) was performed. Sixty-three percent of the patients received antiparasitic medical treatment. Recurrence occurred in 37% of cases. Four patients died from hydatidosis-related complications. Factors could be independently associated with recurrence such as male gender, and vertebral involvement. The presence of a visceral hydatid cyst located at a distance from the parietal lesion at the time of diagnosis and the occurrence of postoperative infectious complications could increase mortality. Conclusions Chest wall hydatidosis represents a rare medical condition where surgery remains the preferred treatment modality. However, it carries a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality, influenced by various factors. Further large-scale studies are necessary to gain a deeper understanding of these factors and to optimize management strategies accordingly.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-49/v2?src=rss">Support Vector Machine-Based Prediction Model for Healthcare Workforce Transition Success Under Decentralization [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Objective To develop and validate predictive models for healthcare workforce transition success under decentralization using Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis and to identify key determinants across organizational support domains. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 430 healthcare personnel transferred from Ministry of Public Health facilities to Provincial Administrative Organizations in Thailand (2023–2024). Thirty-seven predictors, including demographics, benefits, and welfare domains, were analyzed. Four kernel functions were compared using 10-fold cross-validation, and feature importance was assessed. Class imbalance was addressed with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Results The linear kernel achieved superior cross-validated performance (accuracy: 69 ± 4%, sensitivity: 46 ± 5%, specificity: 82 ± 4%, AUC: 0.64). SMOTE improved sensitivity to 54 ± 5% while maintaining specificity at 79 ± 5%. Five stable predictors were identified across validation folds: competitive compensation (0.427), career development opportunities (0.358), fair promotion processes (0.336), hazardous work compensation (0.285), and educational leave opportunities (0.252). Comparative analysis showed that SVM outperformed logistic regression (66% accuracy), random forest (66%), and gradient boosting (65%). Conclusions This study represents the first application of machine learning techniques to predict healthcare personnel transition success in decentralization contexts. The SVM model effectively identified critical factors influencing workforce transitions, emphasizing the importance of balanced organizational support mechanisms. These findings provide evidence-based guidance for healthcare administrators implementing decentralization policies, offering generalizable insights for workforce management during health system reforms.

                Background This study delves into how university students in Ghana are using generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to boost their creative and critical thinking skills in academic tasks. Methods By employing a convergent parallel mixed-methods approach, we gathered quantitative survey data from 490 participants and complemented it with qualitative insights from semi-structured interviews. Results The results show that AI tools spark idea generation and enhance evaluative reasoning, while students still feel a strong sense of agency, often fine-tuning or dismissing AI suggestions based on their own understanding. Nonetheless, there are ongoing concerns about ethical limits, dependency on technology, and insufficient training. Conclusions The study wraps up by suggesting that AI serves best as a cognitive partner when users are equipped with solid digital literacy and ethical guidance. We also discuss the implications for teaching, theory, and policy, offering recommendations for creating learner-centred AI integration in education.

<p>Focused ultrasound (FUS) applied to the sciatic nerve in a rodent model of acute pain produced reversible inhibition of nociceptive, non-nociceptive sensory, and motor behaviors lasting up to 9 weeks. Nerve ultrastructure changes persisted for up to 24 weeks. These findings support FUS as a potential non-invasive method for peripheral nerve blockade to manage pain.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Focused ultrasound (FUS) holds potential to inhibit peripheral nerves to manage pain. We previously found FUS parameters resulting in changes to nerve structure and reversible increased mechanical withdrawal threshold as well as reversible inhibition of motor and non-pain sensory fibers. However, as behaviors were only followed for 4 weeks and structure for 2 weeks, the duration of increased thermal withdrawal latency and changes to nerve structure were undetermined. We investigated the duration of increased thermal withdrawal latency and nerve structure alterations after FUS application in an acute pain model. FUS was applied directly to the rat sciatic nerve prior to hindpaw (HP) incision; animal behaviors (thermal and mechanical nociceptive thresholds, HP extension and flexion) were assessed for 12 weeks and nerve structure was assessed for 28 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in HP thermal withdrawal latency. Secondary outcomes were the changes to sciatic nerve structure and HP mechanical withdrawal threshold, extension, and flexion. Compared with controls, after FUS application, animals had increased thermal nociceptive thresholds until week 9, increased mechanical nociceptive thresholds until week 2, decreased HP motor response until week 3.5, and decreased HP plantar sensation until week 4. Nerve ultrastructure changes may have persisted until week 24. In this new longer-term follow-up study, after invasive FUS application to the sciatic nerve in a rodent model of acute incisional pain, we determined the duration of changes to thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical hyperalgesia, motor, and non-pain sensory responses, and changes to nerve structure.</p>

                Using advanced transcriptomic and physiological profiling, the authors identified deep-layer long-range GABAergic projection neurons as the most disrupted neuronal subtype and key contributor to brain dysfunction in the 15q13.3 neuropsychiatric mouse model. Late-onset impairments in these neurons disrupted sleep, which was rescued by chemogenetic inhibition, offering mechanistic insight and therapeutic potential.

                Korah, Reveron-Thornton, and Fallah et al. show that a subset of cancer-associated fibroblasts in PDAC use MYD88 signaling to suppress antitumor immunity and promote tumor growth. Combining MYD88 inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade mitigates these effects, revealing new insights into stromal regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment.

                Gadek et al. show that embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma formation is defined by the presence of primary cilia and limits SHH pathway competency in early endothelial progenitor cells that disappear during embryonic development and differentiation. This potentially explains why rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and is rare in adults.

                Rominger et al. present a new autochthonous lung tumor model in which mutant RIT1 drives cancer together with p53 and Nf2 tumor suppressor gene loss. Transcriptomic and chromatin profiling shows that RIT1M90I promotes an EMT-like phenotype with high ZEB1 and AP-1 activity.

                Alkie et al. investigated the impacts of A(H5N1) from dairy cattle on other ruminants. The study shows that goats are highly susceptible to both bovine and avian strains, developing mastitis and shedding virus in milk and enabling transmission to offspring. Findings highlight the need for enhanced influenza surveillance in ruminant livestock.

                Jung et al. discovered that the critical regulator of blood cell development, GATA2, suppresses the activity of transcriptional enhancers that activate genes encoding key regulators of inflammatory signaling. This GATA2-dependent process to prevent ectopic inflammatory signaling illustrates an important intersection between GATA transcription factor and inflammatory mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106044">Dimerization and dynamics of human angiotensin-I converting enzyme revealed by cryo-EM and MD simulations</a></h4>

              
                Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) regulates the levels of disparate bioactive peptides, notably converting angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II and degrading amyloid beta. ACE is a heavily glycosylated dimer, containing four analogous catalytic sites, and exists in membrane-bound and soluble (sACE) forms. ACE inhibition is a frontline, FDA-approved, therapy for cardiovascular diseases yet is associated with significant side effects, including higher rates of lung cancer. To date, structural studies have been confined to individual domains or partially denatured cryo-EM structures. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the glycosylated full human sACE dimer. We resolved four structural states at 2.99 – 3.65 Å resolution which are primarily differentiated by varying degrees of solvent accessibility to the active sites and reveal the full dimerization interface. We also employed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and heterogeneity analysis in cryoSPARC, cryoDRGN, and RECOVAR to elucidate the conformational dynamics of sACE and identify key regions mediating conformational change. We identify differences in the mechanisms governing the conformational dynamics of individual domains that have implications for the design of domain-specific sACE modulators.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105138">Conformational changes, excess area, and elasticity of the Piezo protein-membrane nanodome from coarse-grained and atomistic simulations</a></h4>

              
                The mechanosensitive ion channels Piezo 1 and 2 induce a curved protein-membrane nanodome that flattens with increasing membrane tension γ. The tension-induced flattening of the nanodome is associated with Piezo activation and driven by the energy γΔA where ΔA is the excess area of the curved nanodome relative to its planar projected area. Based on extensive coarse-grained and atomistic simulations of membrane-embedded Piezo 1 and 2 proteins, we report here an excess area ΔA for the Piezo protein-membrane nanodome of about 40 nm<sup>2</sup> in tensionless membranes, and a half-maximal reduction of ΔA at tension values of about 3–4 mN/m, which is within the range of experimentally determined values for the half-maximal activation of Piezo 1. In line with recent experimental investigations of Piezo proteins in cell membranes and membrane vesicles, the membrane-embedded Piezo proteins adopt conformations in our simulations that are significantly less curved than the protein conformation in the detergent micelles of cryo-EM structures. An elasticity analysis of the nanodome shapes and protein conformations obtained from our simulations leads to an elastic model for Piezo activation that distinguishes the different energy components of the protein and the membrane in the tension-induced flattening of the nanodome. According to this model, the Piezo proteins resist flattening with a force constant of about 60 pN/nm.

                The lysosomal damage response is important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis in human cells. Although the mechanisms underlying the repair and autophagic elimination of damaged lysosomes have been elucidated, the early signal transduction pathways and genes induced in response to lysosomal damage remain elusive. We performed transcriptome and proteome analyses and found that the TAB–TAK1–IKK–NF-κB axis is activated by K63-linked ubiquitin chains that accumulate on damaged lysosomes. This activates the expression of various transcription factors and cytokines that promote anti-apoptosis and intercellular signaling. The findings highlight the crucial role of ubiquitin-regulated signal transduction and gene expression in cell survival and cell–cell communication in response to lysosomal damage. The results suggest that the ubiquitin system is not only involved in the removal of damaged lysosomes by lysophagy, but also functions in the activation of cellular signaling for cell survival.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104101">Online reinforcement learning of state representation in recurrent network supported by the power of random feedback and biological constraints</a></h4>

              
                Representation of external and internal states in the brain plays a critical role in enabling suitable behavior. Recent studies suggest that state representation and state value can be simultaneously learned through Temporal-Difference-Reinforcement-Learning (TDRL) and Backpropagation-Through-Time (BPTT) in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their readout. However, neural implementation of such learning remains unclear as BPTT requires offline update using transported downstream weights, which is suggested to be biologically implausible. We demonstrate that simple online training of RNNs using TD reward prediction error and random feedback, without additional memory or eligibility trace, can still learn the structure of tasks with cue–reward delay and timing variability. This is because TD learning itself is a solution for temporal credit assignment, and feedback alignment, a mechanism originally proposed for supervised learning, enables gradient approximation without weight transport. Furthermore, we show that biologically constraining downstream weights and random feedback to be non-negative not only preserves learning but may even enhance it because the non-negative constraint ensures loose alignment—allowing the downstream and feedback weights to roughly align from the beginning. These results provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the learning of state representation and value, highlighting the potential of random feedback and biological constraints.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106365">Forecasting protein evolution by integrating birth-death population models with structurally constrained substitution models</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary studies in population genetics and ecology were mainly focused on predicting and understanding past evolutionary events. Recently, however, a growing trend explores the prediction of evolutionary trajectories toward the future promoted by its wide variety of applications. In this context, we introduce a forecasting protein evolution method that integrates birth-death population models with substitution models that consider selection on protein folding stability. In contrast to traditional population genetics methods that usually make the unrealistic assumption of simulating molecular evolution separately from the evolutionary history, the present method combines both processes to simultaneously model forward-in-time birth-death evolutionary trajectories and protein evolution under structurally constrained substitution models that outperformed traditional empirical substitution models. We implemented the method into a freely available computer framework. We evaluated the accuracy of the predictions with several monitored viral proteins of broad interest. Overall, the method showed acceptable errors in predicting the folding stability of the forecasted protein variants, but, expectedly, the errors were larger in the prediction of the corresponding sequences. We conclude that forecasting protein evolution is feasible in certain evolutionary scenarios and provide suggestions to enhance its accuracy by improving the underlying models of evolution.

">RAVEN: Robust, generalizable, multi-resolution structural MRI upsampling using Autoencoders</a></h4>

              
                Due to their high inter-tissue contrast, Magnetic resonance images (MRIs) can reflect neuroanatomical changes related to healthy aging and pathological processes. However, standard brain MRI acquisition resolutions hinder the ability to measure the more subtle changes that occur in early disease stages. Increasing the resolution during acquisition poses multiple challenges, including increased noise, higher acquisition times and cost, and discomfort of the scanned individual. In this work, we propose a robust, generalizable single-image super-resolution network for brain MRIs named Resolution Augmentation with Variational auto-Encoder Networks (RAVEN) with generative adversarial networks (GANs). We show RAVEN is capable of upsampling in-vivo and ex-vivo MRIs of diverse modalities (e.g. T1-weighted , T2-weighted, and T2*) and varying field strengths (3T to 7T) to target voxel sizes as small as 0.5mm isotropic using arbitrary upsampling factors. RAVEN achieved state-of-the-art performance against deep learning and non-deep learning methods, best preserving true anatomical information. We have also made RAVEN open access, with the source code as well as training and evaluation scripts available and ready to use at: https://github.com/waadgo/raven.

">Functional independence of entorhinal grid cell modules enables remapping in hippocampal place cells</a></h4>

              
                A systems-level understanding of cortical computation requires insight into how neural codes are transformed across distinct brain circuits. In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of 'partial remapping'. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus' ability to support high-capacity memory storage.

">Computer models predict differential dendritic vulnerability with ischemia and spreading depression</a></h4>

              
                Ischemia, whether abrupt or chronic, limits ATP production and disrupts ATP-dependent homeostatic mechanisms, leading to alterations in both intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations. Inadequate neuronal ATP triggers K+ release and increased extracellular K+ depolarizes neurons, leading to additional K+ release; this positive feedback phenomenon is known as spreading depolarization (SD). When the depolarizing effects are strong enough, the cells undergo depolarization blockade, known as spreading depression. Excess extracellular K+ increases energy demand from the Na+-K+ pump, producing a pathological confluence of increased demand with reduced delivery of energy. The resulting changes have profound effects at subcellular, cellular, and network scales of brain function. We hypothesized that consequences of ischemic or SD homeostatic failure would differ on the subcellular scale, with differences between disjunct dendritic regions of a hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron. To evaluate the interplay between morphology and ion concentrations, we used a mechanistic simulation incorporating neuronal morphology, pumps, exchangers, voltage-, and Ca2+-sensitive ion channels. In both cases, calcium accumulation was greatest in the basilar dendrites, suggesting these dendrites would show the greatest effects of excitotoxicity. By contrast, ischemia, but not SD showed that distal apical dendrites were exposed to greater intracellular chloride concentrations, which may lead to dendritic beading.

">Hemodynamic and electrophysiological progression of the Rose Bengal photothrombotic stroke model in mice: vasoactive properties of Rose Bengal, tissue heating, wavelength optimization, and sex differences in lesion volume</a></h4>

              
                The photothrombotic stroke model is gaining popularity due to its relative simplicity, minimal invasiveness, and clinical relevance. Photothrombosis involves the delivery of an intravascular photosensitizer (Rose Bengal) followed by its photoactivation, resulting in vessel occlusion and ischemia. Using a combination of complementary optical and non-optical techniques, we characterized the physiological changes in mice undergoing photothrombosis. We report that Rose Bengal acts as a rapid vasoconstrictor, inducing hypoemia both in the brain and periphery even in the absence of its photoactivation. Conversely, we find that light, when used at photothrombosis-appropriate intensities and durations, induces large amounts of tissue heating and hyperemia even in the distal non-illuminated hemisphere. Furthermore, we show that use of the optimal photothrombotic wavelength based on the Rose Bengal absorption spectrum (yellow-561nm) produces a more consistent and pronounced drop in blood flow, and a shorter latency to the initial spreading depolarization (SD), ultimately resulting in a larger stroke. Similarly, when yellow light is used to induce a stroke in ChR2-expressing mice, the electrophysiological and hemodynamic confounds from green light cross activation of ChR2 are eliminated. Finally, we observe across cohorts that male mice have larger strokes than females. Altogether, we extensively describe important caveats and confounds concerning photothrombosis and provide a detailed characterization of its early ischemic events.

">Context rescales a social action code in a hormone-sensitive network</a></h4>

              
                Deciding whether and when to engage in social interaction depends on external factors including the location of the interaction and the identity of the social partner (the social context) as well as internal factors such as an individual's hormonal state. However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (esr1+) as well as from local esr1- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.

">Blood-derived dietary protein promotes sleep in the mosquito Aedes aegypti</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is a ubiquitous, yet highly variable, behavior across species. The duration and timing of sleep are influenced by ecological demands and dietary context. In the mosquito Aedes aegypti, a blood feeding insect with specialized nutritional requirements, the relationship between feeding and sleep remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate how blood derived dietary protein influences sleep regulation. Using postural analysis, videography, and arousal threshold assays, we establish that immobility bouts of greater than 10 minutes reliably define sleep in Ae. aegypti. Infrared activity monitoring revealed that blood-fed females exhibit a marked increase in sleep beginning immediately after feeding and persisting for several days, accompanied by reduced locomotor activity. Notably, this sleep elevation lasts well beyond the cessation of host-seeking behavior, suggesting distinct phases of opportunistic versus determined host pursuit. To determine the dietary basis of this effect, we tested mosquitoes fed a bovine serum albumin (BSA) based diet. BSA feeding alone was sufficient to mimic the sleep-promoting and hypoactive effects of blood, identifying dietary protein as the key nutritional regulator. Moreover, RNAi mediated knockdown of the leucokinin receptor (lkr), previously implicated in fluid regulation and feeding, enhanced sleep and reduced activity, implicating LK signaling in postprandial sleep modulation. Together, these findings demonstrate that blood-derived proteins drive sustained increases in sleep and reduced locomotion in Ae. aegypti. This work positions Ae. aegypti as a model for dissecting nutrient-specific regulation of sleep and highlights potential adaptive functions of protein-induced quiescence, such as energy conservation and predator avoidance. More broadly, it provides insight into how specialized diets shape the neural and behavioral architecture of sleep.

">Prolonged oscillating kisspeptin neuron activity underlies the preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge in mice</a></h4>

              
                The population of kisspeptin neurons located in the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) is thought to have a key role in generating the GnRH surge that triggers ovulation. Using a modified GCaMP fibre photometry procedure, we have been able to record the in vivo population activity of RP3VKISS neurons across the estrous cycle of female mice. A marked increase in GCaMP activity was detected beginning on the afternoon of proestrus that lasted in total for 13{+/-}1 hours. This was comprised of slow baseline oscillations with a period of 91{+/-}4 min and associated with high frequency rapid transients. Very little oscillating baseline or transient activity was detected at other stages of the estrous cycle. Concurrent blood sampling showed that the peak of the LH surge occurred 3.5{+/-}1.1 h after the first baseline RP3VKISS neuron baseline oscillation on the afternoon of proestrus. The time of onset of RP3VKISS neuron oscillations varied between mice and across subsequent proestrous stages in the same mice. To assess the impact of estradiol on RP3VKISS neuron activity, mice were ovariectomized and given an incremental estradiol replacement regimen. Minimal patterned GCaMP activity was found in OVX mice, and this was not changed acutely by any of the estradiol treatments. However, on the afternoon of the expected LH surge, the same oscillating baseline activity with associated transients occurred for 7.1{+/-}0.5 h. These observations reveal an unexpected prolonged oscillatory pattern of RP3VKISS neuron activity that is dependent on estrogen and underlies the preovulatory LH surge as well as potentially other facets of reproductive behavior.

">A neural circuit for female-specific defensive homeostasis in risk assessment</a></h4>

              
                Risk assessment in defensive behavior is an adaptive mechanism shaped by natural selection, enabling individuals to evaluate potential threats and thereby maintain defensive homeostasis. Although risk assessment is essential for survival, it remains unknown whether specific neural circuits maintain their behavioral homeostasis in a sex-specific manner. Here, we show that visual survival threats activated cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R)-expressing neurons in the superior colliculus (SC), initiating consistent risk assessment in both sexes. Deletion of CB1R in SC GABAergic neurons female-specifically impairs risk assessment by disinhibiting GABA release in SC-lateral habenula (LHb) projections, resulting in abnormally shortened risk assessment. Furthermore, loss of CB1R in SC GABAergic neurons increases the occurrence of abnormal spontaneous behavior following chronic stress exclusively in females. Our findings revealed a female-specific CB1R-modulated SC-LHb GABAergic circuit crucial for maintaining defensive homeostasis in risk assessment, highlighting how disruptions in this circuit underlie deficits in risk assessment and adaptive stress coping.

">Cortex-Wide Substrates for Body Schema and Action Awareness</a></h4>

              
                The body schema, an internal model of the body's configuration in space, is essential for embodied perception and voluntary action. Cortical lesions can disrupt the body schema; however, it remains unclear how the cortex efficiently represents the vast repertoire of body postures during natural behavior. Here, we unveil the representational format underlying the body schema by combining large-scale electrophysiology with 3D full-body motion capture in freely moving mice. Across posterior parietal (PPC) and sensorimotor cortices (SMC), neurons encoded diverse postural features in distinct reference frames: PPC neurons emphasize midline-referenced features related to left-right turning, whereas SMC neurons encode body elevation and pitch relative to the ground, revealing a gravicentric reference frame. Strikingly, beyond static posture encoding, we identified neural ensembles selectively activated during stereotyped actions such as walking, rearing, and grooming. These action ensembles fire in phase-locked sequences that tile the entire action cycle, providing a substrate for action awareness. A network model recapitulated these dynamics, showing that population activity clustered into action-specific subspaces. Together, these findings demonstrate that the cortex organizes the body schema around actions, compressing high-dimensional kinematics into an efficient, gravity-anchored, and action-aware neural code.

">Neuronal detection of social actions directs collective escape behavior</a></h4>

              
                Animals in groups obtain information from their social partners to engage in collective behavior. Social information transmission has been observed amongst individuals in fish schools, bird flocks, and human groups, but the neural mechanisms for detecting socially transmitted information are poorly understood. By studying the schooling glassfish Danionella cerebrum, here we demonstrate that escape from danger is enhanced by visual perception of other escaping fish. We found that neural populations in the midbrain optic tectum and dorsal thalamus are activated by the rapid escape of social partners. These neurons are also driven by the sudden disappearance of virtual social partners, yet unaffected by disappearing stimuli without social relevance. Virtual fish schools that escape or disappear were sufficient to cause observers to escape, even in the absence of direct threats. These results demonstrate that rapid social-off detection in visual circuits enables the detection of socially transmitted threat information, which may be a particularly effective strategy for animals capable of rapid movement but limited visual range. These results show how neural computations in individuals enables rapid information sharing in animal collectives.

">Perceiving less or perceiving unreliably? Disentangling thermosensory sensitivity and precision in the contexts of ageing and neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Thermal perception is determined not only by sensitivity but also by precision, yet the latter is often overlooked in thermosensation and pain research. This study examined how ageing and diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) affect the sensitivity and precision of thermal perception and whether combining these parameters can aid in distinguishing patients from healthy controls. Using a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach, we estimated psychometric function thresholds (sensitivity) and slopes (precision) for cold detection, warm detection, cold pain, and heat pain in 86 healthy adults (aged 21-80) and 34 patients with DPN. We assessed age- and neuropathy-related effects on these parameters. Using simulated classification analyses, we also tested their utility in discriminating patients from controls. Ageing was associated with elevated detection and cold pain thresholds and reduced precision of cold detection. Patients with DPN showed similar patterns: higher detection thresholds and lower cold detection slopes while pain-related parameters were largely unaffected. These findings indicate that ageing and neuropathy produce qualitatively similar changes in thermosensory function, particularly affecting cold detection sensitivity and precision. Classification based on detection thresholds and cold detection slope successfully discriminated patients from controls, with cold detection slope offering the best performance. Combining threshold and slope parameters did not significantly improve classification accuracy. Accurate classification was not possible based on pain thresholds and slopes. Modelling both thresholds and slopes provides a more comprehensive view of sensory decline and may enhance the detection of early or subtle sensory dysfunction.

">Improving the learning curve in monoportal endoscopic lumbar surgery: development and validation of a porcine training model.</a></h4>

              
                Study design Experimental animal study. Purpose Endoscopic spine surgery (ESS) has gained substantial traction globally. Proficiency in ESS demands a steep learning curve and rigorous technical training. This study aims to develop and validate a porcine model as a high-fidelity, reproducible platform for hands-on training in lumbar endoscopic procedures. Methods Thirteen skeletally mature Landrace x Large white pigs underwent lumbar endoscopic decompression via a transforaminal approach at L4-L5 and an interlaminar approach at L5-L6. Specific procedural modifications were introduced to optimize anatomical correlation and surgical ergonomics. Following a seven-day postoperative period, necropsies were performed to evaluate procedural outcomes and adverse events. Operative times, intraoperative events, and postoperative outcomes were systematically recorded. Results Endoscopic decompression was successfully completed in all specimens. Mean operative time was 134.7 {+/-} 32.3 minutes. Intraoperative complications occurred in 4 animals (30.8%): uncontrollable epidural bleeding (case 1), dural tear (case 7), technically difficult transforaminal access in a low-weight pig (33.8 kg, case 8), and a complex interlaminar approach leading to spinal cord injury (case 13). One additional animal (case 4) developed paraplegia without structural findings at necropsy, attributed to intraoperative positioning. Necropsy revealed asymptomatic epidural hematomas in three cases (9, 11, 12). Three animals (23.1%) required early euthanasia based on humane criteria. A significant learning curve effect was demonstrated, with operative time decreasing over the series ({rho} = -0.73, p = 0.004). Conclusions The porcine lumbar spine provides a reliable and anatomically valid model for ESS training. Awareness of species-specific anatomy, specimen size, and positioning is essential to maximize reproducibility and safety.

">Inferring systemic metabolic and oxidative stress susceptibility in normal-tension glaucoma through targeted skin fibroblast analysis</a></h4>

              
                Aim: Enhance the understanding of intrinsic metabolic and oxidative stress vulnerability in normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) pathophysiology by targeted profiling of skin fibroblasts from NTG and control donors. Background: NTG is a primary open-angle glaucoma subtype characterised by glaucomatous neurodegeneration without elevated intraocular pressure. Increasing evidence links systemic metabolic and oxidative stress vulnerability to NTG pathophysiology, making non-ocular, somatic cells promising surrogate systems for assessing neurodegenerative predisposing mechanisms. Methods: Skin fibroblast cultures were obtained from four female NTG and four age- and gender-matched control donors. Targeted metabolic profiling of mitochondrial function, glycolytic capacity, and glucose and amino acid metabolism was performed using the seahorse assay, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Oxidative stress resilience to hydrogen peroxide was assessed employing the lactate dehydrogenase release assay. Results: Pure skin fibroblast cultures were obtained for all included donors. NTG and control fibroblast exhibited similar mitochondrial and glycolytic function. No group difference was demonstrated in relative glucose metabolism and absolute amino acid profile. Control and NTG fibroblasts exhibited similar susceptibility to oxidative stress. Conclusion: NTG skin fibroblasts exhibit similar mitochondrial and glycolytic function, glucose metabolisation, amino acid profile, and oxidative stress resiliency compared to controls. Future studies should focus on mapping cell- and tissue-specific differences through combined genetic and transcriptomic profiling to guide and stratify the functional assessment of different endotypes within the NTG disease spectrum. Cell-specific dysregulation and the need for individual mechanistic grouping diminish the applicability of skin fibroblasts as a model system for exploiting NTG pathophysiology.

">Exploring the impact of social relevance on the cortical tracking of speech: viability and temporal response characterisation</a></h4>

              
                Human speech is inherently social. Yet our understanding of the neural substrates underlying continuous speech perception relies largely on neural responses to monologues, leaving substantial uncertainty about how social interactions shape the neural encoding of speech. Here, we bridge this gap by studying how EEG responses to speech change when the input includes a social element. Specifically, we compared the neural encoding of synthesised undirected monologues, directed monologues, and dialogues in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, we extended this by using podcasts, addressing the additional challenges of real speech dialogue, such as dysfluencies. Using temporal response function analyses, we show that the presence of a social component strengthens envelope tracking - despite identical acoustic properties - indicating heightened listener engagement. Neural responses to synthesised speech showed a strong correlation with those for real speech podcasts, with a stronger alignment emerging for more socially-relevant speech material. In addition, we demonstrate that robust neural indices of sound and lexical-level processing can be derived using real podcast recordings despite the presence of dysfluencies. Finally, we discuss the importance of dysfluency in social speech experiments, presenting a simulation quantifying the potential impact of dysfluency on lexical level analyses. Together, these findings advance our understanding of continuous speech neurophysiology by highlighting the impact of social elements in shaping auditory neural processing in a controlled manner and providing a framework for future investigation and analysis of social speech listening and speech interaction.

">A mechanistic theory of planning in prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Planning is critical for adaptive behaviour in a changing world, because it lets us anticipate the future and adjust our actions accordingly. While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting 'spacetime attractor' excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.

">Emergence of Functional Heart-Brain Circuits in a Vertebrate</a></h4>

              
                The early formation of sensorimotor circuits is essential for survival. While the development and function of exteroceptive circuits and their associated motor pathways are well characterized, far less is known about the circuits that convey viscerosensory inputs to the brain and transmit visceromotor commands from the central nervous system to internal organs. Technical limitations, such as the in utero development of viscerosensory and visceromotor circuits and the invasiveness of procedures required to access them, have hindered studies of their functional development in mammals. Using larval zebrafish, which are genetically accessible and optically transparent, we tracked, in vivo, how cardiosensory and cardiomotor neural circuits assemble and begin to function. We uncovered a staged program. First, a minimal efferent circuit suffices for heart-rate control: direct brain-to-heart vagal motor innervation is required, intracardiac neurons are not, and heart rate is governed exclusively by the motor vagus nerve. Within the hindbrain, we functionally localize a vagal premotor population that drives this early efferent control. Second, sympathetic innervation arrives and enhances the dynamics and amplitude of cardiac responses, as neurons in the most anterior sympathetic ganglia acquire the ability to drive cardiac acceleration. These neurons exhibit proportional, integral, and derivative-like relationships to heart rate, consistent with controller motifs that shape gain and dynamics. Third, vagal sensory neurons innervate the heart. Distinct subsets increase activity when heart rate falls or rises, and across spontaneous fluctuations, responses to aversive stimuli, and optogenetically evoked cardiac perturbations, their dynamics are captured by a single canonical temporal kernel with neuron-specific phase offsets, supporting a population code for heart rate. This temporally segregated maturation isolates three experimentally tractable regimes, unidirectional brain-to-heart communication, dual efferent control, and closed-loop control after sensory feedback engages, providing a framework for mechanistic dissection of organism-wide heart-brain circuits.

                <p>The plasma membrane acts as a capacitor that plays a critical role in neuronal excitability and signal propagation. Neuronal capacitance is proportional to the area of the cell membrane; thus it is often used as a measure of the cell size that is assumed to be relatively stable. Recent work proposes that the capacitance of dentate granule cells (dGCs) and cortical pyramidal cells changes across the light/dark (LD) cycle in a manner that alters synaptic integration. We addressed this potential change in capacitance using a large dataset of dGC recordings from adult male and female mice across the light cycle. Our data show that daily changes in the membrane time constant result from fluctuation in membrane resistance rather than capacitance. We also confirm the ability to resolve changes in neuronal capacitance induced by altering dGC membrane area via acute axotomy or genetically induced overgrowth using either voltage-clamp or current-clamp approaches. Our results demonstrate that the capacitance of dGCs remains stable over the LD cycle and that daily changes in the membrane time constant and excitability are mediated by fluctuations in membrane resistance.</p>

                <p>The corticospinal tract (CST) is essential for forelimb-specific fine motor skills. In rodents, it undergoes extensive structural remodeling across development, injury, and disease states, with major implications for motor function. A vast body of literature, spanning numerous injury models, frequently assesses these projections. Despite this, a cohesive imaging modality for rapid, quantitative assessment of the bilateral cervical spinal cord projectome is lacking. To address this, we developed SpinalTRAQ (Spinal cord Tomographic Registration and Automated Quantification), a novel mouse cervical spinal cord volumetric reference atlas and machine learning-based analytical pipeline. Using serial two-photon tomography, SpinalTRAQ enables unbiased, region-specific quantification of fluorescently labeled CST presynaptic terminals. In healthy male mice, the CST exhibits a distinct bilateral synaptic projectome, with the densest innervation in laminae 5 and 7 on the contralateral side and lamina 7 on the ipsilateral side. We additionally observed sparse synaptic input in lamina 9, specifically axial motor neuron pools, which we found was targeted to spinal motoneurons. Following focal motor cortical stroke, the injured CST axons are depleted, and contralesional CST projections are significantly increased after 4 and 6&nbsp;weeks. By 6&nbsp;weeks post-stroke, ipsilateral CST synapses were increased by fivefold, with the greatest increases seen in homotopic laminae and all motor neuron pools. SpinalTRAQ offers detailed, level- and lamina-specific quantification of the bilateral cervical spinal cord synaptic projectome, revealing previously unrecognized CST connectivity and plasticity after injury.</p>

                Introduction This study explored the application of T-norms in fuzzy algebra, specifically by examining JU-subalgebras and JU-ideals derived from crisp JU-algebras. We investigated the properties of the T-fuzzy structures within this algebraic framework. Our work focuses on characterizing idempotent T-fuzzy JU algebras and analyzing their behavior in Cartesian products. Method We begin by defining T-fuzzy JU-subalgebras and JU-ideals using T-norm operations. Next, we examine the structural properties of these algebraic systems through a theoretical analysis. We then studied the idempotent cases to identify their distinctive features. Finally, we prove the closure properties by constructing Cartesian products of these fuzzy structures. Conclusion Our analysis demonstrated that idempotent T-fuzzy JU algebras possess unique structural characteristics. Furthermore, we establish that the Cartesian product of the two T-fuzzy JU-subalgebras remains a T-fuzzy JU-subalgebra, and similarly for JU-ideals. These findings extend the theoretical foundations of fuzzy algebra and suggest its potential applications in related mathematical fields.

                Background Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a highly morbid disease. Chemotherapy for NSCLC lacks specificity and efficacy mainly because of drug resistance. The current study aimed to explore computational tools to target allosteric epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) sites and screen for the top molecules in vitro and in vivo xenograft models. Methods Molecular docking, virtual screening, and molecular dynamic studies revealed that acenocoumarol and silodosin are the top two allosteric EGFR inhibitors. They were further tested for cytotoxicity, apoptosis, cell cycle, and gene expression by qPCR, western blotting, A549 cell xenograft anti-proliferative activity, and tumor regression efficacy analysis. Results Acenocoumarol and silodosin exhibited cytotoxicity in A549 and IMR-90 cells at concentrations below 50 and 80 μM, respectively. Acenocoumarol and silodosin induced S-phase and G2/M-phase arrest in A549 cells in the cell cycle analysis. Both drugs showed early apoptosis at their IC50 doses (acenocoumarol 50 μM and silodosin 25 μM). KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) and ERK2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2) gene regulation in A549 cells was confirmed using qPCR. KRAS and ERK2 activities were quantified by western blot analysis. In the xenograft study, tumor size, body weight, and organ weight were significantly attenuated by the test drugs compared with the standard cisplatin. Immunoblotting and western blot results of the A549-xenograft tissue indicated downregulation of KRAS and ERK2. Furthermore, the test drugs have upregulated caspase-3 gene expression. Conclusion The drugs acenocoumarol and silodosin downregulate KRAS and ERK2 in both A549 cell lines and Xenograft model. KRAS and ERK2 are components of EGFR-associated signaling pathways. Hence, acenocoumarol and silodosin can be further explored as repurposed candidates in future preclinical and clinical studies.

                This paper examines the complex interplay between urban land lease policy, state ownership, and neo-patrimonial practices in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. While Ethiopia’s urban land lease policy aims for equitable development, state ownership exacerbates neo-patrimonial dynamics, leading to distorted resource allocation and limited access for marginalized communities. Through key informant interviews and policy analysis, this study reveals how ethnic alignment and political loyalty influence land access, undermining the policy’s stated objectives. The findings highlight a disconnection between formal regulations and the lived experiences of urban residents, particularly those lacking political connections. Despite constitutional guarantees, a centralized decision-making process and limited accountability perpetuate inequality. The study concludes that institutional reforms are needed to decentralize power, enhance transparency, and integrate marginalized voices into land governance to realize equitable and sustainable urban development in Addis Ababa. This research contributes to a broader understanding of the challenges facing urban land management in neo-patrimonial contexts.

                Background Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is an important enzyme that metabolizes commonly used drugs, such as tramadol hydrochloride. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 have been shown to influence the pharmacodynamic properties of administered drugs. This study aimed to screen postoperative patients (wild-type, CYP2D6*5, and CYP2D6 multiplication) of Minangkabau ethnicity in West Sumatera, Indonesia, who received tramadol using a modified long PCR method, and to investigate the clinical impact of tramadol on these patients. This study had a retrospective clinical trial registry number NCT06642480, and a total of 65 patients participated. Methods The Reported Long PCR was modified using different DNA polymerases, optimizing annealing, and the number of step PCR to detect wild-type, CYP2D6*5, and multiplication CYP2D6. To ensure accurate PCR, the size of the PCR product was monitored: wild-type (5kb), CYP2D6*5 (6kb), and CYP2D6 multiplication genotype (10 kb). The wild-type PCR product was used as the control reaction. The method was applied to screen postoperative patients of Minangkabau ethnicity. A statistical study was conducted using analysis of variance (ANOVA), and a chi-square test. Result The Long PCR was successfully modified with a two-step PCR at 68°C as the annealing and extension temperatures. The screened genotype patients were dominated by the wild-type, followed by CYP2D6*5, and multiplication CYP2D6 with percentages of 89%, 6,3%, and 4,7% respectively. A total of 6.3% of CYP2D6*5 cases were classified as heterozygous and predicted as intermediate metabolizers. Based on ANOVA analysis, there was a significant association between analgesic tramadol and VAS value, as well as between tramadol and molecular screening, with P-values of 0.045 and 0.003, respectively. Conclusion The percentages of CYP2D6*5 and CYP2D6 multiplication genotypes were similar to those observed in another Asian population. Based on statistical analysis, tramadol was effective as an analgesic for postoperative Minangkabau ethnicity patients with wild-type, CYP2D6*5, and multiple CYP2D6 genotypes.

                Background Cayratia trifolia has been extensively studied for its bioactive components and medicinal properties. This study was carried out to evaluate the fermentation ability of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2.1 to determine suitable fermentation conditions. Methods The suitable initial sugar content, temperature, and incubation time were investigated in the fermentation in the 100-milliliter flask scale. Besides, a trial fermentation at the 1-liter scale was conducted to assess yeast performance. Results All treatments showed that the total sugar content decreased after 9 days of fermentation compared to the initial level. Temperature during fermentation has a direct effect on yeast activity. Temperature increases the growth of yeast and the speed of enzyme activity. The fermentation time changes depending on temperature, initial soluble solid contents, and yeast strains, leading to changes in the ethanol content after the end of fermentation. The results showed that the S. cerevisiae 2.1 was able to ferment at room temperature with an initial pH of 4.5, 24 °Brix, and a yeast density of 107 cells/mL. The appropriate fermentation conditions determined for S. cerevisiae 2.1 were 24 °Brix and incubation at room temperature (28-33°C) with a fermentation time of 11 days. In 1-L scale fermentation, three-leaf cayratia wine had 9.46% (v/v) and the fermentation efficiency was 90.34%. The wine produced had a unique color, flavor, and aroma that met the sensory evaluation of the Vietnamese national standard TCVN-3217:79. Conclusion The results showed that the S. cerevisiae 2.1 was able to produce wine from Cayratia trifolia extract in suitable conditions with high ethanol content and organoleptic values. The results of this study supplied needed information for further studies on analysis of bioactive compounds produced by the fermentation.

                <p>by Paolo Pigini, Federico Manuel Giorgi, Keng Boon Wee</p>

The endogenous U1 small nuclear RNA (U1-snRNA) plays a crucial role in splicing initiation through base-pairing to donor splice sites (5′-SSs). Likewise, modified U1s that carry a mutation-adapted 5′-terminal sequence have been demonstrated to rescue exon splicing when this is disrupted by genetic mutations within the 5′-SS. Given the base-pairing flexibility of the endogenous U1, the selectivity of modified U1s requires investigation. We developed a computational pipeline (Utargetome) which considers combinations of mismatches and alternative annealing registers to predict the transcriptome-wide binding sites (or targetome) of a U1. The pipeline accuracy was tested by recapitulating well-established alternative annealing registers and specificity for 5′-SSs in the predicted targetome of the human endogenous U1. It was then applied to analyse the targetome of 54 modified U1s that have been demonstrated to restore exon inclusion when affected by 5′-SS pathogenic mutations. While the targetome size was found to be wide-ranging, the off-target load appeared to be reduced for U1s targeting distal sites from the canonical U1-binding position. This feature was predicted also for a large set of 30,204 newly designed U1s targeting 839 5′-SS pathogenic mutations that were expected to affect exon inclusion. Targetome analysis indeed revealed an optimal distal-targeting position at 3 nucleotides downstream from the canonical 5′-SS, for which a modified U1 is likely to have minimal off-targets at 5′-SSs and acceptor splice sites (3′-SSs). Based on these insights, we propose to implement targetome prediction in the design and optimization of therapeutic U1s with improved selectivity.

                <p>by Hojin Jang, Frank Tong</p>

Object recognition in real-world environments requires dealing with considerable ambiguity, yet the human visual system is highly robust to noisy viewing conditions. Here, we investigated the role of perceptual learning in the acquisition of robustness in both humans and deep neural networks (DNNs). Specifically, we sought to determine whether perceptual training with object images in Gaussian noise, drawn from certain animate or inanimate categories, would lead to category-specific or category-general improvements in human robustness. Moreover, might DNNs provide viable models of human perceptual learning? Both before and after training, we evaluated the noise threshold required for accurate recognition using novel object images. Human observers were quite robust to noise before training, but showed additional category-specific improvement after training with only a few hundred noisy object examples. In comparison, standard DNNs initially lacked robustness, then showed both category-general and category-specific learning after training with the same noisy examples. We further evaluated DNN models that were pre-trained with moderately noisy images to match human pre-training accuracy. Notably, these models only showed category-specific improvement, matching the overall pattern of learning exhibited by human observers. A layer-wise analysis of DNN responses revealed that category-general learning effects emerged in the lower layers, whereas category-specific improvements emerged in the higher layers. Our findings provide support for the notion that robustness to noisy visual conditions arises through learning, humans likely acquire robustness from everyday encounters with real-world noise, and additional category-specific improvements exhibited by humans and DNNs involve learning at higher levels of visual representation.

                <p>by Tshikala Eddie Lulamba, Themba Mutemaringa, Nicki Tiffin</p>

Structured patient data generated within the health data ecosystem are shared both internally for operational use and also externally for research and public health benefit. Protecting individual privacy and health data confidentiality in these contexts relies on data de-identification and anonymisation, although there are no universally accepted standards for these processes and the techniques involved can be technically complex. We present practical recommendations grounded in the principle of data minimisation—avoiding unnecessary granularity and identifying variables that could lead to re-identification when combined with other datasets. We provide practical guidance for anonymising and perturbing structured health data in ways that support compliance with data protection laws, describing technical and operational methods for reducing re-identification risk that include rounding numerical values, replacing precise values with ranges, adding jitter to numeric fields, aggregating data, management of date values and separating sensitive fields from identifying data to prevent linkage leading to re-identification. While some methods require advanced technical knowledge, we focus here on accessible strategies that can be implemented without specialist expertise, recognising the importance of the legal and governance frameworks in which anonymisation occurs. These guidelines support researchers, data managers and institutions in sharing health data responsibly, maintaining data utility while upholding privacy and promoting ethical and legal data stewardship for data-driven health research.

                <p>by Marina Koutsi, Triantafyllos Stylianopoulos, Fotios Mpekris</p>

Mechanical solid stress plays a pivotal role in tumor progression and therapeutic response. Elevated solid stress compresses intratumoral blood vessels, leading to hypoperfusion, and hypoxia, which impair oxygen and drug delivery. These conditions hinder the efficacy of drugs and promote tumor progression and treatment resistance compromising therapeutic outcomes. To enhance treatment efficacy, mechanotherapeutics and ultrasound sonopermeation have been developed to improve tumor perfusion and drug delivery. Mechanotherapy aims to reduce tumor stiffness and mechanical stress within tumors to normal levels leading to decompression of vessels while simultaneously improving perfusion. On the other hand, ultrasound sonopermeation strategy focuses on increasing non-invasively and transiently tumor vessel wall permeability to boost perfusion and thus, improve drug delivery. Within this framework and aiming to replicate published experimental data in silico, we developed a pilot mathematical model designed to derive optimal conditions for the combined use of mechanotherapeutics and sonopermeation, with the goal of optimizing efficacy of nano-immunotherapy. The model incorporates complex interactions among diverse components that are crucial in the multifaceted process of tumor progression. These components encompass a variety of cell populations in tumor, such as tumor cells and immune cells, as well as components of the tumor vasculature including endothelial cells, angiopoietins, and the vascular endothelial growth factor. Seeking initial model verification, we carried out validation of model predictions with published experimental data, wherein a strong correlation was observed between the model predictions and the actual experimental measurements of critical parameters, which are essential to reinforce the overall accuracy of the mathematical framework employed. In addition, a parametric analysis was performed with primary objective to investigate the impact of various critical parameters that influence sonopermeation. Model predictions showed maximal drug delivery and tumor volume reduction at an acoustic pressure range of 0.24–0.27 MPa and mechanical index of 0.17, consistent with values used in clinical trials following sonopermeation treatment. The analysis provided optimal guidelines for the use of sonopermeation in conjunction with mechanotherapy, that contribute to identify optimal conditions for sonopermeation.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neural activity and bodily functions are inherently rhythmic and related to each other. The occurrence of hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs) and dentate spikes (DSs) supporting memory consolidation is regulated by the overall state of the brain, and they also seem to aggregate to a certain phase of the breathing cycle in naturally sleeping mice. Further, SPW-Rs and DSs synchronize to a variable degree between hemispheres, but how this is affected by the neural and bodily state is unclear. Here, we recorded dorsal hippocampal local-field potentials, electrocardiogram, and respiration for several hours under urethane anesthesia in adult male Sprague–Dawley rats. For a subset of rats, we injected atropine (50 mg/kg, i.p.) halfway into the recording to decrease cholinergic and parasympathetic tone. We found variable relation of hippocampal oscillations to breathing phase and none to the cardiac cycle phase. A decrease in breathing rate implying increased parasympathetic tone preceded the start of SPW-R bouts. Roughly 90% of DSs and half of SPW-Rs were unilateral. In most rats, SPW-Rs were more often bilateral during slow breathing compared to faster breathing. Atropine reduced the proportion of bilateral SPW-Rs. Both nonrapid eye movement sleep-like state and atropine increased the proportion of bilateral DSs under urethane anesthesia. Finally, in naturally sleeping rats, both DSs and SPW-Rs were bilateral ~60% of the time. In sum, urethane seems to desynchronize DSs but not SPW-Rs, and a low cholinergic and/or parasympathetic tone seems to dissociate SPW-Rs and to synchronize DSs in the two hippocampi. Whether these findings have relevance in terms of memory consolidation and behavior should be investigated in the future.</p>

                Data analysis often entails a multitude of heterogeneous steps, from the application of various command line tools to the usage of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way. Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.

                Background A novel low-loss 4 × 4 Butler Matrix structure for 26 GHz operation is designed in this study. The proposed 4 × 4 antenna Butler matrix comprises an inscribed structure, which makes it fundamentally different from traditional beam-forming networks in 5G 26-GHz applications. Method This novel Butler matrix comprises four hybrid couplers without crossovers or phase shifters. To reduce the size, magnitude, and phase difference, and to increase the bandwidth, interdigital and non-metallic vias are used in the coupler design. The performance of the proposed matrix was simulated using the CST software and implemented on a Rogers 8085 substrate. It was also interfaced with four substrate-integrated waveguide slot antennas to demonstrate its distinct beam scanning capability. Results The matrix yielded an error magnitude loss of 1 dB and a phase error of 1.7° with a broad operational bandwidth of 3 GHz. The measured coupling factor of the 4 × 4 Butler matrix at 26 GHz is -6 ±1 dB at the output. The measured results validate that four phase-scanning states at -14.3°, 14.88°, -32.21°, and 31.33° can be realized with return losses of less than -10 dB. Conclusions The proposed design achieves a compact, efficient, and low-loss beamforming solution suitable for 5G applications at 26 GHz, demonstrating distinct scanning features without the need for crossovers or phase shifters.

                Background Rat tickling (heterospecific play between rats and the human hand), can promote positive affect and improve laboratory rat welfare. However, individual variation, particularly in response to the standard tickling protocol involving frequent pinning, may limit its effectiveness. Following hypothesis registration (https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1053/v2), we aimed to refine the protocol by testing responses to different amounts of pinning during playful handling (PH), a flexible form of tactile interaction resembling juvenile rough and tumble rat play. Methods Juvenile male and female Wistar rats received six daily 30-second sessions of PH with 0, 1, or 4 pins per session. A non-PH control involved a motionless hand. The primary response variables were the count and variability of 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs), which are measures of positive affect in rats. Additional exploratory outcomes included behavioural and physiological responses in the elevated plus maze and open field tests. Results All PH treatments increased 50 kHz USVs compared to controls, confirming their positive effect. Males showed no difference in USVs across pinning conditions, while females vocalised more in treatments with minimal or no pinning. Except for the highest pinning treatment (P4), females produced more USVs than males across all conditions, including controls. However, reducing pinning did not reliably decrease USV variability or alter behavioural and physiological outcomes. Conclusions Applying 50 kHz USVs as a measure of positive affect, these results confirm that tickling induces positive affect in juvenile laboratory rats. We report the novel finding of sex differences in response to tickling. Females preferred tickling where the amount of pinning is minimised relative to males that showed no preference across tickling treatments. Levels of USVs suggest that females possibly found the applied treatments, including control conditions, more rewarding than males did

                Background There are currently no sex-specific recommendations for antipsychotic prescribing in schizophrenia, although women may be more susceptible to certain side-effects and may require lower doses to achieve comparable efficacy to men. However, sex differences remain insufficiently studied to inform treatment decisions. Methods We plan a systematic review and individual-participant-data meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing different antipsychotic drugs, doses, formulations with each other or with placebo in adults with acute schizophrenia. Eligible studies will be identified through the Vivli platform, and their individual-participant-data will be harmonized into a common dataset. Two independent reviewers will screen search results and assess risk of bias using the Risk of Bias 2 tool. The primary outcome will be overall symptoms of schizophrenia, and secondary outcomes will include a broad range of efficacy, tolerability, acceptability, and dosing measures. A stepwise approach to data synthesis will be adopted, depending on individual-participant-data availability, aiming to examine sex differences in the effects of antipsychotic drugs compared to placebo. If sufficient data are available, we will conduct random-effects meta-analyses using regression models to evaluate biological sex, typically categorised as male or female, as both a prognostic factor and an effect modifier, network meta-analyses to synthesize direct and indirect evidence, and dose-response meta-analyses using restricted cubic splines to explore dose-effect relationships. The robustness of the findings will be assessed through sensitivity analyses adjusting for additional covariates. The certainty of evidence on sex differences will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for subgroup analysis. If the certainty is judged to be moderate or high, sex-specific treatment effects will be further assessed using the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) framework. Discussion This study will examine sex differences in the efficacy, tolerability, and dosing of antipsychotics in acute schizophrenia, potentially contributing to evidence-based, sex-specific treatment recommendations for antipsychotic prescribing.
