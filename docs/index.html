              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27266?af=R">Midlife Steroid‐Binding Globulin Levels and In Vivo Neuroimaging Measures of Tau in Older Men and Women</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In men and women, sex steroid hormones have been associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. We aimed to investigate the influence of midlife testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels on later-life in vivo markers of β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau deposition in clinically healthy older men.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This time-lagged study includes participants enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Third Generation cohort. One hundred fifty-nine men (mean age<sub>PET-scan</sub> = 58 [±/9] years) underwent blood (hormones) collection in 2002 to 2005, and then a single Aβ <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PiB-positron emission tomography (PET) and <sup>18</sup>F-Flortaucipir (FTP)-PET scan in 2016 to 2020. Linear regressions examined sex-stratified associations among total testosterone, and SHBG with Aβ-PET, and tau-PET after adjusting for age. Separate models examined the moderating effect of Aβ-PET and <i>APOE</i>ε4.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In men, the elevated SHBG level was associated with lower tau-PET in entorhinal (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0005], <i>p</i> = 0.007), inferior temporal (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0004], <i>p</i> = 0.04), and rostral middle frontal regions (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0004], <i>p</i> = 0.02). These findings were largely driven by <i>APOE</i>ε4 non-carriers. Testosterone levels were not associated with the Aβ-PET or tau-PET signal.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We report a potential protective effect of SHBG levels on tau-PET burden in men. Higher levels of SHBG have been associated with lower risk of vascular-related comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes, and is regulated by modifiable lifestyle factors. Given mounting evidence of a link between vascular injury and tauopathy in preclinical AD, our findings suggest an intriguing protective cardiovascular pathway for men against higher tau burden later in life.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Several lines of evidence implicate adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in cognitive functions, in mood- and anxiety-related behaviors, and in the therapeutic effects of antidepressants. Augmenting α5-γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor function has shown neurotrophic effects in stress and aged models, but its impact on mouse AHN remains unknown. Adult male 129S6/SvEvTac mice (<i>n</i> = 30 total) were treated for 6 weeks with GL-II-73, an α5-GABAA-R-positive allosteric modulator (α5-PAM) [30 mg/kg, per os, (P.O.)] or fluoxetine, a prototypical selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor known to increase AHN (18 mg/kg, P.O.). Proliferation in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG) was assessed by the level of Ki67, a marker of dividing cells; survival of the young neurons was assessed by retention of the 5-Bromo-2´-Deoxyuridine (BrdU) nucleotide analog injected 2 weeks before sacrifice. Finally, maturation of young adult-born neurons was evaluated by measuring the fraction of BrdU-positive cells that are also DCX and/or NeuN-positive, capturing overall maturation and speed of maturation. Similarly to fluoxetine, a chronic treatment with GL-II-73 stimulated all stages of AHN, significantly increasing neuronal progenitor proliferation, survival of adult-born granule cells, and maturation of young neurons in the DG of the hippocampus. Chronic treatment with GL-II-73, a α5-GABAA-R-positive allosteric modulator, increased AHN, including cellular proliferation, survival, and maturation of newborn neurons, to levels comparable to fluoxetine.</p>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Smartphones have become integral to daily life, and their overuse can lead to various maladaptive behaviors and decision-making patterns. This study investigated the neural and computational mechanisms underlying smartphone addiction, focusing on its impact on loss-aversion decision-making. We combined computational models, such as the Drift Diffusion Model, with a novel analytic approach, intersubject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA). Behavioral results showed that higher smartphone addiction symptom (SAS) scores were correlated with reduced loss-aversion (lnλ), while the drift rate was positively associated with SAS. Furthermore, the drift rate mediated the relationship between SAS and lnλ. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that SAS was associated with increased gain-related activity in the occipital pole (OP) but decreased activity in the precuneus and middle frontal gyrus. Additionally, reduced activity was observed in the angular gyrus and superior temporal gyrus during loss processing. IS-RSA further identified brain activation patterns in the default mode network, frontoparietal network, visual network, and sensorimotor network, which corresponded to intersubject variations in SAS, particularly during gain processing but not during loss processing. These patterns were also observed when gains and losses were processed simultaneously. Mediation analyses indicated that brain activation strengths in the OP, precuneus, and MFG during gain processing mediated the relationship between SAS and lnλ and drift rate. Similar mediation effects were observed for intersubject variations in SAS and computational process patterns (eg decision threshold, drift rate, and nondecision time) within these networks. These findings provide novel insights into the neural and computational mechanisms of loss aversion in smartphone addiction, with implications for understanding cognitive biases and informing interventions for addictive behaviors.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are two kinds of serious psychiatric disorders. Despite different diagnostic criteria, the patients have significant biologic and clinical overlaps, challenging for the early identification, diagnosis, intervention, and management of these two diseases. Given the limited research on interhemispheric functional connectivity (FC) differences between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, we included 38 schizophrenia patients, 34 bipolar disorder patients and 57 HCs from a publicly available fMRI dataset to investigate it across the whole brain by using voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC). Correlation analyses were also performed to examine the associations between VMHC values, clinical symptoms, and neuropsychological tests. Our findings revealed that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder shared the functional alteration in the insula, exhibiting decreased VMHC compared to HCs, but the specific regions differed: bipolar disorder demonstrated alternations in the inferior occipital gyrus, while schizophrenia showed changes in the postcentral gyrus. Both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder showed decreased VMHC relative to HCs. These alterations correlated with clinical symptoms, underscoring the importance of these brain regions in mental diseases. Our research provides new insights into the similarities and differences between the two diseases, suggesting that interhemispheric functional disconnection might critically contribute to the development and maintenance of these psychiatric disorders.</span>

                Background Uterine rupture (UR) remains a major cause of maternal morbidity, especially in low-resource settings. While typically detected during labor, some cases are clinically silent, discovered incidentally during imaging/surgery, highlighting a knowledge gap in risk assessment. In Tunisia, 1.5% of pregnancies involve UR, mostly scar-related. The study aim was to identify factors associated with the development of complete UR in cases that were incidentally found during pregnancy or delivery. Methods This was retrospective, longitudinal cohort study conducted over an eleven-year period, from January 2014 to December 2024, at the Gynaecology and Obstetrics department B, Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia. Asymptomatic UR cases (complete/incomplete) were analysed to compare clinical profiles, identify risk factors, and assess maternal and neonatal outcomes. Results A total of 41 cases of asymptomatic UR were included, which accounted for an average of 50% of the UR cases. In a cohort comparing complete UR cases (N=27) and incomplete UR cases (N=14), significant differences in duration of pregnancy and labor were found. The mean gestational age was longer in the incomplete UR group (p=0.03), and the duration of labor was also significantly longer (p=0.006). No significant differences were observed in sociodemographic characteristics, quality of prenatal care, or complications such as gestational diabetes or preeclampsia. Nonsignificant factors included pregnancy interval, scars number and labor stagnation. The analysis showed two significant predictors of complete UR outcomes. Prolonged labor (>220 minutes) was strongly associated with increased odds of complete UR (OR=45.231, 95% CI=2.591-789.486, p=0.009) and lower maternal weight (<68 kg) correlated with reduced odds of incomplete UR (OR=0.033, 95% CI=0.001–0.837, p=0.039), suggesting a protective effect per kilogram decrease. Conclusion Findings redefine UR as part of a broader clinical spectrum, not just an acute complication, enabling tailored surveillance and improved prevention in high-risk pregnancies.

                Background Many graduates are unprepared for the workforce because of the abysmal increase in unemployment rates. While academics have tried to incorporate employable skills into curricula, graduates must understand social and humanitarian principles to meet globalization demands. This study investigated how service-learning influences the prosocial skills of economics undergraduate pre-service teachers and its impact on their future employment prospects. Method We adopted a mixed-method design of the sequential explanatory approach. A purposive random sampling technique was used to select 150 pre-service teachers (300 and 400 level) from five departments in the Faculty of Education at the University of Ibadan offering economics. A convenience sampling technique was used to sample 10 students for focus group discussions, who served as team leaders in service-learning courses. The Students’ Prosocial and Professional Competencies Questionnaire (r= 0.79) and a Focus Group Discussion Guide were used for data collection. Quantitative data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation and paired sample t-test at significance level of 0.05, while qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results The mean scores for the constructs were communication skills (2.61), teamwork (2.45), empathy (2.35), culture (2.30) and social responsibility (2.50). The mean for communication skills increased significantly from 2.61 before the intervention to 3.35. The reduction in the standard deviation indicates that the communication skills of pre-service teachers have become more consistent and prominent (F=24.87), confirming the statistical significance of these improvements. Similar improvements were observed in teamwork skills, with the mean score rising from 2.62 before intervention to 3.36 and statistically significant (F=9.71). Conclusion The undergraduate students had low overall prosocial ability scores, indicating a lack of prosocial competencies essential for effective teaching and professional success in education. Policymakers and stakeholders should recognize the value of service learning and support its integration into teacher education programs through funding, resources, and institutional encouragement.

                Introduction Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease of high prevalence worldwide. It usually coexists with chondyslipidemia, obesity and hypertension and can present complications such as peripheral neuropathy and nephropathy. Method Retrospective cohort study of 441 patients with diabetes mellitus 2. Medical records were reviewed to obtain the variables under study. All patients of both sexes treated between July 2023 and November 2024 in a primary care hospital were included and patients on predialysis or dialysis, total or partial lower limb amputation, and sequelae of cerebrovascular disease were excluded. Logistic regression analysis was used. Results Among the signs of DN, anhidrosis and mycosis predominated in patients of both sexes, and among the symptoms, burning, prickling and leg pain when walking. The majority of patients with neuropathy are between 60 and 79 years of age, female, have hypertension, have a disease duration of 12.83 ± 8.73 years, Hb1Ac of 7.67% ±1.69, glucose of 153.93 ± 66.17 and hemoglobin of 12.98 ± 1.39. Most patients have CKD G1 and G2. The Chi-square test indicates only relationship between age group, sex and stages. In the quantitative analysis, the Krustall Wallis test indicates that there are significant differences in patient stages according to age, time of disease and HbA1c. Conclusions G1 and G2 stages, female sex and hypertension predominated in patients with CKD. The older the patient and the longer the time with diabetes, the higher the CKD stage. There is a relationship with age group, sex and CKD stages. Age < 79 years and the absence of hypertension are protective factors for the progression of CKD and male sex is considered a risk factor.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-582/v1?src=rss">The Limits of AI in Understanding Emotions: Challenges in Bridging Human Experience and Machine Perception [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This article explores the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to replace the human factor in the analysis of emotions within financial decision-making contexts. The background of this study is as follows: growing reliance on Artificial Intelligence for text analysis, understanding its capacity to detect emotional patterns is particularly relevant in fields where emotional dynamics significantly influence behavior, such as trading. Method Our research method is based on a three-day trading experiment involving students, during which participants made decisions under conditions of uncertainty. At the end of the experiment, each participant wrote a free-form report describing their emotional experience. We applied four different Artificial Intelligence tools to analyze these texts and compared the results with those obtained through a traditional lexical analysis method. AI tools provided relatively consistent and coherent assessments of the general emotional tone in the texts. Results Our results suggest that they successfully identified dominant emotions such as fear, disappointment, and hope. However, the ability of Artificial Intelligence to detect more nuanced or mixed emotional states was limited. In contrast, traditional lexical analysis offered greater sensitivity to emotional complexity. Although both approaches converged on broad emotional tendencies, divergences appeared when addressing subtle or context-specific emotional shifts. Our findings suggest that AI can serve as a useful preliminary tool in the analysis of emotions in written texts, especially for identifying dominant patterns. Conclusion In conclusion, according to us, due to its limitations in detecting emotional nuances, Artificial Intelligence should be integrated into a hybrid analytical approach. Combining Artificial Intelligence with traditional or human-led analysis enhances both the precision and depth of interpretation. We argue that a hybrid model avoids the oversimplification of emotional data and better reflects the complexity of emotional dynamics in decision-making under uncertainty.

                The enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) is a modulator of lipid metabolism by catalyzing the biosynthesis of mono-unsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which SCD1 plays in health and disease can provide novel insides in therapeutic targets, a process that would be facilitated by the availability of high-quality antibodies. Here we have characterized nine SCD1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                <p>by Ismael Jaras, Marcos E. Orchard, Pedro E. Maldonado, Rodrigo C. Vergara</p>

Understanding the intricate interplay between neural dynamics and metabolic constraints is crucial for unraveling the mysteries of the brain. Despite the significance of this relationship, specific details concerning the impact of metabolism on neuronal dynamics and neural network architecture remain elusive, creating a notable gap in the existing literature. This study employs an energy-dependent neuron and plasticity model to analyze the role of local metabolic constraints in shaping both the dynamics and structure of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). Specifically, an energy-dependent version of the leaky integrate-and-fire model is utilized, along with a three-factor learning rule that incorporates postsynaptic available energy as the third factor. These models allow for fine-tuning sensitivity in the presence of energy imbalances. Analytical expressions predicting the network’s activity and structure are derived, and a fixed point analysis reveals the emergence of attractor states characterized by neuronal and synaptic sensitivity to energy imbalances. Analytical findings are validated through numerical simulations using an excitatory-inhibitory network. Furthermore, these simulations enable the study of SNN activity and structure under conditions simulating metabolic impairment. In conclusion, by employing energy-dependent models with adjustable sensitivity to energy imbalances, our study advances the understanding of how metabolic constraints shape SNN dynamics and structure. Moreover, in light of compelling evidence linking neuronal metabolic impairment to neurodegenerative diseases, the incorporation of local metabolic constraints into the investigation of neuronal network structure and activity opens an intriguing avenue for inspiring the development of therapeutic interventions.

                <p>by Wentao Ma, Chunwu Yu</p>

Modern cell membranes are primarily composed of phospholipids, while primitive cell membranes in the beginning of life are believed to have formed from simpler lipids (such as fatty acids) synthesized in the prebiotic environment. An attractive experimental study suggested that the corresponding “membrane-takeover” (as an evolutionary process) is likely to have occurred very early (e.g., in the RNA world) due to some simple physical effects, and might have subsequently triggered some other evolutionary processes. Here, via computer modeling on a system of RNA-based protocells, we convinced the plausibility of such a scenario and elaborated on relevant mechanisms. It is shown that in protocells with a fatty-acid membrane, because of the benefit of phospholipid content (i.e., stabilizing the membrane), a ribozyme favoring the synthesis of phospholipids may emerge; subsequently, due to the reduced membrane permeability on account of the phospholipid content, two other functional RNA species could arise: a ribozyme exploiting more fundamental materials (thus more permeable) for nucleotide synthesis and a species favoring across-membrane transportation. This case exemplifies a combination of experimental and theoretical efforts regarding early evolution, which may shed light on that notoriously complicated problem: the origin of life.

                Fulton et al. identify the chromatin regulator ZBTB7A as a key driver of stress susceptibility via its actions in the astrocytes of the orbitofrontal cortex. Using cross-species epigenomic profiling and rodent models, they show that astrocytic ZBTB7A reshapes neuronal activity and behavior following stress, revealing a glial-mediated epigenetic mechanism of depression vulnerability.

                Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) are rarely elicited in HIV-1 infection. Transient deletion of glycans surrounding the CD4bs in simian-human immunodeficiency viruses markedly enhanced the induction of CD4bs bNAbs in infected macaques by immunofocusing early B cell responses and guiding their affinity maturation.

                Davidson et al. show that cohesin negatively supercoils DNA. In vitro, this process depends on the same DNA-binding sites and co-factors as cohesin’s loop-extrusion activity, and a cohesin mutant defective in negative supercoiling forms shorter loops in cells. These results indicate that cohesin supercoils DNA during loop extrusion.

Although this speed limit appears to hold for high-level cognitive functions, we argue that unconscious processing for real-time control of movement, which occupies a majority of neurons in the central nervous system and accounts for most of the information throughput of humans, substantially exceeds this limit.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89616">Fingertip viscoelasticity enables human tactile neurons to encode loading history alongside current force</a></h4>

              
                Human skin and its underlying tissues constitute a viscoelastic medium, implying that any deformation depends not only on the currently applied force, but also on the recent loading history. The extent to which this physical memory influences the signaling of first-order tactile neurons during natural hand use is not well understood. Here, we examined the effect of past loading on the responses of fast-adapting (FA-1) and slowly-adapting (SA-1 and SA-2) first-order tactile neurons innervating the human fingertip to loadings applied in different directions representative of object manipulation tasks. We found that variation in the preceding loading affected neurons’ overall signaling of force direction. Some neurons kept signaling the current direction, while others signaled both the current and preceding direction, or even primarily the preceding direction. In addition, ongoing impulse activity in SA-2 neurons between loadings signaled information related to the fingertip’s viscoelastic deformation state. We conclude that tactile neurons at the population level signal continuous information about the fingertip’s viscoelastic deformation state, which is shaped by both its recent history and current loading. Such information might be sufficient for the brain to correctly interpret current force loading and help in computing accurate motor commands for interactions with objects in manipulation and haptic tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98777">A multiplex of connectome trajectories enables several connectivity patterns in parallel</a></h4>

              
                Complex brain function comprises a multitude of neural operations in parallel and often at different speeds. Each of these operations is carried out across a network of distributed brain regions. How multiple distributed processes are facilitated in parallel is largely unknown. We postulate that such processing relies on a multiplex of dynamic network patterns emerging in parallel but from different functional connectivity (FC) timescales. Given the dominance of inherently slow fMRI in network science, it is unknown whether the brain leverages such multi-timescale network dynamics. We studied FC dynamics concurrently across a breadth of timescales (from infraslow to γ-range) in rare, simultaneously recorded intracranial EEG and fMRI in humans, and source-localized scalp EEG-fMRI data in humans. We examined spatial and temporal convergence of connectome trajectories across timescales. ‘Spatial convergence’ refers to spatially similar EEG and fMRI connectome patterns, while ‘temporal convergence’ signifies the more specific case of spatial convergence at corresponding timepoints in EEG and fMRI. We observed spatial convergence but temporal divergence across FC timescales; connectome states (recurrent FC patterns) with partial spatial similarity were found in fMRI and all EEG frequency bands, but these occurred asynchronously across FC timescales. Our findings suggest that hemodynamic and frequency-specific electrophysiological signals, while involving similar large-scale networks, represent functionally distinct connectome trajectories that operate at different FC speeds and in parallel. This multiplex is poised to enable concurrent connectivity across multiple sets of brain regions independently.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90387">Precise spatial tuning of visually driven alpha oscillations in human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal oscillations at about 10 Hz, called alpha oscillations, are often thought to arise from synchronous activity across the occipital cortex and are usually largest when the cortex is inactive. However, recent studies measuring visual receptive fields have reported that local alpha power increases when cortex is excited by visual stimulation. This contrasts with the expectation that alpha oscillations are associated with cortical inactivity. Here, we used intracranial electrodes in human patients to measure alpha oscillations in response to visual stimuli whose location varied systematically across the visual field. We hypothesized that stimulus-driven local increases in alpha power result from a mixture of two effects: a reduction in alpha oscillatory power and a simultaneous increase in broadband power. To test this, we implemented a model to separate these components. The two components were then independently fit by population receptive field (pRF) models. We find that the alpha pRFs have similar center locations to pRFs estimated from broadband power but are several times larger and exhibit the opposite effect: alpha oscillatory power decreases in response to stimuli within the receptive field, reinforcing the link between alpha oscillations and cortical inactivity, whereas broadband power increases. The results demonstrate that alpha suppression in the human visual cortex can be precisely tuned, but that to measure these effects, it is essential to separate the oscillatory signal from broadband power changes. Finally, we show how the large size and the negative valence of alpha pRFs can explain key features of exogenous visual attention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91582">Neural substrates of cold nociception in Drosophila larva</a></h4>

              
                Metazoans detect and differentiate between innocuous (non-painful) and/or noxious (harmful) environmental cues using primary sensory neurons, which serve as the first node in a neural network that computes stimulus-specific behaviors to either navigate away from injury-causing conditions or to perform protective behaviors that mitigate extensive injury. The ability of an animal to detect and respond to various sensory stimuli depends upon molecular diversity in the primary sensors and the underlying neural circuitry responsible for the relevant behavioral action selection. Recent studies in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae have revealed that somatosensory class III multidendritic (CIII md) neurons function as multimodal sensors regulating distinct behavioral responses to innocuous mechanical and nociceptive thermal stimuli. Recent advances in circuit bases of behavior have identified and functionally validated <i>Drosophila</i> larval somatosensory circuitry involved in innocuous (mechanical) and noxious (heat and mechanical) cues. However, central processing of cold nociceptive cues remained unexplored. We implicate multisensory integrators (Basins), premotor (Down-and-Back), and projection (A09e and TePns) neurons as neural substrates required for cold-evoked behavioral and calcium responses. Neural silencing of cell types downstream of CIII md neurons led to significant reductions in cold-evoked behaviors, and neural co-activation of CIII md neurons plus additional cell types facilitated larval contraction (CT) responses. Further, we demonstrate that optogenetic activation of CIII md neurons evokes calcium increases in these neurons. Finally, we characterize the premotor to motor neuron network underlying cold-evoked CT and delineate the muscular basis of CT response. Collectively, we demonstrate how <i>Drosophila</i> larvae process cold stimuli through functionally diverse somatosensory circuitry responsible for generating stimulus-specific behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100497">BCAS2 promotes primitive hematopoiesis by sequestering β-catenin within the nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Breast carcinoma amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2), a core component of the hPrP19 complex, plays crucial roles in various physiological and pathological processes. However, whether BCAS2 has functions other than being a key RNA-splicing regulator within the nucleus remains unknown. Here, we show that BCAS2 is essential for primitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish and mouse embryos. The activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is required for hematopoietic progenitor differentiation, is significantly decreased upon depletion of <i>bcas2</i> in zebrafish embryos and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Interestingly, BCAS2 deﬁciency has no obvious impact on the splicing efficiency of β-catenin pre-mRNA, while significantly attenuating β-catenin nuclear accumulation. Moreover, we find that BCAS2 directly binds to β-catenin via its coiled-coil domains, thereby sequestering β-catenin within the nucleus. Thus, our results uncover a previously unknown function of BCAS2 in promoting Wnt signaling by enhancing β-catenin nuclear retention during primitive hematopoiesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98469">Artificial intelligence approaches for tumor phenotype stratification from single-cell transcriptomic data</a></h4>

              
                Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) coupled with robust computational analysis facilitates the characterization of phenotypic heterogeneity within tumors. Current scRNA-seq analysis pipelines are capable of identifying a myriad of malignant and non-malignant cell subtypes from single-cell profiling of tumors. However, given the extent of intra-tumoral heterogeneity, it is challenging to assess the risk associated with individual cell subpopulations, primarily due to the complexity of the cancer phenotype space and the lack of clinical annotations associated with tumor scRNA-seq studies. To this end, we introduce SCellBOW, a scRNA-seq analysis framework inspired by document embedding techniques from the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). SCellBOW is a novel computational approach that facilitates effective identification and high-quality visualization of single-cell subpopulations. We compared SCellBOW with existing best practice methods for its ability to precisely represent phenotypically divergent cell types across multiple scRNA-seq datasets, including our in-house generated human splenocyte and matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) dataset. For tumor cells, SCellBOW estimates the relative risk associated with each cluster and stratifies them based on their aggressiveness. This is achieved by simulating how the presence or absence of a specific cell subpopulation influences disease prognosis. Using SCellBOW, we identified a hitherto unknown and pervasive AR−/NE<sub>low</sub> (androgen-receptor-negative, neuroendocrine-low) malignant subpopulation in metastatic prostate cancer with conspicuously high aggressiveness. Overall, the risk-stratification capabilities of SCellBOW hold promise for formulating tailored therapeutic interventions by identifying clinically relevant tumor subpopulations and their impact on prognosis.

">Mapping concept and relational semantic representation in the brain using large language models</a></h4>

              
                How the brain organizes semantic information is one of the most challenging and expansive questions in cognitive neuroscience. To shed light on this issue, prior studies have attempted to decode how the brain represents concepts. We instead examined how relational information is encoded, which we pursued by submitting texts to a contemporary large language model and extracting relational embeddings from the model. Using behavioral data (N = 636), we found these embeddings capture independent information about scenes and objects, along with relational information on their semantic links. Turning to fMRI data (N = 60), we leveraged these embeddings for representational similarity analysis: The occipitotemporal cortex represents concepts in isolation, whereas the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia principally encode relational information. Relational coding within prefrontal and striatal areas also tracks how participants reason about scenes and objects. Altogether, this research maps how information progresses from concept-level to integrative forms and how this translates into behavior.

">A theoretically driven calculation for language dominance and degree of multilingualism</a></h4>

              
                Bilingualism research has long been challenged by a lack of a unified approach to quantifying language dominance and degree of multilingualism. While numerous questionnaires (e.g., LHQ, BLP, LEAP Q, and LUQ) provide valuable data on language background variables, they lack a standardized formula to compute key measures from it. We introduce two formulas that synthesize critical linguistic variables to efficiently calculate language dominance and a multilingualism score that ranges from perfect monolingualism to native-like proficiency in multiple languages. Validation across two large datasets shows our dominance measure closely aligns with more complex PCA methods while being simpler and more efficient.

">Credit Assignment via Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity: Theoretical Frameworks</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP) is a form of synaptic plasticity in which dendritic Ca2+; plateau potentials in hippocampal pyramidal neurons drive rapid place field formation. Unlike traditional learning rules, BTSP learns correlations on the timescales of seconds and rapidly changes single-unit activity in only a few trials. To explore how BTSP-like learning can be integrated into network models, we propose a generalized BTSP rule (gBTSP), which we apply to unsupervised and supervised learning tasks, in both feedforward and recurrent networks. Unsupervised gBTSP mirrors classical frameworks of competitive learning, learning place field maps (in the feed-forward case), and attractive memory networks (in the recurrent case). For supervised learning, we show that plateau events can reduce task error, enabling gBTSP to solve tasks such as trajectory matching and delayed non-match-to-sample. However, we find that credit assignment via gBTSP becomes harder to achieve with increased network depth or CA3-like recurrence. This suggests that additional features may be needed to support BTSP-mediated few-shot learning of complex tasks in the hippocampus.

">Modulation of decodable semantic features of brain activity via selection attention</a></h4>

              
                We frequently encounter linguistic information in multiple modalities, such as text and speech, simultaneously. In such cases, we understand the information by selectively attending to one of the modalities. Previous research has shown that selective attention to a specific stimulus modality modulates cortical activity patterns. However, it remains unclear which aspects of linguistic information are selectively modulated by attention and how such modulation influences the decodability of semantic content. To address this question, we constructed decoding models of latent semantic features from the functional magnetic resonance imaging data of six participants in both unimodal (either visual or auditory) and bimodal conditions (simultaneously visual and auditory, with participants attending to a single modality at a time). In unimodal conditions, we successfully decoded the semantic contents from the brain activity. Decodable features were consistent across modalities in both intra-modal and cross-modal decoding. For bimodal conditions, decoding accuracies for the attended stimuli were higher than for the ignored when training and test stimuli belonged to the same modality. Furthermore, decodable features were more consistent across modalities with attended than ignored stimuli in both intra-modal and cross-modal decoding. These results indicate common decodable semantic features regardless of the presentation modality and that selective attention enhances the semantic representations contributing to such decodability.

">Replay of episodic experience in human infants</a></h4>

              
                Sequentially structured and temporally compressed reactivation of episodes of experience plays a key role for memory and learning in the mature mammalian brain. This type of neural coding, known as replay, could also drive the enormous progress in sequential learning seen in human early life. Rodent models, however, suggest that replay emerges slowly and still refines in the juvenile phase. To test whether this prediction holds in humans, we introduced a novel fast event-related stimulation paradigm for infants undergoing non-invasive electroencephalography. Leveraging time-resolved decoding techniques we discovered replay of visual objects already in infants as young as 10 months. Reactivation responses revealed a forward sequential structure and temporal compression of the learnt sequence by a factor of 6 to 7. These results demonstrate that human replay develops considerably earlier than in rodents. Our insights stimulate future research exploring how replay contributes to the development of fundamental human cognitive capacities including language processing and action planning.

MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short noncoding RNAs that individually can negatively regulate dozens of protein-coding transcripts. Previously, we reported that central injection of antisense oligonucleotides targeting microRNA-134 (Ant-134) shortly after status epilepticus potently suppressed the development of recurrent spontaneous seizures in rodent models of temporal lobe epilepsy. The mechanism(s) of these anti-seizure effects remain, however, incompletely understood. Here we show that intracerebroventricular microinjection of Ant-134 in male mice with pre-existing epilepsy caused by intraamygdala kainic acid-induced status epilepticus potently reduces the occurrence of spontaneous seizures. Recordings from ex vivo brain slices collected 2-4 days after Ant-134 injection in epileptic mice, detected a number of electrophysiological phenotypic changes consistent with reduced excitability. Specifically, Ant-134 reduced action potential bursts after current injection in CA1 neurons and reduced miniature excitatory post-synaptic current frequencies in CA1 neurons. Ant-134 also reduced general network excitability, including attenuating pro-excitatory CA1 responses to Schaffer collateral stimulation in hippocampal slices from epileptic mice. Together, the present study demonstrates inhibiting miR-134 reduces single neuron and network hyperexcitability in mice and extends support for this approach to treat drug-resistant epilepsies.

">White matter micro- and macrostructural properties in midlife individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease: Associations with sex and menopausal status</a></h4>

              
                Women are at greater lifetime risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), potentially due to midlife fractional anisotropy (FA) and lower mean diffusivity in fornix and corpus callosum, indicating more densely organized white matter. Perimenopausal women were the exception, with white matter profiles closely resembling those of men. Perimenopausal women exhibited minimal or absent fiber cross-section and FDC sex differences and a reversal of the fornix FA advantage observed in pre- and postmenopausal women. These cross-sectional results are consistent with sex differences in white matter organization. Importantly, the perimenopause emerges as a critical window of neural reorganization in the female midlife aging brain characterized by temporary convergence toward male-like white matter organization. Longitudinal analyses are key to identifying women who do or do not revert to a premenopausal profile, which may inform AD risk.

">Drosophila learn about properties of objects through physical interaction</a></h4>

              
                Animals interact with unfamiliar objects to learn about their properties and guide future behavior, but the underlying neurobiological mechanism is not well understood. Here, we developed a behavioral paradigm in which freely walking Drosophila melanogaster are repeatedly guided to spherical objects using a visual cue. Flies exhibited diverse and structured object interaction motifs, including 'ball pulling', and 'ball walking', that evolved over time. Notably, flies developed a strong preference for immobile over mobile objects, despite their near identical appearance, suggesting they learn about object stability through physical interaction. This preference was impaired by silencing specific h{Delta} neurons in the fan-shaped body, a circuit known for spatial navigation through vector computations. h{Delta} neurons also modulated object interaction motifs and fidelity of following visual guidance cues, pointing to a role in balancing goal-directed and exploratory behaviors. These findings establish Drosophila as a model for investigating how internal representations and multimodal feedback contribute to adaptive object interaction.

">The mPFC molecular clock mediates the effects of sleep deprivation on depression-like behavior and regulates sleep consolidation and homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Disruptions in sleep, circadian rhythms, and neural plasticity are closely linked to the pathophysiology and treatment of depression. Acute sleep deprivation (SD) produces rapid but transient antidepressant effects, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using a mouse model of stress-induced depression, we found altered sleep architecture, impaired sleep homeostasis, and disrupted day-night oscillations of the markers of glutamatergic plasticity - Homer1a and synaptic AMPAR expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These changes were accompanied by a blunted homeostatic response to SD. We further show that SD and ketamine, both rapid-acting antidepressants, exert opposing effects on mPFC circadian gene expression: SD enhances the expression of negative clock loop genes (e.g., Per, Cry), mirroring stress effects, while ketamine downregulates these same genes. Targeted deletion of the core clock gene Bmal1 in CaMK2a-expressing excitatory neurons of the mPFC disrupted sleep-wake architecture, elevated slow-wave activity, and abolished the behavioral and molecular (Homer1a) response to SD. Additionally, pharmacological activation of the clock repressor REV-ERB suppressed the antidepressant effects of SD. Our results demonstrate that the mPFC molecular clock is essential for the regulation of sleep consolidation and homeostasis, and mediates the effects of SD on behavior.

">Experience-dependent sharp-wave ripple deficits in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid pathology is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) play a role in memory consolidation and are impaired in various AD mouse models. However, it remains unclear how experience affects SWRs and how extrinsic signals contribute to SWR generation in AD. Here, by combining behavioral, in vivo electrophysiological and fiber photometry approaches, we show that an experience-dependent increase in hippocampal SWRs is disrupted in male and female 5xFAD mice. In wild-type mice, SWRs during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) increased after exploring a novel environment and the SWR rate gradually decreased with NREMS episodes and multiple behavioral sessions. However, 5xFAD mice did not show such experience-dependent SWR rate changes. A similar deficit was observed after a novel object recognition test. On the other hand, sleep spindles were intact in 5xFAD mice under all conditions. Since deficits in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons have been implicated in 5xFAD mice and SWRs are regulated by hippocampal cholinergic tone, we examined if hippocampal cholinergic signals could explain experience-dependent SWR deficits. Using fiber photometry and expressing a genetically encoded acetylcholine (ACh) sensor in the hippocampus, we found that ACh dynamics in the hippocampus were intact in 5xFAD mice across sleep-wake cycles, including NREMS, while we also found a negative correlation of infraslow cortical signal power dynamics with hippocampal ACh signals during NREMS regardless of genotypes. These results suggest that experience-dependent SWR deficits stem from non-cholinergic pathological changes.

">Personalized whole-brain Ising models with heterogeneous nodes capture differences among brain regions</a></h4>

              
                Multiple lines of research have studied how complex brain dynamics emerge from underlying connectivity by using Ising models as simplified neural mass models. However, limitations on parameter estimation have prevented their use with individual, high-resolution human neuroimaging data. Furthermore, most studies focus only on connectivity, ignoring node heterogeneity, even though real brain regions have different structural and dynamical properties. Here we present an improved approach to fitting Ising models to 360-region functional MRI data: derivation of an initial guess model from group data, optimization of simulation temperature, and two stages of Boltzmann learning, first with group data, then with individual data. We then analyze how data binarization threshold affects goodness-of-fit, the role of the external field in model behavior, and correlations between model parameters and features from structural MRI, including myelination and sulcus depth. The fitted models can reproduce the functional connectivity of the data across a wide range of thresholds, but the role of the external field parameters in model behavior increases with threshold. In parallel, the coupling between nodes correlates with structural connectivity throughout this range, but correlations between the external field and structural features increase with threshold. These results show how our methodology enables personalized, biophysically interpretable modeling of structure-function relationships at the whole-brain level, which can aid understanding of individual differences in brain network organization and dynamics. This approach will help to bridge the gap between connectomics, which emphasizes brain networks, and translational neuroscience, which often focuses on the unique roles of brain regions.

">Lipid droplet dysmetabolism affects cell homeostasis in an in vitro model of Alzheimer disease</a></h4>

              
                Lipid droplets (LD) are dynamic organelles involved in neutral lipid storage, energy homeostasis, and can prevent lipotoxicity and oxidative distress. LD dysmetabolism has been considered a pathological hallmark in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD). In this study, we investigated the alterations in LD metabolism and their impact on mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) in an in vitro model of AD, namely the mouse neuroblastoma cell (N2A) line overexpressing the amyloid precursor protein with the familial Swedish mutation (APPswe). In APPswe cells, we found depletion of LD associated with an accumulation of free fatty acids that can be related with the observed LD degradation by chaperone-mediated autophagy. In these cells we also found decreased levels of seipin, which might contribute to triacylglycerol accumulation. These lipid alterations are associated with increased levels of ROS and lipid peroxidation in APPswe cells. The pharmacological modulation of DGAT1, that mediates triacylglycerol synthesis, normalized LD size and improved ER-mitochondria contacts and mitochondrial function in APPswe cells. In summary, these observations suggest the involvement of altered LD metabolism in AD pathophysiology, which impact on MAM and mitochondria function leading to cell dyshomeostasis. Our findings also support the idea that LD are relevant therapeutic targets in AD.

">Boolean Network Modeling Identifies Cognitive Resilience in the First Murine Model of Asymptomatic Alzheimer Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder defined by amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), yet approximately 30% of aged individuals exhibit these hallmark lesions without developing cognitive impairment, a clinically silent condition termed asymptomatic AD (AsymAD). The molecular basis of this cognitive resilience remains poorly understood due to a lack of mechanistic models. Here, we integrate systems level Boolean network modeling with in vivo validation to define the transcriptomic logic of AsymAD and uncover a novel preclinical model. Using Boolean implication networks trained on large-scale human cortical RNA seq datasets, we identified a robust and invariant AD gene signature that accurately stratifies disease states across independent datasets. Application of this signature to Chromogranin A deficient PS19 mice (CgA-KO/PS19) revealed a unique resilience phenotype: male mice developed AD like molecular and neuropathological profiles in the pre-frontal cortex yet retained intact learning and memory. Female CgA-KO/PS19 mice displayed even greater protection, including reduced Tau phosphorylation and preserved synaptic ultrastructure. These findings establish the first validated murine model of AsymAD and identify CgA as a modifiable node linking neuroendocrine signaling, Tauopathy, and cognitive preservation. This work provides a scalable platform to probe sex-specific resilience, uncover early-stage biomarkers, and accelerate preventive therapeutic development in AD.

">The Art of Not Knowing: Accommodating Structured Missingness in Biomedical Research</a></h4>

              
                Missing data remain a ubiquitous and critical challenge in large-scale clinical studies. Despite advances in imputation, most existing methods fail to address structured missingness, where data are missing according a deterministic pattern and which arise due to systematic patterns introduced by experimental design, site protocols, or cohort differences. These patterns violate key assumptions of most imputation algorithms, yet their impact is rarely evaluated. We demonstrate that structured missingness is a fundamental challenge to drawing valid inferences from standard imputation techniques. First, we present a comprehensive framework for understanding and accommodating the effects of structured missingness. Next, we show through simulations and real-world psychometric data with structured missingness, that widely used algorithms optimised for numerical precision (e.g., Extra Trees, AutoComplete) underperform due to site effects, while donor-based methods (e.g., MICE, hierarchical MICE) better preserve multivariate structure. We propose a novel hierarchical approach that provides optimal performance in simulated and experimental data. Finally, we show that commonly used accuracy metrics, such as mean squared error can obscure these failures, and are therefore inadequate for the evaluation of structured missingness. In contrast, other divergence-based metrics offer a more sensitive and interpretable alternative. We apply this approach to harmonising psychometric data across cohorts, which provides excellent item-level alignment across different instruments. Our study highlights the need for a paradigm shift in handling missing data within biomedical research, moving beyond conventional imputation frameworks to develop tools that can account for structured missingness. This shift is essential for ensuring reliable inference in multi-site clinical studies, precision medicine, and large-scale population analyses.

">Auditory Gamma-Frequency Entrainment Abolishes Working Memory Deficits in a Rodent Model of Autism</a></h4>

              
                Individuals on the autism spectrum often exhibit atypical responses to sensory stimuli and difficulties with behavioral regulation, reflecting altered functional patterns in core sensory-motor circuits. These sensory processing differences suggest the potential for using patterned auditory stimulation to modulate neural activity and mitigate symptoms. While impairments in higher cognitive functions are a hallmark of autism, they remain underexplored in rodent models compared to basic sensory-motor deficits. In this study, we investigated higher cognitive function in the valproic acid (VPA) rodent model of autism and evaluated whether auditory entrainment could ameliorate associated impairments. Pregnant dams received an intraperitoneal injection of VPA on embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), and offspring were subsequently tested on a delayed non-match to place (DNMP) task to assess working memory . Following 40Hz sensory entrainment, VPA-exposed animals showed significantly impaired performance and altered trial-by-trial learning dynamics, indicating deficits in working memory-based decision making. More importantly, auditory stimulation led to increased gamma-frequency oscillations and enhanced power in other bands (theta, beta) across brain regions, as assessed by LFP recordings in freely moving animals. These neural effects were sustained even after stimulation ended, indicating robust and lasting modulation of brain dynamics. This provides strong evidence for the therapeutic potential of sensory entrainment in reversing autism-related cognitive deficits

">Interactions across hemispheres in prefrontal cortex reflect global cognitive processing</a></h4>

              
                Brain functions involve processing in local networks as well as modulation from brainwide signals, such as arousal. Dissecting the contributions of populations of neurons to these functions requires knowledge of interactions between brain areas. We investigated these interactions using dual hemisphere recordings of prefrontal cortex in monkeys performing a spatial memory task. To tease apart global processing from local interactions, we applied a novel statistical approach called pCCA-FA (a combination of probabilistic canonical correlation analysis and factor analysis) to analyze trial-to-trial variability in neuronal responses. We found substantial shared variability among neurons within each population, much of which was actually shared across populations and linked to an arousal process. Our work presents a path by which we can leverage multi-area recordings to reveal aspects of brain functions that are hidden in single-area recordings.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The prevailing irregular pattern of field potentials is little used due to the uncertain origin and identity of the source populations. After recovering clean source-specific dynamics (field potential-generators) in multiple brain areas of anesthetized rats we explored if they contain temporal identity features and to what extent they remain upon blending in the volume (raw field potentials). Relevant factors and mechanisms were further explored through a feed-forward model of field potentials. Signals were characterized with a multivariate set of statistical, spectral and nonlinear measures and explored with machine-learning classifiers. Despite the strong variability of electrographic patterns, field potential generators exhibit unique temporal signatures that allow their discrimination. Signatures are contained in 1 to 5 s segments in any given brain region and are robust across groups of animals. In contrast, the spatial overlap of sources and the contribution by remote potentials cause indeterminacy of raw field potentials, making them approach a noisy behavior. The so revealed source-specific signatures contain spectral and nonlinear features, thus overcoming the traditional notion of waves and frequency bands. We propose that besides upstream dynamics cytoarchitectural factors of the source population contribute to these unique signatures. These findings pave the way to utilize the vast reserve of information contained in irregular field potentials.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Adaptive decision-making requires consideration of risks and rewards associated with each option, as well as subjective preference for risky/safe alternatives. The lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) contributes to both reward and punishment processing as well as cost/benefit decision-making, but its role in punishment-driven risky decision-making remains unclear. To address this, we trained male rats in the Risky Decision-making Task, wherein subjects chose between a small, safe reward and a large reward with either 0% or 50% risk of foot shock punishment. We then recorded single unit activity in LOFC during task performance to determine how LOFC activity signals risky vs. safe options and choices. We observed that lOFC activity encodes risk in the environment prior to decision-making, then encodes reward magnitude independent of risk during action selection. Machine learning models revealed that lOFC activity accurately predicts risk but less effectively predicts impending choice, although integrating the outcome of the previous trial improved the accuracy of choice prediction. Finally, risk-preferring subjects demonstrated reduced encoding of risk and increased encoding of reward magnitude. This suggests that lOFC serves as a central hub wherein environmental information about risk and reward converges with internal, subjective information to guide risky decision-making.</span>

                <p>Regardless of discipline, quantitative literacy is a critical component of any scientist's skill set. A recent push from the NINDS has focused on enhancing and maintaining this expertise in trainees to enhance scientific fluency and to combat the reproducibility crisis. T32-funded programs often include off-campus retreats, providing opportunities to integrate a quantitative literacy component, or thematic focus. Here we will discuss the lessons and considerations learned from organizing a retreat focused on quantitative aspects of diagnostics for spinal cord injury. Survey results regarding retreat events and workshops reveal elements that were perceived to be successful by attendees. Events developed with active learning that focused on collaborative problem-solving and cross-discipline quantitative measures were well received by trainees. On the other hand, lectures and panel discussions were found to be less effective in boosting long-lasting improvements in quantitative literacy. Taken as a whole, these experiences from incorporating quantitative literacy into a T32 retreat offer strategies to consider when designing coursework or events focusing on this topic.</p>

                <p>Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) receive synaptic input from a diverse range of neurons in the developing and adult brain. Understanding whether the neuronal populations that synapse with OPCs in the healthy brain is altered by demyelination and/or remyelination may support the advancement of neuroprotective or myelin repair strategies being developed for demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. To explore this possibility, we employed cre-lox transgenic technology to facilitate the infection of OPCs by a modified rabies virus, enabling the retrograde monosynaptic tracing of neuron-&gt;OPC connectivity. In the healthy adult mouse, OPCs in the corpus callosum primarily received synaptic input from ipsilateral cortical neurons. Of the cortical neurons, ~50% were layer V pyramidal cells. Cuprizone demyelination reduced the total number of labeled neurons. However, the frequency/kinetics of mini-excitatory postsynaptic currents recorded from OPCs appeared preserved. Of particular interest, demyelination increased the number of labeled layer II/III pyramidal neurons and also increased at the expense of layer V pyramidal neurons, a change that was largely ameliorated by remyelination. These data suggest that in the healthy adult mouse brain, callosal OPCs primarily receive synaptic input from cortical layer V pyramidal neurons. However, callosal demyelination is associated with a population switch and OPCs equally synapse with layer II/III and V pyramidal neurons to synapse with OPCs, until myelin is restored.</p>

                Background Writing a medication prescription is a multifaceted skill expected of all junior doctors. However, many medical students feel a lack of preparedness and confidence after graduation. Separating the teaching of practical and clinical components may enhance understanding of the practical skills prior to integrating clinical knowledge to complete a prescription. This study aimed to: (1) assess whether pharmacist-led multimodal education interventions change the prescribing skills of Australian final-year medical students, (2) evaluate knowledge retention a year later in the same participants as junior doctors, and (3) determine whether there is an association between self-perceived confidence to prescribe and their practical ability to write safe and legal prescriptions. This manuscript details the methods used in this novel longitudinal study. Methods This non-randomised pre-post longitudinal study will be conducted in two phases. The control group received standard curriculum-based education. The intervention was pharmacist-led multimodal education on prescription writing skills for final-year medical students. The intervention group completed the pre-post and follow-up tests. This study was approved by the James Cook University Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number H9114). Discussion This paper presents the methods and protocol of an approved and funded non-randomised longitudinal study to investigate the potential of pharmacist educators to improve prescribing knowledge and skills among final-year medical students in Australia. Prescribing skills education for medical students may reduce the probability of potentially incorrect or unsafe prescribing habits as junior doctors. Education standards do not acknowledge adherence to local legal regulations when prescribing and do not recommend mandatory teaching or assessment criteria. This study will review the effectiveness of and need for additional education on the practical skill of writing a medication prescription. If positive, the findings of this study will have practical and policy impacts that may result in long-term improvement in safe medicine practice and ultimately benefit patient care.

                Background Pilot errors and preconditions are major concerns that affected by multiple factors physiologically, psychologically and psychosocially. This study aimed to analyse the correlation between the internal and external risk factors, and pilot preconditions in Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional study design with purposive sampling, directed to male pilots who had flight duty in the past seven days, underwent medical examination at the Aviation Medical Center, Jakarta, August 12–16, 2024. The data were collected through a self-report questionnaire, Trail Making Test A and B, laboratory tests (plasma lipid, fasting blood glucose), and physical measurements (height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure). The independent variables divided into internal factors (Age, Burnout, Metabolic Syndrome parameters); and external factors (Flight Time, Duty Time, Unscheduled Flight Duty, Number of Sectors, Sleep Duration). The dependent variables were pilot preconditions based on the Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). Results A total of 122 participants participated and 28.7% had an Unscheduled Flight Duty in the last 30 days. Significant correlations were found between Adverse Mental State and HDL-Cholesterol (95%CI=1.52–5.80), Adverse Physiological State and Burnout [Personal (95%CI=0.005–0,04), Work-Related (95%CI=0.009–0.042)], Physical Mental Limitation and Fasting Blood Glucose (95%CI=(-0.479)–(-0.071)), Number of Sectors (95%CI=0.022–3.001). For Personal Readiness (PR), significant correlation was found between PR-Psychological Demand and Flight-Time One Year (95%CI=(0.000–0.001), Sleep Duration (95%CI=(-0.137)–(-0.013)), Waist Circumference (95%CI=(-0.014)–(-0.002)), PR-Social Support and Sleep Duration (95%IK=0.018–0.207), Client-Related Burnout (95%IK=(-0.011)–(-0.002)). Conclusions The internal factors that correlated with pilot preconditions in Indonesia were Waist Circumference, HDL-Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Glucose, Personal Burnout, Work, and Client-related burnout. External factors that correlated with pilot preconditions were the Number of Sectors, Flight-Time One Year and Sleep duration. These findings emphasize the need to address physical and mental health aspects of pilots to enhance aviation safety.

                <p>by Nuray Sogunmez Erdogan, Deniz Eroglu</p>

Mapping cell distributions across spatial locations with whole-genome coverage is essential for understanding cellular responses and signaling However, current deconvolution models aim to estimate the proportions of distinct cell types in each spatial transcriptomics spot by integrating reference single-cell data. These models often assume strong overlap between the reference and spatial datasets, neglecting biology-grounded constraints such as sparsity and cell-type variations, as well as technical sparsity. As a result, these methods rely on over-permissive algorithms that ignore given constraints leading to inaccurate predictions, particularly in heterogeneous or unmatched datasets. We introduce Weight-Induced Sparse Regression (WISpR), a machine learning algorithm that integrates spot-specific hyperparameters and sparsity-driven modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that neglect biology-grounded constraints, WISpR accurately predicts cell-type distributions while preserving biological coherence, i.e., spatially and functionally consistent cell-type localization, even in unmatched datasets. Benchmarking against five alternative methods across ten datasets, WISpR consistently outperformed competitors and predicted cellular landscapes in both normal and cancerous tissues. By leveraging sparse cell-type arrangements, WISpR provides biologically informed, high-resolution cellular maps. Its ability to decode tissue organization in both healthy and diseased states highlights WISpR’s practical utility for spatial transcriptomics, particularly in challenging settings involving noise, sparsity, or reference mismatches.

                <p>by Chrysovalantis Voutouri, Lance L. Munn, Triantafyllos Stylianopoulos, Rakesh K. Jain</p>

The success of mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases such as COVID-19 has opened new avenues for their application in oncology. In cancer immunotherapy, mRNA vaccines—typically encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) 100–200 nm in size—enable delivery of tumor-specific antigens to activate immune responses. Here, we investigated the efficacy of mRNA vaccines in cancer by modeling tumor-immune interactions and tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamics to identify predictive biomarkers. Using a mechanistic mathematical model, we simulated tumor growth, immune cell dynamics, and vaccine pharmacokinetics in virtual cohorts of 1,635 patients generated via Latin hypercube sampling. Our simulations demonstrated a 45% average tumor size reduction and a 60% increase in CD8 + T cell infiltration in responsive tumors. Multiple regression analyses validated the predictive power of both pre- and on-treatment biomarkers. Key predictors of vaccine efficacy included antigen-presenting cell (APC) density and cytotoxic T cell fraction. Specifically, an APC density above 500 cells/mm³ in lymph nodes correlated with a 55% increase in vaccine response rates, while a cytotoxic T cell fraction above 20% in tumors was associated with a 60% reduction in tumor volume. A reduced M2/M1 macrophage ratio further improved treatment outcomes by 50%, highlighting the role of reprograming immunosuppressive macrophages. TME characteristics significantly influenced vaccine efficacy. Low extracellular matrix (ECM) density—modeled as a 5–10 × increase in hydraulic conductivity—combined with medium cytokine levels (IL-2 and TNF-α at 10–50 pg/ml), created optimal conditions for immune activation. Under these conditions, vaccine uptake improved by 35% and cytotoxic T cell infiltration increased by 65%, resulting in up to a 50% improvement in therapeutic outcomes. Model predictions aligned with pre-clinical data from melanoma and breast cancer models. These findings provide a framework for optimizing mRNA vaccine strategies and advancing personalized cancer immunotherapy.

During each heartbeat, a voltage wave propagates through the cardiac muscle, triggering action potentials in approximately two billion cardiomyocytes. This electrical activity ensures the coordinated contraction of the heart, which is essential for its pumping function. A key event in this process is the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels in the cell membrane, allowing calcium ions to enter the cardiac dyad and triggering a large-scale release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. This process is fundamental to cardiac function because calcium subsequently binds to troponin, initiating the conformational changes necessary for myofilament contraction. The cardiac dyad is characterized by a very small volume with steep ionic concentration gradients, which is challenging for detailed mathematical modeling. Traditionally, the dyadic calcium concentration has been approximated using spatially averaged values or modeled with reaction-diffusion equations. However, at the nanometer (nm) and nanosecond (ns) scales, such approximations may be insufficient. At this resolution, the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system provides a detailed continuous representation of the underlying electrodiffusion dynamics. Here, we present a nano-scale computational model, representing dyad dynamics using the PNP system. Potassium, sodium, and calcium channels are incorporated in the cell membrane, along with the sodium-calcium exchanger. We demonstrate the formation of the Debye layer in the resting state and highlight how both diffusive and electrical effects are required to maintain this equilibrium. Additionally, we show that cross-species ion interactions in the dyad are electrical, and that diffusion models fail to capture this effect. Finally, we illustrate how the dyad width and diffusion coefficient influence local ionic concentrations and the timing of calcium arrival at the ryanodine receptors. These results provide new insights into the electrodiffusive properties of the dyad and clarify when solving the full PNP system is necessary for accurate modeling.

Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) is a versatile tool to quantify cell-exerted forces by imaging and tracking fiduciary markers embedded in elastic substrates. The computations involved in TFM are often ill-conditioned, and data smoothing or regularization is required to avoid overfitting the noise in the tracked displacements. Most TFM calculations depend critically on the heuristic selection of regularization (hyper-) parameters affecting the balance between overfitting and smoothing. However, TFM methods rarely estimate or account for measurement errors in substrate deformation to adjust the regularization level accordingly. Moreover, there is a lack of tools for uncertainty quantification (UQ) to understand how these errors propagate to the recovered traction stresses. These limitations make it difficult to interpret the TFM readouts and hinder comparing different experiments. This manuscript presents an uncertainty-aware TFM technique that estimates the variability in the magnitude and direction of the traction stress vector recovered at each point in space and time of each experiment. In this technique, a non-parametric bootstrap method perturbs the cross-correlation functional of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) to assess the uncertainty of the measured deformation. This information is passed on to a hierarchical Bayesian TFM framework with spatially adaptive regularization that propagates the uncertainty to the traction stress readouts (TFM-UQ). We evaluate TFM-UQ using synthetic datasets with prescribed image quality variations and demonstrate its application to experimental datasets. These studies show that TFM-UQ bypasses the need for subjective regularization parameter selection and locally adapts smoothing, outperforming traditional regularization methods. They also illustrate how uncertainty-aware TFM tools can be used to objectively choose key image analysis parameters like PIV window size. We anticipate that these tools will allow for decoupling biological heterogeneity from measurement variability and facilitate automating the analysis of large datasets by parameter-free, input data-based regularization.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003198">A unified framework to model synaptic dynamics during the sleep–wake cycle</a></h4>

Understanding synaptic dynamics during the sleep–wake cycle in the cortex is crucial yet remains controversial. The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY) suggests synaptic depression during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, while other studies report synaptic potentiation or synaptic changes during NREM sleep depending on activities in wakefulness. To find boundary conditions between these contradictory observations, we focused on learning rules and firing patterns that contribute to the synaptic dynamics. Using computational models considering mammalian cortical neurons, we found that under Hebbian and spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), wake-like firing patterns decrease synaptic weights, while sleep-like patterns strengthen synaptic weights. We refer to this tendency as Wake Inhibition and Sleep Excitation (WISE). Conversely, under Anti-Hebbian and Anti-STDP, synaptic depression during NREM sleep was observed, aligning with the conventional synaptic homeostasis hypothesis. Moreover, synaptic changes depended on firing rate differences between NREM sleep and wakefulness. We provide a unified framework that could explain synaptic homeodynamics under the sleep–wake cycle.

Diffuse large B cell lymphomas and follicular lymphomas show recurrent mutations in epigenetic regulators; among these are loss-of-function mutations in KMT2D and gain-of-function mutations in EZH2. To systematically explore the effects of these mutations on the wiring of the epigenetic network, we applied a single-cell approach to probe a wide array of histone modifications. We show that mutant-EZH2 elicits extensive effects on the epigenome of lymphomas, beyond alterations to H3K27 methylations, and is epistatic over KMT2D mutations. Utilizing the single-cell data, we present computational methods to measure epigenetic heterogeneity. We identify an unexpected characteristic of mutant-EZH2, but not KMT2D, in increasing heterogeneity, shedding light on a novel oncogenic mechanism mediated by this mutation. Finally, we present tools to reconstruct known interactions within the epigenetic network, as well as reveal potential novel cross talk between various modifications, supported by functional perturbations. Our work highlights novel roles for mutant-EZH2 in lymphomagenesis and establishes new concepts for measuring epigenetic heterogeneity and intra-chromatin connectivity in cancer cells.

Bacteria produce a plethora of natural products that are in clinical, agricultural and biotechnological use. Genome mining has uncovered millions of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that encode their biosynthesis, the vast majority of them lacking a clear product or function. Thus, a major challenge is to predict the bioactivities of the molecules these BGCs specify, and how to elicit their expression. Here, we present an innovative strategy whereby we harness the power of regulatory networks combined with global gene expression patterns to predict BGC functions. Bioinformatic analysis of all genes predicted to be controlled by the iron master regulator DmdR1 combined with co-expression data, led to identification of the novel operon <i>desJGH</i> that plays a key role in the biosynthesis of the iron overload drug desferrioxamine (DFO) B in <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i>. Deletion of either <i>desG</i> or <i>desH</i> strongly reduces the biosynthesis of DFO B, while that of DFO E is enhanced. DesJGH most likely act by changing the balance between the DFO precursors. Our work shows the power of harnessing regulation-based genome mining to functionally prioritize BGCs, accelerating the discovery of novel bioactive molecules.

Defining the subset of cellular factors governing SARS-CoV-2 replication can provide critical insights into viral pathogenesis and identify targets for host-directed antiviral therapies. While a number of genetic screens have previously reported SARS-CoV-2 host dependency factors, most of these approaches relied on utilizing pooled genome-scale CRISPR libraries, which are biased toward the discovery of host proteins impacting early stages of viral replication. To identify host factors involved throughout the SARS-CoV-2 infectious cycle, we conducted an arrayed genome-scale siRNA screen. Resulting data were integrated with published functional screens and proteomics data to reveal (i) common pathways that were identified in all OMICs datasets—including regulation of Wnt signaling and gap junctions, (ii) pathways uniquely identified in this screen—including NADH oxidation, or (iii) pathways supported by this screen and proteomics data but not published functional screens—including arachionate production and MAPK signaling. The identified proviral host factors were mapped into the SARS-CoV-2 infectious cycle, including 32 proteins that were determined to impact viral replication and 27 impacting late stages of infection, respectively. Additionally, a subset of proteins was tested across other coronaviruses revealing a subset of proviral factors that were conserved across pandemic SARS-CoV-2, epidemic SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and the seasonal coronavirus OC43-CoV. Further studies illuminated a role for the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and found that inhibition of the non-canonical NF-kB pathway through targeting of BIRC2 restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication both in vitro and in vivo. These studies provide critical insight into the landscape of virus–host interactions driving SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as valuable targets for host-directed antivirals.

     alt="Neural Repertoire Behind the World's Most Complex Retina: Neuroanatomy of the Stomatopod Lamina"/>
<p>The lamina behind the complex retina of mantis shrimp is highly conserved between eye regions and species and is similar to crustaceans and distinct from insects. Midband cartridges connect along columns, providing a neural basis for the unique scanning behavior of stomatopods.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The lamina is the first optic neuropil and visual information integration station in crustaceans and insects, containing synaptic connections between photoreceptors and first-order interneurons. The lamina circuitry in mantis shrimp (stomatopods) is both interesting and complex, as there are 16 different types of photoreceptors contained within the mid-band region of the eye. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, we have reconstructed photoreceptor terminals and lamina interneurons in two major superfamilies with different visual ecologies. Neurons follow the same general pattern as other crustaceans but with notable differences in gross anatomy from insects. The photoreceptors form bulbous terminals in the lamina, following the same overall connectivity pattern in all lamina cartridges across species examined and eye regions. The photoreceptor terminals themselves appear to be complex, with many large mitochondria, a notable difference between insects and stomatopods. Connectivity between photoreceptors and interneurons, as well as cross-cartridge connections, is estimated based on neuronal overlap. Lamina monopolar cells follow previous research in stomatopods and crustaceans, with a set of common neuron types that may provide the beginning of an opponency circuit. Additionally, neurons that extend beyond their parent cartridge in the midband show a preference for branching between rows within the same visual column of cells, as well as some connections within the same row. This added complexity suggests that the stomatopod lamina performs a unique processing of visual signals versus other crustaceans and insects and provides further evidence for the emerging hypotheses around the processing of information by the scanning visual system of stomatopods.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to outline the dynamics of the mitochondrial network and cytoprotective response in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD)-derived olfactory mucosa neurons (ONs) at different disease stages.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>ONs obtained by nasal brush from 41 well-phenotyped patients with PD (n = 24 PD de novo [PD<sup>dn</sup>] and n = 17 under treatment [PD<sup>tr</sup>]) and 29 healthy controls were examined through real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunofluorescence, and Western blot. An integrative set of experiments using SH-SY5Y neuronal cells was also performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PD ONs accumulated α-synuclein oligomers in association with an aberrant subcellular distribution of mitochondrial markers COX IV and HSP60. DJ-1 ONs expression was permanently reduced in PD, revealing the mitochondrial dysfunction and justifying the defective Nrf2-mediated cytoprotective response. The Nrf2/SOD-1 pathway was indeed downregulated in PD ONs, although with stage-specific differences. In PD<sup>dn</sup> ONs, Nrf2 mostly presented in the inactive cytosolic localization with a major reduction of SOD-1 expression, whereas in PD<sup>tr</sup>, the Nrf2 active nuclear fraction increased, and the SOD-1 expression raised. In SH-SY5Y cells, we demonstrated that dopamine administration increases the Nrf2 nuclear fraction, acting as a possible pathway's inducer.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Human-derived ONs may recapitulate PD pathogenic milestones, exhibiting stage-specific interactions among α-synuclein oligomers, mitochondrial metabolism, and cytoprotective response. These findings highlighted mitochondrial dysfunction as a primary target for therapeutic interventions and a potential axis for the biological stratification of patients. Moreover, they supported the translational value of ONs, as a source of biomarkers or models, which is critical in the current changing paradigm of PD toward a biological-based approach.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Carotid artery web is an underrecognized cause of ischemic stroke and is associated with a high risk of recurrent events. It is uncertain whether medical management or carotid revascularization is beneficial for patients with ischemic stroke and ipsilateral carotid web. In the absence of large randomized clinical trials and observational studies, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing medical management and carotid revascularization in this population.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024485069). We searched five databases: Embase, Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL. We included observational studies that studied the association between recurrent stroke in patients with ipsilateral carotid web receiving medical management (antiplatelet and anticoagulation) and carotid revascularization. Random effects modeling was performed, and risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals were reported.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 17 studies (16 published and 1 institutional study). In the medical management group, 32% (90/281) of patients experienced recurrent ischemic stroke ipsilateral to the carotid web. The meta-analysis revealed a significantly lower risk of recurrent ischemic stroke with carotid revascularization (relative risk 0.11, 95% confidence interval 0.06–0.28, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, <i>I</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 14.5%). Both carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting were equally effective in reducing recurrent stroke risk (relative risk 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.11–1.76, <i>p</i> = 0.99).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Carotid revascularization is associated with reduced recurrence rates, with no difference between revascularization subtypes (carotid endarterectomy vs carotid artery stenting). However, given the small, heterogeneous cohorts and the uncertain natural history of carotid artery web under medical management, these findings should be interpreted with caution until prospective, controlled comparative effectiveness studies are performed.

                Lanzar et al. use a combination of half-life extension and IL-12 variants to explore the toxic effects of IL-12 treatment. These datasets highlight the cellular pool of innate and adaptive lymphocytes that respond to IL-12 and emphasize that a range of IL-12 agonists can be harnessed without overt immune pathology.

                Children with ASD exhibit gastrointestinal comorbidity symptoms and have a higher susceptibility to IBD. In this study, rodent models were used to demonstrate that maternal VitD reshapes the immune status of offspring by altering chromatin accessibility and metabolic patterns of CD4+ T cells, thereby enhancing the response to intestinal inflammation.

                Transplants release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that disseminate donor antigens in lymphoid tissues, eliciting T and B cell allosensitization. Chen and Powell et al. demonstrate that natural IgMs bind graft EVs, activating complement. B cells relay complement-opsonized EVs to follicular dendritic cells that present the graft EVs to anti-donor B cells.

                Various RNA viruses induce expression of small non-coding vtRNAs during infection. Stok et al. show that vtRNAs promote replication of two distinct viruses. Using mass spectrometry, they uncover the vtRNA interactome, which includes ELAVL1 and hnRNP C. VtRNAs facilitate nuclear export of these proviral factors, which enhances viral replication.

                Kooistra et al. demonstrate that airway stem cells are necessary to maintain functional IAMs. Specifically, basal cell-derived Notch signaling is required for MHC II expression by IAMs. Indeed, impaired crosstalk results in loss of antigen-induced inflammation. As such, human IAM-like cells may play a role in pathologic airway inflammation.
