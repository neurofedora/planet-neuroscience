              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid Analysis of Visual Receptive Fields by Iterative Tomography</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Many receptive fields in the early visual system show standard (center-surround) structure and can be analyzed using simple drifting patterns and a difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) model, which treats the receptive field as a linear filter of the visual image. But many other receptive fields show nonlinear properties such as selectivity for direction of movement. Such receptive fields are typically studied using discrete stimuli (moving or flashed bars and edges) and are modelled according to the features of the visual image to which they are most sensitive. Here, we harness recent advances in tomographic image analysis to characterize rapidly and simultaneously both the linear and nonlinear components of visual receptive fields. Spiking and intracellular voltage potential responses to briefly flashed bars are analyzed using non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) and iterative reconstruction tomography (IRT). The method yields high-resolution receptive field maps of individual neurons and neuron ensembles in primate (marmoset, both sexes) lateral geniculate and rodent (mouse, male) retina. We show that the first two IRT components correspond to DoG-equivalent center and surround of standard [magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P)] receptive fields in primate geniculate. The first two IRT components also reveal the spatiotemporal receptive field structure of nonstandard (on/off-rectifying) receptive fields. In rodent retina we combine NNMF-IRT with patch-clamp recording and dye injection to directly map spatial receptive fields to the underlying anatomy of retinal output neurons. We conclude that NNMF-IRT provides a rapid and flexible framework for study of receptive fields in the early visual system.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Untreated age-related hearing loss increases audiovisual integration and impacts resting state functional brain connectivity. Further, there is a relation between crossmodal plasticity and audiovisual integration strength in cochlear implant patients. However, it is currently unclear whether amplification of the auditory input by hearing aids influences audiovisual integration and resting state functional brain connectivity. We conducted a randomized controlled pilot study to investigate how the McGurk illusion, a common measure for audiovisual integration, and resting state functional brain connectivity of the auditory cortex are altered by six-month hearing aid use. Thirty-two older participants with slight-to-moderate, symmetric, age-related hearing loss were allocated to a treatment or waiting control group and measured one week before and six months after hearing aid fitting with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our results showed a statistical trend for an increased McGurk illusion after six months of hearing aid use. We further demonstrated that an increase in McGurk susceptibility is related to a decreased hearing aid benefit for auditory speech intelligibility in noise. No significant interaction between group and time point was obtained in the whole-brain resting state analysis. However, a region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI analysis indicated that hearing aid use of six months was associated with a decrease in resting state functional connectivity between the auditory cortex and the fusiform gyrus and that this decrease was related to an increase of perceived McGurk illusions. Our study, therefore, suggests that even short-term hearing aid use alters audiovisual integration and functional brain connectivity between auditory and visual cortices.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Amyloidogenic Processing of Amyloid Precursor Protein Drives Stretch-Induced Disruption of Axonal Transport in hiPSC-Derived Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in disrupted brain function following impact from an external force and is a risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although neurologic symptoms triggered by mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI), the most common form of TBI, typically resolve rapidly, even an isolated mTBI event can increase the risk to develop AD. Aberrant accumulation of amyloid &beta; peptide (A&beta;), a cleaved fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP), is a key pathologic outcome designating the progression of AD following mTBI and has also been linked to impaired axonal transport. However, relationships among mTBI, amyloidogenesis, and axonal transport remain unclear, in part because of the dearth of human models to study the neuronal response following mTBI. Here, we implemented a custom-microfabricated device to deform neurons derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells, derived from a cognitively unimpaired male individual, to mimic the mild stretch experienced by neurons during mTBI. Although no cell lethality or cytoskeletal disruptions were observed, mild stretch was sufficient to stimulate rapid amyloidogenic processing of APP. This processing led to abrupt cessation of APP axonal transport and progressive formation of aberrant axonal accumulations that contained APP, its processing machinery, and amyloidogenic fragments. Consistent with this sequence of events, stretch-induced defects were abrogated by reducing amyloidogenesis either pharmacologically or genetically. In sum, we have uncovered a novel and manipulable stretch-induced amyloidogenic pathway directly responsible for APP axonal transport dysregulation. Our findings may help to understand and ultimately mitigate the risk of developing AD following mTBI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mild traumatic brain injury is a risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increased amyloid &beta; peptide generation after injury may drive this risk. Here, by using a custom-built device to impose mild stretch to human neurons, we found that stretch triggers amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage, and thus amyloid &beta; peptide generation, consequently disrupting APP axonal transport. Compellingly, protecting APP from cleavage was sufficient to spare axonal transport dysregulation and the consequent aberrant axonal accumulation of APP. Supporting such protective mechanism, the expression of the AD-protective APP<sup>A673T</sup> genetic variant conferred protection against stretch-induced APP axonal transport phenotypes. Our data reveal potential subcellular pathways contributing to the development of AD-associated phenotypes following mild traumatic brain injury, and putative strategies for intervening in these pathways.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Proinflammatory Stimulus Disrupts Hippocampal Plasticity and Learning via Microglial Activation and 25-Hydroxycholesterol</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inflammatory cells, including macrophages and microglia, synthesize and release the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), which has antiviral and immunomodulatory properties. Here, we examined the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an activator of innate immunity, on 25HC production in microglia, and the effects of LPS and 25HC on CA1 hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning. In primary microglia, LPS markedly increases the expression of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h), the key enzyme involved in 25HC synthesis, and increases the levels of secreted 25HC. Wild-type microglia produced higher levels of 25HC than <I>Ch25h</I> knock-out (KO) microglia with or without LPS. LPS treatment also disrupts long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices via induction of a form of NMDA receptor-dependent metaplasticity. The inhibitory effects of LPS on LTP were mimicked by exogenous 25HC, and were not observed in slices from <I>Ch25h</I> KO mice. <I>In vivo</I>, LPS treatment also disrupts LTP and inhibits one-trial learning in wild-type mice, but not <I>Ch25h</I> KO mice. These results demonstrate that the oxysterol 25HC is a key modulator of synaptic plasticity and memory under proinflammatory stimuli.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuroinflammation is thought to contribute to cognitive impairment in multiple neuropsychiatric illnesses. In this study, we found that a proinflammatory stimulus, LPS, disrupts hippocampal LTP via a metaplastic mechanism. The effects of LPS on LTP are mimicked by the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), an immune mediator synthesized in brain microglia. Effects of LPS on both synaptic plasticity and one-trial inhibitory avoidance learning are eliminated in mice deficient in Ch25h (cholesterol 25-hydroxylase), the primary enzyme responsible for endogenous 25HC synthesis. Thus, these results indicate that 25HC is a key mediator of the effects of an inflammatory stimulus on hippocampal function and open new potential avenues to overcome the effects of neuroinflammation on brain function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Balanced Enhancements of Synaptic Excitation and Inhibition Underlie Developmental Maturation of Receptive Fields in the Mouse Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurons in the developing visual cortex undergo progressive functional maturation as indicated by the refinement of their visual feature selectivity. However, changes of the synaptic architecture underlying the maturation of spatial visual receptive fields (RFs) per se remain largely unclear. Here, loose-patch as well as single-unit recordings in layer 4 of mouse primary visual cortex (V1) of both sexes revealed that RF development following an eye-opening period is marked by an increased proportion of cortical neurons with spatially defined RFs, together with the increased signal-to-noise ratio of spiking responses. By exploring excitatory and inhibitory synaptic RFs with whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we observed a balanced enhancement of both synaptic excitation and inhibition, and while the excitatory subfield size remains relatively constant during development, the inhibitory subfield is broadened. This balanced developmental strengthening of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs results in enhanced visual responses, and with a reduction of spontaneous firing rate, contributes to the maturation of visual cortical RFs. Visual deprivation by dark rearing impedes the normal strengthening of excitatory inputs but leaves the apparently normal enhancement of inhibition while preventing the broadening of the inhibitory subfield, leading to weakened RF responses and a reduced fraction of neurons exhibiting a clear RF, compared with normally reared animals. Our data demonstrate that an experience-dependent and coordinated maturation of excitatory and inhibitory circuits underlie the functional development of visual cortical RFs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The organization of synaptic RFs is a fundamental determinant of feature selectivity functions in the cortex. However, how changes of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs lead to the functional maturation of visual RFs during cortical development remains not well understood. In layer 4 of mouse V1, we show that a coordinated, balanced enhancement of synaptic excitation and inhibition contributes to the developmental maturation of spatially defined visual RFs. Visual deprivation by dark rearing partially interferes with this process, resulting in a relatively more dominant inhibitory tone and a reduced fraction of neurons exhibiting clear RFs at the spike level. These data provide an unprecedented understanding of the functional development of visual cortical RFs at the synaptic level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Overexpressing Histone Deacetylase 5 in Rat Dorsal Striatum Alters Reward-Guided Decision-Making and Associated Neural Encoding</a></h4>

              
                <p>Accumulating evidence in the past decade implicates histone-modifying enzymes, such as class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), in learning and memory and, recently, habit formation. However, it is unclear whether HDACs play roles in complex cognitive function. To address this issue, we examined the role of dorsal striatal HDAC5, a class II HDAC, in reward-guided decision-making and associated neural encoding in rats. We first injected adeno-associated virus to overexpress a nuclear-localized HDAC5 in dorsal striatum (DS). We then recorded neural correlates from dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as rats performed two reward-guided choice tasks, in which we manipulated either the size of or delay to reward. During these tasks, rats first learned which of two options led to the better reward and then reversed those contingencies in a second block of trials. We found that rats with HDAC5 overexpression in DS responded faster and chose higher value reward more often during the first block of trials but were less able to reverse those contingencies in the second block of trials. At the neural level, HDAC5 overexpression in DS elevated and reduced the number of cells in DLS that increased firing to stimuli and reward, respectively, and shifted encoding toward cues that predicted more immediate reward. These results suggest that the HDAC5 overexpression in DS contributes to inflexible decision-making, demonstrating a role of histone-modifying enzymes in complex cognitive function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> HDACs are important for learning and habit formation. Here, we expanded on these functions and found that overexpression of HDAC5 produced faster and more automatic behavior, and related changes in dorsolateral striatal neural firing in rats performing a value-based decision-making task. These results implicate HDAC5 as a potential therapeutic target for psychiatric conditions that impair decision-making and executive function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Fastigial Output Channels and Their Impact on Temporal Lobe Seizures</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite being canonically considered a motor control structure, the cerebellum is increasingly recognized for important roles in processes beyond this traditional framework, including seizure suppression. Excitatory fastigial neurons project to a large number of downstream targets, and it is unclear whether this broad targeting underlies seizure suppression, or whether a specific output may be sufficient. To address this question, we used the intrahippocampal kainic acid mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy, male and female animals, and a dual-virus approach to selectively label and manipulate fastigial outputs. We examined fastigial neurons projecting to the superior colliculus, medullary reticular formation, and central lateral nucleus of the thalamus, and found that these comprise largely nonoverlapping populations of neurons that send collaterals to unique sets of additional, somewhat overlapping, thalamic and brainstem regions. We found that neither optogenetic stimulation of superior colliculus nor reticular formation output channels attenuated hippocampal seizures. In contrast, on-demand stimulation of fastigial neurons targeting the central lateral nucleus robustly inhibited seizures. Our results indicate that fastigial control of hippocampal seizures does not require simultaneous modulation of many fastigial output channels. Rather, selective modulation of the fastigial output channel to the central lateral thalamus, specifically, is sufficient for seizure control. More broadly, our data highlight the concept of specific cerebellar output channels, whereby discrete cerebellar nucleus neurons project to specific aggregates of downstream targets, with important consequences for therapeutic interventions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cerebellum has an emerging relationship with nonmotor systems and may represent a powerful target for therapeutic intervention in temporal lobe epilepsy. We find, as previously reported, that fastigial neurons project to numerous brain regions via largely segregated output channels, and that projection targets cannot be predicted simply by somatic locations within the nucleus. We further find that on-demand optogenetic excitation of fastigial neurons projecting to the central lateral nucleus of the thalamus&mdash;but not fastigial neurons projecting to the reticular formation, superior colliculus, or ventral lateral thalamus&mdash;is sufficient to attenuate hippocampal seizures.</p>

                <p>Multisensory plasticity enables our senses to dynamically adapt to each other and the external environment, a fundamental operation that our brain performs continuously. We searched for neural correlates of adult multisensory plasticity in the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd) and the ventral intraparietal area (VIP) in 2 male rhesus macaques using a paradigm of supervised calibration. We report little plasticity in neural responses in the relatively low-level multisensory cortical area MSTd. In contrast, neural correlates of plasticity are found in higher-level multisensory VIP, an area with strong decision-related activity. Accordingly, we observed systematic shifts of VIP tuning curves, which were reflected in the choice-related component of the population response. This is the first demonstration of neuronal calibration, together with behavioral calibration, in single sessions. These results lay the foundation for understanding multisensory neural plasticity, applicable broadly to maintaining accuracy for sensorimotor tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Timescales of Local and Cross-Area Interactions during Neuroprosthetic Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>How does the brain integrate signals with different timescales to drive purposeful actions? Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) offer a powerful tool to causally test how distributed neural networks achieve specific neural patterns. During neuroprosthetic learning, actuator movements are causally linked to primary motor cortex (M1) neurons, i.e., "direct" neurons that project to the decoder and whose firing is required to successfully perform the task. However, it is unknown how such direct M1 neurons interact with both "indirect" local (in M1 but not part of the decoder) and across area neural populations (e.g., in premotor cortex/M2), all of which are embedded in complex biological recurrent networks. Here, we trained male rats to perform a M1-BMI task and simultaneously recorded the activity of indirect neurons in both M2 and M1. We found that both M2 and M1 indirect neuron populations could be used to predict the activity of the direct neurons (i.e., "BMI-potent activity"). Interestingly, compared with M1 indirect activity, M2 neural activity was correlated with BMI-potent activity across a longer set of time lags, and the timescale of population activity patterns evolved more slowly. M2 units also predicted the activity of both M1 direct and indirect neural populations, suggesting that M2 population dynamics provide a continuous modulatory influence on M1 activity as a whole, rather than a moment-by-moment influence solely on neurons most relevant to a task. Together, our results indicate that longer timescale M2 activity provides modulatory influence over extended time lags on shorter-timescale control signals in M1.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A central question in the study of motor control is whether primary motor cortex (M1) and premotor cortex (M2) interact through task-specific subpopulations of neurons, or whether tasks engage broader correlated networks. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are powerful tools to study cross-area interactions. Here, we performed simultaneous recordings of M1 and M2 in a BMI task using a subpopulation of M1 neurons (direct neurons). We found that activity outside of direct neurons in M1 and M2 was predictive of M1-BMI task activity, and that M2 activity evolved at slower timescales than M1. These findings suggest that M2 provides a continuous modulatory influence on M1 as a whole, supporting a model of interactions through broad correlated networks rather than task-specific neural subpopulations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Predictive Feedback, Early Sensory Representations, and Fast Responses to Predicted Stimuli Depend on NMDA Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Learned associations between stimuli allow us to model the world and make predictions, crucial for efficient behavior (e.g., hearing a siren, we expect to see an ambulance and quickly make way). While there are theoretical and computational frameworks for prediction, the circuit and receptor-level mechanisms are unclear. Using high-density EEG, Bayesian modeling, and machine learning, we show that inferred "causal" relationships between stimuli and frontal alpha activity account for reaction times (a proxy for predictions) on a trial-by-trial basis in an audiovisual delayed match-to-sample task which elicited predictions. Predictive &beta; feedback activated sensory representations in advance of predicted stimuli. Low-dose ketamine, an NMDAR blocker, but not the control drug dexmedetomidine, perturbed behavioral indices of predictions, their representation in higher-order cortex, feedback to posterior cortex, and pre-activation of sensory templates in higher-order sensory cortex. This study suggests that predictions depend on alpha activity in higher-order cortex, &beta; feedback, and NMDARs, and ketamine blocks access to learned predictive information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We learn the statistical regularities around us, creating associations between sensory stimuli. These associations can be exploited by generating predictions, which enable fast and efficient behavior. When predictions are perturbed, it can negatively influence perception and even contribute to psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. Here we show that the frontal lobe generates predictions and sends them to posterior brain areas, to activate representations of predicted sensory stimuli before their appearance. Oscillations in neural activity (&alpha; and &beta; waves) are vital for these predictive mechanisms. The drug ketamine blocks predictions and the underlying mechanisms. This suggests that the generation of predictions in the frontal lobe, and the feedback pre-activating sensory representations in advance of stimuli, depend on NMDARs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Basal Forebrain Cholinergic Neurons Selectively Drive Coordinated Motor Learning in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Motor control requires precise temporal and spatial encoding across distinct motor centers that is refined through the repetition of learning. The recruitment of motor regions requires modulatory input to shape circuit activity. Here, we identify a role for the baso-cortical cholinergic pathway in the acquisition of a coordinated motor skill in mice. Targeted depletion of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons results in significant impairments in training on the rotarod task of coordinated movement. Cholinergic neuromodulation is required during training sessions as chemogenetic inactivation of cholinergic neurons also impairs task acquisition. Rotarod learning is known to drive refinement of corticostriatal neurons arising in both medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and motor cortex, and we have found that cholinergic input to both motor regions is required for task acquisition. Critically, the effects of cholinergic neuromodulation are restricted to the acquisition stage, as depletion of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons after learning does not affect task execution. Our results indicate a critical role for cholinergic neuromodulation of distant cortical motor centers during coordinated motor learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Acetylcholine release from basal forebrain cholinergic neuron terminals rapidly modulates neuronal excitability, circuit dynamics, and cortical coding; all processes required for processing complex sensory information, cognition, and attention. We found that depletion or transient silencing of cholinergic inputs to anatomically isolated motor areas, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and motor cortex, selectively led to significant impairments on coordinated motor learning; disrupting this baso-cortical network after acquisition elicited no effect on task execution. Our results indicate a pivotal role for cholinergic neuromodulation of distant cortical motor centers during coordinated motor learning. These findings support the concept that cognitive components (such as attention) are indispensable in the adjustment of motor output and training-induced improvements in motor performance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Interaural Place-of-Stimulation Mismatch Estimates Using CT Scans and Binaural Perception, But Not Pitch, Are Consistent in Cochlear-Implant Users</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bilateral cochlear implants (BI-CIs) or a CI for single-sided deafness (SSD-CI; one normally functioning acoustic ear) can partially restore spatial-hearing abilities, including sound localization and speech understanding in noise. For these populations, however, interaural place-of-stimulation mismatch can occur and thus diminish binaural sensitivity that relies on interaurally frequency-matched neurons. This study examined whether plasticity&mdash;reorganization of central neural pathways over time&mdash;can compensate for peripheral interaural place mismatch. We hypothesized differential plasticity across two systems: none for binaural processing but adaptation for pitch perception toward frequencies delivered by the specific electrodes. Interaural place mismatch was evaluated in 19 BI-CI and 23 SSD-CI human subjects (both sexes) using binaural processing (interaural-time-difference discrimination with simultaneous bilateral stimulation), pitch perception (pitch ranking for single electrodes or acoustic tones with sequential bilateral stimulation), and physical electrode-location estimates from computed-tomography (CT) scans. On average, CT scans revealed relatively little BI-CI interaural place mismatch (26&deg; insertion-angle mismatch) but a relatively large SSD-CI mismatch, particularly at low frequencies (166&deg; for an electrode tuned to 300 Hz, decreasing to 14&deg; at 7000 Hz). For BI-CI subjects, the three metrics were in agreement because there was little mismatch. For SSD-CI subjects, binaural and CT measurements were in agreement, suggesting little binaural-system plasticity induced by mismatch. The pitch measurements disagreed with binaural and CT measurements, suggesting place-pitch plasticity or a procedural bias. These results suggest that reducing interaural place mismatch and potentially improving binaural processing by reprogramming the CI frequency allocation would be better done using CT-scan than pitch information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Electrode-array placement for cochlear implants (bionic prostheses that partially restore hearing) does not explicitly align neural representations of frequency information. The resulting interaural place-of-stimulation mismatch can diminish spatial-hearing abilities. In this study, adults with two cochlear implants showed reasonable interaural alignment, whereas those with one cochlear implant but normal hearing in the other ear often showed mismatch. In cases of mismatch, binaural sensitivity was best when the same cochlear locations were stimulated in both ears, suggesting that binaural brainstem pathways do not experience plasticity to compensate for mismatch. In contrast, interaurally pitch-matched electrodes deviated from cochlear-location estimates and did not optimize binaural sensitivity. Clinical correction of interaural place mismatch using binaural or computed-tomography (but not pitch) information may improve spatial-hearing benefits.</p>

                <p>Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) exhibit compartmentalized organization, receiving synaptic inputs through their dendrites and transmitting visual information from the retina to the brain through the optic nerve. Little is known about the structure of RGC axon bundles extending from individual RGC somas to the optic nerve head (ONH) and how they respond to disease insults. We recently introduced visible-light optical coherence tomography fibergraphy (vis-OCTF), a technique for directly visualizing and analyzing mouse RGC axon bundles <I>in vivo</I>. In this study, we validated vis-OCTF's ability to quantify RGC axon bundles with an increased number of RGCs using mice deficient in BCL2-associated X protein (BAX<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>). Next, we performed optic nerve crush (ONC) injury on wild-type (WT) mice and showed that the changes in RGC axon bundle width and thickness were location-dependent. Our work demonstrates the potential of vis-OCTF to longitudinally quantify and track RGC damage at single axon bundle level in optic neuropathies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Nearly all clinical and preclinical studies measure the retinal nerve fiber (RNFL) thickness as the sole indicator of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) damage without investigating RGC axon bundles directly. We demonstrated visible-light optical coherence tomography fibergraphy (vis-OCTF) to directly quantify global and regional RGC axon bundle organizations <I>in vivo</I> as a new biomarker for RGC health. We validated <I>in vivo</I> vis-OCTF measures using both confocal microscopy of the immunostained flat-mounted retina and numerical simulations. Vis-OCTF for monitoring RGC axon bundle organization has the potential to bring new insight into RGC damage in optic neuropathies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hyperexcitability and Pharmacological Responsiveness of Cortical Neurons Derived from Human iPSCs Carrying Epilepsy-Associated Sodium Channel Nav1.2-L1342P Genetic Variant</a></h4>

              
                <p>With the wide adoption of genomic sequencing in children having seizures, an increasing number of <I>SCN2A</I> genetic variants have been revealed as genetic causes of epilepsy. Voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2, encoded by gene <I>SCN2A</I>, is predominantly expressed in the pyramidal excitatory neurons and supports action potential (AP) firing. One recurrent <I>SCN2A</I> genetic variant is L1342P, which was identified in multiple patients with epileptic encephalopathy and intractable seizures. However, the mechanism underlying L1342P-mediated seizures and the pharmacogenetics of this variant in human neurons remain unknown. To understand the core phenotypes of the L1342P variant in human neurons, we took advantage of a reference human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) line from a male donor, in which L1342P was introduced by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Using patch-clamping and microelectrode array (MEA) recordings, we revealed that cortical neurons derived from hiPSCs carrying heterozygous L1342P variant have significantly increased intrinsic excitability, higher sodium current density, and enhanced bursting and synchronous network firing, suggesting hyperexcitability phenotypes. Interestingly, L1342P neuronal culture displayed a degree of resistance to the anticonvulsant medication phenytoin, which recapitulated aspects of clinical observation of patients carrying the L1342P variant. In contrast, phrixotoxin-3 (PTx3), a Nav1.2 isoform-specific blocker, can potently alleviate spontaneous and chemically-induced hyperexcitability of neurons carrying the L1342P variant. Our results reveal a possible pathogenic underpinning of Nav1.2-L1342P mediated epileptic seizures and demonstrate the utility of genome-edited hiPSCs as an <I>in vitro</I> platform to advance personalized phenotyping and drug discovery.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A mounting number of <I>SCN2A</I> genetic variants have been identified from patients with epilepsy, but how <I>SCN2A</I> variants affect the function of human neurons contributing to seizures is still elusive. This study investigated the functional consequences of a recurring <I>SCN2A</I> variant (L1342P) using human iPSC-derived neurons and revealed both intrinsic and network hyperexcitability of neurons carrying a mutant Nav1.2 channel. Importantly, this study recapitulated elements of clinical observations of drug-resistant features of the L1342P variant, and provided a platform for <I>in vitro</I> drug testing. Our study sheds light on cellular mechanism of seizures resulting from a recurring Nav1.2 variant, and helps to advance personalized drug discovery to treat patients carrying pathogenic <I>SCN2A</I> variant.</p>

                Averrhoa bilimbi is a fast-growing tree widely found in countries of tropical Asia. Due to easy accessibility and traditional knowledge, various parts of this plant are adopted as folk medicine and a natural health remedy. Recently, beneficial effects of bilimbi in combating obesity including its potential antihyperlipidemic and hypoglycemic activities have been discovered. This paper reports the successive isolation and purification of bioactive compounds from the leaf of bilimbi that corresponds to brown adipocyte activation. Bilimbi ethanolic extract underwent bioassay-guided partitioning and fractionation. The n-hexane partition exhibited highest brown adipogenesis potential via adipomyocytes differentiation. Further isolation of this active partition yielded 10 fractions. Active fractions with the highest brown adipogenesis potential were further evaluated via the adipomyocytes assay. Chemical structures of the constituents were elucidated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Major phytocomponents in the n-hexane partition include hexadecanoic acid, phytol, 9-Octadecenoic acid (Z)- and squalene.

                <p>by Guoyang Zou, Yang Zou, Chenglong Ma, Jiaojiao Zhao, Lei Li</p>

Many computational classifiers have been developed to predict different types of post-translational modification sites. Their performances are measured using cross-validation or independent test, in which experimental data from different sources are mixed and randomly split into training and test sets. However, the self-reported performances of most classifiers based on this measure are generally higher than their performances in the application of new experimental data. It suggests that the cross-validation method overestimates the generalization ability of a classifier. Here, we proposed a generalization estimate method, dubbed experiment-split test, where the experimental sources for the training set are different from those for the test set that simulate the data derived from a new experiment. We took the prediction of lysine methylome (Kme) as an example and developed a deep learning-based Kme site predictor (called DeepKme) with outstanding performance. We assessed the experiment-split test by comparing it with the cross-validation method. We found that the performance measured using the experiment-split test is lower than that measured in terms of cross-validation. As the test data of the experiment-split method were derived from an independent experimental source, this method could reflect the generalization of the predictor. Therefore, we believe that the experiment-split method can be applied to benchmark the practical performance of a given PTM model. DeepKme is free accessible via https://github.com/guoyangzou/DeepKme.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multifunctional RNA-binding proteins influence mRNA abundance and translational efficiency of distinct sets of target genes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Valentin Schneider-Lunitz, Jorge Ruiz-Orera, Norbert Hubner, Sebastiaan van Heesch</p>

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can regulate more than a single aspect of RNA metabolism. We searched for such previously undiscovered multifunctionality within a set of 143 RBPs, by defining the predictive value of RBP abundance for the transcription and translation levels of known RBP target genes across 80 human hearts. This led us to newly associate 27 RBPs with cardiac translational regulation <i>in vivo</i>. Of these, 21 impacted both RNA expression and translation, albeit for virtually independent sets of target genes. We highlight a subset of these, including G3BP1, PUM1, UCHL5, and DDX3X, where dual regulation is achieved through differential affinity for target length, by which separate biological processes are controlled. Like the RNA helicase DDX3X, the known splicing factors EFTUD2 and PRPF8—all identified as multifunctional RBPs by our analysis—selectively influence target translation rates depending on 5’ UTR structure. Our analyses identify dozens of RBPs as being multifunctional and pinpoint potential novel regulators of translation, postulating unanticipated complexity of protein-RNA interactions at consecutive stages of gene expression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">DeepCME: A deep learning framework for computing solution statistics of the chemical master equation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ankit Gupta, Christoph Schwab, Mustafa Khammash</p>

Stochastic models of biomolecular reaction networks are commonly employed in systems and synthetic biology to study the effects of stochastic fluctuations emanating from reactions involving species with low copy-numbers. For such models, the Kolmogorov’s forward equation is called the chemical master equation (CME), and it is a fundamental system of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describes the evolution of the probability distribution of the random state-vector representing the copy-numbers of all the reacting species. The size of this system is given by the number of states that are accessible by the chemical system, and for most examples of interest this number is either very large or infinite. Moreover, approximations that reduce the size of the system by retaining only a finite number of important chemical states (e.g. those with non-negligible probability) result in high-dimensional ODE systems, even when the number of reacting species is small. Consequently, accurate numerical solution of the CME is very challenging, despite the linear nature of the underlying ODEs. One often resorts to estimating the solutions via computationally intensive stochastic simulations. The goal of the present paper is to develop a novel deep-learning approach for computing solution statistics of high-dimensional CMEs by reformulating the stochastic dynamics using Kolmogorov’s backward equation. The proposed method leverages superior approximation properties of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to reliably estimate expectations under the CME solution for several user-defined functions of the state-vector. This method is algorithmically based on reinforcement learning and it only requires a moderate number of stochastic simulations (in comparison to typical simulation-based approaches) to train the “policy function”. This allows not just the numerical approximation of various expectations for the CME solution but also of its sensitivities with respect to all the reaction network parameters (e.g. rate constants). We provide four examples to illustrate our methodology and provide several directions for future research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Benchmarking of tools for axon length measurement in individually-labeled projection neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mario Rubio-Teves, Sergio Díez-Hermano, César Porrero, Abel Sánchez-Jiménez, Lucía Prensa, Francisco Clascá, María García-Amado, José Antonio Villacorta-Atienza</p>

Projection neurons are the commonest neuronal type in the mammalian forebrain and their individual characterization is a crucial step to understand how neural circuitry operates. These cells have an axon whose arborizations extend over long distances, branching in complex patterns and/or in multiple brain regions. Axon length is a principal estimate of the functional impact of the neuron, as it directly correlates with the number of synapses formed by the axon in its target regions; however, its measurement by direct 3D axonal tracing is a slow and labor-intensive method. On the contrary, axon length estimations have been recently proposed as an effective and accessible alternative, allowing a fast approach to the functional significance of the single neuron. Here, we analyze the accuracy and efficiency of the most used length estimation tools—design-based stereology by virtual planes or spheres, and mathematical correction of the 2D projected-axon length—in contrast with direct measurement, to quantify individual axon length. To this end, we computationally simulated each tool, applied them over a dataset of 951 3D-reconstructed axons (from NeuroMorpho.org), and compared the generated length values with their 3D reconstruction counterparts. The evaluated reliability of each axon length estimation method was then balanced with the required human effort, experience and know-how, and economic affordability. Subsequently, computational results were contrasted with measurements performed on actual brain tissue sections. We show that the plane-based stereological method balances acceptable errors (~5%) with robustness to biases, whereas the projection-based method, despite its accuracy, is prone to inherent biases when implemented in the laboratory. This work, therefore, aims to provide a constructive benchmark to help guide the selection of the most efficient method for measuring specific axonal morphologies according to the particular circumstances of the conducted research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Tinnitus-like “hallucinations” elicited by sensory deprivation in an entropy maximization recurrent neural network</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aviv Dotan, Oren Shriki</p>

Sensory deprivation has long been known to cause hallucinations or “phantom” sensations, the most common of which is tinnitus induced by hearing loss, affecting 10–20% of the population. An observable hearing loss, causing auditory sensory deprivation over a band of frequencies, is present in over 90% of people with tinnitus. Existing plasticity-based computational models for tinnitus are usually driven by homeostatic mechanisms, modeled to fit phenomenological findings. Here, we use an objective-driven learning algorithm to model an early auditory processing neuronal network, e.g., in the dorsal cochlear nucleus. The learning algorithm maximizes the network’s output entropy by learning the feed-forward and recurrent interactions in the model. We show that the connectivity patterns and responses learned by the model display several hallmarks of early auditory neuronal networks. We further demonstrate that attenuation of peripheral inputs drives the recurrent network towards its critical point and transition into a tinnitus-like state. In this state, the network activity resembles responses to genuine inputs even in the absence of external stimulation, namely, it “hallucinates” auditory responses. These findings demonstrate how objective-driven plasticity mechanisms that normally act to optimize the network’s input representation can also elicit pathologies such as tinnitus as a result of sensory deprivation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The 3-phosphoinositide–dependent protein kinase 1 is an essential upstream activator of protein kinase A in malaria parasites</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eva Hitz, Natalie Wiedemar, Armin Passecker, Beatriz A. S. Graça, Christian Scheurer, Sergio Wittlin, Nicolas M. B. Brancucci, Ioannis Vakonakis, Pascal Mäser, Till S. Voss</p>

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signalling is essential for the proliferation of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria blood stage parasites. The mechanisms regulating the activity of the catalytic subunit PfPKAc, however, are only partially understood, and PfPKAc function has not been investigated in gametocytes, the sexual blood stage forms that are essential for malaria transmission. By studying a conditional PfPKAc knockdown (cKD) mutant, we confirm the essential role for PfPKAc in erythrocyte invasion by merozoites and show that PfPKAc is involved in regulating gametocyte deformability. We furthermore demonstrate that overexpression of PfPKAc is lethal and kills parasites at the early phase of schizogony. Strikingly, whole genome sequencing (WGS) of parasite mutants selected to tolerate increased PfPKAc expression levels identified missense mutations exclusively in the gene encoding the parasite orthologue of 3-phosphoinositide–dependent protein kinase-1 (PfPDK1). Using targeted mutagenesis, we demonstrate that PfPDK1 is required to activate PfPKAc and that T189 in the PfPKAc activation loop is the crucial target residue in this process. In summary, our results corroborate the importance of tight regulation of PfPKA signalling for parasite survival and imply that PfPDK1 acts as a crucial upstream regulator in this pathway and potential new drug target.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A structurally conserved site in AUP1 binds the E2 enzyme UBE2G2 and is essential for ER-associated degradation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher E. Smith, Yien Che Tsai, Yu-He Liang, Domarin Khago, Jennifer Mariano, Jess Li, Sergey G. Tarasov, Emma Gergel, Borong Tsai, Matthew Villaneuva, Michelle E. Clapp, Valentin Magidson, Raj Chari, R. Andrew Byrd, Xinhua Ji, Allan M. Weissman</p>

Endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation (ERAD) is a protein quality control pathway of fundamental importance to cellular homeostasis. Although multiple ERAD pathways exist for targeting topologically distinct substrates, all pathways require substrate ubiquitination. Here, we characterize a key role for the UBE2G2 Binding Region (G2BR) of the ERAD accessory protein ancient ubiquitous protein 1 (AUP1) in ERAD pathways. This 27-amino acid (aa) region of AUP1 binds with high specificity and low nanomolar affinity to the backside of the ERAD ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) UBE2G2. The structure of the AUP1 G2BR (G2BR<sup>AUP1</sup>) in complex with UBE2G2 reveals an interface that includes a network of salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions essential for AUP1 function in cells. The G2BR<sup>AUP1</sup> shares significant structural conservation with the G2BR found in the E3 ubiquitin ligase gp78 and in vitro can similarly allosterically activate ubiquitination in conjunction with ERAD E3s. In cells, AUP1 is uniquely required to maintain normal levels of UBE2G2; this is due to G2BR<sup>AUP1</sup> binding to the E2 and preventing its rapid degradation. In addition, the G2BR<sup>AUP1</sup> is required for both ER membrane recruitment of UBE2G2 and for its activation at the ER membrane. Thus, by binding to the backside of a critical ERAD E2, G2BR<sup>AUP1</sup> plays multiple critical roles in ERAD.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of anisometropia in children and adolescents [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This research was developed to study the epidemiology of anisometropia. It aims to estimate the prevalence of anisometropia in Portuguese children and adolescents at various educational stages, studying its association with sociodemographic variables. Methods: Observational cross sectional study envolving 749 children and adolescents (from 3 to 16 years old) from the central region of Portugal. The refraction was performed with a paediatric, open field auto refractometer (PlusOptix), without cycloplegia and under binocular conditions, to determine the rate of anisometropia and its association with gender, study cycle and area of residence. Results: The prevalence of anisometropia in the studied sample was 6.1%, varying from 2.9% in pre-school education to 9.4% in the 3rd study cycle. Myopic anisometropia was the most frequent and hyperopic and astigmatic anisometropia showed identical proportions of occurrence. No statistical differences were found between genders or between areas of residence regarding the rate of anisometropia. Regarding spherical equivalent anisometropia, there was a pattern of variation that increased with the cycle of studies (��2(3)= 10.918; p = 0.012), with myopic anisometropia being the main contributor to this variation. Conclusions: An increase in anisometropia with the educational stage, was found in this study. The high rate of anisometropia found in adolescents (9.4%) as well as the progressive increase in this rate throughout school progress (from 2.9% to 9.4%) suggests the need to extend the detection strategies of this condition beyond childhood.

                Background: Prehabilitation is a therapeutic strategy involving preoperative physical exercises, nutritional support, and stress and anxiety reduction. This approach has been gaining popularity and has been seeing effective results in adults in terms of improving pre and postoperative outcomes. The purpose of this review was to summarise the evidence about the effects of exercise-based prehabilitation programs on various outcome measures in children post elective surgeries.­­ Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PEDro, CINAHL/EBSCO and EMBASE electronic databases were searched from inception to June 2021. Based on the inclusion criteria, titles and abstracts were independently screened by the authors. After that, a data extraction table of the selected studies which included the participants, type, and details of exercise intervention, outcome measures and results were analysed after which the quality assessment of the studies was done. Results: The search yielded 2219 articles of which three articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria with two studies being randomized controlled trials and one being a quasi-experimental pre-post type of study. One randomized controlled trial was on the effects of exercise-based prehabilitation in reducing pulmonary complications post cardiac surgeries in children and the other two studies were on the effects of prehabilitation on functional capacity & pulmonary function. All the three articles found that exercise-based prehabilitation had a positive effect on children’s post-surgery. Conclusion: Although there is a paucity of evidence-based literature, we conclude based on the existing literature retrieved by our review that exercise-based prehabilitation improves postoperative outcomes and helps in reducing postoperative complications in children undergoing various surgeries.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">MSTCN: A multiscale temporal convolutional network for user independent human activity recognition [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In recent years, human activity recognition (HAR) has been an active research topic due to its widespread application in various fields such as healthcare, sports, patient monitoring, etc. HAR approaches can be categorised as handcrafted feature methods (HCF) and deep learning methods (DL). HCF involves complex data pre-processing and manual feature extraction in which the models may be exposed to high bias and crucial implicit pattern loss. Hence, DL approaches are introduced due to their exceptional recognition performance. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) extracts spatial features while preserving localisation. However, it hardly captures temporal features. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) learns temporal features, but it is susceptible to gradient vanishing and suffers from short-term memory problems. Unlike RNN, Long-Short Term Memory network has a relatively longer-term dependency. However, it consumes higher computation and memory because it computes and stores partial results at each level. Methods: This work proposes a novel multiscale temporal convolutional network (MSTCN) based on the Inception model with a temporal convolutional architecture. Unlike HCF methods, MSTCN requires minimal pre-processing and no manual feature engineering. Further, multiple separable convolutions with different-sized kernels are used in MSTCN for multiscale feature extraction. Dilations are applied to each separable convolution to enlarge the receptive fields without increasing the model parameters. Moreover, residual connections are utilised to prevent information loss and gradient vanishing. These features enable MSTCN to possess a longer effective history while maintaining a relatively low in-network computation. Results: The performance of MSTCN is evaluated on UCI and WISDM datasets using subject independent protocol with no overlapping subjects between the training and testing sets. MSTCN achieves F1 scores of 0.9752 on UCI and 0.9470 on WISDM. Conclusion: The proposed MSTCN dominates the other state-of-the-art methods by acquiring high recognition accuracies without requiring any manual feature engineering.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hobotnica: exploring molecular signature quality [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                A Molecular Features Set (MFS), is a result of a vast diversity of bioinformatics pipelines. The lack of a “gold standard” for most experimental data modalities makes it difficult to provide valid estimation for a particular MFS's quality. Yet, this goal can partially be achieved by analyzing inner-sample Distance Matrices (DM) and their power to distinguish between phenotypes. The quality of a DM can be assessed by summarizing its power to quantify the differences of inner-phenotype and outer-phenotype distances. This estimation of the DM quality can be construed as a measure of the MFS's quality.  Here we propose Hobotnica, an approach to estimate MFSs quality by their ability to stratify data, and assign them significance scores, that allow for collating various signatures and comparing their quality for contrasting groups.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">AXIN-AMPK signaling: Implications for healthy aging [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The energy sensor AMP kinase (AMPK) and the master scaffolding protein, AXIN, are two major regulators of biological processes in metazoans. AXIN-dependent regulation of AMPK activation plays a crucial role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis during glucose-deprived and energy-stressed conditions. The two proteins are also required for muscle function. While studies have refined our knowledge of various cellular events that promote the formation of AXIN-AMPK complexes and the involvement of effector proteins, more work is needed to understand precisely how the pathway is regulated in response to various forms of stress. In this review, we discuss recent data on AXIN and AMPK interaction and its role in physiological changes leading to improved muscle health and an extension of lifespan. We argue that AXIN-AMPK signaling plays an essential role in maintaining muscle function and manipulating the pathway in a tissue-specific manner could delay muscle aging. Therefore, research on understanding the factors that regulate AXIN-AMPK signaling holds the potential for developing novel therapeutics to slow down or revert the age-associated decline in muscle function, thereby extending the healthspan of animals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Interplay among positive and negative symptoms, neurocognition, social cognition, and functional outcome in clinically stable patients with schizophrenia: a network analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Schizophrenia has a broad range of interrelated symptoms and impairment in functioning. The objective of the study was to explore the interplay between positive symptoms, negative symptoms, neurocognition, social cognition and functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia using network analysis. Methods: Participants were 64 clinically stable patients with schizophrenia. Psychopathologic, neurocognition, social cognition, and functional outcome were measured using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination III, Faces test, Reading the Mind in the Eyes test, and Personal Social Performance scale. Results: The network analysis suggested that functional outcome was the most central in the network followed by avolition and asociality. Functioning was directly connected to avolition, asociality, blunted affect, neurocognition and emotion recognition. The positive symptoms were the most remote and therefore the least important node. Conclusion: The high centrality of functioning suggests the need for improving of everyday life skills for patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, treatment of specific negative symptoms, neurocognition and emotion recognition could also enhance functional outcome.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factor Xa inhibitor for venous thromboembolism management in patient with cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: An earlier systematic review reported no differences in the incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding between factor Xa inhibitors and standard anticoagulation. The present meta-analysis aimed to assess the effectiveness of factor Xa inhibitors for the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE), specifically in patients with cancer, as there were more randomized clinical trials (RCTs) available. Methods: The PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were systematically screened for all RCTs assessing factor Xa inhibitor efficacy for VTE management in cancer patients. Using RevMan 5.3, we performed a Mantel–Haenszel fixed-effects meta-analysis of the following outcomes: recurrent VTE, VTE events, and major bleeding rates. Results: We identified 11 studies involving 7,965 patients. Factor Xa inhibitors were superior in preventing VTE recurrence, compared to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.45–0.80; P < 0.01) and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) (OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.33–0.78; P < 0.01). As prophylaxis, factor Xa inhibitors had a similar rate of VTE compared to VKAs (OR 1.08 [95% CI 0.31–3.77]; P = 0.90) and a lower rate compared to placebo (OR 0.54 [95% CI 0.35–0.81]; P < 0.01). Major bleeding rates were higher with factor Xa inhibitors than with LMWHs (OR 1.34 [95% CI 0.83–2.18]; P = 0.23), but significantly lower than VKAs (OR 0.71 [95% CI 0.55–0.92]; P < 0.01). Conclusions: Factor Xa inhibitors are effective for VTE management in patients with cancer; however, they are also associated with an increased bleeding risk compared to LMWH, but decreased when compared to VKA.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Spinal cord atrophy predicts progressive disease in relapsing multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A major challenge in multiple sclerosis (MS) research is the understanding of silent progression and Progressive MS. Using a novel method to accurately capture upper cervical cord area from legacy brain MRI scans we aimed to study the role of spinal cord and brain atrophy for silent progression and conversion to secondary progressive disease (SPMS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From a single-center observational study, all RRMS (n=360) and SPMS (n=47) patients and 80 matched controls were evaluated. RRMS patient subsets who converted to SPMS (n=54) or silently progressed (n=159), respectively, during the 12-year observation period were compared to clinically matched RRMS patients remaining RRMS (n=54) or stable (n=147), respectively. From brain MRI, we assessed the value of brain and spinal cord measures to predict silent progression and SPMS conversion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients who developed SPMS showed faster cord atrophy rates (-2.19 %/year) at least four years before conversion compared to their RRMS matches (-0.88 %/year, p&lt;0.001). Spinal cord atrophy rates decelerated after conversion (-1.63%/year, <i>p</i>=0.010) towards those of SPMS patients from study entry (-1.04%). Each 1% faster spinal cord atrophy rate was associated with 69% (<i>p</i>&lt;0.0001) and 53% (<i>p</i>&lt;0.0001) shorter time to silent progression and SPMS conversion, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Silent progression and conversion to secondary progressive disease are predominantly related to cervical cord atrophy. This atrophy is often present from the earliest disease stages and predicts the speed of silent progression and conversion to Progressive MS. Diagnosis of SPMS is rather a late recognition of this neurodegenerative process than a distinct disease phase.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">DBS of thalamic centromedian nucleus for Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (ESTEL trial)</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Prior uncontrolled studies have reported seizure reductions following Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in patients with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS), but evidence from randomized controlled studies is lacking. We aimed to formally assess the efficacy and safety of DBS to the centromedian thalamic nucleus (CM) for treatment of LGS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Prospective, double-blind, randomized study of continuous, cycling stimulation of CM-DBS, in patients with LGS. Following pre- and post-implantation periods, half received three-months stimulation (blinded phase), then all received three-months stimulation (unblinded phase). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with ≥50% reduction in diary-recorded seizures in stimulated versus control participants, measured at the end of the blinded phase. A secondary outcome was the proportion of participants with a ≥ 50% reduction in electrographic seizures on 24-hour ambulatory EEG at the end of blinded phase.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between November 2017–December 2019, 20 young adults with LGS (17–37 years;13 females) underwent bilateral CM-DBS at a single centre in Australia, with 19 randomized (treatment, n = 10; control, n = 9). 50% of the stimulation group achieved ≥50% seizure reduction, compared with 22% of controls (OR3.1; 95%CI 0.44–21.45; p = 0.25). For electrographic seizures, 59% of the stimulation group had ≥50% reduction at the end of the blinded phase, compared with none of the controls (OR23.25; 95%CI 1.0–538.4; p = 0.05). Across all patients, median seizure reduction (baseline vs study exit) was 46.7% (IQR 28–67%) for diary-recorded seizures and 53.8% (IQR 27–73%) for electrographic seizures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CM-DBS in patients with LGS reduced electrographic rather than diary-recorded seizures, after three-months of stimulation. 50% of all participants had diary-recorded seizures reduced by half at study exit, providing supporting evidence of treatment effect.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Identification of a stereotypic molecular arrangement of endogenous glycine receptors at spinal cord synapses</a></h4>

              
                Precise quantitative information about the molecular architecture of synapses is essential to understanding the functional specificity and downstream signaling processes at specific populations of synapses. Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are the primary fast inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the spinal cord and brainstem. These inhibitory glycinergic networks crucially regulate motor and sensory processes. Thus far the nanoscale organization of GlyRs underlying the different network specificities has not been defined. Here, we have quantitatively characterized the molecular arrangement and ultra-structure of glycinergic synapses in spinal cord tissue using quantitative super-resolution correlative light and electron microscopy (SR-CLEM). We show that endogenous GlyRs exhibit equal receptor-scaffold occupancy and constant packing densities of about 2000 GlyRs µm<sup>-2</sup> at synapses across the spinal cord and throughout adulthood, even though ventral horn synapses have twice the total copy numbers, larger postsynaptic domains and more convoluted morphologies than dorsal horn synapses. We demonstrate that this stereotypic molecular arrangement is maintained at glycinergic synapses in the <i>oscillator</i> mouse model of the neuromotor disease hyperekplexia despite a decrease in synapse size, indicating that the molecular organization of GlyRs is preserved in this hypomorph. We thus conclude that the morphology and size of inhibitory postsynaptic specializations rather than differences in GlyR packing determine the postsynaptic strength of glycinergic neurotransmission in motor and sensory spinal cord networks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Assessing target engagement using proteome-wide solvent shift assays</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS) have enabled quantitative proteomics to become a powerful tool in the field of drug discovery, especially when applied toward proteome-wide target engagement studies. Similar to temperature gradients, increasing concentrations of organic solvents stimulate unfolding and precipitation of the cellular proteome. This property can be influenced by physical association with ligands and other molecules, making individual proteins more or less susceptible to solvent-induced denaturation. Herein, we report the development of proteome-wide solvent shift assays by combining the principles of solvent-induced precipitation (Zhang et al., 2020) with modern quantitative proteomics. Using this approach, we developed solvent proteome profiling (SPP), which is capable of establishing target engagement through analysis of SPP denaturation curves. We readily identified the specific targets of compounds with known mechanisms of action. As a further efficiency boost, we applied the concept of area under the curve analysis to develop solvent proteome integral solubility alteration (solvent-PISA) and demonstrate that this approach can serve as a reliable surrogate for SPP. We propose that by combining SPP with alternative methods, like thermal proteome profiling, it will be possible to increase the absolute number of high-quality melting curves that are attainable by either approach individually, thereby increasing the fraction of the proteome that can be screened for evidence of ligand binding.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Blood-brain barrier-restricted translocation of Toxoplasma gondii from cortical capillaries</a></h4>

              
                The cellular barriers of the central nervous system proficiently protect the brain parenchyma from infectious insults. Yet, the single-celled parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> commonly causes latent cerebral infection in humans and other vertebrates. Here, we addressed the role of the cerebral vasculature in the passage of <i>T. gondii</i> to the brain parenchyma. Shortly after inoculation in mice, parasites mainly localized to cortical capillaries, in preference over post-capillary venules, cortical arterioles or meningeal and choroidal vessels. Early invasion to the parenchyma (days 1-5) occurred in absence of a measurable increase in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, perivascular leukocyte cuffs or hemorrhage. However, sparse focalized permeability elevations were detected adjacently to replicative parasite foci. Further, <i>T. gondii</i> triggered inflammatory responses in cortical microvessels and endothelium. Pro- and anti-inflammatory treatments of mice with LPS and hydrocortisone, respectively, impacted BBB permeability and parasite loads in the brain parenchyma. Finally, pharmacological inhibition or Cre/<i>lox</i>P conditional knockout of endothelial focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a BBB intercellular junction regulator, facilitated parasite translocation to the brain parenchyma. The data reveal that the initial passage of <i>T. gondii</i> to the central nervous system occurs principally across cortical capillaries. The integrity of the microvascular BBB restricts parasite transit, which conversely is exacerbated by the inflammatory response.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tightly coupled inhibitory and excitatory functional networks in the developing primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Intracortical inhibition plays a critical role in shaping activity patterns in the mature cortex. However, little is known about the structure of inhibition in early development prior to the onset of sensory experience, a time when spontaneous activity exhibits long-range correlations predictive of mature functional networks. Here, using calcium imaging of GABAergic neurons in the ferret visual cortex, we show that spontaneous activity in inhibitory neurons is already highly organized into distributed modular networks before visual experience. Inhibitory neurons exhibit spatially modular activity with long-range correlations and precise local organization that is in quantitative agreement with excitatory networks. Furthermore, excitatory and inhibitory networks are strongly co-aligned at both millimeter and cellular scales. These results demonstrate a remarkable degree of organization in inhibitory networks early in the developing cortex, providing support for computational models of self-organizing networks and suggesting a mechanism for the emergence of distributed functional networks during development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nuclear NAD+-biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT1 facilitates development and early survival of retinal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Despite mounting evidence that the mammalian retina is exceptionally reliant on proper NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis for health and function, the specific roles of subcellular NAD<sup>+</sup> pools in retinal development, maintenance, and disease remain obscure. Here, we show that deletion of the nuclear-localized NAD<sup>+</sup> synthase nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase-1 (NMNAT1) in the developing murine retina causes early and severe degeneration of photoreceptors and select inner retinal neurons via multiple distinct cell death pathways. This severe phenotype is associated with disruptions to retinal central carbon metabolism, purine nucleotide synthesis, and amino acid pathways. Furthermore, transcriptomic and immunostaining approaches reveal dysregulation of a collection of photoreceptor and synapse-specific genes in NMNAT1 knockout retinas prior to detectable morphological or metabolic alterations. Collectively, our study reveals previously unrecognized complexity in NMNAT1-associated retinal degeneration and suggests a yet-undescribed role for NMNAT1 in gene regulation during photoreceptor terminal differentiation.

                As one of the main influenza antigens, neuraminidase (NA) in H3N2 virus has evolved extensively for more than 50 years due to continuous immune pressure. While NA has recently emerged as an effective vaccine target, biophysical constraints on the antigenic evolution of NA remain largely elusive. Here, we apply combinatorial mutagenesis and next-generation sequencing to characterize the local fitness landscape in an antigenic region of NA in six different human H3N2 strains that were isolated around 10 years apart. The local fitness landscape correlates well among strains and the pairwise epistasis is highly conserved. Our analysis further demonstrates that local net charge governs the pairwise epistasis in this antigenic region. In addition, we show that residue coevolution in this antigenic region is correlated with the pairwise epistasis between charge states. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of quantifying epistasis and the underlying biophysical constraint for building a model of influenza evolution.

                Hemispheric specializations are well studied at the functional level but less is known about the underlying neural mechanisms. We identified a small cluster of cholinergic neurons in the dorsal habenula (dHb) of zebrafish, defined by their expression of the <i>lecithin retinol acyltransferase domain containing 2a</i> (<i>lratd2a</i>) gene and their efferent connections with a subregion of the ventral interpeduncular nucleus (vIPN). The <i>lratd2a</i>-expressing neurons in the right dHb are innervated by a subset of mitral cells from both the left and right olfactory bulb and are activated upon exposure to the odorant cadaverine that is repellent to adult zebrafish. Using an intersectional strategy to drive expression of the botulinum neurotoxin specifically in these neurons, we find that adults no longer show aversion to cadaverine. Mutants with left-isomerized dHb that lack these neurons are also less repelled by cadaverine and their behavioral response to alarm substance, a potent aversive cue, is diminished. However, mutants in which both dHb have right identity appear more reactive to alarm substance. The results implicate an asymmetric dHb-vIPN neural circuit in the processing of repulsive olfactory cues and in modulating the resultant behavioral response.

                Intelligent behavior and cognitive functions in mammals depend on cortical microcircuits made up of a variety of excitatory and inhibitory cells that form a forest-like complex across six layers. Mechanistic understanding of cortical microcircuits requires both manipulation and monitoring of multiple layers and interactions between them. However, existing techniques are limited as to simultaneous monitoring and stimulation at different depths without damaging a large volume of cortical tissue. Here, we present a relatively simple and versatile method for delivering light to any two cortical layers simultaneously. The method uses a tiny optical probe consisting of two microprisms mounted on a single shaft. We demonstrate the versatility of the probe in three sets of experiments: first, two distinct cortical layers were optogenetically and independently manipulated; second, one layer was stimulated while the activity of another layer was monitored; third, the activity of thalamic axons distributed in two distinct cortical layers was simultaneously monitored in awake mice. Its simple-design, versatility, small-size, and low-cost allow the probe to be applied widely to address important biological questions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tsc1 haploinsufficiency leads to Pax2 dysregulation in the developing murine cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) is a tumour suppressor gene that inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Mutations in TSC1 lead to a rare complex disorder of the same name, in which up to 50% of patients present with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD is a highly prevalent, early-onset neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by social deficits and repetitive behaviours, although the type and severity of symptoms show wide variability across individuals. Amongst different brain areas proposed to play a role in the development of ASD, the cerebellum is commonly reported to be altered, and cerebellar-specific deletion of Tsc1 in mice is sufficient to induce an ASD-like phenotype. Given that the mTOR pathway is crucial for proper cell replication and migration, this suggests that dysregulation of this pathway, particularly during critical phases of cerebellar development, could contribute to the establishment of ASD. Here, we used a mouse model of TSC to investigate gene and protein expression during embryonic and early postnatal periods of cerebellar development. We found that, at E18 and P7, mRNA levels of the cerebellar inhibitory interneuron marker Pax2 were dysregulated. This was accompanied by changes in the expression of mTOR pathway-related genes and downstream phosphorylation of S6. Differential gene correlation analysis revealed dynamic changes in correlated gene pairs across development, with an overall loss of correlation between mTOR- and cerebellar-related genes in Tsc1 mutants compared to controls. We corroborated the genetic findings by characterizing the mTOR pathway and cerebellar development on protein and cellular levels with Western blot and immunohistochemistry. We found that Pax2-expressing cells were hypertrophic at E18 while, at P7, their number was increased and maturation into parvalbumin-expressing cells delayed. Our findings indicate that E18 and P7 are crucial time points in cerebellar development in mice that are particularly susceptible to mTOR pathway dysregulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibitory neurosteroid reverses the dendritic spine disorder caused by gain-of-function GABAAR epilepsy variants</a></h4>

              
                GABAA receptors (GABAARs) are key orchestrators of neuronal activity and several GABAAR variants have been linked to genetic neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and epilepsies. Here, we report two variants (Met263Lys, Leu267Ile) in the predominant GABAAR 1 subunit gene (GABRA1) that increase apparent receptor affinity for GABA and confer spontaneous receptor activity. These gain-of-function features are unusual because GABAAR variants are traditionally thought to cause seizures by reducing inhibitory neurotransmission. Both Met263Lys and Leu267Ile increased tonic and spontaneous GABAergic conductances in neurons revealed by competitive inhibition and channel block of GABAARs. Significantly, 1-subunit variant expression in hippocampal neurons also reduced dendritic spine density. Our results indicate that elevated GABAergic signalling can precipitate genetic epilepsies and NDDs. Furthermore, the mechanistic basis may involve the de-compartmentalisation of excitatory inputs due to the removal of dendritic spines. This aberrant structural plasticity can be reversed by the naturally-occurring, therapeutically-tractable, inhibitory neurosteroid, pregnenolone sulphate.

                The cerebellum regulates nonmotor behavior, but the routes by which it exerts its influence are not well characterized. Here we report a necessary role for posterior cerebellum in guiding flexible behavior, acting through a network of diencephalic and neocortical structures. After chemogenetic inhibition of Purkinje cells in lobule VI or crus I, high-throughput automated analysis of complex whole-body movement revealed deficiencies in adaptation across days to an open field environment. Neither perturbation affected gait, within-day open-field adaptation, or location preference. In a Y-maze task, mice could learn but were impaired in their ability to reverse their initial choice. To map targets of perturbation, we imaged c-Fos activation in cleared whole brains using light-sheet microscopy. Reversal learning activated diencephalic regions and associative neocortical regions. Distinctive subsets of structures were altered by perturbation of lobule VI (thalamus and habenula) and crus I (hypothalamus and prelimbic/orbital cortex), and both perturbations influenced anterior cingulate and infralimbic cortex. Taken together, these experiments reveal parts of a brainwide system for cerebellar influence to guide flexible learning.

                The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) is composed of functionally distinct sub-populations of GABAergic neurons such as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-, arginine vasopressin (AVP)-, gastrin releasing peptide (GRP)-, and neuromedin S (NMS)-expressing neurons which form a neural network responsible for synchronizing most physiological and behavioral circadian rhythms in mammals. To date, little is known regarding which aspects of SCN rhythmicity are generated by individual SCN neurons or neuronal sub-populations and which aspects result from neuronal interaction within a network. In this study, we address this question utilizing in vivo miniaturized microscopy to measure fluorescent GCaMP-mediated calcium dynamics in AVP neurons in the intact SCN of awake, behaving mice. This approach permits analysis of rhythms of single cells, populations, and correlational analysis among groups of AVP neurons in a field of view across the circadian and diurnal day and night. We report that AVP neurons in the murine SCN exhibit a periodic oscillatory increase in calcium of approximately 14 seconds across the day and night, in both constant darkness and under a 12:12 light-dark (LD) cycle. Using in vivo optogentically-targeted single unit activity recording, we demonstrated that these slow calcium waves are likely the result of burst-firing characteristic of AVP neurons previously reported for other brain regions. Rhythmicity analysis of several fluorescence measures suggests that individual AVP neurons exhibit unstable and stochastic rhythms, with approximately 30% of the neurons rhythmic during any given day across lighting conditions, and weak or absent rhythmicity at the population level. Network-level cross-correlational analysis revealed that coherence among neuron pairs also exhibited stochastic rhythms with about 25% of pairs rhythmic at any time. Notably, this analysis revealed a stronger rhythm at the population level than was observed in single cell analysis. The peak time of maximal coherence among AVP neuronal pairs occurs between CT/ZT 6 and 9, coinciding with the timing of maximal neuronal activity with the SCN as a whole. These results are the first to demonstrate robust circadian variation in the coordination between apparently weakly rhythmic or arrhythmic neurons suggesting that, for AVP neurons, interactions between neurons in the SCN are more influential than individual or single sub-population activity in the regulation of mammalian circadian rhythms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MORPHOLOGICAL DETERMINANTS OF CELL-TO-CELL VARIATIONS IN ACTION POTENTIAL DYNAMICS IN SUBSTANTIA NIGRA DOPAMINERGIC NEURONS</a></h4>

              
                Action potential (AP) shape is a critical electrophysiological parameter, in particular because it strongly modulates neurotransmitter release. AP shape is also used to distinguish neuronal populations, as it greatly varies between neuronal types. For instance, AP duration ranges from hundreds of microseconds in cerebellar granule cells to 2-3 milliseconds in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons. While most of this variation seems to arise from differences in the subtypes of voltage- and calcium-gated ion channels expressed, a few studies suggested that dendritic morphology may also affect AP shape. However, AP duration also displays significant variability in a same neuronal type, while the determinants of these variations are poorly known. Using electrophysiological recordings, morphological reconstructions and realistic Hodgkin-Huxley modeling, we investigated the relationships between dendritic morphology and AP shape in SNc DA neurons. In this neuronal type where the axon arises from an axon-bearing dendrite (ABD), the duration of the somatic AP could be predicted from a linear combination of the complexities of the ABD and the non-ABDs. Dendrotomy simulation and experiments showed that these correlations arise from the causal influence of dendritic topology on AP duration, due in particular to a high density of sodium channels in the somato-dendritic compartment. In addition, dendritic morphology also modulated AP back-propagation efficiency in response to barrages of EPSCs in the ABD. In line with previous findings, these results demonstrate that dendritic morphology plays a major role in defining the electrophysiological properties of SNc DA neurons and their cell-to-cell variations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chloride dynamics determine the optimal distribution of inhibitory synapses to minimise dendritic excitability</a></h4>

              
                Many neurons in the mammalian central nervous system have complex dendritic arborisations and active dendritic conductances that enable these cells to perform sophisticated computations. How dendritically targeted inhibition affects local dendritic excitability is not fully understood. Here we use computational models of branched dendrites to investigate where GABAergic synapses should be placed to minimise dendritic excitability over time. To do so, we formulate a metric we term the "Inhibitory Level" (IL), which quantifies the effectiveness of synaptic inhibition for reducing the depolarising effect of nearby excitatory input. GABAergic synaptic inhibition is dependent on the reversal potential for GABAA receptors (EGABA), which is primarily set by the transmembrane chloride ion (Cl-) concentration gradient. We, therefore, investigated how variable EGABA and dynamic chloride affects dendritic inhibition. We found that the inhibitory effectiveness of dendritic GABAergic synapses accumulates at an encircled branch junction. The extent of inhibitory accumulation is dependent on the number of branches and location of synapses but is independent of EGABA. This accumulation occurs even for very distally placed inhibitory synapses when they are hyperpolarising - but not when they are shunting. When accounting for Cl- fluxes and dynamics in Cl- concentration, we observed that Cl- loading is detrimental to inhibitory effectiveness. This enabled us to determine the most inhibitory distribution of GABAergic synapses which is close to - but not at - a shared branch junction. This distribution balances a trade-off between a stronger combined inhibitory influence when synapses closely encircle a branch junction with the deleterious effects of increased Cl- loading that occurs when inhibitory synapses are co-located.

                Purpose To introduce a method to create 3D-printed axon-mimetic phantoms with complex fibre orientations to characterize the performance of diffusion MRI models and representations in the presence of orientation dispersion. Methods An extension to an open source 3D printing package was created to 3D print a set of five 3D-printed axon-mimetic (3AM) phantoms with various combinations of bending and crossing fibre orientations. A two-shell diffusion MRI scan of the five phantoms in water was performed at 9.4T. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), the ball and stick model, neurite orientation density and dispersion imaging (NODDI), and Bingham-NODDI were all fit to the resulting diffusion MRI data. A fiducial in each phantom was used to register a ground truth map of that phantom's crossing angles and/or arc radius to the diffusion-weighted images. Metrics from each model and representation were compared to the ground-truth maps, and a quadratic regression model was fit to each combination of output metric and ground-truth metric. Results The mean diffusivity (MD) metric defined by DTI was insensitive to crossing angle, but increased with fibre curvature. Axial diffusivity (AD) decreased sharply with increasing crossing angle. DKI's diffusivity metrics replicated the trends seen in DTI, and its mean kurtosis (MK) metric, decreased with fibre curvature, except in regions with high crossing angles. The estimated stick volume fraction in the ball and stick model decreased with increasing fibre curvature and crossing angle. NODDI's intra-neurite volume fraction was insensitive to crossing angle, and its orientation dispersion index (ODI) was strongly correlated to crossing angle. Bingham-NODDI's intra-neurite volume fraction was also insensitive to crossing angle, while its primary ODI (ODIP) was also strongly correlated to crossing angle and its secondary ODI (ODIS) was insensitive to crossing angle. For both NODDI models, the volume fractions of the extra-neurite and CSF compartments had low reliability with no clear relationship to crossing angle. Conclusions This study demonstrates that inexpensive 3D-printed axon-mimetic phantoms can be used to investigate the effect of fibre curvature and crossings on diffusion MRI representations and models of diffusion signal. As a proof of concept, the dependence of several representations and models on fibre dispersion/crossing were investigated. As expected, Bingham-NODDI was best able to characterize planar fibre dispersion in the phantoms.

                Motor units convert the last neural code of movement into muscle forces. The classic view of motor unit control is that the central nervous system sends common synaptic inputs to motoneuron pools and that motoneurons respond in an orderly fashion dictated by the size principle. This view however is in contrast with the large number of dimensions observed in motor cortex which may allow individual and flexible control of motor units. Evidence for flexible control of motor units may be obtained by tracking motor units longitudinally during the performance of tasks with some level of behavioural variability. Here we identified and tracked populations of motor units in the brachioradialis muscle of two macaque monkeys during ten sessions spanning over one month during high force isometric contractions with a broad range of rate of force development (1.8 - 38.6 Nm/s). During the same sessions we recorded intramuscular EMG signals from 16 arm muscles of both limbs and elicited the full recruitment through neural stimulation of the median and deep radial nerves. We found a very stable recruitment order and discharge characteristics of the motor units over sessions and contraction trials. The small deviations from orderly recruitment were observed between motor units with close recruitment thresholds, and only during high rate of force development. Moreover, we also found that one component explained more than ~50% of the motor unit discharge rate variance, and that the remaining components could be described as a time-shifted version of the first, as it could be predicted from the interplay between the size principle of recruitment and one common input. In conclusion, our results show that motoneurons recruitment is determined by the interplay of the size principle and common input and that this recruitment scheme is not violated over time nor by the speed of the contractions.

	<p>Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with different neurological conditions such as Guillain-Barr&amp;amp;eacute;, encephalitis and stroke. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited small-vessel disease characterized by recurrent ischemic stroke, cognitive decline, migraine and mood disturbances. One of the mechanisms involved in CADASIL pathogenesis is endothelial dysfunction, which causes an increased risk of recurrent strokes. Since COVID-19 infection is also associated with coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction, the risk of ischemic stroke might be even higher in this population. We describe the case of a CADASIL patient who developed an acute ischemic stroke after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In patients with diseases causing endothelial dysregulation, such as CADASIL, the hypercoagulability related to COVID-19 may contribute to the risk of stroke recurrence.</p>

	<p>Cancer-related treatments may lead to side effects that undermine a patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life (QOL). Although cognitive behavioral therapy plus coping management (CBTM) may appear to improve health-related QOL in cancer patients, limited documentation exists on the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for patients with breast cancer (BC) during recovery. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of CBTM for sleep quality, anxiety, depression, and health among patients with BC. An experimental study was conducted to assess the efficacy of a CBTM intervention (experimental group = 36, control group = 34). The experimental group received a 12-week CBTM intervention focused on their identity, challenges, the replacement of dysfunctional beliefs, coping skills, relaxation, and rehabilitation exercises, while the control group received usual care. The follow-up evaluations were performed immediately after the intervention (T1), and at one (T2) and three months (T3). The generalized estimating equation (GEE) model showed significant effects from the CBTM intervention over time. The experimental group showed significant improvement in sleep quality, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and significant increases in their mental and physical QOL from baseline, T1, T2, and T3&amp;amp;mdash;except for the mental and physical QOL showing no significant change at T3&amp;amp;mdash;while the control group receiving usual care showed no changes over time. The results suggest that CBTM increases sleep quality, reduces anxiety and depressive symptoms, and enhances health-related QOL for participants. CBTM is efficacious and can be provided by nurses to enhance patients&amp;amp;rsquo; coping skills and consequently improve their QOL.</p>

	<p>Background: In addition to the effects on patients suffering from motor-manifest Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (HD), this fatal disease is devasting to people who are at risk, premanifest mutation-carriers, and especially to whole families. There is a huge burden on people in the environment of affected HD patients, and a need for further research to identify at-risk caregivers. The aim of our research was to investigate a large cohort of family members, in comparison with genotype negative and premanifest HD in order to evaluate particular cohorts more closely. Methods: We used the ENROLL-HD global registry study to compare motoric, cognitive, functional, and psychiatric manifestation in family members, premanifest HD, and genotype negative participant as controls. Cross-sectional data were analyzed using ANCOVA-analyses in IBM SPSS Statistics V.28. Results: Of N = 21,116 participants from the global registry study, n = 5174 participants had a premanifest motor-phenotype, n = 2358 were identified as family controls, and n = 2640 with a negative HD genotype. Analysis of variance revealed more motoric, cognitive, and psychiatric impairments in premanifest HD (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Self-reported psychiatric assessments revealed a significantly higher score for depression in family controls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) when compared to genotype negative (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and premanifest HD patients (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Family controls had significantly less cognitive capacities within the cognitive test battery when compared to genotype negative participants. Conclusions: Within the largest cohort of HD patients and families, several impairments of motoric, functional, cognitive, and psychiatric components can be confirmed in a large cohort of premanifest HD, potentially due to prodromal HD pathology. HD family controls suffered from higher self-reported depression and less cognitive capacities, which were potentially due to loaded or stressful situations. This research aims to sensitize investigators to be aware of caregiver burdens caused by HD and encourage support with socio-medical care and targeted psychological interventions. In particular, further surveys and variables are necessary in order to implement them within the database so as to identify at-risk caregivers.</p>

	<p>Brand equity is an important intangible for enterprises. As one advantage, products with brand equity can increase revenue, compared with those without such equity. However, unlike tangibles, it is difficult for enterprises to manage brand equity because it exists within consumers&amp;amp;rsquo; minds. Although, over the past two decades, numerous consumer neuroscience studies have revealed the brain regions related to brand equity, the identification of unique brain regions related to such equity is still controversial. Therefore, this study identifies the unique brain regions related to brand equity and assesses the mental processes derived from these regions. For this purpose, three analysis methods (i.e., the quantitative meta-analysis, chi-square tests, and machine learning) were conducted. The data were collected in accordance with the general procedures of a qualitative meta-analysis. In total, 65 studies (1412 foci) investigating branded objects with brand equity and unbranded objects without brand equity were examined, whereas the neural systems involved for these two brain regions were contrasted. According to the results, the parahippocampal gyrus and the lingual gyrus were unique brand equity-related brain regions, whereas automatic mental processes based on emotional associative memories derived from these regions were characteristic mental processes that discriminate branded from unbranded objects.</p>

	<p>Music listening is a widespread approach in the field of music therapy. In this study, the effects of music listening on anxiety and stress in patients undergoing radiotherapy are investigated. Sixty patients with breast cancer who were candidates for postoperative curative radiotherapy were recruited and randomly assigned to three groups: Melomics-Health (MH) group (music listening algorithmically created, n = 20); individualized music listening (IML) group (playlist of preferred music, n = 20); no music group (n = 20). Music listening was administered for 15 min immediately before simulation and during the first five radiotherapy sessions. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Psychological Distress Inventory (PDI) were administered before/after treatment. Cochran&amp;amp;rsquo;s Q test and McNemar test for paired proportions were performed to evaluate if the proportion of subjects having an outcome score below the critical value by treatment and over time was different, and if there was a change in that proportion. The MH group improved in STAI and PDI. The IML group worsened in STAI at T1 and improved STAI-Trait at T2. The IML group worsened in PDI at T2. The No music group generally improved in STAI and PDI. Clinical and music listening-related implications are discussed defining possible research perspectives in this field.</p>

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a predominantly global quarantine response that has been associated with social isolation, loneliness, and anxiety. The foregoing experiences have been amply documented to have profound impacts on health, morbidity, and mortality. This narrative review uses the extant neurobiological and theoretical literature to explore the association between social isolation, loneliness, and anxiety in the context of quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging evidence suggests that distinct health issues (e.g., a sedentary lifestyle, a diminished overall sense of well-being) are associated with social isolation and loneliness. The health implications of social isolation and loneliness during quarantine have a heterogenous and comorbid nature and, as a result, form a link to anxiety. The limbic system plays a role in fear and anxiety response; the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, HPA axis, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, insula, and locus coeruleus have an impact in a prolonged anxious state. In the conclusion, possible solutions are considered and remarks are made on future areas of exploration.</p>

	<p>Clobenpropit (CLO), an antagonist on histamine H3 receptors (HH3R), has been shown to protect NMDA-induced neuronal necrosis in cortical neuronal cell culture from rats. In this work, we explored its potential on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced memory deficits, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in mice. CLO (1 and 3 mg/kg, p.o.) was treated continually for 30 days, and neurotoxicity was induced by four doses of LPS (250 &amp;amp;micro;g/kg, i.p.). The radial arm maze (RAM) was used to access memory behaviors. After the REM test, brain tissue was collected from each mouse to estimate pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF&amp;amp;alpha; and IL6), anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-&amp;amp;beta;1 and IL-10), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX 2), and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (MRCC- I, II and IV) enzymes. CLO treatment reversed the LPS-induced behavioral deficits by a significant reduction in time taken to consume all five bites (TTB), working memory error (WME), and reference memory error (REM) in the REM test. Regarding neuroinflammation, it attenuated the release of COX, TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, and IL-6, and augmented TGF-&amp;amp;beta;1 and IL-10 levels in the brain. Reversal of LPS-induced brain MRCC (I, II, and IV) levels also resulted with CLO treatment. From these findings, CLO promises neuroprotection against LPS-induced cognitive deficits by ameliorating neuroinflammation and restoring the MRCC enzymes in mice.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Charcot&amp;amp;ndash;Marie&amp;amp;ndash;Tooth disease (CMT) is the most frequent form of inherited chronic motor and sensory polyneuropathy. Over 100 CMT causative genes have been identified. Previous reports found PMP22, GJB1, MPZ, and MFN2 as the most frequently involved genes. Other genes, such as BSCL2, MORC2, HINT1, LITAF, GARS, and autosomal dominant GDAP1 are responsible for only a minority of CMT cases. (2) Methods: we present here our records of CMT patients harboring a mutation in one of these rare genes (BSCL2, MORC2, HINT1, LITAF, GARS, autosomal dominant GDAP1). We studied 17 patients from 8 unrelated families. All subjects underwent neurologic evaluation and genetic testing by next-generation sequencing on an Ion Torrent PGM (Thermo Fischer) with a 44-gene custom panel. (3) Results: the following variants were found: BSCL2 c.263A &amp;amp;gt; G p.Asn88Ser (eight subjects), MORC2 c.1503A &amp;amp;gt; T p.Gln501His (one subject), HINT1 c.110G &amp;amp;gt; C p.Arg37Pro (one subject), LITAF c.404C &amp;amp;gt; G p.Pro135Arg (two subjects), GARS c.1660G &amp;amp;gt; A p.Asp554Asn (three subjects), GDAP1 c.374G &amp;amp;gt; A p.Arg125Gln (two subjects). (4) Expanding the spectrum of CMT phenotypes is of high relevance, especially for less common variants that have a higher risk of remaining undiagnosed. The necessity of reaching a genetic definition for most patients is great, potentially making them eligible for future experimentations.</p>

                Extreme polarization can undermine democracy by making compromise impossible and transforming politics into a zero-sum game. “Ideological polarization”—the extent to which political views are widely dispersed—is already strong among elites, but less so among the general public [N. McCarty, Polarization: What Everyone Needs to Know, 2019, pp. 50–68]. Strong mutual...

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The activity-dependent expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs) has been utilized to label memory traces. However, their roles in engram specification are incompletely understood. Outstanding questions remain as to whether expression of IEGs can interplay with network properties such as functional connectivity and also if neurons expressing different IEGs are functionally distinct. In order to connect IEG expression at the cellular level with changes in functional connectivity, we investigated the expression of 2 IEGs, Arc and c-Fos, in cultured hippocampal neurons. Primary neuronal cultures were treated with a chemical cocktail [4-aminopyridine (4AP), bicuculline (Bic), and forskolin] to increase neuronal activity, IEG expression, and induce chemical long-term potentiation (LTP). Neuronal firing is assayed by intracellular calcium imaging using GCaMP6m and expression of IEGs is assessed by immunofluorescence staining. We noted an emergent network property of refinement in network activity, characterized by a global downregulation of correlated activity, together with an increase in correlated activity between subsets of specific neurons. Subsequently, we show that Arc expression correlates with the effects of refinement, as the increase in correlated activity occurs specifically between Arc-positive neurons. The expression patterns of the IEGs c-Fos and Arc strongly overlap, but Arc was more selectively expressed than c-Fos. A subpopulation of neurons positive for both Arc and c-Fos shows increased correlated activity, while correlated firing between Arc+/cFos&ndash; neurons is reduced. Our results relate neuronal activity-dependent expression of the IEGs Arc and c-Fos on the individual cellular level to changes in correlated activity of the neuronal network.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Slinker: Visualising novel splicing events in RNA-Seq data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Visualisation of the transcriptome relative to a reference genome is fraught with sparsity. This is due to RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) reads being predominantly mapped to exons that account for just under 3% of the human genome. Recently, we have used exon-only references, superTranscripts, to improve visualisation of aligned RNA-Seq data through the omission of supposedly unexpressed regions such as introns. However, variation within these regions can lead to novel splicing events that may drive a pathogenic phenotype. In these cases, the loss of information in only retaining annotated exons presents significant drawbacks. Here we present Slinker, a bioinformatics pipeline written in Python and Bpipe that uses a data-driven approach to assemble sample-specific superTranscripts. At its core, Slinker uses Stringtie2 to assemble transcripts with any sequence across any gene. This assembly is merged with reference transcripts, converted to a superTranscript, of which rich visualisations are made through Plotly with associated annotation and coverage information. Slinker was validated on five novel splicing events of rare disease samples from a cohort of primary muscular disorders. In addition, Slinker was shown to be effective in visualising deletion events within transcriptomes of tumour samples in the important leukemia gene, IKZF1. Slinker offers a succinct visualisation of RNA-Seq alignments across typically sparse regions and is freely available on Github.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Enhancement of pyocyanin production by subinhibitory concentration of royal jelly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [version 4; peer review: 3 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterium, produces pyocyanin, a virulence factor associated with antibiotic tolerance. High concentrations of royal jelly have an antibacterial effect, which may potentially overcome antibacterial resistance. However, in some cases, antibiotic tolerance can occur due to prolonged stress of low-dose antibacterial agents. This study aimed to investigate the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of royal jelly on bacterial growth, pyocyanin production, and biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa. Methods: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and clinical isolates were cultured in a royal jelly-containing medium to test the antibacterial activity. Pyocyanin production was observed by measuring the absorbance at 690 nm after 36 h culture and determined using extinction coefficient 4310 M-1 cm-1. Static microtiter plate biofilm assay performed to detect the biofilm formation, followed by scanning electron microscopy. Results: Royal jelly effectively inhibited the viability of both strains from a concentration of 25%. The highest production of pyocyanin was observed in the subinhibitory concentration group 6.25%, which gradually decreased along with the decrease of royal jelly concentration. Results of one-way ANOVA tests differed significantly in pyocyanin production of the two strains between the royal jelly groups. Tukey HSD test showed concentrations of 12.5%, 6.25%, and 3.125% significantly increased pyocyanin production of ATCC 10145, and the concentrations of 12.5% and 6.25% significantly increased production of the clinical isolates. Concentrations of 12.5% and 6.125% significantly induced biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145, in line with the results of the SEM analysis. Conclusions: The royal jelly concentration of 25% or higher inhibits bacterial growth; however, the subinhibitory concentration increases pyocyanin production and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. It is advisable to determine the appropriate concentration of royal jelly to obtain beneficial virulence inhibiting activity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Hebbian plasticity in parallel synaptic pathways: A circuit mechanism for systems memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michiel W. H. Remme, Urs Bergmann, Denis Alevi, Susanne Schreiber, Henning Sprekeler, Richard Kempter</p>

Systems memory consolidation involves the transfer of memories across brain regions and the transformation of memory content. For example, declarative memories that transiently depend on the hippocampal formation are transformed into long-term memory traces in neocortical networks, and procedural memories are transformed within cortico-striatal networks. These consolidation processes are thought to rely on replay and repetition of recently acquired memories, but the cellular and network mechanisms that mediate the changes of memories are poorly understood. Here, we suggest that systems memory consolidation could arise from Hebbian plasticity in networks with parallel synaptic pathways—two ubiquitous features of neural circuits in the brain. We explore this hypothesis in the context of hippocampus-dependent memories. Using computational models and mathematical analyses, we illustrate how memories are transferred across circuits and discuss why their representations could change. The analyses suggest that Hebbian plasticity mediates consolidation by transferring a linear approximation of a previously acquired memory into a parallel pathway. Our modelling results are further in quantitative agreement with lesion studies in rodents. Moreover, a hierarchical iteration of the mechanism yields power-law forgetting—as observed in psychophysical studies in humans. The predicted circuit mechanism thus bridges spatial scales from single cells to cortical areas and time scales from milliseconds to years.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Locus coeruleus neurons encode the subjective difficulty of triggering and executing actions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pauline Bornert, Sebastien Bouret</p>

The brain stem noradrenergic nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) is involved in various costly processes: arousal, stress, and attention. Recent work has pointed toward an implication in physical effort, and indirect evidence suggests that the LC could be also involved in cognitive effort. To assess the dynamic relation between LC activity, effort production, and difficulty, we recorded the activity of 193 LC single units in 5 monkeys performing 2 discounting tasks (a delay discounting task and a force discounting task), as well as a simpler target detection task where conditions were matched for difficulty and only differed in terms of sensory-motor processes. First, LC neurons displayed a transient activation both when monkeys initiated an action and when exerting force. Second, the magnitude of the activation scaled with the associated difficulty, and, potentially, the corresponding amount of effort produced, both for decision and force production. Indeed, at action initiation in both discounting tasks, LC activation increased in conditions associated with lower average engagement rate, i.e., those requiring more cognitive control to trigger the response. Decision-related activation also scaled with response time (RT), over and above task parameters, in line with the idea that it reflects the amount of resources (here time) spent on the decision process. During force production, LC activation only scaled with the amount of force produced in the force discounting task, but not in the control target detection task, where subjective difficulty was equivalent across conditions. Our data show that LC neurons dynamically track the amount of effort produced to face both cognitive and physical challenges with a subsecond precision. This works provides key insight into effort processing and the contribution of the noradrenergic system, which is affected in several pathologies where effort is impaired, including Parkinson disease and depression.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An informational sociobiological explanation of the constitution of the human body [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pedro Ortiz (1933-2011), in the latest four decades of his life, developed the Informational Sociobiological Theory (IST) in a university teaching context that became the foundation of post-grade studies in neuroscience in Peru. The IST looks for a totality explanation of the phenomena of the universe proposes an explanation of the constitution of the human body. In what consist this explanation of the configuration of the human body? Methods: A bibliographical qualitative study was conducted starting from primary documental sources. It was considered among the sources, all related to the editorial project Books of Social Psychobiologic (elaborated by Ortiz during the first decade of this age). The results have been presented across a conceptual analysis, narrative and graphic, oriented to expose Ortiz’ ideas in relation to the human body’s morphology. Results: The structural architecture of the human body, and in particular in one person; shows five levels of complexity which begins in cells, the intercellular matrix, the neural system, the paleocortical psyche, and neocortical psyche. In this involve explanation, the organs of the body are essentially tissue systems, and are integrated (subsumed) at the neural level (which informationally goes through the plexuses, ganglia, and subcortical nuclei). The two levels of superior complexity to the neural system, are the space of the psychic activity, unconscious and conscious, which is suprastructurally to all bodily structures. Ortiz is settled on a different monism: that guides us to imagine and think that all psychic activity is suprastructural to the body. Conclusions: There is an original explanation of the human body within the IST. This informational morphology dialogues with the knowledge of biology, neurology, anatomy, physiology, embryology, and histology, and is proposed as a structuring element in all the conceptual architecture that represents the IST.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Current situation of vaccine injury compensation program and a future perspective in light of COVID-19 and emerging viral diseases [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Vaccines have had a great impact on disease prevention and reducing mortality. Very rarely, vaccines also can result in serious adverse effects. In consideration of this fact, vaccine injury compensation programs have been implemented in many countries to compensate a vaccinee for associated adverse effects. The existing vaccine injury compensation system addresses routine immunization schemes. However, there are rising concerns about the compensation for adverse effects caused by new vaccines such as those developed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review focuses on vaccine injury compensation programs and highlights the necessity to include all upcoming new vaccines for COVID-19 and other emerging viral diseases in the compensation schemes. Methods: Published articles relating to vaccine compensation injury programs, vaccines, injuries, disabilities, illnesses, and deaths resulting from vaccination were searched in data bases. Through a careful review of the abstracts, 25 relevant articles were selected for analysis. Results: We identified 27 countries on four continents with vaccine injury compensation schemes: 17 countries in Europe, 7 countries in Asia, the United States, a Canadian Province and New Zealand. No programs were identified in Africa and in South America. Program design, funding, and eligibility for compensation vary vastly between countries. We identified 17 countries operating well-established vaccine injury compensation programs. However, minimal information is available on numerous other countries. Conclusion: We conclude that the vaccine injury compensation programs are available in limited number of countries across four continents - mostly in Europe. Lack of standard approach and scope of injury prevention and compensation programs across the countries exists. Some important limitations include limited scientific material, which hindered our research. Therefore, additional data concerning payout for each type of injury and the number of claimants related to a specific vaccine injury worldwide could provide a more comprehensive analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mobile perceived trust mediation on the intention and adoption of FinTech innovations using mobile technology: A systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The banking and financial sectors have witnessed a significant development recently due to financial technology (FinTech), and it has become an essential part of the financial system. Many factors helped the development of this sector, including the pandemics such as Covid-19, the considerable increasing market value of the FinTech sector worldwide, and new technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and mobile technology. Moreover, changes in consumer's preferences, especially the Z-generation (digital generation). FinTech shifted the traditional business models to mobile platforms characterized by ease of access and swift transactions. Mobile technology became the main backbone for FinTech innovations and acts as a channel to deliver FinTech services that overcome all geographical and timing barriers, thus enhancing financial inclusion. Mobile perceived Trust (MPT), or the trust in using financial business models via mobile technology, is a crucial factor in the FinTech context that has mediation effects on the intention and adoption of different FinTech business models. Unfortunately, few studies have explored MPT mediations on consumers' intention to adopt FinTech innovations using mobile technology. Typically, many studies examined trust/MPT as an independent and unidirectional variable and investigated its effects on behaviour intention without predicting its mediation effects. This study aimed to develop a systematic literature review on MPT mediation in FinTech, focusing on the period from 2016 and 2021, in journals ranked Q1 and Q2, and known-based theories such as the technology acceptance model, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, and the mobile technology acceptance model. This study found that only four articles were published in Q1 and Q2 journals. In these articles, the MPT was used as a mediator, and its effects were measured on the intention and adoption of the behaviour.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Globalization and life lost due to tuberculosis: evidence from a multi-country study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Tuberculosis affects around 30% of the population of the world. Tuberculosis causes an increase in early mortality and thus has the potential to increase the number of years of life lost. Globalization directly or indirectly by affecting the factors that increase the susceptibility for tuberculosis infection has the potential to increase the spread and mortality due to tuberculosis. This study assessed the causal link between globalization and the years of life lost due to tuberculosis. Methods: Data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and World Bank for 2004 and 2005 were used for a number of covariates and possible mediators. Data from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) were used for the outcome variable and important globalization indicators. The primary health outcome that was studied is tuberculosis and the measure that was used to quantify tuberculosis mortality is the years of life lost (YLL). Path analysis was used. Results: The main independent variables of economic and social integration were not statistically significant. For every unit increase in the proportion of people that were using treated drinking water, there was a -0.0002 decrease in the YLL due to tuberculosis. For every unit increase in the proportion of people with earth floor, there was a 0.0002 units increase in YLL due to tuberculosis. For every unit increase in the proportion of people living using clean fuel, there was a 0.0004 decrease in the YLL due to tuberculosis. Conclusions: Social and economic globalization have no effect on the years of life lost due to tuberculosis, highlighting that globalization actually does not contribute to tuberculosis mortality. However, improving other important determinants such as sanitation, providing safe drinking water and clean households will reduce the mortality due to tuberculosis, highlighting the need to invest in them.

                Peter et al. show that, when a visual stimulus is repeated, primate V1 shows reductions in firing rates yet increases in gamma-band activity. These changes are specific to the stimulus location and the stimulus itself that induced them, and they show persistency over minutes and occur for gratings and natural images.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">SARS-CoV-2 ferritin nanoparticle vaccines elicit broad SARS coronavirus immunogenicity</a></h4>

              
                Joyce et al. generate four categories of engineered SARS-CoV-2 ferritin nanoparticle immunogens using structure-based vaccine design that recapitulate the prefusion SARS-CoV-2 Spike, S1, and RBD. These immunogens induce robust and protective neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2, and elicit potent neutralization against variants of concern, and the heterologous SARS-CoV-1.
