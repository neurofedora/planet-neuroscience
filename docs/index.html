<p>Neuronal connectomes play a critical role in information storage during learning and memory. We report that dopamine neurons are essential for adaptive olfactory learning in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Dopamine neurodegeneration results in significant learning impairment.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Encoding and consolidating information through learning and memory is vital in adaptation and survival. Dopamine (DA) is a critical neurotransmitter that modulates behavior. However, the role of DA in learning and memory processes is not well defined. Herein, we used the olfactory adaptive learning paradigm in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to elucidate the role of DA in the memory pathway. <i>Cat-2</i> mutant worms with low DA synthesis showed a significant reduction in chemotaxis index (CI) compared to the wild type (WT) after short-term conditioning. In dat-1::ICE worms, having degeneration of DA neurons, there was a significant reduction in adaptive learning and memory. When the worms were trained in the presence of exogenous DA (10 mM) instead of food, a substantial increase in CI value was observed. Furthermore, our results suggest that both dop-1 and dop-3 DA receptors are involved in memory retention. The release of DA during conditioning is essential to initiate the learning pathway. We also noted an enhanced cholinergic receptor activity in the absence of dopaminergic neurons. The strains expressing GCaMP6 in DA neurons (pdat-1::GCaMP-6::<i>mCherry)</i> showed a rise in intracellular calcium influx in the presence of the conditional stimulus after training, suggesting DA neurons are activated during memory recall. These results reveal the critical role of DA in adaptive learning and memory, indicating that DA neurons play a crucial role in the effective processing of cognitive function.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A characterization of the neural representation of confidence during probabilistic learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning in a stochastic and changing environment is a difficult task. Models of learning typically postulate that observations that deviate from the learned predictions are surprising and used to update those predictions. Bayesian accounts further posit the existence of a confidence-weighting mechanism: learning should be modulated by the confidence level that accompanies those predictions. However, the neural bases of this confidence are much less known than the ones of surprise. Here, we used a dynamic probability learning task and high-field MRI to identify putative cortical regions involved in the representation of confidence about predictions during human learning. We devised a stringent test based on the conjunction of four criteria. We localized several regions in parietal and frontal cortices whose activity is sensitive to the confidence of an ideal observer, specifically so with respect to potential confounds (surprise and predictability), and in a way that is invariant to which item is predicted. We also tested for functionality in two ways. First, we localized regions whose activity patterns at the subject level showed an effect of both confidence and surprise in qualitative agreement with the confidence-weighting principle. Second, we found neural representations of ideal confidence that also accounted for subjective confidence. Taken together, those results identify a set of cortical regions potentially implicated in the confidence-weighting of learning.

	<p>Hypothermia therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy for traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, some trials have shown that hypothermia therapy has a negative effect on patients with TBI. The treatment of hypothermia in children with TBI remains controversial. We conducted a search of six online databases to validate the literature on comparing hypothermia with normal therapy for children with TBI. Eight randomized controlled trials (514 patients) were included. The meta-analysis indicated that hypothermia therapy may increase the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores. However, in terms of improving the rate of complications, intracranial pressure (ICP), mortality, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and length of stay both in hospital as well as pediatric ICU, the difference was not statistically significant. Hypothermia therapy may have clinical advantages in improving the GOS scores in children with TBI compared with normothermic therapy, but hypothermia therapy may have no benefit in improving the incidence of complications, ICP, mortality, CPP, and length of stay both in pediatric ICU as well as hospital. The decision to implement hypothermia therapy for children with TBI depends on the advantages and disadvantages from many aspects and these must be considered comprehensively.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of Aloe vera extract in post-burn skin repair in rats [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Burn injury is a global health problem that is most often caused by heat. A burn injury can cause high morbidity and mortality and requires high cost. Therefore, the use of plants as an herbal medicine has the potential to be developed in Indonesia. Aloe vera contains various active ingredients that help the wound healing process, such as glucomannan and acemannan which have the effects on the proliferation of macrophages, fibroblasts, and re-epithelialization. This study aimed to determine the effect of Aloe vera extract in repairing post-burn skin in rats that were analyzed from the number of macrophages, fibroblasts, and epidermal thickness. Methods: This is an experimental study with a posttest-only control group design using 54 Rattus norvegicus Wistar strain rats. The sampling method was simple random sampling consisting of 3 groups, i.e., I. standard group, which were normal rats; II. negative control group, which were given second-degree burns and treated with gel base (without Aloe vera extract); III. treatment groups, which were given second-degree burns and treated with Aloe vera extract gel. Each group was subdivided into three smaller groups (n = 6) according to the time the lesions were evaluated. Skin tissue samplings were carried out on days 3, 14, and 21 after injury to observe the number of macrophages, fibroblasts, and epidermal thickness. Results: There were significant differences in the mean number of macrophages, number of fibroblasts, and epidermal thickness in all groups (p<0.05). Conclusion: Aloe vera extract could accelerate the healing process of burns in rats.

                Background: Data pertaining to risk factors of nonspecific low back pain (NSLBP) among rural Bangladeshi is scarce. This study explored the risk factors associated with NSLBP among rural Bangladeshi adults. Methods: A community-based study was done in Sonargaon Upazila of Narayanganj district of Bangladesh. A total of 343 NSLBP patients were recruited as cases, based on the Bangla version of Community oriented program for control of rheumatic diseases (COPCORD) questionnaire. An equal number of age and sex matched subjects without any rheumatic disease were recruited from the same community. A total of 15 probable factors were analyzed. Age-sex adjusted univariate and age-sex with 13 risk factors adjusted multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses were done. Results: The mean age of the participants was 33.1 years old (standard deviation: 9.5). Out of 13 risk factors, history of chronic disease (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2 – 3.4), prolonged sitting (OR 4.6, 95% CI 2.0 – 11.0), squatting (OR 7.2, 95% CI 3.2 – 16.0), bending of the waist (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.8 – 7.6), regular lifting or carrying a heavy load (OR 9.2, 95% CI 2.2 – 39.7), prolonged standing (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.9 – 17.7), occupation related to strenuous physical activity (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1 – 0.8), overweight (body mass index >=25 kg/m2) (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.8 – 5.2) and depression (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4 – 3.6) were found to be significantly associated with NSLBP. Conclusions: The study generated knowledge on associated risk factors for NSLBP in rural people of Bangladesh that may facilitate an evidence-based intervention for the target group.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of Fabry disease in Iraq [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Fabry disease occurs due to mutations in the α-galactosidase A (GLA) gene present in the X-chromosome, which results in α-galactosidase A (α-GAL A) enzyme deficiency, leading to the intracellular accumulation of glycosphingolipids like globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). It involves multiorgan dysfunction, particularly affecting kidneys, heart, and central and peripheral nervous system. We intended to evaluate the prevalence of Fabry disease in various regions of Iraq along with the clinical manifestations. Methods: This cross-sectional multi-center study was conducted in Iraq with 1148 patients with variable presentations from January 2018 to June 2022. The demography, patient medical and family history were recorded. Routine clinical investigations were performed along with some specific assessments. Lysosomal α-GAL A enzyme activity was determined using the dried blood spot test followed by tandem mass spectrometry, where values between 200–2000 pmol/spot*20 h were considered normal. Any patient with α-GAL A activity <100 pmol/spot*20h was sent for genetic testing for confirmation of the diagnosis. Statistical analysis of data involved Pearson’s chi-squared test. Results: In total, 17 patients had Fabry disease, with a 16:1 male:female ratio. The disorder was predominant in the 10–30-year age group. Renal dysfunction was the dominant clinical manifestation (82.3%), followed by peripheral neuropathy (35.3%), angiokeratoma (29.4%), corneal verticillate (23.5%), and left ventricular hypertrophy (17.6%). The prevalence of Fabry disease was highest in north Iraq, followed by middle and south regions. Conclusions: A prompt and timely diagnosis of Fabry disease is the cornerstone for preventing complications, especially renal and cardiac involvement.

                Single-cell omics (SCO) has revolutionized the way and the level of resolution by which life science research is conducted, not only impacting our understanding of fundamental cell biology but also providing novel solutions in cutting-edge medical research. The rapid development of single-cell technologies has been accompanied by the active development of data analysis methods, resulting in a plethora of new analysis tools and strategies every year. Such a rapid development of SCO methods and tools poses several challenges in standardization, benchmarking, computational resources and training. These challenges are in line with the activities of ELIXIR, the European coordinated infrastructure for life science data. Here, we describe the current landscape of and the main challenges in SCO data, and propose the creation of the ELIXIR SCO Community, to coordinate the efforts in order to best serve SCO researchers in Europe and beyond. The Community will build on top of national experiences and pave the way towards integrated long-term solutions for SCO research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of vaccination against COVID-19 on the emotional health of older adults [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the mental and emotional health of the elderly, especially those from low to middle-income countries. However, COVID-19 vaccination may reduce this influence. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the effect of vaccination against COVID-19 on the emotional health of older adults. Methods: We selected a national, random, and stratified sample of non-hospitalized adults aged 60 to 79 years from Peru who intended to receive or had already received the COVID-19 vaccine during recruitment. During June and July 2021, the assessed outcomes were the fear, anxiety, and worry about COVID-19, general anxiety, and depression at baseline and after a month. We estimated the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each altered emotional health outcomes in those who had one and two doses, compared with those who were not vaccinated using multilevel logistic regression with mixed effects. Results: We recruited 861 older adults with 20.8% of loss to follow-up. At baseline, 43.9% had received only one dose of the vaccine, and 49.1% had two doses. In the analysis during follow-up, those who had two doses had less fear (aOR: 0.19; CI 95%: 0.07 to 0.51) and anxiety to COVID-19 (aOR: 0.45; CI 95%: 0.22 to 0.89), compared to unvaccinated. We observed no effects in those with only one dose. Conclusions: Two doses of COVID-19 vaccination in older adults improves their perception of COVID-19 infection consequences. This information could be integrated into the vaccination campaign as an additional beneficial effect.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Neuroimaging Data Model Linear Regression Tool (nidm_linreg): PyNIDM Project [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                The Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM) is a series of specifications for describing all aspects of the neuroimaging data lifecycle from raw data to analyses and provenance. NIDM uses community-driven terminologies along with unambiguous data dictionaries within a Resource Description Framework (RDF) document to describe data and metadata for integration and query. Data from different studies, using locally defined variable names, can be retrieved by linking them to higher-order concepts from established ontologies and terminologies. Through these capabilities, NIDM documents are expected to improve reproducibility and facilitate data discovery and reuse. PyNIDM is a Python toolbox supporting the creation, manipulation, and querying of NIDM documents. Using the query tools available in PyNIDM, users are able interrogate datasets to find studies that have collected variables measuring similar phenotypic properties. This, in turn, facilitates the transformation and combination of data across multiple studies. The focus of this manuscript is the linear regression tool which is a part of the PyNIDM toolbox and works directly on NIDM documents. It provides a high-level statistical analysis that aids researchers in gaining more insight into the data that they are considering combining across studies. This saves researchers valuable time and effort while showing potential relationships between variables. The linear regression tool operates through a command-line interface integrated with the other tools (pynidm linear-regression) and provides the user with the opportunity to specify variables of interest using the rich query techniques available for NIDM documents and then conduct a linear regression with optional contrast and regularization.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Proximate analysis of the high phytochemical activity of encapsulated Mandai cempedak (Artocarpus champeden) vinegar prepared with maltodextrin and chitosan as wall materials [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mandai cempedak vinegar (MCV) is a fermented vinegar produced from the inner skin of cempedak (Artocarpus champeden), which contains antioxidants classified as flavonoids, phenols, and tannins. These bioactive compounds are sensitive to heat and prone to oxidative damage. Therefore, an encapsulation process is proposed to protect the bioactive compounds. This study aimed to design a potential scaling-up formulation of spray-dried encapsulated MCV based on Total Soluble Solid (TSS) with the addition of maltodextrin and chitosan, followed by determining the nutrition and phytochemical values of the formulation. Methods: The formulation employed maltodextrin to achieve TSS of 15, 20, and 25 ºBrix as the primary wall material treatment factor. The second factor was chitosan as auxiliary wall material at 1, 2, and 3% (w/w of maltodextrin). Products were spray-dried at 100 ºC inlet temperature and 80 ºC outlet temperature. Analyses of nutrition, flavonoid, phenol, and tannin were conducted in triplicate for each encapsulated product.  Results: The 15 ºBrix of TSS from maltodextrin with 1% chitosan emerged as the best-encapsulating material, giving 7.54% moisture, 0.75% ash, 0.42% protein, 0.35% fat, and 90.94% carbohydrate content, resulting in a phytochemical activity equivalent to 9.13 mg Catechin Equivalent kg-1, 69.61 mg Gallic Acid Equivalent kg-1, and 25.04 mg Tannic Acid Equivalent kg-1. Compared to maltodextrin, the chitosan generally contributed less to the proximate, flavonoid, phenol, and tannin content of the encapsulated MCV. Conclusions: The best formulation contained maltodextrin at 15 ºBrix of TSS and 1% chitosan. Maintaining optimum TSS was a key to producing consistent encapsulated MCV with high phytochemical activity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An exploration of trends and future directions in sustainability performance: A bibliometric analysis of Scopus database [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Current global economic activities are increasingly being perceived as unsustainable. With the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) statement in 2015, sustainability performance has received significant attention. Thus, it is necessary to better understand the topics of interest and expand cooperation networks to advance studies in integrated efforts. The present bibliometric research intends to assess worldwide research tendency in sustainability performance. Methods: We conducted an extensive bibliometric analysis of published academic articles on sustainability performance (SP) from 1997 to 2021. We reviewed, retrieved, and analysed 3680 papers published in Scopus. Specifically, VOSviewer software was used to conduct document co-authorship and co-occurrence analyses and burst detection analyses. Results: The outcomes reveal that since 1997, the sum of publications has been on the rise steadily. About a third of all global papers on sustainability performance were produced by researchers from the United States and Australia, outnumbering the remaining 138 countries/territories. Furthermore, the ten most prolific authors of sustainability performance are all from universities. Haapala, Karl R. and Murat Kucukvar were the most influential authors found, based on the total publication number of sustainability performance. Conclusions: The bibliometric analysis was conducted to identify the trends in the area of sustainability performance. Therefore, this study identified a significant research gap for future study of practitioners and researchers. The social sustainability and the relationship between the material flow analysis and sustainability performance should be noted. In addition, only the Scopus database has been considered due to its academic prestige. The database includes a large number of articles on sustainability performance. Therefore, the analysis was limited to the Scopus database only. However, other databases, such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, and MedLine, can be used for future research. These can also be used in combination.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The global prevalence and association between the risk of myocarditis and mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination: A network meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cases of myocarditis development have been reported after administration of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines. However, the reports vary among the studies, and the types of mRNA vaccines with potential to cause myocarditis remain unidentified. The objective was to assess the cumulative prevalence of myocarditis and determine the association between myocarditis and mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: We performed a network meta-analysis by searching articles in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Information on the prevalence of myocarditis after the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination was collected from each study. Analysis was performed by calculating the pooled prevalence rate, and the association was determined using the Z-test. Data networking was performed using the Bayesian method. Results: A total of 18 papers was included in our analysis. We found that the cumulative prevalence of myocarditis was 1.7, 1.9, 1.2, and 1.1 per 100,000 population after vaccination with different types of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, namely all mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, BNT162b1, mRNA-1273, and the combination of BNT162b1 and mRNA-1273, respectively. Moreover, the results revealed that BNT162b1 vaccination increased the risk of myocarditis by 1.64- and 1.71-folds compared to mRNA-1273 and the combination of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively. Similar risks of developing myocarditis were observed after mRNA-1273 and the combination of BNT162b1 and mRNA-1273 vaccination. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the cumulative prevalence of myocarditis after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination with maximum prevalence was observed after BNT162b2 administration. BNT162b2 was associated with a higher risk of developing myocarditis than the other mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines.

                Chinese herbal medicine formula Zhi Shi Xiao Pi Wan (ZSXPW) is commonly used for gastrointestinal diseases. Previous research showed ZSXPW also suggested for diabetic gastroparesis (DGP) treatment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ZSXPW in treating adult DGP. Six databases, including Pubmed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, China Network Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and Chinese Scientific Journals were searched from their inceptions to November 2021. Only randomized control trials (RCTs) evaluating ZSXPW for adult DGP were included in this review. Two investigators independently evaluated and extracted the data. Total 11 RCTs and 802 participants were included in the review. In these studies, ZSXPW was compared with oral cisapride, domperidone, and mosapride citrate tablets. The outcomes of effective rate, stomach emptying time, stomach emptying rate, motilin, gastrin, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and adverse events were analyzed. The effective rate of ZSXPW is higher than other pharmacotherapies (RR:1.24, 95% CI [1.16,1.32]). The results showed intervention group has better effect on gastric emptying time used (MD: -0.51, 95% CI [-0.81, -0.21]) and gastric emptying rate (MD: 19.32, 95% CI [12.82, 25.83]) than the comparison group. The meta-analysis results showed ZSXPW is effective on adult DGP.

                Background: People with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are frequently at higher risk of developing cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, which are strongly related to the development of long-term illness and higher mortality. These effects may be caused by several interrelated processes, including the IL-6 driven cytokine storm or uncontrolled angiotensin II stimulation. In addition, the direct viral infection of cardiac myocytes is thought to cause cardiac injury because it increases metabolic demand, activates the immune system, and causes vasculature disruption. The objective of this study was to determine whether there is a relationship between cardiac troponin-T (cTnT) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio values with COVID-19. Methods: During the data collection stage, 90 participants were included, 45 healthy controls and 45 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Each participant provided 5 ml venous blood to begin analyzing cTnT and LDL-C:HDL-C ratio levels in their blood to see whether there is an association between the level of any of these markers and COVID-19 infection using SPSS version 23. Results: This research reported a significant rise in the measured values of cTnT and LDL-C:HDL-C ratio in patients' blood compared to controls, with P-values of 0.025 and 0.000, respectively, in which alpha values < 0.05, These biomarkers hold the promise in predicting COVID-19 severity, and early treatment may help reduce complications. Conclusions: Due to the fact that cTn is a diagnostic marker of disease activity and a strong independent predictor of negative events, its usage in emergency rooms may well be advantageous. If cTn is elevated, hospitalization may be indicated. A difference in the blood LDL-C:HDL-C ratio of COVID-19 patients demonstrated an association with the illness. Because lipid studies are inexpensive and reliable to do, they may aid clinicians in identifying the severity of COVID-19.

                Natural killer (NK) cells recognise and kill target cells undergoing different types of stress. NK cells are also capable of modulating immune responses. In particular, they regulate T cell functions. Small RNA next-generation sequencing of resting and activated human NK cells and their secreted EVs led to the identification of a specific repertoire of NK-EV-associated microRNAs and their post-transcriptional modifications signature. Several microRNAs of NK-EVs, namely miR-10b-5p, miR-92a-3p and miR-155-5p, specifically target molecules involved in Th1 responses. NK-EVs promote the downregulation of <i>GATA3</i> mRNA in CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells and subsequent <i>TBX21</i> de-repression that leads to Th1 polarization and IFN-γ and IL-2 production. NK-EVs also have an effect on monocyte and moDCs function, driving their activation and increased presentation and co-stimulatory functions. Nanoparticle-delivered NK-EV microRNAs partially recapitulate NK-EV effects in mice. Our results provide new insights on the immunomodulatory roles of NK-EVs that may help to improve their use as immunotherapeutic tools.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Label-free three-photon imaging of intact human cerebral organoids for tracking early events in brain development and deficits in Rett syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Human cerebral organoids are unique in their development of progenitor-rich zones akin to ventricular zones from which neuronal progenitors differentiate and migrate radially. Analyses of cerebral organoids thus far have been performed in sectioned tissue or in superficial layers due to their high scattering properties. Here, we demonstrate label-free three-photon imaging of whole, uncleared intact organoids (~2 mm depth) to assess early events of early human brain development. Optimizing a custom-made three-photon microscope to image intact cerebral organoids generated from Rett Syndrome patients, we show defects in the ventricular zone volumetric structure of mutant organoids compared to isogenic control organoids. Long-term imaging live organoids reveals that shorter migration distances and slower migration speeds of mutant radially migrating neurons are associated with more tortuous trajectories. Our label-free imaging system constitutes a particularly useful platform for tracking normal and abnormal development in individual organoids, as well as for screening therapeutic molecules via intact organoid imaging.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Manganese is a physiologically relevant TORC1 activator in yeast and mammals</a></h4>

              
                The essential biometal manganese (Mn) serves as a cofactor for several enzymes that are crucial for the prevention of human diseases. Whether intracellular Mn levels may be sensed and modulate intracellular signaling events has so far remained largely unexplored. The highly conserved target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1, mTORC1 in mammals) protein kinase requires divalent metal cofactors such as magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) to phosphorylate effectors as part of a homeostatic process that coordinates cell growth and metabolism with nutrient and/or growth factor availability. Here, our genetic approaches reveal that TORC1 activity is stimulated in vivo by elevated cytoplasmic Mn levels, which can be induced by loss of the Golgi-resident Mn<sup>2+</sup> transporter Pmr1 and which depend on the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (NRAMP) metal ion transporters Smf1 and Smf2. Accordingly, genetic interventions that increase cytoplasmic Mn<sup>2+</sup> levels antagonize the effects of rapamycin in triggering autophagy, mitophagy, and Rtg1-Rtg3-dependent mitochondrion-to-nucleus retrograde signaling. Surprisingly, our in vitro protein kinase assays uncovered that Mn<sup>2+</sup> activates TORC1 substantially better than Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which is primarily due to its ability to lower the K<sub>m</sub> for ATP, thereby allowing more efficient ATP coordination in the catalytic cleft of TORC1. These findings, therefore, provide both a mechanism to explain our genetic observations in yeast and a rationale for how fluctuations in trace amounts of Mn can become physiologically relevant. Supporting this notion, TORC1 is also wired to feedback control mechanisms that impinge on Smf1 and Smf2. Finally, we also show that Mn<sup>2+</sup>-mediated control of TORC1 is evolutionarily conserved in mammals, which may prove relevant for our understanding of the role of Mn in human diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ubiquitination drives COPI priming and Golgi SNARE localization</a></h4>

              
                Deciphering mechanisms controlling SNARE localization within the Golgi complex is crucial to understanding protein trafficking patterns within the secretory pathway. SNAREs are also thought to prime COPI assembly to ensure incorporation of these essential cargoes into vesicles, but the regulation of these events is poorly understood. Here we report roles for ubiquitin recognition by COPI in SNARE trafficking and in stabilizing interactions between Arf, COPI, and Golgi SNAREs in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. The ability of COPI to bind ubiquitin, but not the dilysine motif, through its N-terminal WD repeat domain of β'COP or through an unrelated ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) is essential for the proper localization of Golgi SNAREs Bet1 and Gos1. We find that COPI, the ArfGAP Glo3 and multiple Golgi SNAREs are ubiquitinated. Notably, the binding of Arf and COPI to Gos1 is markedly enhanced by ubiquitination of these components. Glo3 is proposed to prime COPI-SNARE interactions; however, Glo3 is not enriched in the ubiquitin-stabilized SNARE-Arf-COPI complex but is instead enriched with COPI complexes that lack SNAREs. These results support a new model for how posttranslational modifications drive COPI priming events crucial for Golgi SNARE localization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Heritability and cross-species comparisons of human cortical functional organization asymmetry</a></h4>

              
                The human cerebral cortex is symmetrically organized along large-scale axes but also presents inter-hemispheric differences in structure and function. The quantified contralateral homologous difference, i.e., asymmetry, is a key feature of the human brain left-right axis supporting functional processes, such as language. Here, we assessed whether the asymmetry of cortical functional organization is heritable and phylogenetically conserved between humans and macaques. Our findings indicate asymmetric organization along an axis describing a functional trajectory from perceptual/action to abstract cognition. Whereas language network showed leftward asymmetric organization, frontoparietal network showed rightward asymmetric organization in humans. These asymmetries were heritable in humans and showed a similar spatial distribution with macaques, in the case of intra-hemispheric asymmetry of functional hierarchy. This suggests (phylo)genetic conservation. However, both language and frontoparietal networks showed a qualitatively larger asymmetry in humans relative to macaques. Overall, our findings suggest a genetic basis for asymmetry in intrinsic functional organization, linked to higher-order cognitive functions uniquely developed in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">CXCR4high megakaryocytes regulate host-defense immunity against bacterial pathogens</a></h4>

              
                Megakaryocytes (MKs) continuously produce platelets to support hemostasis and form a niche for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance in the bone marrow. MKs are also involved in inflammation responses; however, the mechanism remains poorly understood. Using single-cell sequencing, we identified a CXCR4 highly expressed MK subpopulation, which exhibited both MK-specific and immune characteristics. CXCR4<sup>high</sup> MKs interacted with myeloid cells to promote their migration and stimulate the bacterial phagocytosis of macrophages and neutrophils by producing TNFα and IL-6. CXCR4<sup>high</sup> MKs were also capable of phagocytosis, processing and presenting antigens to activate T cells. Furthermore, CXCR4<sup>high</sup> MKs also egressed circulation and infiltrated into the spleen, liver, and lung upon bacterial infection. Ablation of MKs suppressed the innate immune response and T cell activation to impair the anti-bacterial effects in mice under the <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> challenge. Using hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell lineage-tracing mouse lines, we show that CXCR4<sup>high</sup> MKs were generated from infection-induced emergency megakaryopoiesis in response to bacterial infection. Overall, we identify the CXCR4<sup>high</sup> MKs, which regulate host-defense immune response against bacterial infection.

                The nitrogenase Fe protein mediates ATP-dependent electron transfer to the nitrogenase MoFe protein during nitrogen fixation, in addition to catalyzing MoFe protein independent substrate (CO<sub>2</sub>) reduction and facilitating MoFe protein metallocluster biosynthesis. The precise role(s) of the Fe protein Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> cluster in some of these processes remains ill-defined. Herein, we report crystallographic data demonstrating ATP-dependent chalcogenide exchange at the Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> cluster of the nitrogenase Fe protein when potassium selenocyanate is used as the selenium source, an unexpected result as the Fe protein cluster is not traditionally perceived as a site of substrate binding within nitrogenase. The observed chalcogenide exchange illustrates that this Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> cluster is capable of core substitution reactions under certain conditions, adding to the Fe protein's repertoire of unique properties.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Locally adaptive temperature response of vegetative growth in Arabidopsis thaliana</a></h4>

              
                We investigated early vegetative growth of natural <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> accessions in cold, nonfreezing temperatures, similar to temperatures these plants naturally encounter in fall at northern latitudes. We found that accessions from northern latitudes produced larger seedlings than accessions from southern latitudes, partly as a result of larger seed size. However, their subsequent vegetative growth when exposed to colder temperatures was slower. The difference was too large to be explained by random population differentiation, and is thus suggestive of local adaptation, a notion that is further supported by substantial transcriptome and metabolome changes in northern accessions. We hypothesize that the reduced growth of northern accessions is an adaptive response and a consequence of reallocating resources toward cold acclimation and winter survival.

                Opsin 3 (Opn3) is a light-sensitive protein present throughout the mammalian brain, although its functions in this organ are currently unknown. Since Opn3 encoded mRNA increases in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus in response to hyperosmotic stimuli, we have explored the role of Opn3 in this nucleus. By in situ hybridization, we have demonstrated that Opn3 is expressed in neurones expressing both arginine vasopressin and oxytocin in the rat SON, suggesting that OPN3 functions in both neuronal types. Gene profiling analysis by RNA-seq suggested that neuropeptide production is impaired when knocking down Opn3 in the rat SON, as confirmed by quantitative PCR and immunolabelling. Knocking down Opn3 in the rat SON altered physiological parameters including water intake, body temperature and motor activity. Altogether the data indicates that Opn3 in the SON is involved in the regulation of a number of neuropeptides and other proteins that participate in water homeostasis, body temperature and motor activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MISPEL: A deep learning approach for harmonizingmulti-scanner matched neuroimaging data</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale data obtained from the aggregation of already collected multi-site neuroimaging datasets has brought benefits such as higher statistical power, reliability, and robustness to the studies. Despite these promises from growth in sample size, substantial technical variability stemming from differences in scanner specifications exists in the aggregated data and could inadvertently bias any downstream analyses on it. Such a challenge calls for data normalization and/or harmonization frameworks, in addition to comprehensive criteria to estimate the scanner-related variability and evaluate the harmonization frameworks. In this study, we propose MISPEL (Multi-scanner Image harmonization via Structure Preserving Embedding Learning), a supervised multi-scanner harmonization method. Unlike existing techniques, MISPEL does not assume a perfect coregistration across the scans, and the framework is naturally extendable to more than two scanners. We also designed a set of comprehensive criteria to investigate the scanner-related technical variability and evaluate the harmonization techniques. As an essential requirement of our criteria, we introduced a multi-scanner matched dataset of four 3T MRI T1 images, which, to the best of our knowledge is the first dataset of its kind. We also investigated our evaluations using two popular segmentation frameworks: FSL and segmentation in statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Lastly, we compared MISPEL to popular methods of normalization and harmonization, namely White Stripe, RAVEL, and CALAMITI. MISPEL outperformed these methods and is promising for many other neuroimaging modalities.

                Development of the mammalian brain requires precisely controlled differentiation of neurons, glia, and nonneural cells. To investigate protein-level changes in these diverse cell types and their progenitors, we performed single-cell mass cytometry on whole brain (E11.5/E12.5) and microdissected telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon (E13.5-P4) collected at daily timepoints from C57/BL6 mice. Measuring 24,290,787 cells from 112 sample replicates with a 40-antibody panel, we quantified 85 molecularly distinct cell populations across embryonic and postnatal development, including microglia putatively phagocytosing neurites, neural cells, and myelin. Differentiation trajectory analysis also identified two separate pathways for producing oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Comparison with previous studies revealed considerable discrepancies between protein and mRNA abundances in the developing brain, demonstrating the value of protein-level measurements for identifying functional cell states. Overall, our findings demonstrate the utility of mass cytometry as a high-throughput, scalable platform for single-cell profiling of brain tissue.

                The relationships between microglia and macrophages, especially their lineage segregation outside the yolk sac, have been recently explored, providing a model in which a conversion from macrophages seeds microglia during brain development. However, spatiotemporal evidence to support such microglial seeding and to explain how it occurs has not been obtained. By cell tracking via slice culture, intravital imaging, and Flash tag-mediated labeling, we found that a group of intraventricular macrophages belonging to border-associated macrophages (BAMs), which were abundantly observed along the inner surface of the mouse cerebral wall at embryonic day 12, frequently entered the brain wall. Immunohistochemistry of the tracked cells showed that postinfiltrative BAMs acquired microglial properties while losing a macrophage phenotype. We also found that the intraventricular BAMs were supplied transepithelially from the roof plate. Thus, this study demonstrates that the ''roof plate[-&gt;]ventricle[-&gt;]cerebral wall'' route is an essential path for microglial colonization into the embryonic mouse brain.

                Human behavior and cognitive function correlate with complex patterns of spatio-temporal brain dynamics, which can be simulated using computational models with different degrees of biophysical realism. We used a data-driven optimization algorithm to determine and classify the types of local dynamics that enable the reproduction of different observables derived from functional magnetic resonance recordings. The phase space analysis of the resulting equations revealed a predominance of stable spiral attractors, which optimized the similarity with the empirical data in terms of the synchronization, metastability, and functional connectivity dynamics. For stable limit cycles, departures from harmonic oscillations improved the fit in terms of functional connectivity dynamics. Eigenvalue analyses showed that the proximity to Hopf bifurcations improved the accuracy of the simulation for wakefulness, while deep sleep was associated with increased stability. Our results provide testable predictions that constrain the landscape of suitable biophysical models, while supporting noise-driven dynamics close to a bifurcation as a canonical mechanism underlying the complex fluctuations that characterize endogenous brain activity.

                Timing plays a critical role in signaling throughout the nervous system. Signaling times vary widely depending on distance and speed, and timing delays influence circuit computations such as coincidence detection, synaptic integration, entrainment, temporal summation, and plasticity. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are a major type of inhibitory neuron with critical roles throughout the brain. Their rapid-spiking characteristics enable them to control the dynamics of neural circuits across a range of time scales. However, little is known about the factors that determine the timing of their synaptic inputs. Here, we measured the conduction velocity (CV) of excitatory axons that target PV interneurons in mouse primary somatosensory cortex. Using a genetically-encoded hybrid voltage sensor (hVOS) targeted to PV interneurons, we clocked the arrival of excitatory synaptic inputs with sub-millisecond precision in large numbers of cells across multiple layers. Arrival times varied with distance, allowing us to determine the CV of the excitatory axons. Values ranged from 28-241 m/msec across layers 2-5, and interlaminar CV was about twice as fast as intralaminar CV. This will enable more rapid computation within columns, while integration between columns will be slower. hVOS imaging from specific cell types offers a unique opportunity to investigate conduction in axons defined by their targets.

                Deep brain stimulation of subcallosal cingulate white matter (SCCwm-DBS) alleviates symptoms of treatment resistant depression (TRD) over months of therapy. Readouts of depression symptom severity derived from neural recordings are needed for more systematic study and improvement of the therapy. In this study, we measured local field potentials (LFP) multiple times a day alongside seven months of therapy using the Activa PC+S in six patients treated with SCCwm-DBS. We found significant changes in oscillatory power between early and late therapy after accounting for stimulation-related distortions, particularly within the {beta} band. We then used a decoder strategy to identify oscillatory activity that tracked with depression measurements over seven months, with asymmetric {delta} and {beta} oscillations contributing to a statistically significant prediction of 10% of the measured depression signal. Simulating its use in clinical decision-making, we demonstrated that the DR-SCC yield clinically meaningful information that can augment other measures of depression state. Ultimately, this DR-SCC provides a data-driven first-step towards objectively tracking chronic recovery after antidepressant DBS implantation and developing adaptive DBS strategies in the presence of active stimulation.

                Spatial frequency (SF) is an important attribute in the visual scene and is a defining feature of visual processing channels. However, there remains many unsolved questions about how primate visual cortex, in particular extrastriate areas V2 and V4, codes this fundamental information. Here, using intrinsic signal optical imaging in visual cortex of Macaque monkeys, we quantify the relationship between spatial frequency maps and (1) visual topography, (2) color and orientation maps, and (3) across visual areas V1, V2, and V4. We find that in orientation regions, low to high spatial frequency is mapped orthogonally to orientation; however, in color regions, which is reported to contain orthogonal axes of color and lightness, only low spatial frequencies are represented without a gradient of SF representation. This produces the first observation of a population spatial frequency fluctuation related to the repeating color/orientation organizations. These findings support a generalized hypercolumn model across cortical areas, comprised of two orthogonal parameters with additional parameters.

                Approach-avoidance conflict (AAC) arises from decisions with embedded positive and negative outcomes, and appropriate management of these decisions is essential for adaptive functioning. However, translating key advances on AAC in non-human primates to tasks in humans has proven difficult in part due to the inherent limitations in existing human tasks in isolating relevant neural substrates of behavior. Here, we present, and validate, a novel task in humans (N= 38) of both sexes, derived from work in non-human primates utilizing primary reinforcers (shock/juice), and in doing so identify neural features specific to conflict, implementing a computational model of task behavior. We found that neural patterns of activation within the parietal, frontal, temporal and cingulate regions were associated with conflict-specific avoidance behavior. Importantly, a number of these regions were associated with trait anxiety, implicating a potential link between these neural regions and anxiety-driven avoidance behavior. This task platform may help advance both behavioral and biological research examining the neural patterning underlying approach-avoidance behavior in humans, providing an empirically oriented framework with which to translate between non-human primate and human work.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Loss of aquaporin-4 results in glymphatic system dysfunction via brain-wide interstitial fluid stagnation</a></h4>

              
                The glymphatic system is a fluid transport network of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) entering the brain along arterial perivascular spaces, exchanging with interstitial fluid (ISF), ultimately establishing directional clearance of interstitial solutes. CSF transport is facilitated by the expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels on the perivascular endfeet of astrocytes. Mice with genetic deletion of AQP4 (AQP4 KO) exhibit abnormalities in the brain structure and molecular water transport. Yet, no studies have systematically examined how these abnormalities in structure and water transport correlate with glymphatic function. Here we used high-resolution 3D magnetic resonance (MR) non-contrast cisternography, diffusion-weighted MR imaging (MR-DWI) along with intravoxel-incoherent motion (IVIM) DWI, while evaluating glymphatic function using a standard dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging to better understand how water transport and glymphatic function is disrupted after genetic deletion of AQP4. AQP4 KO mice had larger interstitial spaces and total brain volumes resulting in higher water content and reduced CSF space volumes, despite similar CSF production rates and vascular density compared to wildtype mice. The larger interstitial fluid volume likely resulted in increased slow but not fast MR diffusion scores and coincided with reduced glymphatic influx. This markedly altered brain fluid transport in AQP4 KO mice may result from a reduction in glymphatic clearance, leading to stagnation of ISF movement and enlargement of the interstitial space. Overall, diffusion MR is a useful tool to evaluate glymphatic function and may serve as valuable translational biomarker to study glymphatics in human disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional integrity of visual coding following advanced photoreceptor degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Photoreceptor degeneration sufficient to produce severe visual loss often spares the inner retina. This raises the hope that treatments using optogenetics or electrical stimulation, which generate a replacement light input signal in surviving neurons, may restore vision. The success of these approaches is dependent on the capacity of surviving circuits in the early stages of the visual system to generate and propagate an appropriate visual code in the face of neuroanatomical remodelling. To determine the capacity of surviving circuits in advanced retinal degeneration to present an appropriate visual code, we generated a transgenic mouse expressing the optogenetic actuator ReaChR in ON bipolar cells (second order neurons in the visual projection). After crossing this with the rd1 model of photoreceptor degeneration, we compared ReaChR derived responses with photoreceptor-driven responses in wildtype (WT) mice in retinal ganglion cells and visual thalamus. The ReaChR-driven responses in rd1 animals showed low photosensitivity, but in other respects generated a visual code that was very similar to WT. Furthermore, ReaChR rd1 units in the retina had high response reproducibility and showed sensitivity normalisation to code contrast stably across different background intensities. At the single unit level, ReaChR-derived responses exhibited broadly similar variation in light response polarity, contrast sensitivity and temporal frequency tuning as WT. Units from WT and ReaChR rd1 mice clustered together when subjected to unsupervised community detection based on stimulus-response properties. Our data reveal an impressive ability for surviving circuitry to recreate a rich visual code following advanced retinal degeneration and are promising for regenerative medicine in the central nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Linguistic speech processing decreases with advancing age</a></h4>

              
                Background: Older adults process speech differently, but it is not yet clear how aging affects different levels of processing natural, continuous speech, both in terms of bottom-up acoustic analysis and top-down generation of linguistic-based predictions. We studied natural speech processing across the adult lifespan via EEG measurements of neural tracking. Goals: Our goals are to analyze the unique contribution of linguistic speech processing across the adult lifespan using natural speech, while controlling for the influence of acoustic processing. In particular, we focus on changes in spatial and temporal activation patterns in response to natural speech across the lifespan. Methods: 52 normal-hearing adults between 17 and 82 years of age listened to a naturally spoken story while the EEG signal was recorded. We investigated the effect of age on acoustic and linguistic processing of speech. Because age correlated with hearing capacity and measures of cognition, we investigated whether the observed age effect is mediated by these factors. Furthermore, we investigated whether there is an effect of age on hemisphere lateralization and on spatiotemporal patterns of the neural responses. Results: Our EEG results showed that linguistic speech processing declines with advancing age. Moreover, as age increased, the neural response latency to certain aspects of linguistic speech processing increased. Also acoustic neural tracking decreased with increasing age but in contrast to linguistic processing, older subjects showed shorter latencies for early acoustic responses to speech. No evidence was found for hemispheric lateralization in neither younger nor older adults during linguistic speech processing. Most of the observed aging effects on acoustic and linguistic processing were not explained by age-related decline in hearing capacity or cognition. However, our results suggest that the effect of increasing neural response latency with age for word-level linguistic processing is likely more due to an age-related decline in cognition than a robust effect of age. Conclusion: Spatial and temporal characteristics of the neural responses to continuous speech change across the adult lifespan for both acoustic and linguistic speech processing. These are most likely explained by compensation mechanisms that occur during healthy aging. Traces of this compensation mechanism are reported as modifications in the neural response to acoustic and linguistic speech characteristics in terms of spatial and temporal differences, suggesting structural and functional changes. Additionally, different frontal patterns were observed for linguistic processing, suggesting that older adults recruit additional frontal brain regions to compensate for the age-related decline.

                Tractography is widely used in human studies of connectivity with respect to every brain region, function, and is explored developmentally, in adulthood, aging, and in disease. However, the core issue of how to systematically threshold, taking into account the inherent differences in connectivity values for different track lengths, and to do this in a comparable way across studies has not been solved. The study adopted Monte Carlo derived distance-dependent distributions (DDDs) to generate distance-dependent thresholds with various levels of alpha for connections of varying lengths. As a test case, we applied the DDD approach to generate a language connectome. The resulting connectome showed expected short- and long-distance structural connectivity in the close and distant regions within the language network. The finding demonstrates that the DDD approach can be used for both individual and group thresholding. Critically, it offers a standard method that can be applied to various probabilistic tracking datasets.

                Using cross-experiment multivariate classification of EEG patterns, in a recent study we found evidence for a shared familiarity signal for faces, patterns of neural activity that successfully separate trials for familiar and unfamiliar faces across participants and modes of familiarization. Here, our aim was to expand upon this research to further characterize the spatio-temporal properties of this signal. By utilizing the information content present for incidental exposure to personally familiar and unfamiliar faces, we tested how the information content in the neural signal unfolds over time under different task demands - giving truthful or deceptive responses to photographs of genuinely familiar and unfamiliar individuals. For this goal, we re-analyzed data from two previously published experiments using within-experiment leave-one-subject-out and cross-experiment classification of face familiarity. We observed that the general face familiarity signal, consistent with its previously described spatio-temporal properties, is present for long-term personally familiar faces under passive viewing, as well as for acknowledged and concealed familiarity responses. Also, central-posterior regions contain information related to deception. We propose that signals in the 200-400 ms window are modulated by top-down task-related anticipation, while the patterns in the 400-600 ms window are influenced by conscious effort to deceive. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the representational dynamics of concealed knowledge for faces.

                Interoception is the sensation, perception, and control of signals from within the body. It has been associated with a broad range of physiological and psychological processes. Further, interoceptive variables are related to specific regions and networks in the human brain. However, it is not clear whether or how these networks relate empirically to different domains of physiological and psychological health at the population level. We analysed a dataset of 19 020 individuals (10 055 females, 8 965 males; mean age: 63 years, age range: 45-81 years), who have participated in the UK Biobank Study, a very large scale prospective epidemiological health study. Using canonical correlation analysis (CCA), allowing for the examination of associations between two sets of variables, we related the functional connectome of brain regions implicated in interoception to a selection of non-imaging health and lifestyle related phenotypes, exploring their relationship within modes of population co-variation. In one integrated and data driven analysis, we obtained four statistically significant modes. Modes could be categorised into domains of affect and cardiovascular health, breathing, obesity, and subjective health (all p < 0.0001) and were meaningfully associated with distinct neural circuits. Circuits represent specific neural 'fingerprints' of functional domains and set the scope for future studies on the neurobiology of interoceptive involvement in different lifestyle and health related phenotypes. Therefore, our research contributes to the conceptualisation of interoception and may lead to a better understanding of co-morbid conditions in the light of shared interoceptive structures.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perinatal correlated retinal activity is required for the wiring of visual axons in non-image forming nuclei</a></h4>

              
                The formation of the visual system is a complex multistep process that includes proper assembly between retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon terminals and their relay neurons in the different visual nuclei of the brain. RGC axons reach the main image-forming nuclei (IFN) --the superior colliculus and the lateral geniculate nucleus-- at perinatal stages and extensively arborize to then refine throughout the first postnatal weeks. Spontaneous activity generated in the immature retina plays an essential role in the fine tune refinement of exhuberant axonal arborizations but the molecular mechanisms underlying this activity-dependent remodeling process remain poorly characterized. RGC axons, in addition to innervate IFN, target non-image forming nuclei (NIFN), but the impact of spontaneous retinal activity in the development of these accessory nuclei has not yet been described. Here, by genetically altering spontaneous activity in the RGCs of mice we demonstrate that correlated retinal activity also shapes the connectivity of the non-image forming circuit and identify the transcriptional programs modulating this process. Together, our data contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms ruling activity-dependent axon refining in the building of visual circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perceptual warping exposes categorical representations for speech in human brainstem responses</a></h4>

              
                The brain transforms continuous acoustic events into discrete category representations to downsample the speech signal for our perceptual-cognitive systems. Such phonetic categories are highly malleable and heir percepts can change depending on surrounding stimulus context. Previous work suggests these acoustic-phonetic mapping and perceptual warping of speech emerge in the brain no earlier than auditory cortex. Here, we examined whether these auditory-category phenomena inherent to speech perception occur even earlier in the human brain, at the level of auditory brainstem. We recorded speech-evoked frequency following responses (FFRs) during a task designed to induce more/less warping of listeners' perceptual categories depending on stimulus presentation order of a speech continuum (random, forward, backward directions). We used a novel clustered stimulus paradigm to rapidly record the high trial counts needed for FFRs concurrent with active behavioral tasks. We found serial stimulus order caused perceptual shifts (hysteresis) near listeners' category boundary confirming identical speech tokens are perceived differentially depending on stimulus context. Critically, we further show neural FFRs during active (but not passive) listening are enhanced for prototypical vs. category-ambiguous tokens and are biased in the direction of listeners' phonetic label even for acoustically-identical speech stimuli. Our data expose FFRs carry category-level information and suggest top-down processing actively shapes the neural encoding and categorization of speech at subcortical levels. These findings suggest the acoustic-phonetic mapping and perceptual warping in speech perception occur surprisingly early along the auditory neuroaxis, which might aid understanding by reducing ambiguity inherent to the speech signal.

	<p>The modeling procedure of current biological neuron models is hindered by either hyperparameter optimization or overparameterization, which limits their application to a variety of biologically realistic tasks. This article proposes a novel neuron model called the Regularized Spectral Spike Response Model (RSSRM) to address these issues. The selection of hyperparameters is avoided by the model structure and fitting strategy, while the number of parameters is constrained by regularization techniques. Twenty firing simulation experiments indicate the superiority of RSSRM. In particular, after pruning more than 99% of its parameters, RSSRM with 100 parameters achieves an RMSE of 5.632 in membrane potential prediction, a VRD of 47.219, and an F1-score of 0.95 in spike train forecasting with correct timing (&amp;amp;plusmn;1.4 ms), which are 25%, 99%, 55%, and 24% better than the average of other neuron models with the same number of parameters in RMSE, VRD, F1-score, and correct timing, respectively. Moreover, RSSRM with 100 parameters achieves a memory use of 10 KB and a runtime of 1 ms during inference, which is more efficient than the Izhikevich model.</p>

	<p>Background: Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) patients who receive deep brain stimulation (DBS) have a higher risk of postoperative pain, which will affect their postoperative quality of recovery (QoR). Scalp nerve block (SNB) and intercostal nerve block (ICNB) can alleviate postoperative pain, yet their effect on postoperative QoR in PD patients has proven to be unclear. Therefore, we have aimed to explore the effect of SNB paired with ICNB on postoperative QoR. Methods: To explore the effect, we have designed a randomized controlled trial in which 88 patients with PD will be randomly assigned to either an SNB group or control group, receiving either SNB combined with ICNB or without before surgery. The primary outcome will be a 15-item QoR score at 24 h after surgery. The secondary outcomes will include: 15-item QoR scores at 72 h and 1 month after surgery; the numeric rating scale pain scores before discharge from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) at 24 h, 72 h, and 1 month after surgery; rescue analgesics; nausea and vomiting 24 h after operation and remifentanil consumption during operation; emergence agitation; the duration of anesthesia and surgery; time to respiratory recovery, time to response, and time to extubation; the PACU length of stay; as well as adverse events. Proposed protocol and conclusion: Our findings will provide a novel method for the management of recovery and acute pain after DBS in PD patients. This research was registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT05353764 on 19 April 2022.</p>

	<p>Upper limb sensory processing deficits are common in the chronic phase after stroke and are associated with decreased functional performance. Yet, current clinical assessments show suboptimal psychometric properties. Our aim was to develop and validate a novel robot-based assessment of sensory processing. We assessed 60 healthy participants and 20 participants with chronic stroke using existing clinical and robot-based assessments of sensorimotor function. In addition, sensory processing was evaluated with a new evaluation protocol, using a bimanual planar robot, through passive or active exploration, reproduction and identification of 15 geometrical shapes. The discriminative validity of this novel assessment was evaluated by comparing the performance between healthy participants and participants with stroke, and the convergent validity was evaluated by calculating the correlation coefficients with existing assessments for people with stroke. The results showed that participants with stroke showed a significantly worse sensory processing ability than healthy participants (passive condition: p = 0.028, Hedges&amp;amp;rsquo; g = 0.58; active condition: p = 0.012, Hedges&amp;amp;rsquo; g = 0.73), as shown by the less accurate reproduction and identification of shapes. The novel assessment showed moderate to high correlations with the tactile discrimination test: a sensitive clinical assessment of sensory processing (r = 0.52&amp;amp;ndash;0.71). We conclude that the novel robot-based sensory processing assessment shows good discriminant and convergent validity for use in participants with chronic stroke.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>After unilateral lesion of the medial forebrain bundle by 6-OHDA rats exhibit lateralized deficits in spontaneous behavior or apomorphine-induced rotations. We investigated whether such lateralization is attenuated by either deep brain stimulation (DBS) or glutamatergic neurotransmission in the inferior colliculus (IC) of Wistar rats. Intracollicular DBS did not affect spontaneous lateralization but attenuated apomorphine-induced rotations. Spontaneous lateralization disappeared after either the glutamatergic antagonist MK-801 or the agonist NMDA microinjections into the IC. Apomorphine-induced rotations were potentiated by MK-801 but were not affected by NMDA intracollicular microinjection. After injecting a bidirectional neural tract tracer into the IC, cell bodies and/or axonal fibers were found in the periaqueductal gray matter, superior colliculus, substantia nigra, cuneiform nucleus, and pedunculo-pontine tegmental nucleus, suggesting the involvement of these structures in the motor improvement after IC manipulation. Importantly, the side of the IC microinjection regarding the lesion (ipsilateral or contralateral) is particularly important, and this effect may not involve the neostriatum directly.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Altered lipoprotein metabolism is considered a pathogenic component of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), a major high-density lipoprotein (HDL) protein, is associated with prevention of vascular damage. However, ApoA1&rsquo;s effects on damaged endothelium in ALS are unknown. This study aimed to determine therapeutic potential of ApoA1 for endothelial cell (EC) repair under a pathologic condition reminiscent of ALS. We performed <I>in vitro</I> studies using mouse brain ECs (mBECs) exposed to plasma from symptomatic G93A SOD1 mice. Dosage effects of ApoA1, including inhibition of the phosphoinoside 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway and integration of ApoA1 into mBECs were examined. Also, human bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (hBM-EPCs) and mBECs were co-cultured without cell contact to establish therapeutic mechanism of hBM-EPC transplantation. Results showed that ApoA1 significantly reduced mBEC death via the PI3K/Akt downstream signaling pathway. Also, ApoA1 was incorporated into mBECs as confirmed by blocked ApoA1 cellular integration. Co-culture system provided evidence that ApoA1 was secreted by hBM-EPCs and incorporated into injured mBECs. Thus, our study findings provide important evidence for ApoA1 as a potential novel therapeutic for endothelium protection in ALS. This <I>in vitro</I> study lays the groundwork for further <I>in vivo</I> research to fully determine therapeutic effects of ApoA1 in ALS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Gestational Buprenorphine Exposure Disrupts Dopamine Neuron Activity and Related Behaviors in Adulthood</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Opioid misuse among pregnant women is rapidly increasing in the United States. The number of maternal opioid-related diagnoses increased by 131% in the last 10 years, resulting in an increased number of infants exposed to opioids <I>in utero</I> and a subsequent increase in infants developing neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). The most prescribed treatment to combat maternal opioid use disorder is buprenorphine, a partial &mu;-opioid receptor agonist and -opioid receptor antagonist. Buprenorphine treatment effectively reduces NAS but has been associated with disrupted cortical development and neurodevelopmental consequences in childhood. Less is known about the long-term neurodevelopmental consequences following buprenorphine exposure <I>in utero</I>. Previous research has shown that gestational buprenorphine exposure can induce anxiety-like and depressive-like phenotypes in adult rats, suggesting that exposure to buprenorphine <I>in utero</I> may render individuals more susceptible to psychiatric illness in adulthood. A common pathology observed across multiple psychiatric illnesses is dopamine system dysfunction. Here, we administered the highly-abused opioid, oxycodone (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or a therapeutic used to treat opioid use disorder, buprenorphine (1 mg/kg, i.p) to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats from gestational day 11 through 21, then examined neurophysiological alterations in the mesolimbic dopamine system and dopamine-dependent behaviors in adult offspring. We found that gestational exposure to buprenorphine or oxycodone increases dopamine neuron activity in adulthood. Moreover, prenatal buprenorphine exposure disrupts the afferent regulation of dopamine neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Taken together, we posit that gestational buprenorphine or oxycodone exposure can have profound effects on the mesolimbic dopamine system in adulthood.</p>

                Background: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the education sector around the world. In order to control the spread of the virus, eLearning practice has been introduced in Saudi higher education. Such online communication has become an important tool to narrow the teaching practice gap. This study assessed the characteristics of eLearning and distance learning and the inclination of Imam Abdulrahman BinFaisal University (IAU) faculty members in terms of skills, and managing classes and tests using online learning tools. Methods: A QuestionPro questionnaire with 22 questions on eLearning experience, training experience, and skills and knowledge in the educational process of IAU teaching faculty was conducted through the online university e-mail domain. The questionnaire was sent to the IAU’s teaching faculty. The questionnaire’s reliability was studied using Cronbach’s a coefficient. The criterion value was statistically studied using the KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) and Bartlett’s test. The variables associated with the present survey model were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Results: The study showed positive responses and readiness (skills and abilities) and the effectiveness of IAU’s faculty members to perform e-learning activities during COVID-19. IAU faculty received a strong positive response, and the respondents were also impressed with and agreed on trainer knowledge, session management, communication and expertise on training topics. Conclusions: The positive response indicates the readiness of IAU to provide the necessary support (tools, information and updates) required for a successful online educational process.

                We present a case report of a four-year-old girl with stiff skin syndrome associated with bone involvement at the femoral head. She presented with thickness of the skin of the trunk and limbs, noted from the age of one year. This was associated with hypertrichosis and reduced joint mobility of the left lower extremity. The patient received physiotherapeutic treatments and underwent orthopedic examinations. A diagnosis of stiff skin syndrome should be considered in infants and children with thick skin, particularly if there is associated hypertrichosis. Important differentials to rule out include generalized morphea and systemic sclerosis. In this piece, we share insight on how a young girl with stiff skin syndrome associated with bone involvement at the femoral head presented and was managed in a rural tertiary health facility despite resource constraints.

                The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought the world’s attention to the gendered impacts of health emergencies of women. This offers a critical opportunity to advance our understanding of the gendered impacts of healthcare and to improve health outcomes for women around the world. However, to do so we need to be mindful of five future challenges: 1. the continued impact of COVID-19; 2. attacks on women’s health and the need for gender equality; 3. understanding women’s health needs everyday, not just during emergencies; 4. not seeing female leadership as a quick fix; and 5. holding global institutions to account.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Binding mechanism of oseltamivir and influenza neuraminidase suggests perspectives for the design of new anti-influenza drugs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jiaye Tao, Heping Wang, Wenjian Wang, Na Mi, Wei Zhang, Qiujia Wen, Jiajing Ouyang, Xinyun Liang, Min Chen, Wentao Guo, Guoming Li, Jun Liu, Hanning Zhao, Xin Wang, Xuemeng Li, Shengjun Feng, Xinguang Liu, Zhiwei He, Zuguo Zhao</p>

Oseltamivir is a widely used influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor that prevents the release of new virus particles from host cells. However, oseltamivir-resistant strains have emerged, but effective drugs against them have not yet been developed. Elucidating the binding mechanisms between NA and oseltamivir may provide valuable information for the design of new drugs against NA mutants resistant to oseltamivir. Here, we conducted large-scale (353.4 μs) free-binding molecular dynamics simulations, together with a Markov State Model and an importance-sampling algorithm, to reveal the binding process of oseltamivir and NA. Ten metastable states and five major binding pathways were identified that validated and complemented previously discovered binding pathways, including the hypothesis that oseltamivir can be transferred from the secondary sialic acid binding site to the catalytic site. The discovery of multiple new metastable states, especially the stable bound state containing a water-mediated hydrogen bond between Arg118 and oseltamivir, may provide new insights into the improvement of NA inhibitors. We anticipated the findings presented here will facilitate the development of drugs capable of combating NA mutations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cheater suppression and stochastic clearance through quorum sensing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander S. Moffett, Peter J. Thomas, Michael Hinczewski, Andrew W. Eckford</p>

The evolutionary consequences of quorum sensing in regulating bacterial cooperation are not fully understood. In this study, we reveal unexpected effects of regulating public good production through quorum sensing on bacterial population dynamics, showing that quorum sensing can be a collectively harmful alternative to unregulated production. We analyze a birth-death model of bacterial population dynamics accounting for public good production and the presence of non-producing cheaters. Our model demonstrates that when demographic noise is a factor, the consequences of controlling public good production according to quorum sensing depend on the cost of public good production and the growth rate of populations in the absence of public goods. When public good production is inexpensive, quorum sensing is a destructive alternative to unconditional production, in terms of the mean population extinction time. When costs are higher, quorum sensing becomes a constructive strategy for the producing strain, both stabilizing cooperation and decreasing the risk of population extinction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Physiological characterization of electrodermal activity enables scalable near real-time autonomic nervous system activation inference</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rafiul Amin, Rose T. Faghih</p>

Electrodermal activities (EDA) are any electrical phxenomena observed on the skin. Skin conductance (SC), a measure of EDA, shows fluctuations due to autonomic nervous system (ANS) activation induced sweat secretion. Since it can capture psychophysiological information, there is a significant rise in the research work for tracking mental and physiological health with EDA. However, the current state-of-the-art lacks a physiologically motivated approach for real-time inference of ANS activation from EDA. Therefore, firstly, we propose a comprehensive model for the SC dynamics. The proposed model is a 3D state-space representation of the direct secretion of sweat via pore opening and diffusion followed by corresponding evaporation and reabsorption. As the input to the model, we consider a sparse signal representing the ANS activation that causes the sweat glands to produce sweat. Secondly, we derive a scalable fixed-interval smoother-based sparse recovery approach utilizing the proposed comprehensive model to infer the ANS activation enabling edge computation. We incorporate a generalized-cross-validation to tune the sparsity level. Finally, we propose an Expectation-Maximization based deconvolution approach for learning the model parameters during the ANS activation inference. For evaluation, we utilize a dataset with 26 participants, and the results show that our comprehensive state-space model can successfully describe the SC variations with high scalability, showing the feasibility of real-time applications. Results validate that our physiology-motivated state-space model can comprehensively explain the EDA and outperforms all previous approaches. Our findings introduce a whole new perspective and have a broader impact on the standard practices of EDA analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferring the nature of linguistic computations in the brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sanne Ten Oever, Karthikeya Kaushik, Andrea E. Martin</p>

Sentences contain structure that determines their meaning beyond that of individual words. An influential study by Ding and colleagues (2016) used frequency tagging of phrases and sentences to show that the human brain is sensitive to structure by finding peaks of neural power at the rate at which structures were presented. Since then, there has been a rich debate on how to best explain this pattern of results with profound impact on the language sciences. Models that use hierarchical structure building, as well as models based on associative sequence processing, can predict the neural response, creating an inferential impasse as to which class of models explains the nature of the linguistic computations reflected in the neural readout. In the current manuscript, we discuss pitfalls and common fallacies seen in the conclusions drawn in the literature illustrated by various simulations. We conclude that inferring the neural operations of sentence processing based on these neural data, and any like it, alone, is insufficient. We discuss how to best evaluate models and how to approach the modeling of neural readouts to sentence processing in a manner that remains faithful to cognitive, neural, and linguistic principles.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Genome-wide functional analysis reveals key roles for kinesins in the mammalian and mosquito stages of the malaria parasite life cycle</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohammad Zeeshan, Ravish Rashpa, David J. P. Ferguson, Steven Abel, Zeinab Chahine, Declan Brady, Sue Vaughan, Carolyn A. Moores, Karine G. Le Roch, Mathieu Brochet, Anthony A. Holder, Rita Tewari</p>

Kinesins are microtubule (MT)-based motors important in cell division, motility, polarity, and intracellular transport in many eukaryotes. However, they are poorly studied in the divergent eukaryotic pathogens <i>Plasmodium</i> spp., the causative agents of malaria, which manifest atypical aspects of cell division and plasticity of morphology throughout the life cycle in both mammalian and mosquito hosts. Here, we describe a genome-wide screen of <i>Plasmodium</i> kinesins, revealing diverse subcellular locations and functions in spindle assembly, axoneme formation, and cell morphology. Surprisingly, only kinesin-13 is essential for growth in the mammalian host while the other 8 kinesins are required during the proliferative and invasive stages of parasite transmission through the mosquito vector. In-depth analyses of kinesin-13 and kinesin-20 revealed functions in MT dynamics during apical cell polarity formation, spindle assembly, and axoneme biogenesis. These findings help us to understand the importance of MT motors and may be exploited to discover new therapeutic interventions against malaria.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Neural responses in human superior temporal cortex support coding of voice representations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kyle Rupp, Jasmine L. Hect, Madison Remick, Avniel Ghuman, Bharath Chandrasekaran, Lori L. Holt, Taylor J. Abel</p>

The ability to recognize abstract features of voice during auditory perception is an intricate feat of human audition. For the listener, this occurs in near-automatic fashion to seamlessly extract complex cues from a highly variable auditory signal. Voice perception depends on specialized regions of auditory cortex, including superior temporal gyrus (STG) and superior temporal sulcus (STS). However, the nature of voice encoding at the cortical level remains poorly understood. We leverage intracerebral recordings across human auditory cortex during presentation of voice and nonvoice acoustic stimuli to examine voice encoding at the cortical level in 8 patient-participants undergoing epilepsy surgery evaluation. We show that voice selectivity increases along the auditory hierarchy from supratemporal plane (STP) to the STG and STS. Results show accurate decoding of vocalizations from human auditory cortical activity even in the complete absence of linguistic content. These findings show an early, less-selective temporal window of neural activity in the STG and STS followed by a sustained, strongly voice-selective window. Encoding models demonstrate divergence in the encoding of acoustic features along the auditory hierarchy, wherein STG/STS responses are best explained by voice category and acoustics, as opposed to acoustic features of voice stimuli alone. This is in contrast to neural activity recorded from STP, in which responses were accounted for by acoustic features. These findings support a model of voice perception that engages categorical encoding mechanisms within STG and STS to facilitate feature extraction.

                The global market of a total 42.4 billion US dollars of ornamental plants owes its worth to the color and fragrance associated with these plants. A lot of work has been done to understand the physiological, biochemical, genetic, and environmental factors responsible for the development of color and fragrance in flowers. The aim of these studies about the floral biology was to achieve the desired characters by manipulating all these factors to fulfill the changing demand of the global market. While, modifying flower color and fragrance, scientists moved from the traditional breeding methods to the comparatively modern genetic engineering techniques, yet limitations in results always remained a big issue for researchers. However, genome editing tools look promising to achieve the desired level of efficiency to modify the color and fragrance in the flowers. This review gives insight into the significance of floral characters, molecular factors responsible for these characters and applications of modern genome editing technologies for desirable modification.

                Background: Gaining a better understanding of molecular alterations in the pathogenesis of lung cancer reveals a significant change in approach to the management and prognosis of lung cancer. Several oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have been identified and have different roles related to survival rates in lung cancer patients. This study aims to determine the role of KRAS, EGFR, and TP53 mutations in the survival rate of lung cancer patients in the population of North Sumatra. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study involving 108 subjects diagnosed with lung cancer from histopathology specimens. DNA extractions were performed using FFPE followed by PCR examinations for assessing the expressions of EGFR, RAS, and TP53 protein. Sequencing analysis was carried out to determine the mutations of EGFR exon 19 and 21, RAS protein exon 2, and TP53 exon 5-6 and 8-9. Data input and analysis were conducted using statistical analysis software for Windows. The survival rate analysis was presented with Kaplan Meier. Results: 52 subjects completed all procedures in this study. Most of the subjects are male (75%), above 60 years old (53.8%), heavy smokers (75%), and suffer from adenocarcinoma type of lung cancer (69.2%). No subjects showed KRAS exon 2 mutations. Overall survival rates increased in patients with EGFR mutations (15 months compared to 8 months; p=0.001) and decreased in patients with TP53 mutations (7 months compared to 9 months; p=0.148). Also, there was increasing Progression-Free Survival in patients with EGFR mutations (6 months compared to 3 months) (p=0.19) and decreasing PFS in patients with TP53 mutations (3 months compared to 6 months) (p=0.07). Conclusions: There were no KRAS mutations in this study. EGFR mutations showed a higher survival rate, while TP53 mutations showed a lower survival rate in overall survival and progression-free survival.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The genomic and clinical features of the COVID-19 Omicron variant: a narrative review [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Since late November 2021, the Omicron variant has emerged as the primary cause of COVID-19 and caused a huge increase in the reported incidence around the world. To date, 32-34 spike mutations have been reported to be present in the Omicron variant, 15 of which were located in the receptor-binding domain that interacts with the cell surface of the host cells, while the rest were located in the N-terminal domain and around the furin cleavage site. Recent studies have suggested that those mutations could have a major role in the transmissibility and pathogenicity of the Omicron variant. Additionally, some mutations might contribute to the change of viral tropism of this novel variant. Here, we aim to discuss the recent reports on the transmissibility and severity of the Omicron variant from both the genetic and clinical perspectives. Afterward, we also take the chance to deliver our personal view on the topic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The burden of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations among Vietnamese women and their associated factors: A protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: BReast CAncer gene (BRCA)1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers are frequently provided genetic counselling. A precise estimation of the prevalence of BRCA gene mutations is essential to provide an appropriate risk prediction. However, the data in Vietnam is ambiguous and include unreliable risk factors from individual studies. Hence, the objective of this protocol is to provide a method to synthesize evidence pertaining to the proportion of BRCA mutations among Vietnamese women and their risk factors for cancer. Methods: PRISMA-P was followed in developing and reporting this protocol. From the databases' inception until June 2023, a comprehensive search will be undertaken in electronic PubMed and Scopus databases. In two stages, title/abstract screening and full-text screening, two independent authors will assess all retrieved articles for inclusion. This review includes papers providing the relevant results reflecting the prevalence of BRCA gene mutations in Vietnamese women who are at least 18 years old with or without cancer. Predefined selection criteria will be used to establish each publication's eligibility. Using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias tools, the quality of included studies will be assessed, and overall evidence quality will be appraised using the GRADE approach. All pertinent data from the included articles will be entered into an Excel spreadsheet for meta-analysis, which will be imported into Rstudio. Meta-analyses using random effects will be used to obtain the pooled percentages. The chi-squared test and I2 parameter will be used to evaluate heterogeneity. Publication bias will be investigated visually using funnel plots for asymmetry and Egger's statistical tests. Conclusions: Based on the prevalence of BRCA muations and its associated comprehensive and specific risk factors, we hope our findings will provide a reference for future strategies to build an effective treatment plan and manage the risk of cancer development. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42022340152; 30 June 2022).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of different concentrations of reversine to enhance conversion of dedifferentiated fat cells into mature cardiomyocytes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is an essential need for cardiomyocyte regeneration among patients with heart failure. Transplantation of dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells may lead to an improvement of cardiomyocyte regeneration among heart failure patients. We believe that DFAT cells are promising candidate cell sources for cardiac regeneration. However, the pathway underlying how DFAT cells of the adipose lineage differentiate into mature cardiomyocytes isn’t fully understood. Methods: We conducted an experimental laboratory study on isolated DFAT cells from adipose tissue of healthy adults. Then, we treated cells with different concentrations of reversine (10, 20 and 40 nM), and performed RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Next, we used a ceiling culture method based on the buoyancy properties of mature lipid-filled adipocytes. Stemness expression (Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 [Oct4], brachyury, Fetal liver kinase 1 [Flk-1]) was quantified by reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR, while cardiomyocyte expression (Transcription factor GATA-4 [GATA4] and cardiac troponin T [cTnT]) was quantified by immunocytochemistry. Results: ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc found that 10 nM reversine increased greater Flk-1 expression compared to the control group (MD: 5.037 + 0.998; p < 0.001), but there were no significant changes among Oct4 (MD: 0.013 + 1.244; p = 0.99) and brachyury expression (MD: 0.157 + 0.084; p = 0.252). Kruskal-Wallis revealed that the expression of GATA4 (1.65 [0.41-1.98] to 0.015 [0.007-0.034]; p = 0.017) reduced significantly from day 7 until day 21 and cTnT (5.07 [6.62-8.91] to 8.22 [6.81-9.40]; p = 0.001) increased significantly from day 7 until day 21. Conclusions: Reversine could increase the expression of Flk-1, but it was unable to stimulate the expression of Oct4 and brachyury related to stem cell-ness. An optimal concentration of 10 nM reversine may have the greatest effect on enhancing the differentiation of DFAT cells into mature cardiomyocytes, as indicated by higher cTnT expression between cells.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Bilateral peritonsillar abscess with complications of upper airway obstruction [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Peritonsillar abscess is a collection of pus between the tonsillar fibrous capsule and the pharyngeal constrictor muscle. Unilateral peritonsillar abscess is a common complication of acute tonsillitis, whereas bilateral peritonsillar abscess is rare. The incidence of bilateral peritonsillar abscess remains unknown but is estimated to be 4.9% of all peritonsillar abscess cases. Case report: A 20-year-old man came to the emergency room with bilateral peritonsillar abscess and complained of shortness of breath for two weeks. Physical examination showed muffled voice, 82% oxygen saturation, and inspiratory stridor. The isthmus faucium was narrow, with approximately 30% remaining. Peritonsillar puncture revealed pus mixed with blood. The treatment for this patient included bilateral peritonsillar incision and drainage and intravenous antibiotics of levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient came to the Ear, Nose, Throat, Head, and Neck (ENTHN) Outpatient Unit eight days after the procedure for a control checkup and was in good condition. Conclusion: We have reported a bilateral peritonsillar abscess with complications of upper airway obstruction, in which we performed incision and drainage. Prompt and appropriate management is needed to avoid unwanted morbidity and mortality.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Measurement of speech in individuals with selective mutism: A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The main characteristic of selective mutism (SM) is the failure to speak in specific social situations. Thus, assessing speech across social contexts is important for confirming a diagnosis of SM and for differentiating it from other disorders. The purpose of this review was to organize how the core symptom of SM, a lack of speech in specific social situations, has been assessed in previous studies. Methods: A systematic search of articles was conducted in three databases, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and PubMed and reviews of surveys or experimental studies that reported empirical data on individuals with SM were performed. We excluded review, qualitative, epidemiological, and intervention studies. The study summarized the diagnostic criteria, methods of confirming SM diagnosis, distinction of SM from other disorders, and methods of speech assessment. Results: A total of 447 articles were screened, where 60 articles were considered eligible. The results demonstrate that different interviews and questionnaires were used to establish the diagnosis of SM. However, the majority of interviews and questionnaires lacked validation. Only two (2/60) articles used validated methods of speech assessment to confirm SM diagnosis. Moreover, a consensus was lacking on the assessment method for differentiating SM from other disorders across studies. Specifically, 17 studies measured speech and are not intended for diagnosis. The majority of studies (16/17) used the questionnaire to assess the severity of the SM condition, and only one study conducted behavioral observation. Assessment methods based on the measurement of speech in real-life situations for individuals with SM were not established. Conclusion: We have the limitation that we did not review intervention studies. However, this systematic review revealed the problem that speech assessment methods for surveys or experimental studies of SM were not established. Future studies should establish methods of speech assessment across social situations to assess SM symptoms.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Interspecific variation in sex‐specific gustatory organs in Drosophila</a></h4>

     alt="Interspecific variation in sex-specific gustatory organs in Drosophila"/><p><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is a popular model for investigating how sex-specific sensory information is translated into sex-specific behavior. To provide an evolutionary context for these studies, this report shows that different <i>Drosophila</i> species vary extensively in the presence, number, locations, and morphology of sex-specific gustatory bristles on their legs.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Drosophila</i> males use leg gustatory bristles to discriminate between male and female cuticular pheromones as an important part of courtship behavior. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, several male-specific gustatory bristles are present on the anterior surface of the first tarsal segment of the prothoracic leg, in addition to a larger set of gustatory bristles found in both sexes. These bristles are thought to be specialized for pheromone detection. Here, we report the number and location of sex-specific gustatory bristles in 27 other <i>Drosophila</i> species. Although some species have a pattern similar to <i>D. melanogaster</i>, others lack anterior male-specific bristles but have many dorsal male-specific gustatory bristles instead. Some species have both anterior and dorsal male-specific bristles, while others lack sexual dimorphism entirely. In several distantly related species, the number of gustatory bristles is much greater in males than in females due to a male-specific transformation of ancestrally mechanosensory bristles to a chemosensory identity. This variation in the extent and pattern of sexual dimorphism may affect the formation and function of neuronal circuits that control <i>Drosophila</i> courtship and contribute to the evolution of mating behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Micro‐CT visualization of the CNS: Performance of different contrast‐enhancing techniques for documenting the spider brain</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spider brain and central nervous system (CNS) have remained unexplored, due in part to the difficulty of observing these organs, usually only possible through histological preparations. Recently, internal anatomy studies have been supplemented by the inclusion of X- ray micro-CT. Unmineralized tissue such as the body of invertebrates requires a staining process to enhance tissue X-ray absorption and improve contrast during observation. Many current protocols are based on iodine staining requiring critical point drying (CPD) of the sample for optimal contrast. This process induces shrinking of the soft tissue generating artifacts in the morphology, volume, and even position of internal structures. Phosphotungstic acid (PTA) is an alternative staining agent recently used in marine invertebrate and plant studies. Here, we used several specimens of the common spider <i>Araneus diadematus</i> to visualize the spider brain and compare both contrast-enhancing ethanol-based solutions. We assessed a gradient of staining times, observed and tested the repercussions of CPD, and examined the use of vacuum to accelerate PTA diffusion. We show that PTA provides the best contrast on micro-CT scans in ethanol eliminating the need for CPD, and offering more realistic in situ visualizations of the internal organs. In combination with different scanning settings, PTA allowed observation of internal organs like the CNS, digestive system, muscles, and finer structures like the retina, visual nerves, and optic neuropiles. This fast and less invasive method could facilitate the proper documentation of the internal anatomy in the context of evolutionary, developmental and functional studies.</p>

     alt="Chemoarchitecture of area prostriata in adult and developing mice: Comparison with presubiculum and parasubiculum"/><p>The present study investigated the genoarchitecture of the mouse equivalent of area prostriata (Pro), which receives direct inputs from dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex (V1). In both adult and postnatal mice, many genes are expressed in layers 2–3 (e.g., Fstl1) or layer 5 (e.g., Lypd1) or both (not shown) of the prostriata, while some other genes are differentially expressed in the dorsal (e.g., Col5a1) and ventral (e.g., Cdh24) subdivisions of the prostriata. These gene expression patterns make the prostriata distinguishable from adjoining regions such as the postsubiculum and V1.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Retrosplenial area 29e, which was a cortical region described mostly in earlier rodent literature, is often included in the dorsal presubiculum (PrSd) or postsubiculum (PoS) in modern literature and commonly used brain atlases. Recent anatomical and molecular studies have revealed that retrosplenial area 29e belongs to the superficial layers of area prostriata, which in primates is found to be important in fast analysis of quickly moving objects in far peripheral visual field. As in primates, the prostriata in rodents adjoins area 29 (granular retrosplenial area), area 30 (agranular retrosplenial area), medial visual cortex, PrSd/PoS, parasubiculum (PaS), and postrhinal cortex (PoR). The present study aims to reveal the chemoarchitecture of the prostriata versus PrSd/PoS or PaS by means of a systematic survey of gene expression patterns in adult and developing mouse brains. First, we find many genes that display differential expression across the prostriata, PrSd/PoS, and PaS and that show obvious laminar expression patterns. Second, we reveal subsets of genes that selectively express in the dorsal or ventral parts of the prostriata, suggesting the existence of at least two subdivisions. Third, we detect some genes that shows differential expression in the prostriata of postnatal mouse brains from adjoining regions, thus enabling identification of the developing area prostriata. Fourth, gene expression difference of the prostriata from the medial primary visual cortex and PoR is also observed. Finally, molecular and connectional features of the prostriata in rodents and nonhuman primates are discussed and compared.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The central complex (CX) in the brain of insects is a highly conserved group of midline-spanning neuropils consisting of the upper and lower division of the central body, the protocerebral bridge, and the paired noduli. These neuropils are the substrate for a number of behaviors, most prominently goal-oriented locomotion. Honeybees have been a model organism for sky-compass orientation for more than 70 years, but there is still very limited knowledge about the structure and function of their CX. To advance and facilitate research on this brain area, we created a high-resolution three-dimensional atlas of the honeybee's CX and associated neuropils, including the posterior optic tubercles, the bulbs, and the anterior optic tubercles. To this end, we developed a modified version of the iterative shape averaging technique, which allowed us to achieve high volumetric accuracy of the neuropil models. For a finer definition of spatial locations within the central body, we defined layers based on immunostaining against the neuropeptides locustatachykinin, FMRFamide, gastrin/cholecystokinin, and allatostatin and included them into the atlas by elastic registration. Our honeybee CX atlas provides a platform for future neuroanatomical work.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It is becoming increasingly clear that robust sex differences exist in the processing of acute and chronic pain in both rodents and humans. However, the underlying mechanism has not been well characterized. The dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord is the fundamental building block of ascending and descending pain pathways. It has been shown that numerous neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems in the spinal cord, including the endocannabinoid system and its main receptor, the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R), play vital roles in processing nociceptive information. Our previous findings have shown that <i>CB<sub>1</sub>R</i> mRNA is widely expressed in the brain in sex-dependent patterns. However, the sex-, lamina-, and cell-type-specific characteristics of CB<sub>1</sub>R expression in the spinal cord have not been fully described. In this study, the <i>CB<sub>1</sub>R-iCre-EGFP</i> mouse strain was generated to label and identify CB<sub>1</sub>R-positive (CB<sub>1</sub>R<sup>GFP</sup>) cells. We reported no sex difference in CB<sub>1</sub>R expression in the lumbar dorsal horn of the spinal cord, but a dynamic distribution within superficial laminae II and III in female mice between estrus and nonestrus phases. Furthermore, the cell-type-specific CB<sub>1</sub>R expression pattern in the dorsal horn was similar in both sexes. Over 50% of CB<sub>1</sub>R<sup>GFP</sup> cells were GABAergic neurons, and approximately 25% were glycinergic and 20–30% were glutamatergic neurons. The CB<sub>1</sub>R-expressing cells also represented a subset of spinal projection neurons. Overall, our work indicates a highly consistent distribution pattern of CB<sub>1</sub>R<sup>GFP</sup> cells in the dorsal horn of lumbar spinal cord in males and females.</p>

     alt="From retina to motoneurons: A substrate for visuomotor transformation in salamanders"/>
<p>We provide anatomical and physiological evidence of a retino-tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway in salamanders. This pathway provides a substrate for the transformation of visual information into a motor command and is well positioned to control orienting behaviors when approaching a prey for instance.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The transformation of visual input into motor output is essential to approach a target or avoid a predator. In salamanders, visually guided orientation behaviors have been extensively studied during prey capture. However, the neural circuitry involved is not resolved. Using salamander brain preparations, calcium imaging and tracing experiments, we describe a neural substrate through which retinal input is transformed into spinal motor output. We found that retina stimulation evoked responses in reticulospinal neurons of the middle reticular nucleus, known to control steering movements in salamanders. Microinjection of glutamatergic antagonists in the optic tectum (superior colliculus in mammals) decreased the reticulospinal responses. Using tracing, we found that retina projected to the dorsal layers of the contralateral tectum, where the dendrites of neurons projecting to the middle reticular nucleus were located. In slices, stimulation of the tectal dorsal layers evoked glutamatergic responses in deep tectal neurons retrogradely labeled from the middle reticular nucleus. We then examined how tectum activation translated into spinal motor output. Tectum stimulation evoked motoneuronal responses, which were decreased by microinjections of glutamatergic antagonists in the contralateral middle reticular nucleus. Reticulospinal fibers anterogradely labeled from tracer injection in the middle reticular nucleus were preferentially distributed in proximity with the dendrites of ipsilateral motoneurons. Our work establishes a neural substrate linking visual and motor centers in salamanders. This retino-tecto-reticulo-spinal circuitry is well positioned to control orienting behaviors. Our study bridges the gap between the behavioral studies and the neural mechanisms involved in the transformation of visual input into motor output in salamanders.</p>

     alt="Calcium-binding proteins typify the dopaminergic neuronal subtypes in the ventral tegmental area of zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata"/>
<p>Graphical Abstract: Dopamine (DA) neurons residing in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) in the midbrain of zebra finch demonstrate distinct differences in size and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-ir). The DA neurons in VTA were smaller than those in SN. Based on TH-ir, VTA neurons have been demarcated as subtype 1, 2, and 3. The further study probed the nature of the calcium binding proteins (CBPs), namely, Calbindin (CB)-, Calretinin (CR)-, Parvalbumin (PV)-, and Secretagogin (SCGN)-expressing DA neurons in the VTA and SN. CBPs mRNA and protein showed differential expression in VTA subdivisions and SN. While the subtype 1 TH neurons in the VTA were CB- or CR-negative, subtype 2 and 3 TH neurons co-expressed CB and CR, respectively. Neurons expressing SCGN were observed only in the VTA. All subtypes of TH neurons in the VTA co-expressed PV, and the PV and TH-ir showed reciprocal relationship.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Calcium-binding proteins (CBPs) regulate neuronal function in midbrain dopamine (DA)-ergic neurons in mammals by buffering and sensing the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and vesicular release. In birds, the equivalent set of neurons are important in song learning, directed singing, courtship, and energy balance, yet the status of CBPs in these neurons is unknown. Herein, for the first time, we probe the nature of CBPs, namely, Calbindin-, Calretinin-, Parvalbumin-, and Secretagogin-expressing DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) in the midbrain of zebra finch, <i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>. qRT-PCR analysis of ventral midbrain tissue fragment revealed higher Calbindin- and Calretinin-mRNA levels compared to Parvalbumin and Secretagogin. Application of immunofluorescence showed CBP-immunoreactive (-i) neurons in VTA (anterior [VTAa], mid [VTAm], caudal [VTAc]), SN (compacta [SNc], and reticulata [SNr]). Compared to VTAa, higher Calbindin- and Parvalbumin-immunoreactivity (-ir), and lower Calretinin-ir were observed in VTAm and VTAc. Secretagogin-ir was highly localized to VTAa. In SN, Calbindin- and Calretinin-ir were higher in SNc, SNr was Parvalbumin enriched, and Secretagogin-ir was not detected. Weak, moderate, and intense tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-i VTA neurons were demarcated as subtypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. While subtype 1 TH-i neurons were neither Calbindin- nor Calretinin-i, ∼80 and ∼65% subtype 2 and ∼30 and ∼45% subtype 3 TH-i neurons co-expressed Calbindin and Calretinin, respectively. All TH-i neuronal subtypes co-expressed Parvalbumin with reciprocal relationship with TH-ir. We suggest that the CBPs may determine VTA DA neuronal heterogeneity and differentially regulate their activity in <i>T. guttata</i>.</p>

     alt="A versatile transcription factor: Multiple roles of orthopedia a (otpa) beyond its restricted localization in dopaminergic systems of developing and adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) brains"/><p>The complete array of expression domains of the <i>orthopedia a</i> (<i>otpa</i>) gene is reported in the early adult zebrafish brain using immunohistochemistry and epifluorescence and confocal microscopy. Newly defined Otpa-positive neuroanatomical areas include the ventral and prerecess caudal periventricular hypothalamic zones and various brainstem nuclei including the perilemniscal nucleus and nucleus lateralis valvulae. These data are summarized in the schematic drawing. Double-labeling with a tyrosine hydroxylase antibody confirms cellular colocalization exclusively in two posterior tubercular nuclei (TPp-m; PTN; a/a1-b/b1). Using <i>shh-</i> and <i>islet1</i>-related zebrafish transgenic lines, colocalization of <i>shh</i> and Otpa is shown in posterior tubercular dopaminergic cells (c) with ascending projections to the subpallium, and of <i>islet1</i> in the ventral hypothalamic zone (d).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Many transcription factors boost neural development and differentiation in specific directions and serve for identifying similar or homologous structures across species. The expression of Orthopedia (Otp) is critical for the development of certain cell groups along the vertebrate neuraxis, for example, the medial amygdala or hypothalamic neurosecretory neurons. Therefore, the primary focus of the present study is the distribution of Orthopedia a (Otpa) in the larval and adult zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) brain. Since Otpa is also critical for the development of zebrafish basal diencephalic dopaminergic cells, colocalization of Otpa with the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is studied. Cellular colocalization of Otpa and dopamine is only seen in magnocellular neurons of the periventricular posterior tubercular nucleus and in the posterior tuberal nucleus. Otpa-positive cells occur in many additional structures along the zebrafish neuraxis, from the secondary prosencephalon down to the hindbrain. Furthermore, Otpa expression is studied in <i>shh</i>-GFP and <i>islet1</i>-GFP transgenic zebrafish. Otpa-positive cells only express <i>shh</i> in dopaminergic magnocellular periventricular posterior tubercular cells, and only colocalize with <i>islet1</i>-GFP in the ventral zone and prerecess caudal periventricular hypothalamic zone and the perilemniscal nucleus. The scarcity of cellular colocalization of Otpa in <i>islet1</i>-GFP cells indicates that the Shh<i>-islet1</i> neurogenetic pathway is not active in most Otpa-expressing domains. Our analysis reveals detailed correspondences between mouse and zebrafish forebrain territories including the zebrafish intermediate nucleus of the ventral telencephalon and the mouse medial amygdala. The zebrafish preoptic Otpa-positive domain represents the neuropeptidergic supraopto-paraventricular region of all tetrapods. Otpa domains in the zebrafish basal plate hypothalamus suggest that the ventral periventricular hypothalamic zone corresponds to the <i>otp</i>-expressing basal hypothalamic tuberal field in the mouse. Furthermore, the mouse <i>otp</i> domain in the mammillary hypothalamus compares partly to our Otpa-positive domain in the prerecess caudal periventricular hypothalamic zone (Hc-a).</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The giant mimivirus 1.2 Mb genome is elegantly organized into a 30 nm diameter helical protein shield</a></h4>

              
                Mimivirus is the prototype of the <i>Mimiviridae</i> family of giant dsDNA viruses. Little is known about the organization of the 1.2 Mb genome inside the membrane-limited nucleoid filling the ~0.5 µm icosahedral capsids. Cryo-electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography and proteomics revealed that it is encased into a ~30 nm diameter helical protein shell surprisingly composed of two GMC-type oxidoreductases, which also form the glycosylated fibrils decorating the capsid. The genome is arranged in 5- or 6-start left-handed super-helices, with each DNA-strand lining the central channel. This luminal channel of the nucleoprotein fiber is wide enough to accommodate oxidative stress proteins and RNA polymerase subunits identified by proteomics. Such elegant supramolecular organization would represent a remarkable evolutionary strategy for packaging and protecting the genome, in a state ready for immediate transcription upon unwinding in the host cytoplasm. The parsimonious use of the same protein in two unrelated substructures of the virion is unexpected for a giant virus with thousand genes at its disposal.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Global analysis of cytosine and adenine DNA modifications across the tree of life</a></h4>

              
                Interpreting the function and metabolism of enzymatic DNA modifications requires both position-specific and global quantities. Sequencing-based techniques that deliver the former have become broadly accessible, but analytical methods for the global quantification of DNA modifications have thus far been applied mostly to individual problems. We established a mass spectrometric method for the sensitive and accurate quantification of multiple enzymatic DNA modifications. Then, we isolated DNA from 124 archean, bacterial, fungal, plant, and mammalian species, and several tissues and created a resource of global DNA modification quantities. Our dataset provides insights into the general nature of enzymatic DNA modifications, reveals unique biological cases, and provides complementary quantitative information to normalize and assess the accuracy of sequencing-based detection of DNA modifications. We report that only three of the studied DNA modifications, methylcytosine (5mdC), methyladenine (N6mdA) and hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmdC), were detected above a picomolar detection limit across species, and dominated in higher eukaryotes (5mdC), in bacteria (N6mdA), or the vertebrate central nervous systems (5hmdC). All three modifications were detected simultaneously in only one of the tested species, <i>Raphanus sativus</i>. In contrast, these modifications were either absent or detected only at trace quantities, across all yeasts and insect genomes studied. Further, we reveal interesting biological cases. For instance, in <i>Allium cepa</i>, <i>Helianthus annuus</i>, or <i>Andropogon gerardi</i>, more than 35% of cytosines were methylated. Additionally, next to the mammlian CNS, 5hmdC was also detected in plants like <i>Lepidium sativum</i> and was found on 8% of cytosines in the <i>Garra barreimiae</i> brain samples. Thus, identifying unexpected levels of DNA modifications in several wild species, our resource underscores the need to address biological diversity for studying DNA modifications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Large protein complex interfaces have evolved to promote cotranslational assembly</a></h4>

              
                Assembly pathways of protein complexes should be precise and efficient to minimise misfolding and unwanted interactions with other proteins in the cell. One way to achieve this efficiency is by seeding assembly pathways during translation via the cotranslational assembly of subunits. While recent evidence suggests that such cotranslational assembly is widespread, little is known about the properties of protein complexes associated with the phenomenon. Here, using a combination of proteome-specific protein complex structures and publicly available ribosome profiling data, we show that cotranslational assembly is particularly common between subunits that form large intermolecular interfaces. To test whether large interfaces have evolved to promote cotranslational assembly, as opposed to cotranslational assembly being a non-adaptive consequence of large interfaces, we compared the sizes of first and last translated interfaces of heteromeric subunits in bacterial, yeast, and human complexes. When considering all together, we observe the N-terminal interface to be larger than the C-terminal interface 54% of the time, increasing to 64% when we exclude subunits with only small interfaces, which are unlikely to cotranslationally assemble. This strongly suggests that large interfaces have evolved as a means to maximise the chance of successful cotranslational subunit binding.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">3D single cell migration driven by temporal correlation between oscillating force dipoles</a></h4>

              
                Directional cell locomotion requires symmetry breaking between the front and rear of the cell. In some cells, symmetry breaking manifests itself in a directional flow of actin from the front to the rear of the cell. Many cells, especially in physiological 3D matrices do not show such coherent actin dynamics and present seemingly competing protrusion/retraction dynamics at their front and back. How symmetry breaking manifests itself for such cells is therefore elusive. We take inspiration from the scallop theorem proposed by Purcell for micro-swimmers in Newtonian fluids: self-propelled objects undergoing persistent motion at low Reynolds number must follow a cycle of shape changes that breaks temporal symmetry. We report similar observations for cells crawling in 3D. We quantified cell motion using a combination of 3D live cell imaging, visualization of the matrix displacement and a minimal model with multipolar expansion. We show that our cells embedded in a 3D matrix form myosin-driven force dipoles at both sides of the nucleus, that locally and periodically pinch the matrix. The existence of a phase shift between the two dipoles is required for directed cell motion which manifests itself as cycles with finite area in the dipole-quadrupole diagram, a formal equivalence to the Purcell cycle. We confirm this mechanism by triggering local dipolar contractions with a laser. This leads to directed motion. Our study reveals that these cells control their motility by synchronizing dipolar forces distributed at front and back. This result opens new strategies to externally control cell motion as well as for the design of micro-crawlers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Precise control of neural activity using temporally dithered and spatially multiplexed electrical stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Electrical stimulation with neural implants can restore lost sensory function by evoking patterns of activity in neural populations. However, stimulation with many electrodes generally combines nonlinearly to influence neural activity, and is thus difficult to control. To overcome this challenge, we propose a dynamic stimulation approach that exploits the slow time scales of downstream neural processing and the independence of distant electrodes by encoding a complex visual stimulus into a rapid, greedily chosen, temporally dithered and spatially multiplexed sequence of simple stimulation patterns. The approach was evaluated using a lab prototype of a retinal implant: large-scale, high-resolution multi-electrode stimulation and recording of primate retinal ganglion cells ex vivo. Greedy dithering and multiplexing provided a powerful framework for optimizing electrical stimulation, greatly enhancing expected performance compared to existing open loop approaches. The modular framework enabled parallel extensions to naturalistic and dynamic viewing conditions, optimization of perceptual similarity measures and efficient hardware implementation for retinal implants.

                There is mounting evidence for predictive coding theory from computational, neuroimaging, and psychological research. However there remains a lack of research exploring how predictive brain function develops across childhood. To address this gap, we used paediatric magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record the evoked magnetic fields of 18 younger children (M = 4.1 years) and 19 older children (M = 6.2 years) as they listened to a 12-minute auditory oddball paradigm. For each child, we computed a MisMatch Field (MMF): an electrophysiological component that is widely interpreted as a neural signature of predictive coding. Consistent with our hypotheses, the older children showed significantly larger MMF amplitudes relative to the younger children. Furthermore, the older children showed a significantly larger MMF amplitude in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; 0.312 to 0.33 s) relative to the younger children, p < .05. These findings support the idea that predictive brain function develops during childhood, with increasing involvement of the frontal cortex in response to prediction errors. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the brain function underpinning child cognitive development.

                Family and twin studies demonstrate that genetic factors determine 20-60% of the vulnerability to opioid use disorder. However, the genes/alleles that mediate the risk of developing addiction-related behaviors, including the sensitivity to the analgesic efficacy of opioids, the development of tolerance, dependence, and escalation of oxycodone taking and seeking, have been ill-defined, thus hindering efforts to design pharmacological interventions to enable precision medicine strategies. Here we characterized oxycodone addiction-like behaviors in heterogeneous stock (HS) rats, that show high genetic diversity that mimics the high genetic variability in humans. HS rats were allowed to self-administer oxycodone for two h/daily for four days (ShA) and then moved to 12h/daily (LgA) for 14 days. Animals were screened for motivation to self-administer oxycodone using a progressive-ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement and for the development of withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance to the analgesic effects of oxycodone using the von-Frey and tail immersion tests, respectively. To reduce cohort-specific effects, we used cohorts of 46-60 rats and normalized the response level within cohorts using a Z-score. To take advantage of the four opioid-related behaviors and further identify subjects that are consistently vulnerable vs. resilient to compulsive oxycodone use, we computed an Addiction Index by averaging normalized responding (Z-scores) for the four behavioral tests. Results showed high individual variability between vulnerable and resilient rats, likely to facilitate the detection of gene variants associated with vulnerable vs. resilient individuals. Such data will have considerable translational value for designing follow-up studies in humans.

                Brain size differs substantially between human males and females. This difference in total intracranial volume (TIV) can cause bias when employing machine-learning approaches for the investigation of sex differences in brain morphology. TIV-biased models will likely not capture actual qualitative sex differences in brain organization but rather learn to classify an individual's sex based on brain size differences, thus leading to spurious and misleading conclusions, for example when comparing brain morphology between cisgender- and transgender individuals. Here, TIV bias in sex classification models applied to cis- and transgender individuals was systematically investigated by controlling for brain size either through featurewise confound removal or by matching training samples for TIV. Our results provide evidence that non-TIV-biased models can classify the sex of both cis- and transgender individuals with high accuracy, highlighting the importance of appropriate modelling to avoid bias in automated decision making.

                In zebrafish telencephalon, radial glial cells (RGs) show a remarkable ability to regenerate damaged neural tissue by re-initiating cell proliferation to produce neural precursors to rebuild the lost neural circuit. However, it is not fully understood how RGs respond to brain damage to initiate this regenerative response. Here we applied single-cell transcriptomics to RGs in adult zebrafish telencephalon and identified five RG subtypes, which are classified into four quiescent RGs (qRGs) and one proliferating RG (pRG). The four qRGs differentially express distinct subsets of qRG markers, suggesting heterogeneity of qRG in zebrafish adult brain. Interestingly, one qRG subtype shows high expression of ribosomal proteins, and its fraction increases in response to brain damage. Consistently, the mTOR pathway is activated in RGs near the injury site. It was reported that inflammatory responses of brain-resident immune cells, microglia, are required for inducing regenerative responses of RGs in zebrafish. Genetical elimination of microglia not only suppressed the damage-induced regenerative response of RGs, but also decreased the fraction of the ribosomal expression-enriched qRGs. Our pseudo-time analysis suggests that putative dormant RGs produce ribosomal expression-enriched qRGs through activation of ribosomal genesis, as well as suppression of cholesterol biogenesis, and pRGs through activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Our findings reveal heterogeneity of qRGs in adult zebrafish brain and their dynamic regenerative response to brain damage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain structural covariances in the ageing brain in the UK Biobank</a></h4>

              
                Brain structural covariances or pairwise correlations describe how morphologic properties of brain regions are related to one another across individuals. Although it is reported that brain structural covariance changes during brain development, it is not clear how structural covariance relates to the ageing process. Here we investigated the human brain structural covariances of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes in the ageing brain and their associations with age, cognition, and longevity polygenic risk score (longevity-PRS) by using cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank (N = 42075, aged 45-83 years, M/F=19752 /22323). The sample of participants was divided into 84 non-overlapping groups based on their age. The older the age group, the greater the variability in the whole brain structural covariance. However, there was a differential rate of age-related increase of variance between males and females. The variance of females started lower than those of males and then increased with age with a greater gradient than that of males. There was a consistent and significant enrichment of pairwise correlations within the occipital lobe in ageing process. The cortical thickness and subcortical covariances in older groups were significantly different from those in the youngest group. Sixty-two of the total 528 pairs of cortical thickness correlations and 10 of the total 21 pairs of subcortical volume correlations were significantly associated with age after Bonferroni correction. Specifically, with an increasing age, most decreased cortical thickness correlations were found between the regions within the frontal lobe as well as between the frontal lobe regions and regions in other lobes, while pairwise correlations within occipital lobe regions were all strengthening. Most of these correlations were also associated with global cognition and weakly associated with longevity-PRS. These findings revealed that the structural covariance was not stable during ageing. Given the thinning of the cortex and the volumetric reduction of subcortical structures seen in the ageing process, an increased pairwise correlation between the brain regions in the older brain suggested a strengthened coordinated decline between the brain regions involved. However, some of the brain regions demonstrated a differentiated rate of decline which was shown as the inversed or reduced pairwise correlations between these regions.

                Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by alpha-synuclein aggregation and loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. Risk of PD arises due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, which may interact, termed gene-environment (GxE) interactions. An inverse association between smoking and risk of PD is well-established, and a previous genome-wide GxE interaction study identified genetic variation in the synaptic-vesicle glycoprotein 2C (SV2C) locus as an important mediator of the degree to which smoking is inversely associated with PD. Objective: We sought to determine the mechanism of the smoking-SV2C interaction in a Drosophila model of PD. Methods: Flies expressing human alpha-synuclein in all neurons develop the hallmarks of PD, including motor dysfunction, loss of DA neurons, and formation of alpha-synuclein inclusions. We assessed the effects of increasing doses of nicotine on these parameters of neurodegeneration, in the presence or absence of SV2 knockdown. Results: alpha-synuclein-expressing flies treated with nicotine had improvement in locomotion, DA neuron counts, and in alpha-synuclein aggregation. However, in alpha-synuclein-expressing flies in which Drosophila orthologs of SV2 were knocked down, nicotine failed to rescue neurodegeneration. Conclusions: This work confirms a GxE interaction between nicotine and SV2, defines a role for this interaction in alpha-synuclein proteostasis, and suggests that future clinical trials on nicotine should consider genetic variation in SV2C. Further, this provides proof of concept that our model can be used for mechanistic study of GxE, paving the way for investigation of additional GxE interactions or identification of novel GxE.

                Background: Population-based neuroscience offers opportunities to examine important but understudied sociocultural factors, such as acculturation. Acculturation refers to the extent to which an individual retains their cultural heritage and/or adopts the receiving society's culture and is particularly salient among Hispanic/Latinx immigrants. Acculturation has been linked to vulnerability to substance use, depression, and suicide and is known to influence family dynamics between caregivers and their children. Methods: We investigated first- and second-generation Hispanic/Latinx caregivers in the ABCD Study and examined how caregivers' acculturative orientation impacts their mental health, as well as the mental health and brain function of their children. Neuroimaging analyses focused on regions associated with self- and affiliation-based social processing (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, insula, and temporoparietal junction). Results: We identified two profiles of caregiver acculturation: bicultural (retains heritage culture while adopting US culture) and detached (discards heritage culture and rejects US culture). Bicultural caregivers exhibited fewer internalizing and externalizing problems compared to detached caregivers; further, youth exhibited similar internalizing effects across caregiver profiles. In addition, youth with bicultural caregivers displayed increased resting-state brain activity (i.e., fALFF and ReHo) in the left insula, which has been linked to psychopathology; however, differences in long-range functional connectivity were not significant. Conclusions: Caregiver acculturation is an important familial factor linked to significant differences in youth mental health and insula activity. Future work should examine sociocultural and neurodevelopmental changes across adolescence to assess long-term outcomes and determine whether localized, corticolimbic brain effects are ultimately translated into long-range connectivity differences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal gradient characteristics of automatic neural representation for orthographic consistency in Chinese characters</a></h4>

              
                Visual word processing involves the automatic decoding of orthographic, phonological and semantic information. The mappings of these information in a writing system comprise an important feature of visual words: orthographic regularity and consistency. Recent electroencephalography (EEG) studies have investigated the automatic processing mechanism of orthographic regularity (i.e., words vs. pseudowords) among visual words. However, the automated mechanism and temporal dynamics of different types of orthographic consistency effects (e.g., orthographic positional consistency, orthography-to-phonology consistency vs. orthography-to-semantics consistency) have never been studied. This study explored automatic neural representation for orthographic consistency effects in visual words and its temporal dynamics through an oddball paradigm. Three types of oddball sequences were designed with Chinese characters as stimuli, including consistent Chinese characters as standard stimuli and three types of inconsistent characters (orthographic positional inconsistent, orthography-to-phonology inconsistent vs. orthography-to-semantics inconsistent) as deviant stimuli, respectively. Significant visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) activities were observed in all three types of inconsistent characters, which suggests automatic processing caused by orthographic consistency violations. Time-resolved representational similarity analysis (RSA) further revealed that there are different temporal dynamics of automatic neural representations for the three types of consistency features. The representation of positional consistency emerged earlier within an independent time window, while the representation of phonetic and semantic consistency emerged later, and partially overlapped. These findings provide novel insights for the temporal gradient characteristics of automated representation structure of orthography consistency information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">System-level high-amplitude co-fluctuations</a></h4>

              
                Edge time series decompose interregional correlations (functional connectivity; FC) into their time-varying contributions. Previous studies have revealed that brief, high-amplitude, and globally-defined "events" contribute disproportionately to the time-averaged FC pattern. This whole-brain view prioritizes systems that occupy vast neocortical territory, possibly obscuring extremely high-amplitude co-fluctuations that are localized to smaller brain systems. Here, we investigate local events detected at the system level, assessing their independent contributions to global events and characterizing their repertoire during resting-state and movie-watching scans. We find that, as expected, global events are more likely to occur when large brain systems exhibit events. Next, we study the co-fluctuation patterns that coincide with system events--i.e. events detected locally based on the behavior of individual brain systems. We find that although each system exhibits a distinct co-fluctuation pattern that is dissimilar from those associated with global events, the patterns can nonetheless be grouped into two broad categories, corresponding to events that coincide with sensorimotor and attention systems and, separately, association systems. We then investigate system-level events during movie-watching, discovering that the timing of events in sensorimotor and attention systems decouple, yielding reductions in co-fluctuation amplitude. Next, we show that by associating each edge with its most similar system-averaged edge time series, we recover overlapping community structure, obviating the need for applying clustering algorithms to high-dimensional edge time series. Finally, we focus on cortical responses to system-level events in subcortical areas and the cerebellum. We show that these structures coincide with spatially distributed cortical co-fluctuations, centered on prefrontal and somatosensory systems. Collectively, the findings presented here help clarify the relative contributions of large and small systems to global events, as well as their independent behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct chaperonopathy in skeletal muscle associated with the dominant variant in DNAJB4</a></h4>

              
                DnaJ homolog, subfamily B, member 4, a member of the heat shock protein 40 chaperones encoded by DNAJB4, is highly expressed in myofibers. We identified a heterozygous c.270 T>A (p.F90L) variant in DNAJB4 in a family with a dominantly inherited distal myopathy, in which affected members have specific features on muscle pathology represented by the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions and the accumulation of desmin, p62, HSP70 and DNAJB4 predominantly in type 1 fibers. Both Dnajb4-F90L knock-in and knockout mice developed muscle weakness and recapitulated the patient muscle pathology in the soleus muscle, where DNAJB4 has the highest expression. These data indicate that the identified variant is causative resulting in defective chaperone function and selective muscle degeneration in specific muscle fibers. This study demonstrates the importance of DNAJB4 in skeletal muscle proteostasis by identifying the associated chaperonopathy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Model of Hippocampal Replay Driven by Experience and Environmental Structure Facilitates Spatial Learning</a></h4>

              
                Replay of neuronal sequences in the hippocampus during resting states and sleep play an important role in learning and memory consolidation. Consistent with these functions, replay sequences have been shown to obey current spatial constraints. Nevertheless, replay does not necessarily reflect previous behavior and can construct never-experienced sequences. Here we propose a stochastic replay mechanism that prioritizes experiences based on three variables: 1. Experience strength, 2. experience similarity, and 3. inhibition of return. Using this prioritized replay mechanism to train reinforcement learning agents leads to far better performance than using random replay. Its performance is close to the state-of-the-art, but biologically unrealistic, algorithm by Mattar & Daw (2018). Importantly, our model reproduces diverse types of replay because of the stochasticity of the replay mechanism and experience-dependent differences between the three variables. In conclusion, a unified replay mechanism generates diverse replay statistics and is efficient in driving spatial learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SorCS1 inhibits amyloid-β binding to neurexin and rescues amyloid-β-induced synaptic pathology</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid-{beta} oligomers (A{beta}Os), toxic peptide aggregates found in Alzheimer's disease (AD), cause synapse pathology. A{beta}Os interact with Neurexins (NRXs), key synaptic organizers, and this interaction dampens normal trafficking and function of NRXs. Axonal trafficking of NRX is in part regulated by its interaction with SorCS1, a protein sorting receptor, but the impact of SorCS1 regulation of NRXs in A{beta} pathology was previously unstudied. Here, we show competitive interaction of SorCS1 and A{beta}Os with {beta}-NRXs and rescue effects of SorCS1 on A{beta}O-induced synaptic pathology. Like A{beta}Os, SorCS1 binds to NRX1{beta} through the histidine-rich-domain (HRD) of NRX1{beta}, and SorCS1 and A{beta}Os compete for NRX1{beta} binding. In cultured hippocampal neurons, SorCS1 colocalizes with NRX1{beta} on the axon surface, and axonal expression of SorCS1 rescues A{beta}O-induced impairment of NRX-mediated presynaptic organization and presynaptic vesicle recycling as well as A{beta}O-induced structural defects in excitatory synapses. Thus, we reveal a role of SorCS1 in the rescue of A{beta}O-induced NRX dysfunction and synaptic pathology, providing the basis for a novel potential therapeutic strategy for AD.

	<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that interferes with multiple aspects of daily functioning. Malingering or feigning of symptoms can be a major challenge during ADHD assessment. Stimulant medication abuse, misuse and diversion may constitute another challenge during management. A literature search of the past 15 years on the topic continued to suggest that there are several reasons for malingering and faking ADHD symptoms. Some of the reasons include the intent to obtain prescriptions for stimulant medications for performance enhancement, to gain access to additional school services and accommodations, to use recreationally and to sell as a street drug. In some countries, patients may receive additional tax or student loan benefits. Several researchers suggested that self-report rating measures are easily simulated by patients without ADHD. They concluded that no questionnaire has proved sufficiently robust against false positives. Some clinical factors that may suggest malingering during the ADHD assessment are highlighted and some available tests to detect malingering are discussed.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: there is an ongoing debate about whether psychopathic traits increase or decrease cognitive empathy/Theory of Mind. (2) Methods: using a representative sample of 204 Spanish convicted inmates incarcerated at the Pereiro de Aguiar Penitentiary in Ourense, Spain, we investigated the relationship between two tools for the assessment of psychopathy, the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) and the Comprehensive Assessment of Psychopathic Personality (CAPP), and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), a well-known measure of cognitive empathy. (3) Results: The results showed no clear connection between the scores on the psychopathy assessment tools and RMET performance. This lack of association was stronger when the age variable was included in the multivariate analysis. (4) Conclusions: the results of this study failed to detect any clear link between psychopathy and cognitive empathy performance. Accordingly, our results indicate that psychopathy neither improves nor worsens cognitive empathy.</p>
