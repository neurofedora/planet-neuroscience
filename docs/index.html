              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10972">Quantifying the Dynamics of Consciousness using Hierarchical Integration, Organised Complexity and Metastability</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.10972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the neural signatures of consciousness remains a major challenge in neuroscience and AI. Although many theories link consciousness to rich, multiscale, and flexible neural organisation, robust quantitative measures are still lacking. This paper presents a theory-neutral framework that characterises consciousness-related dynamics through three properties: hierarchical integration (H), cross-frequency complexity (D), and metastability (M). Candidate subsystems are identified using predictive information, temporal complexity, and state-space exploration to distinguish structured from unstructured activity. We provide mathematical definitions for all components and implement the framework in a generative model of synthetic EEG, simulating nine brain states ranging from psychedelic and wakeful to dreaming, non-REM sleep, minimally conscious, anaesthetised, and seizure-like regimes. Across single trials and Monte Carlo ensembles, the composite index reliably separates high-consciousness from impaired or non-conscious states. We further validate the framework using real EEG from the Sleep-EDF dataset alongside matched synthetic EEG designed to reproduce state-dependent oscillatory structure. Across Wake, N2, and REM sleep, synthetic data recapitulate the empirical ordering and magnitude of the index, indicating that the index captures stable and biologically meaningful distinctions. This approach provides a principled and empirically grounded tool for quantifying consciousness-related neural organisation with potential applications to both biological and artificial systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10976">The Homological Brain: Parity Principle and Amortized Inference</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.10976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological intelligence emerges from substrates that are slow, noisy, and energetically constrained, yet it performs rapid and coherent inference in open-ended environments. Classical computational theories, built around vector-space transformations and instantaneous error minimization, struggle to reconcile the slow timescale of synaptic plasticity with the fast timescale of perceptual synthesis. We propose a unifying framework based on algebraic topology, the Homological Brain, in which neural computation is understood as the construction and navigation of topological structure. Central to this view is the Parity Principle, a homological partition between even-dimensional scaffolds encoding stable content ($\Phi$) and odd-dimensional flows encoding dynamic context ($\Psi$). Transient contextual flows are resolved through a three-stage topological trinity transformation: Search (open-chain exploration), Closure (topological cycle formation), and Condensation (collapse of validated flows into new scaffold). This process converts high-complexity recursive search (formally modeled by Savitch's Theorem in NPSPACE) into low-complexity navigation over a learned manifold (analogous to memoized Dynamic Programming in P). In this framework, topological condensation is the mechanism that transforms a ``search problem'' into a ``navigation task'', allowing the brain to amortize past inference and achieve rapid perceptual integration. This perspective unifies the Wake-Sleep cycle, episodic-to-semantic consolidation, and dual-process theories (System 1-vs-System 2), revealing the brain as a homology engine that minimizes topological complexity to transmute high-entropy sensory flux into low-entropy, invariant cognitive structure.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10978">Cognitive Mirrors: Exploring the Diverse Functional Roles of Attention Heads in LLM Reasoning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.10978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a variety of tasks, but remain largely opaque in terms of their internal mechanisms. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial to improve their reasoning abilities. Drawing inspiration from the interplay between neural processes and human cognition, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the roles and behaviors of attention heads, which are key components of LLMs. We introduce CogQA, a dataset that decomposes complex questions into step-by-step subquestions with a chain-of-thought design, each associated with specific cognitive functions such as retrieval or logical reasoning. By applying a multi-class probing method, we identify the attention heads responsible for these functions. Our analysis across multiple LLM families reveals that attention heads exhibit functional specialization, characterized as cognitive heads. These cognitive heads exhibit several key properties: they are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across different cognitive functions, and display interactive and hierarchical structures. We further show that cognitive heads play a vital role in reasoning tasks - removing them leads to performance degradation, while augmenting them enhances reasoning accuracy. These insights offer a deeper understanding of LLM reasoning and suggest important implications for model design, training, and fine-tuning strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10981">Targeting the Synergistic Interaction of Pathologies in Alzheimer's Disease: Rationale and Prospects for Combination Therapy</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.10981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) persists as a paramount challenge in neurological research, characterized by the pathological hallmarks of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. This review synthesizes the evolving understanding of AD pathogenesis, moving beyond the linear amyloid cascade hypothesis to conceptualize the disease as a cross-talk of intricately interacting pathologies, encompassing Abeta, tau, and neuroinflammation. This evolving pathophysiological understanding parallels a transformation in diagnostic paradigms, where biomarker-based strategies -- such as the AT(N) framework -- enable early disease detection during preclinical or prodromal stages. Within this new landscape, while anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies (e.g., lecanemab, donanemab) represent a breakthrough as the first disease-modifying therapies, their modest efficacy underscores the limitation of single-target approaches. Therefore, this review explores the compelling rationale for combination therapies that simultaneously target Abeta pathology, aberrant tau, and neuroinflammation. Looking forward, we emphasize emerging technological platforms -- such as gene editing and biophysical neuromodulation -- n advancing precision medicine. Ultimately, the integration of early biomarker detection, multi-target therapeutic strategies, and AI-driven patient stratification charts a promising roadmap toward fundamentally altering the trajectory of AD. The future of AD management will be defined by preemptive, biomarker-guided, and personalized combination interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10982">Rosetta Stone of Neural Mass Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.10982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain dynamics dominate every level of neural organization -- from single-neuron spiking to the macroscopic waves captured by fMRI, MEG, and EEG -- yet the mathematical tools used to interrogate those dynamics remain scattered across a patchwork of traditions. Neural mass models (NMMs) (aggregate neural models) provide one of the most popular gateways into this landscape, but their sheer variety -- spanning lumped parameter models, firing-rate equations, and multi-layer generators -- demands a unifying framework that situates diverse architectures along a continuum of abstraction and biological detail. Here, we start from the idea that oscillations originate from a simple push-pull interaction between two or more neural populations. We build from the undamped harmonic oscillator and, guided by a simple push-pull motif between excitatory and inhibitory populations, climb a systematic ladder of detail. Each rung is presented first in isolation, next under forcing, and then within a coupled network, reflecting the progression from single-node to whole-brain modeling. By transforming a repertoire of disparate formalisms into a navigable ladder, we hope to turn NMM choice from a subjective act into a principled design decision, helping both theorists and experimentalists translate between scales, modalities, and interventions. In doing so, we offer a \emph{Rosetta Stone} for brain oscillation models -- one that lets the field speak a common dynamical language while preserving the dialectical richness that fuels discovery.

                arXiv:2512.10984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Symmetry-Loss, a brain-inspired algorithmic principle that enforces invariance and equivariance through a differentiable constraint derived from environmental symmetries. The framework models learning as the iterative refinement of an effective symmetry group, paralleling developmental processes in which cortical representations align with the world's structure. By minimizing structural surprise, i.e. deviations from symmetry consistency, Symmetry-Loss operationalizes a Free-Energy--like objective for representation learning. This formulation bridges predictive-coding and group-theoretic perspectives, showing how efficient, stable, and compositional representations can emerge from symmetry-based self-organization. The result is a general computational mechanism linking developmental learning in the brain with principled representation learning in artificial systems.

                arXiv:2512.10985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of 'what' and 'where' pathways of information processing in the brain was proposed almost 30 years ago, but there is still a lack of a clear mathematical model that could show how these pathways work together. We propose a biologically inspired mathematical model that uses this idea to identify and separate the self from the environment and then build and use a self-model for better predictions. This is a model of neocortical columns governed by the basal ganglia to make predictions and choose the next action, where some columns act as 'what' columns and others act as 'where' columns. Based on this model, we present a reinforcement learning agent that learns purposeful behavior in a virtual environment. We evaluate the agent on the Atari games Pong and Breakout, where it successfully learns to play. We conclude that the ability to separate the self from the environment gives advantages to the agent and therefore such a model could appear in living organisms during evolution. We propose Self-Awareness Principle 1: the ability to separate the self from the world is a necessary but insufficient condition for self-awareness.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10988">Mathematics of natural intelligence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.10988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the process of evolution, the brain has achieved such perfection that artificial intelligence systems do not have and which needs its own mathematics. The concept of cognitome, introduced by the academician K.V. Anokhin, as the cognitive structure of the mind -- a high-order structure of the brain and a neural hypernetwork, is considered as the basis for modeling. Consciousness then is a special form of dynamics in this hypernetwork -- a large-scale integration of its cognitive elements. The cognitome, in turn, consists of interconnected COGs (cognitive groups of neurons) of two types -- functional systems and cellular ensembles. K.V. Anokhin sees the task of the fundamental theory of the brain and mind in describing these structures, their origin, functions and processes in them. The paper presents mathematical models of these structures based on new mathematical results, as well as models of different cognitive processes in terms of these models. In addition, it is shown that these models can be derived based on a fairly general principle of the brain works: \textit{the brain discovers all possible causal relationships in the external world and draws all possible conclusions from them}. Based on these results, the paper presents models of: ``natural" classification; theory of functional brain systems by P.K. Anokhin; prototypical theory of categorization by E. Roche; theory of causal models by Bob Rehter; theory of consciousness as integrated information by G. Tononi.

                arXiv:2512.11738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal MRI offers complementary multi-scale information to characterize the brain structure. However, it remains challenging to effectively integrate multimodal MRI while achieving neuroscience interpretability. Here we propose to use Laplacian harmonics and spectral graph theory for multimodal alignment and multiscale integration. Based on the cortical mesh and connectome matrix that offer multi-scale representations, we devise Laplacian operators and spectral graph attentions to construct a shared latent space for model alignment. Next, we employ a disentangled learning combined with Graph Variational Autoencoder architectures to separate scale-specific and shared features. Lastly, we design a mutual information-informed bilevel regularizer to separate causal and non-causal factors based on the disentangled features, achieving robust model performance with enhanced interpretability. Our model outperforms baselines and other state-of-the-art models. The ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed modules. Our model promises to offer a robust and interpretable framework for multi-scale brain structure analysis.

Abstract: Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) is a major neurotransmitter whose release from densely distributed serotonergic varicosities shapes plasticity and network integration throughout the brain, yet its extracellular dynamics remain poorly understood due to the sub-micrometer and millisecond scales involved. We develop a mathematical framework that captures the coupled reaction-diffusion processes governing serotonin signaling in realistic tissue microenvironments. Formulating a two-dimensional compartmental-reaction diffusion system, we use strong localized perturbation theory to derive an asymptotically equivalent set of nonlinear integro-ODEs that preserve diffusive coupling while enabling efficient computation. We analyze period-averaged steady states, establish bounds using Jensen's inequality, obtain closed-form spike maxima and minima, and implement a fast marching-scheme solver based on sum-of-exponentials kernels. These mathematical results provide quantitative insight into how firing frequency, varicosity geometry, and uptake kinetics shape extracellular serotonin. The model reveals that varicosities form diffusively coupled microdomains capable of generating spatial "serotonin reservoirs," clarifies aspects of local versus volume transmission, and yields predictions relevant to interpreting high-resolution serotonin imaging and the actions of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors.

                arXiv:2512.11582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of foundation models for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series holds significant promise for predicting phenotypes related to disease and cognition. Current models, however, are often trained using a mask-and-reconstruct objective on small brain regions. This focus on low-level information leads to representations that are sensitive to noise and temporal fluctuations, necessitating extensive fine-tuning for downstream tasks. We introduce Brain-Semantoks, a self-supervised framework designed specifically to learn abstract representations of brain dynamics. Its architecture is built on two core innovations: a semantic tokenizer that aggregates noisy regional signals into robust tokens representing functional networks, and a self-distillation objective that enforces representational stability across time. We show that this objective is stabilized through a novel training curriculum, ensuring the model robustly learns meaningful features from low signal-to-noise time series. We demonstrate that learned representations enable strong performance on a variety of downstream tasks even when only using a linear probe. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive scaling analyses indicating more unlabeled data reliably results in out-of-distribution performance gains without domain adaptation.

                arXiv:2511.16465v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.

                arXiv:2512.11000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representations pervade our daily experience, from letters representing sounds to bit strings encoding digital files. While such representations require externally defined decoders to convey meaning, conscious experience appears fundamentally different: a neural state corresponding to perceiving a red square cannot alternatively encode the experience of a green square. This intrinsic property of consciousness suggests that conscious representations must be unambiguous in a way that conventional representations are not. We formalize this intuition using information theory, defining representational ambiguity as the conditional entropy H(I|R) over possible interpretations I given a representation R. Through experiments on neural networks trained to classify MNIST digits, we demonstrate that relational structures in network connectivity can unambiguously encode representational content. Using both learned decoders and direct geometric matching, we achieve perfect (100%) accuracy for dropout-trained networks and 38% for standard backpropagation in identifying output neuron class identity, despite identical task performance, demonstrating that representational ambiguity can arise orthogonally to behavioral accuracy. We further show that spatial position information of input neurons can be decoded from network connectivity with R2 up to 0.844. These results provide a quantitative method for measuring representational ambiguity in neural systems and demonstrate that neural networks can exhibit the low-ambiguity representations posited as necessary (though not sufficient) by theoretical accounts of consciousness.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11453">Learning to Evolve with Convergence Guarantee via Neural Unrolling</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.11453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from hand-crafted heuristics to data-driven evolutionary algorithms faces a fundamental dilemma: achieving neural plasticity without sacrificing mathematical stability. Emerging learned optimizers demonstrate high adaptability. However, they often lack rigorous convergence guarantees. This deficiency results in unpredictable behaviors on unseen landscapes. To address this challenge, we introduce Learning to Evolve (L2E), a unified bilevel meta-optimization framework. This method reformulates evolutionary search as a Neural Unrolling process grounded in Krasnosel'skii-Mann (KM) fixed-point theory. First, L2E models a coupled dynamic system in which the inner loop enforces a strict contractive trajectory via a structured Mamba-based neural operator. Second, the outer loop optimizes meta-parameters to align the fixed point of the operator with the target objective minimizers. Third, we design a gradient-derived composite solver that adaptively fuses learned evolutionary proposals with proxy gradient steps, thereby harmonizing global exploration with local refinement. Crucially, this formulation provides the learned optimizer with provable convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scalability of L2E in high-dimensional spaces and its robust zero-shot generalization across synthetic and real-world control tasks. These results confirm that the framework learns a generic optimization manifold that extends beyond specific training distributions.

                arXiv:2512.11743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), regarded as the third generation of artificial neural networks, are expected to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience. However, most mainstream SNN research directly adopts the rigid, chain-like hierarchical architecture of traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), ignoring key structural characteristics of the brain. Biological neurons are stochastically interconnected, forming complex neural pathways that exhibit Neuron-Expandability, Pathway-Reusability, and Dynamic-Configurability. In this paper, we introduce a new SNN paradigm, named Cognition-aware SNN (CogniSNN), by incorporating Random Graph Architecture (RGA). Furthermore, we address the issues of network degradation and dimensional mismatch in deep pathways by introducing an improved pure spiking residual mechanism alongside an adaptive pooling strategy. Then, we design a Key Pathway-based Learning without Forgetting (KP-LwF) approach, which selectively reuses critical neural pathways while retaining historical knowledge, enabling efficient multi-task transfer. Finally, we propose a Dynamic Growth Learning (DGL) algorithm that allows neurons and synapses to grow dynamically along the internal temporal dimension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogniSNN achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, current state-of-the-art SNNs on neuromorphic datasets and Tiny-ImageNet. The Pathway-Reusability enhances the network's continuous learning capability across different scenarios, while the dynamic growth algorithm improves robustness against interference and mitigates the fixed-timestep constraints during neuromorphic chip deployment. This work demonstrates the potential of SNNs with random graph structures in advancing brain-inspired intelligence and lays the foundation for their practical application on neuromorphic hardware.

                arXiv:2510.18221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore how physical scale and population size shape the emergence of complex behaviors in open-ended ecological environments. In our setting, agents are unsupervised and have no explicit rewards or learning objectives but instead evolve over time according to reproduction, mutation, and selection. As they act, agents also shape their environment and the population around them in an ongoing dynamic ecology. Our goal is not to optimize a single high-performance policy, but instead to examine how behaviors emerge and evolve across large populations due to natural competition and environmental pressures. We use modern hardware along with a new multi-agent simulator to scale the environment and population to sizes much larger than previously attempted, reaching populations of over 60,000 agents, each with their own evolved neural network policy. We identify various emergent behaviors such as long-range resource extraction, vision-based foraging, and predation that arise under competitive and survival pressures. We examine how sensing modalities and environmental scale affect the emergence of these behaviors and find that some of them appear only in sufficiently large environments and populations, and that larger scales increase the stability and consistency of these emergent behaviors. While there is a rich history of research in evolutionary settings, our scaling results on modern hardware provide promising new directions to explore ecology as an instrument of machine learning in an era of increasingly abundant computational resources and efficient machine frameworks.

                arXiv:2512.09972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing a Pareto set is pivotal for navigating the capability-efficiency trade-offs in Large Language Models (LLMs); however, existing merging techniques remain inadequate for this task. Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the "curse of dimensionality," rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints. Code is available at: https://github.com/xin8coder/BAMBO.

">δ2-Protocadherins organize parallel indirect basal ganglia circuits</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia (BG) contain multiple parallel neural circuits, each of which may control different behaviors. However, how the distinct parallel BG circuits are molecularly organized is not known. Here we show that two {delta}2-protocadherins (PCDHs), PCDH17 and PCDH10, which are homophilic cell-adhesion molecules, establish and define two distinct indirect BG circuits that regulate different behaviors. PCDH17 and PCDH10 are expressed in a complementary expression pattern in the BG, anatomically defining two parallel indirect BG connections. Indirect pathway-specific Pcdh17 and Pcdh10 conditional knockout (cKO) mice show impaired establishment of the indirect BG circuits in a region-preferential manner. Finally, the Pcdh17-cKO mice show defects in task learning, while the Pcdh10-cKO mice show defects in motor/sensory habituation. These results identify PCDH17 and PCDH10 as the molecular organizers for two distinct indirect BG circuits regulating different behaviors and reveal the molecular mechanisms for organizing parallel BG circuits.

">A bifunctional optical reporter for tracking estrogen response dynamics in neurons</a></h4>

              
                Estrogens are inherently dynamic signaling molecules whose fluctuations induce profound shifts in physiology and behavior. However, methods for tracking the dynamics of estrogen action in vivo are limited and not tissue-specific, making it difficult to directly relate dynamics to ongoing physiological, behavioral, and neural changes. Traditionally, estrogen sensitive cells have been identified by metrics such as receptor expression or radioactive ligand binding, but these measures do not capture the dynamic nature of hormone response. In addition, current methods for assessing the dynamics of estrogens in an individual, including microdialysis and vaginal cytology, lack temporal and spatial resolution.To address this need we developed a bifunctional reporter called neuro-seeER (neuronal see Estrogen Response) that can be used to track changes in exogenous and endogenous estrogen dynamics in vitro and in vivo, including longitudinally in behaving animals. We confirmed that the fluorescent response requires estrogen receptor expression, is specific to activation with estradiol, and is consistent with the timescale of transcriptional induction. Neuro-seeER expression in the hypothalamus of Esr1-Cre mice revealed dynamic labeling of estrogen-responsive cells following treatment with exogenous estradiol, and fluorescence-aided cell sorting followed by RNA-sequencing confirmed that high neuro-seeER response is associated with enriched expression of genes associated with endogenous estrogen responses. Using a novel "snapshot" photometry method to track the dynamics longitudinally in vivo, we demonstrate that we can robustly detect exogenous estrogen response across multiple hypothalamic sites simultaneously. Finally, we demonstrate that this tool is uniquely suited to capturing endogenous estrogen response dynamics in vivo across the long timescale of the estrous cycle, revealing individual differences in neural estrogen dynamics. Together, these findings reveal unexpected cellular and temporal heterogeneity of the transcriptional response and demonstrate the feasibility of tracking the dynamics of hormonal response alongside additional neural, cell signaling, or behavioral measures.

">Satellite microglia gate neuronal excitability by shielding inhibitory synapses in adult brain</a></h4>

              
                Microglia, the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, are known for sculpting excitatory neural circuits via dynamic processes. However, their role in modulating inhibitory synaptic connections in adulthood remains largely unexplored. In this study, we identified an underappreciated microglia subpopulation, satellite microglia with physical soma-soma contact with neurons, that reshape inhibitory circuit connectivity and gate neuronal activity by shielding inhibitory synapses in the adult mouse brain. Using chronic in vivo two-photon imaging in adult mice, we observed in real time that satellite microglia associations displaced perisomatic inhibitory synapses whereas their dissociation permitted inhibitory synaptogenesis. Redistribution of satellite microglia reorganized inhibitory connectivity, altered local neural networks and changed behaviors. These findings establish satellite microglia as key architects of inhibitory circuitry and suggest their broader role in neural plasticity in health and disease.

">Differential Regulation of APOE4-Mediated Astrocytic Lipid Metabolism by BMP Signaling Exacerbates Alzheimers Disease Pathologies in Neurons</a></h4>

              
                The two greatest risk factors for Alzheimers Disease (AD) are aging and Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) polymorphism, yet how these factors interact remain unclear. In this study, we investigate how bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which increases with age, contributes to APOE4-induced lipid metabolic dysfunctions using induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes and cocultured neurons. Surprisingly, BMP signaling differentially altered lipid droplet formation, cholesterol synthesis and breakdown, and fatty acid-oxidation in APOE4 compared to APOE3 astrocytes, and increased secretion of oxidized LDL (oxLDL). Furthermore, neurons cocultured with BMP4-treated APOE4 astrocytes showed altered transcriptomic profiles based on scRNA-seq as well as increased tau phosphorylation (p-tau). oxLDL treatment similarly increased p-tau and reduced neuronal survival. Conversely, lipid uptake inhibition in neurons rescued the BMP4/APOE4 astrocyte-induced neuronal phenotype. These data demonstrate key interactions between APOE4 and aging-associated molecular signaling in AD pathogenesis and establish a causal linkage between astrocytic lipid metabolism and neuronal tau hyperphosphorylation.

">Automatic binding of basic sensory features requires consciousness</a></h4>

              
                Conscious awareness requires establishing coherent percepts. Yet, whether consciousness is necessary for initiating the integration of basic sensory features remains unclear. Competing theories implicate distinct functional regimes of consciousness in the process of feature binding and creating conscious percepts. We used a novel multi-feature oddball paradigm with intracranial stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) recordings in awake and anesthetized states to investigate the functional boundary of consciousness. In the awake state, the auditory attributes of loudness and tone, as well as the binding of the two features, were automatically encoded without attention to the stimuli in a functionally localized sensory cortical network. In the anesthetized state, the cortical registration of single attributes was preserved, whereas the binding was abolished. Moreover, anesthesia mostly influenced later cortical processes after stimuli offset. These results reveal the borderline of exertion of consciousness between the encoding and manipulation of basic sensory features in local cortical circuits: the functional boundary of consciousness constrains the feedforward binding and recurrent process directly at local rather than global level computations.

">Microglia and its P2RY12 Receptors Regulate Seizure Severity</a></h4>

              
                Microglia have emerged as possible regulators of seizures with previous approaches employed being insufficiently selective of microglial-specific contributions. To more definitely determine microglial roles in seizure severity, we used the recently developed genetic microglial-deficient Csf1r{Delta}FIRE/{Delta}FIRE (FIRE KO) mouse model. In this model, mice lack microglia but retain brain border associated macrophages (BAMs). Using two experimental seizure paradigms with either a chemoconvulsant or electrical stimulation, we confirm that a microglial deficiency exacerbates seizures, reduces survival and facilitates the likelihood of developing spontaneous recurrent seizures, indicating that microglia constrain seizure activity across different seizure paradigms. To gain insights into molecular regulators of seizure severity under microglial regulation, we examined P2RY12 contributions and demonstrate that a loss of microglial P2RY12 increased seizure severity in both global and microglial-specific knockout mice indicating that microglia suppress seizure severity in chemoconvulsive models through P2RY12 signaling. During seizures, P2RY12-deficient microglia displayed altered process complexity, accompanied by increased neuronal activation and reduced inhibitory tone. These results link impaired microglial responses to heightened seizure susceptibility and network excitability. Together, our findings establish microglia as protective regulators of seizure activity and identify P2RY12 signaling as a critical mediator of microglia protective actions.

">Influenza A infection accelerates disease-associated microglia formation during physiological aging</a></h4>

              
                Severe pneumonia is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia, particularly in the elderly. Changes in microglia, the most abundant immune cell population in the brain, are also associated with cognitive decline and dementia, including the emergence of a transcriptional cell state referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAM). We sought to test the hypothesis that non-neuroinvasive influenza A virus (IAV) pneumonia results in transcriptional responses in brain microglia that drive premature expansion of DAM. Using bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing, metabolomics, and spatial transcriptomics, we profiled neuroimmune populations in young, middle-aged, and old male mice during IAV infection and recovery. We observed an increased abundance of DAM, interferon-responsive microglia (IRM), CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in white matter regions beginning in middle age and persisting in old animals, irrespective of IAV infection. DAM exhibited a metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis with disrupted TCA cycling, citrulline depletion, and an elevated itaconate/-ketoglutarate ratio. Spatial transcriptomic profiling of the human middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in normal agers, SuperAgers, and patients with dementia revealed an analogous accumulation of DAM and CD8+ T cells in white matter. IAV pneumonia induced a transient immunosenescent-like response in microglia, marked by glucocorticoid-responsive gene expression and Ccnd3 upregulation. In response to IAV pneumonia, DAM expanded in middle-aged mice, whereas old mice were elevated at baseline and were largely unaffected by IAV infection. The age-related expansion of DAM was unaffected by pharmacological depletion and repopulation of microglia with a CSF1R antagonist or genetic gain or loss of function of the phagocytic receptor MERTK, suggesting the DAM phenotype is driven by the CNS microenvironment, rather than cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Our findings suggest that IAV pneumonia induces an acute immunosenescence response in microglia and accelerates the age-dependent expansion of DAM in white matter.

">Degraded sensory coding in a mouse model of Scn2a-related disorder and its rescue by CRISPRa gene activation</a></h4>

              
                Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SCN2A, a sodium channel gene expressed in cortical pyramidal (PYR) cells, lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by autism, intellectual disability, and cortical sensory dysfunction. In Scn2a+/- mice, PYR dendritic excitability and synapses are impaired, but cortical information processing deficits are unknown. In the whisker somatosensory cortex, we found strongly degraded somatotopic tuning of PYR cells, profoundly blurred whisker maps, and impaired population coding, despite normal overall firing rates. This constitutes a robust biomarker for Scn2a-related cortical dysfunction. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons were also unexpectedly hypofunctional. We tested for rescue of coding deficits in post-critical period, young adult mice by viral delivery of CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) reagents that upregulate Scn2a. CRISPRa treatment normalized cortical sensory representations at the single-unit and map levels. This suggests that therapy to increase Scn2a expression may be effective in normalizing cortical function in Scn2a loss-of-function disorder, even in older children or adults.

">A distinct set of brain areas process prosody--the melody of speech</a></h4>

              
                Human speech carries information beyond the words themselves: pitch, loudness, duration, and pauses--jointly referred to as 'prosody'--emphasize critical words, help group words into phrases, and convey emotional and other socially-relevant information. Using a novel fMRI paradigm, we identify a set of prosody-responsive brain areas and then richly characterize them across 8 experiments (25 experimental conditions; n=51 participants). These areas--located on the lateral temporal surface bilaterally and in the frontal lobe--respond to the presence of prosody in both meaningful and meaningless speech, and are distinct from nearby temporal pitch- and speech-perception areas and from frontal areas sensitive to general cognitive and attentional demands. They are also dissociable from--but show partial overlap with--the language areas and with the area that processes dynamic facial expressions. Thus, prosodic information is processed by a distinct set of brain areas, which may help integrate linguistic meanings with non-verbal communicative signals.

">Cell-type Specific Extracellular Vesicles in Mouse Brain: Proteomic Signatures Highlight Astrocytic GlialCAM Network and GPCR Enrichment</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate intercellular communication in the central nervous system (CNS) and are emerging as biomarkers of brain health and disease. However, the molecular composition of cell type-specific brain EVs, particularly astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs), remains poorly defined. Methods: We performed comparative proteomic analysis of neuronal (NDEVs), microglial (MDEVs), and astrocytic (ADEVs) from mouse brain using magnetic immunocapture and LC-MS/MS proteomic profiling. Results: Each EV subtype displayed distinct molecular fingerprints. NDEVs were enriched in synaptic proteins and neurogenesis-related proteins (e.g., APP and BDNF), whereas MDEVs contained immune and phagocytic markers (e.g., CX3CR1). Strikingly, the ADEV proteome closely mirrored the recently characterized GlialCAM interactome from leukodystrophy research, encompassing GlialCAM/MLC1 and associated partners involved in ion and water homeostasis (EAAT1/2, AQP4, GJA1), together with GPCRs such as GPRC5B. This overlap suggests that ADEVs encapsulate a molecular scaffold characteristic of astrocytic endfeet, potentially extending their signaling functions to the extracellular space. Conclusion: Our study provides a detailed comparative proteomic characterization of brain cell-type specific EVs, revealing that ADEVs contain the GlialCAM/MLC1 network and GPCRs. These findings position ADEVs as promising candidates for EV-based biomarkers and mechanistic studies in CNS disorders.

">Visual working memory representations of naturalistic images in early visual cortex are not sensory-like</a></h4>

              
                For a long time, working memory was considered to reflect sustained activity in prefrontal and parietal areas. This has been challenged by the "sensory recruitment model" according to which sensory areas are involved in maintaining working memory representations. The main support for this comes from the finding that working memory contents can be decoded from early sensory areas during memory delay periods. However, the availability of stimulus-related information in sensory regions does not reveal whether this information is encoded in a sensory format, i.e. in the same way as sensory stimuli. Alternatively, working memory contents could be encoded in independent formats or even potentially undergo dynamic changes throughout the delay. Here, we test this question directly by requiring participants to briefly memorise naturalistic object-scenes. We directly compared the way early visual regions encoded the contents during perception and working memory maintenance. As in previous studies, we found robust stimulus-related information in early visual cortex throughout the delay. However, despite continuously robust information, the encoding of memory contents in the later delay period did not occur in the same format as during pure perception. Thus, despite the fact that sensory areas have working-memory-related information, the format of this information is not strictly sensory-like throughout the delay.

">Auditory representations of words during silent visual reading</a></h4>

              
                Silent visual reading is accompanied by the phenomenological experience of an inner voice. However, the temporal dynamics and functional role of the underlying neural representations remain unclear. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) data while humans read naturalistic narratives, and applied computational modelling to isolate time-resolved auditory from visual and semantic representations. Our results revealed robust auditory representations during silent reading that were not explained by visual or semantic features, emerging already before word onset. These auditory representations mimicked the sequence of sounds of the corresponding words in a fine-grained manner, revealing a candidate basis for the phenomenological experience of hearing an inner voice while reading. Finally, we show that auditory word representations exhibit a key signature of predictive processing: they are stronger for unexpected than expected words. More specifically, early auditory features contribute to predictions before word onset, whereas later features only contribute after word onset, suggesting distinct prediction stages. Together our results reveal the temporal dynamics and functional role of auditory representations in silent reading.

">Striatal pathology in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 mice: A comparative study with Huntingtons disease</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and Huntingtons disease (HD), are motor diseases caused by CAG expansions in ATXN1 and HTT, where SCA1 shows prominent cerebellar neurodegeneration and HD shows prominent striatal neurodegeneration, particularly in the Medium Spiny Neurons (MSNs). Since human and mouse studies demonstrate progressive striatal vulnerability in SCA1, we examined age-dependent molecular, cellular and functional striatal attributes in SCA1 (f-ATXN1146Q/2Q) knockin mice, by assessing RNA-sequencing, immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology. Striatal mRNAs are downregulated in SCA1 mice, many in common with HD mice, and specificity in MSNs is supported by the rescue of transcriptomic dysregulation with deletion of mutant Ataxin1 from MSNs. Immunohistochemistry assessed dopamine receptor 1 (D1R) and 2 (D2R) expression in indirect and direct MSNs. In HD mice (HttQ175/Q7), expression of both D1R and D2R proteins in MSNs decreased with age in parallel with their RNA levels. In the SCA1 mouse striatum, D1R protein expression decreased with age as seen in murine HD striatum. In contrast, while D2R protein level was decreased similar to D1R protein at 5-weeks of age, by 40-weeks expression of D2R protein recovered to levels recorded in WT mice. Electrophysiological assessment showed a reduction of excitatory synaptic transmission in SCA1 mouse MSNs, indicating functional deficits early in disease. In contrast to cerebellar and many other aspects of SCA1 pathology known to depend on proper nuclear localization of ATXN1 with an expanded polyglutamine, mutating ATXN1s nuclear localization failed to correct striatal MSN RNA and protein downregulations, indicating a difference in how ATXN1 exerts its pathological effects between the cerebellum and the striatum. Together, these data provide a molecular and cellular basis of striatal pathology in SCA1.

">Identifying left and right hemispheres using functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Many studies have analyzed what organizational features distinguish the left and right hemispheres of the human brain, with most differences typically being found in language areas. In this analysis, we test whether supervised learning can categorize an unseen hemisphere as right or left based on functional connectivity. Using data from the Human Connectome Project, we find success to be extremely high (accuracies > .90) in right-handed participants (Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [EHI] > 0). Accuracies are still high, but slightly lower when trained on left-handed participants (EHI <= 0). In a third analysis, we test whether the same can be done to identify handedness along with hemisphere chirality. This does not succeed, however, we show that individuals' hemispheres are less distinct the more left-handed they are. Our findings can inform developmental and post-injury work on hemispheric organization.

">Contextual associations impact visual search across multiple processing stages</a></h4>

              
                Growing evidence indicates that visual search is influenced not only by perceptual but also by semantic information. Among such semantic influences, categorical effects have been extensively studied. By contrast, the influence of contextual associations, that is, how objects commonly co-occur within specific scene contexts, remains less understood. Here, we orthogonally manipulated contextual and categorical relationships between target and distractor objects in a visual search task, while controlling for perceptual target-distractor similarity. By applying linear regression analyses, we modelled behavioral responses and event-related potentials (ERPs) from contextual, categorical, and perceptual target-distractor similarity. We found that contextual associations guide attention independently during early processing (modulating the N1pc ERP component), subsequently interact with categorical information (modulating the N2pc), and ultimately shape behavioral search performance jointly with perceptual and categorical similarity. These findings demonstrate that contextual object associations influence visual search across multiple processing stages, thereby supporting attentional guidance in everyday visual tasks.

">Conserved phenotype and function of human brain border-associated macrophages in iPSC-derived models</a></h4>

              
                Border-associated macrophages (BAMs) are increasingly implicated in protective brain functions including the removal of pathogenic material such as amyloid-beta. However, there is a lack of available and deeply characterized human BAM models. Here, we report that postnatal transplantation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived hematopoietic progenitors to the murine brain sufficiently chimerizes the brain border immune compartment to allow functional interrogations. Human xenotransplanted BAMs (xBAMs) line the leptomeninges and brain vasculature beyond the glia limitans. Via single-cell RNA sequencing, we show that a conserved transcriptional signature distinguishes BAMs from microglia across species origin, age, and genetic background. Both xBAMs and murine BAMs are defined by a hyper-endocytic phenotype and function, surpass other brain macrophages in acute amyloid-beta scavenging, and exhibit compartment-restricted sampling of parenchymal material. Using a modified differentiation protocol, we find that we can generate iPS-derived BAM-like cells (iBAMs) in vitro, which are also characterized by a hyper-endocytic phenotype and enhanced engulfment capacity relative to iPS-derived microglia-like cells (iMGLs). Together, these data define a conserved hyper-endocytic BAM phenotype and provide a toolbox for studying human BAMs both in vivo and in vitro.

">The hierarchical organization of human praxis: A lesion-connectome mapping study of limb and oral apraxias</a></h4>

              
                The neural architecture underlying apraxias remains a complex puzzle. While primary motor cortices exhibit clear somatotopic organization, it is unclear whether this segregation extends to the higher-order networks governing skilled actions. Furthermore, the dissociation between verbal (apraxia of speech, AOS) and non-verbal (buccofacial apraxia, BFA) oral motor control remains debated. We investigated the neuroanatomical substrates of limb apraxia (LA), BFA, and AOS in 136 patients with acute left-hemisphere ischemic stroke using voxel-based, region-of-interest-based, and connectome-based lesion-symptom mapping. Our results revealed a fundamental anatomical dissociation extending beyond simple effector specificity. LA was associated with damage to the inferior parietal lobule and widespread white matter disconnections, specifically involving intra-hemispheric temporo-parietal pathways and massive inter-hemispheric transcallosal fibers. In contrast, BFA was attributable to focal cortical lesions centered on the ventral precentral and postcentral gyri, without significant involvement of long-range white matter tracts. AOS showed no significant lesion overlap at the population level, suggesting a highly focal etiology distinct from the premotor patterns of BFA. These findings indicate that LA and BFA differ not only in their effectors but in their network dependency: LA relies on a distributed, bilaterally integrated temporo-parietal network for multimodal action control, whereas BFA depends on localized proprioceptive-motor loops in the ventral sensorimotor cortex. This study provides a structural framework for the hierarchical organization of human praxis, distinguishing between distributed network disconnections and focal cortical dysfunctions.

                Background Chronic diseases impose a substantial global health burden, with outcomes frequently compromised by suboptimal long-term patient engagement and adherence to treatment regimens. Gamification, the application of game-design principles in non-game contexts, has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance patient motivation and self-management. Methods This paper introduces a comprehensive, theory-driven gamification framework designed for integration within a Virtual Health Coach (VHC) system for chronic disease management. Based on Self-Determination Theory, Behavioural Economics, and the Health Belief Model, the framework synthesises five core components: adaptive challenges tailored to individual progress, interactive educational modules, structured reward incentives, social support features, and seamless integration with wearable devices for real-time feedback. Results Recognising that implementation is impeded by challenges such as the digital divide, data privacy concerns, and the risk of user fatigue, this work also proposes a robust analytics framework to guide evaluation and continuous refinement. This evaluation model employs a mixed-methods approach, combining metrics for user engagement, clinical health outcomes, and patient-reported satisfaction with A/B testing and machine learning for predictive analytics. Conclusions The proposed gamified VHC architecture offers a blueprint for developing adaptive, personalised, and sustainable digital health interventions that can enhance patient adherence and improve outcomes, thereby advancing the paradigm of patient-centred chronic care.

<p>RT-fMRI neurofeedback targeting the amygdala-hippocampus complex was followed by changes in amygdala connectivity with prefrontal, temporal, and occipital regions in depressed youth. Neurofeedback was also associated with hemisphere-specific amygdala-cuneus shifts that were associated with improvements in rumination and depression symptoms.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Major depressive disorder is a significant health concern among adolescents due to its link to suicide and lifetime impairments. Current treatments yield limited success, but real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (RT-fMRI) neurofeedback (NF) is a promising intervention. We tested the effects of RT-fMRI neurofeedback on the modulation of neural circuitry underlying self-referential processing and emotion regulation in youth trying to up-regulate the amygdala-hippocampus (AMYHIPP) complex. We examined amygdala functional connectivity during a self-other face recognition task before and after RT-fMRI NF from the AMYHIPP complex. (1) Depressed youth showed higher bilateral amygdala to anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), superior temporal and frontal gyri connectivity compared to controls, who showed lower connectivity before NF. Yet after NF, this pattern reversed, with depressed youth showing lower bilateral amygdala connectivity than controls. (2) Depressed youth showed <i>increased right</i> amygdala-cuneus connectivity while controls showed <i>increased left</i> amygdala-cuneus connectivity during self-other face recognition. (3) Lower right amygdala-cuneus connectivity was linked to improved rumination. Higher left amygdala-cuneus connectivity was linked to improved depression. (4) Shifts of less right versus left amygdala to superior middle temporal gyri connectivity after neurofeedback, and of more right versus left amygdala to middle frontal gyrus after NF, were linked to higher AMYHIPP engagement during training. This is suggestive of NF training effects upon implicit versus explicit emotion circuits. Caution is necessary regarding the meaning of symptoms to circuits associations and putative mechanisms of neurofeedback training given the lack of a placebo group.</p>

">Intra- and Interhemispheric Signatures of Criticality at the Onset of Synchronization</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortex must flexibly alternate between locally segregated activity that supports specialization and long-range interactions that enable integration. How cortical networks balance these competing demands remains unclear. We propose that fluctuations around a critical point between ordered and disordered phases provide a natural framework to understand coordinated neuronal activity across scales. Using simultaneous spiking recordings from the left and right prefrontal cortex (PFC) of freely behaving rats, we found that signatures of criticality emerged at the onset of neuronal synchronization, both locally within individual hemispheres and globally across the combined population. Over time, cortical activity explored a continuum of intra- and interhemispheric synchrony levels, including states in which neurons were locally desynchronized yet maintained interhemispheric coupling. A computational model operating near its critical regime reproduced these empirical patterns, capturing the characteristic relationship between local and long-range coordination. These results suggest that cortical networks achieve flexible transitions between local and global computation by fluctuating around a critical regime.

">Integrative Analysis of Spatial Transcriptome and Connectome by SpaCon</a></h4>

              
                The brain's structure and function arise from its complex molecular composition and neural connectivity, yet the relationship between cell-type-specific gene expression and brain-wide connectivity is not well understood. By integrating single-cell resolution spatial transcriptomics and connectomics, we reveal a tight coupling between gene expression and anatomical connectivity in the cortico-thalamic circuit, and identify specific gene expression in axons of the corpus callosum that reflect their cortical origins. Building on these findings, we developed SpaCon, a graph attention autoencoder that uses a tunable hyperparameter to flexibly integrate global connectivity with local gene expression. To enable analysis at the whole-brain scale, SpaCon introduces an efficient neighbor sampling strategy that drastically reduces computational requirements without compromising performance. This architecture allows the model to identify functionally relevant three-dimensional domains defined by both molecular identity and shared connectivity patterns, even when spatially distant. Validated across diverse datasets and species, SpaCon significantly enhances the prediction of connectivity from gene expression and improves the spatial classification of neuronal subtypes. SpaCon thus provides a powerful, scalable, and versatile framework for understanding the complex relationship between transcriptome and connectome.

">A logarithmic theory of visuomotor stabilization</a></h4>

              
                Although many animals rely on visual information to navigate, optic flow is inherently ambiguous as it confounds information about motion speed and object distance. As a result, the visual feedback produced by a given motor command is context-dependent and requires an appropriately adapted response. Recent experiments have investigated how the fish Danionella cerebrum use visual cues to stabilize their position against simulated external currents. Logarithmic sensorimotor transformations have been proposed to enable adaptive responses to perturbations while preventing delay-induced instabilities. Here, we develop the theoretical framework introduced for continuous locomotion to show how logarithmic coding naturally gives rise to this adaptive behavior. The system is modeled by a nonlinear delay differential equation, which is analyzed using dynamical systems theory. We further analyze experimental data to uncover the mechanisms underlying swimming initiation and positional drift correction. Finally, we extend our framework to intermittent locomotion, resulting in a nonlinear difference equation, and show that it still produces robust adaptive behavior. This is motivated by the literature on zebrafish, where visuomotor stabilization has been extensively studied, but burst-and-coast swimming obscures the underlying adaptation mechanism. We show that our theory can reproduce the experimental results reported for motor adaptation in zebrafish without invoking internal models. Overall, our results highlight logarithmic coding as a unifying principle for visuomotor stability across continuous and intermittent locomotor regimes.

">A frontal motor circuit for economic decisions and actions</a></h4>

              
                Flexible behaviour requires transforming abstract cognitive representations, such as value preferences, into concrete motor actions. During economic decision-making, individuals evaluate options to guide choices and then transform these choices into specific actions to obtain rewards, yet the neural circuit mechanisms linking abstract choices to spatial actions remain unclear. Here we show that a frontal motor network performs this transformation through dynamic circuit reconfiguration across decision stages. Using a mouse task that temporally dissociates value-guided decisions from spatial action planning, cortex-wide optogenetic perturbations revealed that a specific frontal motor circuit was causally required for both abstract and motor stages of choice. Electrophysiological recordings during abstract decision-making showed that frontal motor neurons encoded option values and economic choices independently of sensorimotor contingencies, and unilateral silencing impaired decisions without spatial bias. During spatial planning, value and spatial signals were integrated to guide action selection, and unilateral silencing produced an ipsilateral bias. A dynamical model captured this transformation, predicting a shift from distributed interhemispheric maintenance of economic choice to lateralized control of actions, which we validated with simultaneous bilateral recordings. These findings demonstrate how frontal motor circuits reconfigure their interactions to convert cognitive decisions into motor actions, providing a circuit-level mechanism for flexible, value-guided behaviour.

">EEG Reveals Robust Within-Person but Unstable Between-Person Neural Encoding of Pain</a></h4>

              
                The perception of pain varies both within and between individuals, even when sensory input remains constant. Understanding how the brain encodes these intra- and interindividual variations is essential for elucidating the neural mechanisms of pain in health and disease. Yet, previous findings have been inconsistent, and their robustness, in terms of both repeatability and replicability, has remained unclear. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) in 161 healthy participants to re-investigate the neural correlates of intra- and inter-individual variations in the perception of brief painful stimuli, independent of stimulus intensity. Using Bayesian multivariate multi-model regression, we related pain ratings to evoked (N1, N2, P2) and induced oscillatory responses (alpha, beta, gamma). To assess the robustness of our findings, the experiment was repeated after four weeks in the same participants and replicated in an independent cohort (n = 111). This design allowed us to examine within-person variability at both short (moment-to-moment) and long (day-to-day) timescales. Inter-individual differences in pain were primarily associated with the P2 response, an effect that was repeatable in the same but not replicable in the independent cohort. In contrast, intra-individual variations were explained by a multicomponent EEG pattern that was both repeatable across time and replicable across cohorts. These findings demonstrate that intra- and inter-individual variability in pain is differentially encoded in the human brain and reveal greater robustness of within-person brain-behavior associations. EEG markers may therefore be more suitable for tracking longitudinal changes in pain within individuals than for comparing pain sensitivity across individuals.

">Short Excitatory Projections Promote Burst Activity and Modular Functional Organization in Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Physical constraints in the brain favor short, distance-dependent connections. However, short-range projections are not merely a compromise imposed by these constraints; they also serve essential functional roles. Here, we explore networks with balanced excitation and inhibition, demonstrating that short excitatory projections fundamentally increase the number of common presynaptic inputs, thereby enhancing the correlations of neural responses. Strengthened recurrent correlations can lead to bursting states, amplifying postsynaptic neuronal activity and supporting signal propagation over long distances within the network. Moreover, even without an explicitly imposed modular structure, short excitatory connections can give rise to functional clustering and support a broad spectrum of modular functions. Therefore, this structural principle provides a mechanistic basis for functional column formation and dynamic burst propagation, suggesting that the brain transforms structural wiring constraints into opportunities for complex computation and distributed processing. These findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of how the brain transforms structural limitations into opportunities for complex computation.

">Systematic comparison of color representations between humans and deep neural networks: towards predicting human color perception in a vast color space</a></h4>

              
                The representational structure of human color perception, particularly within vast color spaces, remains incompletely understood. While representational structures for dozens of colors have been studied, exploring structures spanning hundreds or thousands of colors has been infeasible due to the time costs of psychophysical experiments. Given these constraints, deep neural networks (DNNs) have attracted attention as a promising tool for providing proxies or predictions of human perception beyond the scope of psychophysical experiments. However, it remains unclear which DNN models possess internal representations that geometrically align with human color perception. Furthermore, it is unclear which learning paradigm enables DNNs to acquire a color representation that is geometrically aligned with that of humans. Here, we systematically investigate which learning paradigm enables DNNs to produce a color representation that is structurally congruent with that of humans, with a focus on three types: self-supervised learning (SSL) that trains on images alone, supervised learning (SL) that trains on images with category labels, and contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) that trains on image-text pairs. We compared internal representations of DNNs with the human similarity judgments of 93 colors using a rigorous unsupervised method termed Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (GWOT), which reveals whether the representational structures of humans and models align at the fine-item level. Our results show that only the CLIP paradigm acquires color representations that strongly align with human data at the fine-item level. Furthermore, when we leveraged a key advantage of DNNs and investigated a substantial representational structure of 4096 colors, the human-aligned CLIP models consistently converged on a non-trivial distorted ring-like structure, which presents a plausible prediction for the large-scale human color representation. Our work demonstrates an approach for exploring unknown territories of human perception through the use of computational models validated in a limited empirical space, and provides predictions for future large-scale psychophysical experiments.

">Intrinsic persistent firing in CA1 encodes elapsed time across behaviorally relevant scales</a></h4>

              
                The ability to encode and maintain temporal relationships is crucial for learning, predicting, and forming episodic memories. While hippocampal time cells and entorhinal temporal context cells are well-established in vivo, it remains unclear whether single neurons can sustain representations of elapsed time over multi-second intervals, independent of synaptic drive. Here, using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rodent hippocampal CA1 slices under synaptic blockade, we show that following a brief current pulse, many neurons exhibit exponentially decaying firing rates with a broad distribution of time constants extending to tens of seconds. This indicates that single neurons possess intrinsic mechanisms capable of covering behaviorally relevant temporal scales. These results highlight that single neurons can encode temporal information over more than an order of magnitude, providing a potential cellular substrate for temporal coding in the brain.

">Evaluating the effects of regularization and cross-validation parameters on the performance of SVM-based decoding of EEG data</a></h4>

              
                Regularization has been extensively used in multivariate pattern classification (MVPA; decoding) of EEG data to mitigate the risk of overfitting. N-fold cross-validation is also used to mitigate this risk, and it is often combined with averaging across trials to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. However, the impact of different regularization and cross-validation parameters on decoding performance remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of variations in the support vector machine (SVM) regularization parameter (C) and the number of crossfolds (and the number of trials per average) on the performance of SVM-based decoding analyses. To achieve this, we examined the decoding performance in relatively simple binary classification tasks from seven commonly used event-related potential paradigms (N170, mismatch negativity, N2pc, P3b, N400, lateralized readiness potential, and error-related negativity). Additionally, we evaluated the decoding performance in more challenging multiclass tasks, including decoding face identity, facial expression, stimulus location, and stimulus orientation. The results revealed that both decoding accuracy and effect size were highest when the regularization strength was equal to or greater than 1. Furthermore, using between 3 and 5 folds with at least 10 trials per average yielded optimal decoding performance in most cases. Researchers applying SVM-based decoding to datasets similar to those examined here-in terms of population, recording systems, class numbers, and paradigms-might benefit from using the parameters that we found to be optimal here.

                Mesoscopic brain imaging, enabled by advances in tissue clearing, light-sheet microscopy, and large-scale image processing, allows detailed analysis of cellular and molecular architecture across whole neural circuits. However, applying these methods to postmortem human brain tissue is hindered by strong autofluorescence, high tissue density, and fixation-induced damage. We introduce CleLight, a light-enhanced clearing method that increases tissue transparency while quenching autofluorescence. Combined with complementary chemical treatments, CleLight supports multiplexed immunolabeling and high-resolution imaging of centimeter-thick, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human brain sections. It is compatible with a wide range of antibodies and fluorescent dyes, enabling the visualization of physiological and pathological features across diverse CNS regions in healthy and diseased samples. CleLight offers a simple, robust, and scalable workflow for clearing, deep labeling, and volumetric imaging of human brain tissue. Its compatibility with conventional histology and archival material makes it well suited for organ-wide pathological studies in large patient cohorts and historical brain collections.

">Early pathogenesis of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy uncovered by human iPSC-derived motor neurons highlights pathogenic neuropeptides as therapeutic targets</a></h4>

              
                Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by the expansion of the polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor (AR). Motor neurons (MNs) derived from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) robustly recapitulated early SBMA phenotypes driven by endogenous mutant AR in the absence of testosterone (dihydrotestosterone) and detectable mutant AR aggregation. Notably, endoplasmic reticulum stress markedly exacerbated SBMA pathology. Cross-species integrative analyses of patient-derived neurons and spinal cords of transgenic mouse models revealed high expression of multiple disease-associated neuropeptides, including urotensin II (UTS2), in patient spinal MNs that was correlated with disease onset and progression in iPSC-derived MNs. Downstream signaling analyses of these neuropeptides revealed convergent molecular pathways whose pharmacological inhibition rescued cellular phenotypes. Together, these results establish a human disease model harboring endogenous mutant AR that closely reproduces early SBMA pathology and provides molecular leads for elucidating disease mechanisms and biomarkers and developing therapeutic targets.

">Proficiency-Dependent and Dynamic Reorganization of Brain Networks During Children's Second Language Learning</a></h4>

              
                Children's second language (L2) vocabulary learning is often indexed with event-related potentials (ERPs) by the N400 incongruity effect, yet its stability in real classrooms is unclear. We recorded 64-channel EEG from 42 children (aged 9-15 years) during a translation-recognition task before and after a regular instructional vocabulary unit and sub-grouped children by baseline proficiency. We quantified the canonical N400 (300-500 ms, centroparietal region of interest; ROI) alongside electrical-neuroimaging indices of ERP strength and topography (Global Field Power, Global Map Dissimilarity, ERP template-map preponderance), using adult template maps from a prior study as a normative reference. Behaviorally, children showed large gains in vocabulary accuracy and higher discrimination sensitivity (d') in post-assessment. The classical N400 incongruity effect did not increase from pre- to post-learning. By contrast, global and topographic measures were learning-sensitive: Global Field Power increased across sessions and interacted with proficiency, and Global Map Dissimilarity showed main effects of session and proficiency as well as their interaction, indicating proficiency-dependent topographic reorganization. Adult normative template maps backfitted well; within the N400 window, high-proficiency children more consistently occupied an adult-like configuration; later (~650-800 ms), patterns also differentiated by proficiency and congruency. Relative to adults, children exhibited more diffuse topographies and stronger dependence on individual proficiency. In classroom settings, children's L2 vocabulary learning is therefore more sensitively indexed by scalp topography and global field dynamics than by a single N400 amplitude, positioning electrical neuroimaging as a proficiency-dependent, classroom-relevant marker of L2 acquisition.

                <p>RNA localization to neuronal axons and dendrites provides spatiotemporal control over gene expression to support synapse function. Neuronal messenger RNAs (mRNAs) localize as ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), commonly known as RNA granules, the composition of which influences when and where proteins are made. High-throughput sequencing has revealed thousands of mRNAs that localize to the hippocampal neuropil. Whether these mRNAs are spatially organized into common RNA granules or distributed as independent mRNAs for proper delivery to synapses is debated. Here, using highly multiplexed single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (HiPlex smFISH) and colocalization analyses, we investigate the subcellular spatial distribution of 15 synaptic neuropil localized mRNAs in the male and female rodent hippocampus. We observed that these mRNAs are present in the neuropil as heterogeneously sized fluorescent puncta with spatial colocalization patterns that generally scale by neuropil mRNA abundance. Indeed, differentially expressed mRNAs across cell types displayed colocalization patterns that scaled by abundance, as did simulations that reproduce cell-specific differences in abundance. Thus, the probability of these mRNAs colocalizing in the neuropil is best explained by stochastic interactions based on abundance, which places constraints on the mechanisms mediating efficient transport to synapses.</p>

                The integration of digital technology in vocational education has redefined instructional delivery and learner engagement. However, the extent to which technology enhances learning depends largely on the quality of teacher–student interaction. This study investigates the mediating role of Teacher–Student Interaction (TSI) in the relationship between the Technology-Enhanced Learning Environment (TEL) and Learning Engagement (LE). Drawing on the Community of Inquiry (CoI) and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) frameworks, this research tested a structural model to explain how interaction bridges technological and pedagogical processes in vocational learning contexts. A total of 362 valid responses were collected from vocational students across Indonesia using a stratified sampling approach. The data were analyzed through Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) using SmartPLS 4 with 5,000 bootstrap samples. The results demonstrated that TEL positively influenced TSI (β = 0.71, p < .001) and LE (β = 0.39, p < .01). Moreover, TSI significantly predicted LE (β = 0.53, p < .001). The indirect pathway from TEL to LE through TSI was also significant (β = 0.37, p < .001), indicating partial mediation with a Variance Accounted for (VAF) of 48.7%. The model achieved an excellent fit (χ2/df = 2.31, CFI = 0.953, TLI = 0.947, SRMR = 0.046, RMSEA = 0.048) and explained 55% of the variance in TSI and 68% in LE. These findings affirm that technology integration enhances learning engagement primarily when mediated by active teacher–student interaction. The study underscores that digital transformation in vocational education must emphasize pedagogical presence and communicative interaction to sustain engagement, particularly in remote and under-resourced (3T) regions.

Computational modeling of peripheral nerve fibers is a key tool for designing improved neuromodulation therapies. The NEURON software is commonly used to create biophysical simulations of nerve fibers, often in the outdated HOC language. Whether written in HOC or Python, implementing fiber simulations involves a steep learning curve and requires a large amount of standard, boilerplate code that is typically written anew for each project. There is a need for a code package that standardizes and simplifies the creation of model fibers, the execution of simulations of electrical stimulation, and the analysis of the resulting data. We created PyFibers, a NEURON-Python package that provides tools for accomplishing all these tasks and supports the development of new fiber models and stimulation protocols. PyFibers includes 11 fiber models from prior publications under a shared framework, and we validated each model’s implementation in PyFibers against the original results. Our open-source tool simplifies and standardizes computational modeling of peripheral nerve fiber responses to electrical stimulation, providing a platform for the development of novel therapies using electrical stimulation, block, and recording.

                <p>by Yuqing Hou, Oranti Ahmed Omi, Michael W. Stuck, Xi Cheng, Bethany Walker, Ying-Wai Lam, Anna M. Schmoker, Son N. Nguyen, Maria Paz Gonzalez-Perez, Bryan A. Ballif, Karl F. Lechtreck, George B. Witman, Gregory J. Pazour</p>

Variants in the protein kinase CDKL5 cause CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD), a severe neurodevelopmental condition characterized by seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. The <i>Chlamydomonas</i> homolog of CDKL5, LF5, is a flagellar protein whose loss leads to elongated flagella. Here, we combine live-cell imaging, immunofluorescence, and biochemical approaches including mass spectrometry to define how CDKL5 activity is regulated and how its loss alters ciliary function. We find that <i>Chlamydomonas</i> CDKL5 is activated by LF2, a cyclin-dependent kinase, through phosphorylation of its activation loop. This activation controls CDKL5 localization in steady-state cilia, down-regulates its IFT-mediated transport as flagella reach steady-state, controls ciliary abundance of IFT proteins, and controls phosphorylation of the tubulin-binding domain of IFT74, thereby influencing flagellar length. Mouse Cdkl5 shows similar properties: it localizes within cilia, its loss leads to ciliary elongation, and its localization depends on both its kinase activity and Cdk20, the mammalian ortholog of LF2. These results extend our understanding of ciliary length control, challenge the prevailing model that CDKL5 is activated by autophosphorylation, and suggest that CDD pathogenesis arises, at least in part, from disruption of this conserved ciliary regulatory pathway.

                <p>by Ben Vezina, Helena B. Cooper, Christopher K. Barlow, Martin Rethoret-Pasty, Sylvain Brisse, Jonathan M. Monk, Kathryn E. Holt, Kelly L. Wyres</p>

The <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> species complex inhabits a wide variety of hosts and environments, and is a major cause of antimicrobial resistant infections. Genomics has revealed the population comprises multiple species/sub-species and hundreds of distinct co-circulating sub-lineage (SLs) that are associated with distinct gene complements. A substantial fraction of the pan-genome is predicted to be involved in metabolic functions and hence these data are consistent with metabolic differentiation at the SL level. However, this has so far remained unsubstantiated because in the past it was not possible to explore metabolic variation at scale. Here, we used a combination of comparative genomics and high-throughput genome-scale metabolic modeling to systematically explore metabolic diversity across the <i>K. pneumoniae</i> species complex (<i>n</i> = 7,835 genomes). We simulated growth outcomes for each isolate using carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur sources under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (<i>n</i> = 1,278 conditions per isolate). We showed that the distributions of metabolic genes and growth capabilities are structured in the population, and confirmed that SLs exhibit unique metabolic profiles. In vitro co-culture experiments demonstrated reciprocal commensalistic cross-feeding between SLs, effectively extending the range of conditions supporting individual growth. We propose that these substrate specializations may promote the existence and persistence of co-circulating SLs by reducing nutrient competition and facilitating commensal interactions. Our findings have implications for understanding the eco-evolutionary dynamics of <i>K. pneumoniae</i> and for the design of novel strategies to prevent opportunistic infections caused by this World Health Organization priority antimicrobial resistant pathogen.

The liver’s regenerative capacity is underscored by the plasticity potential of adult hepatocytes. In this context, hepatocyte-to-cholangiocyte transdifferentiation (HCT) has been ascribed with pro-regenerative functions in animal models and is a feature of end-stage human chronic liver diseases. While dampened activities of hepatocyte identity transcription factors (TFs) underlay HCT, how the cholangiocyte transcriptional program is implemented is poorly defined. Here, we identify that HCT does not involve transitioning through a hepatoblast-like transcriptional program. Furthermore, we show that HCT primarily involves induction of the archetypal transcriptional program of monopolarized epithelial cells initially repressed in hepatocytes. Indeed, HCT requires relieving H3K27me3-mediated and polycomb-dependent epigenetic silencing of epithelial TF encoding genes including <i>Grainyhead Like Transcription Factor 2</i> (<i>GRHL2</i>). Ectopic expression of GRHL2 in hepatocytes, including in vivo in the adult mouse liver, induces epithelial genes reminiscent of those activated during HCT. Finally, GRHL2 is detected in human hepatocytes undergoing HCT as evidenced using samples from end-stage chronic liver diseases. Hence, HCT is a process chiefly characterized by induction of a conventional epithelial transcriptional program originally lacking in hepatocytes promoted by derepression of the master epithelial TF GRHL2.

The molecular basis of endospore formation in the model gram-positive bacterium <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> has been investigated for over half a century. Here, using high throughput and classical genetic approaches, we performed a comparative analysis of sporulation in the human pathogen <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>. A transposon-sequencing screen identified >150 genes required for <i>B. anthracis</i> sporulation. As anticipated, many of the genes that are critical for sporulation in <i>B. subtilis</i> were also required for <i>B. anthracis</i> sporulation. However, we identified >50 genes that are important for sporulation in <i>B. anthracis</i> but not in <i>B. subtilis,</i> and 22 <i>B. anthracis</i> sporulation genes that are absent from the <i>B. subtilis</i> genome. To validate the hits from our screen, we generated an ordered transposon-mutant library using Knockout Sudoku. Cytological analysis of a subset of the canonical sporulation-defective mutants revealed similar but not identical phenotypes in the pathogen compared to the model. We investigated several of the newly identified sporulation genes, with an in-depth analysis of one, ORF <i>04167</i>, renamed <i>ipdA</i>. Sporulating cells lacking <i>ipdA</i> are blocked in the morphological process of engulfment, generating septal bulges. An AlphaFold-Multimer screen and a classical genetic enrichment revealed that IpdA is a secreted inhibitor of the polysaccharide deacetylase PdaN. Our data support a model in which induction of IpdA at the onset of sporulation inhibits deacetylation of the cell wall peptidoglycan (PG), enabling the sporulation-specific PG hydrolases to catalyze engulfment. Altogether, our studies reveal that <i>B. subtilis</i> is an excellent model for endospore formation in <i>B. anthracis</i>, while underscoring the importance of direct analysis in <i>B. anthracis</i>. The suite of tools that we have generated will catalyze the molecular dissection of sporulation and other cell biological processes in this important human pathogen.

Red blood cell production is one of the most dynamic processes, yet the underlying mechanisms responsible are only partially understood. A new study in PLOS Biology suggests a broadly applicable mechanism able to balance the maintenance of the steady-state and effective stress response.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-927/v2?src=rss">StaggR: an interactive R/Shiny application for planning and visualizing staggered experimental protocols [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Biological experiments often require a series of precisely timed operations, and small variations in treatment can result in inconsistent or biased results. To handle multiple samples in parallel with precise temporal resolution, experimentalists may stagger treatments by initiating the workflow of one sample during the wait or incubation time of another. However, as the number of samples processed in parallel and the number of operations increase, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify and execute valid treatment regimens that permit the handling of each sample. To address this, I developed StaggR, an interactive web application that calculates and visualizes compatible staggering intervals for parallelized execution of identical processing workflows. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for defining protocol operations, durations, and wait times. It can automatically calculate the shortest possible conflict-free interval for initiating sample treatments, or allow users to simulate specific intervals to explore potential treatment regimens or bottlenecks. Using StaggR, users of any experience level can rapidly generate complete, color-coded experimental schedules, visualize these workflows in an easy-to-read chart, and execute them using a built-in timer displaying a treatment schedule with live updates. The experimental designs can be saved, shared, and re-imported, ensuring full reproducibility and user control. The application of StaggR is expected to expedite the design and throughput of complex experimental workflows while maximizing reproducibility.

                Background This study investigated circulating levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and their association with objective sleep parameters in adults with chronic insomnia compared to normal sleepers. Methods A total of 46 participants were enrolled, including 26 individuals with chronic insomnia and 20 normal sleepers. Serum concentrations of BDNF and GDNF were measured, and sleep architecture was analyzed using overnight polysomnography. Group comparisons were conducted using Mann-Whitney U tests, while Spearman’s correlation and multiple regression analyses examined relationships between neurotrophic factors, sleep metrics, and demographic characteristics. Results Participants with insomnia showed significantly impaired objective sleep quality, with lower sleep efficiency (Median: 52.84% vs. 74.65%, p<0.001) and reduced total sleep time (Median: 3.99 h vs. 5.74 h, p<0.001) compared to controls. However, there were no significant differences in circulating BDNF (p=0.610) or GDNF (p=0.249) levels between groups. Correlation analyses across the entire sample revealed no significant associations between either BDNF or GDNF and sleep efficiency (BDNF: ρ = 0.141, p = 0.215; GDNF: ρ = 0.086, p = 0.449) or total sleep time. Multiple regression analysis indicated that sleep efficiency independently predicted BDNF levels (p=0.034), though the overall regression model was not significant (F(4,41)=1.309, p=0.283; R2=0.113). The GDNF regression model was also non-significant (F(4,41)=1.315, p=0.281; R2=0.114). A strong positive correlation was detected between BDNF and GDNF (ρ=0.835, p<0.001). Conclusions The study verified significant objective sleep impairments in individuals with chronic insomnia but found no differences in BDNF or GDNF levels between groups. While bivariate associations with sleep quality were absent, regression results suggest a complex link between sleep efficiency and BDNF. The limited sample size constrains interpretation, implying that larger studies are needed to validate these preliminary findings and to explore the strong interrelationship between BDNF and GDNF.

                Background Extrusion-spheronization is the most commonly used technology to produce pellets using microcrystalline cellulose as a pelletizing agent. However, it has the major drawbacks of lack of disintegration and prolonged drug release. This study aimed to develop rapidly disintegrating microcrystalline cellulose-based pellets. Methods Several pellet formulations were prepared via extrusion spheronization using a combination of microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, polyethylene glycol 400(PEG 400), polyplasdone (PPXL), and croscarmellose sodium (CCS). Subsequently, they were evaluated for their physical characteristics. Results Process optimization indicated that 500 RPM is the ideal extrusion speed. Furthermore, the best spheronization speed was to start with a speed of 3000 RPM speed to cut off the extrudate at a shorter length and then lower the speed to 1000 RPM to reduce fine production and allow for spherical pellet formation. Increasing the polyethylene glycol content to 20% and maintaining the percentages of croscarmellose sodium (15%), 15%), and polyplasdone xl (5%), respectively, demonstrated a significant improvement in disintegration time (DT). Conclusions MCC-based pellets with fast-disintegrating characteristics were obtained by extrusion and spheronization. Incorporating the soluble filler mannitol, hydrophilic polymer PEG 400 with super-disintegrant CCS, and PPXL 400 resulted in a more porous matrix that facilitated water entry and rapid swelling of the pellets to explode and disintegrate quickly (2 min).

                Background Breastfeeding is vital for maternal and child health, yet breastfeeding practices and duration vary globally. In Tunisia, data on factors influencing breastfeeding, especially initiation timing, are limited. This study assessed breastfeeding practices, initiation timing, and associated maternal and delivery factors among Tunisian women, focusing on breastfeeding duration up to 12 months postpartum. Methods Analytical cross-sectional study was conducted over a four-month period, from November 1, 2023, to February 29, 2024, in the Gynecology and Obstetrics Department B of Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis- Tunisia. Women who delivered during the study period were included. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, medical and obstetric history, breastfeeding knowledge and preparation, delivery, postpartum and breastfeeding practices were collected through a questionnaire. Breastfeeding duration was grouped into 1–3, 3–6, and >6 months. Associations with breastfeeding duration were analyzed. Results In total, 400 women were included. Most women were Tunisian (99%), urban residents (91.5%), and of higher socioeconomic status (84.3%). Obesity was present in 20.5%, and cesarean delivery rate was 52.8%. Early breastfeeding initiation (within 1 hour) occurred in only 19.3%, with 80.8% delayed initiation. Breastfeeding continuation at 12 months was 44% and was significantly associated with early initiation (p < 0.001); 77.9% of women who initiated breastfeeding within the first hour continued at 12 months, compared to markedly lower rates among those with delayed initiation. Maternal obesity predicted shorter breastfeeding duration (p = 0.026). Cesarean delivery showed no significant impact. Skin-to-skin contact was low (38.3%), and less than half received breastfeeding education (46%). Family support was not linked to breastfeeding duration. Conclusions Breastfeeding continuation at 12 months was associated with early initiation and negatively influenced by maternal obesity. Despite high breastfeeding intention, delays in initiation, obesity and limited breastfeeding education hinder optimal breastfeeding outcomes. Interventions promoting early initiation, skin-to-skin contact, and tailored postnatal support are needed to improve breastfeeding continuation.

                Background Sleep disturbances frequently occur in concomitance with chronic pain, exacerbating its detrimental effects and diminishing patients’ quality of life. Although various studies have explored the relationship between chronic pain and sleep disturbances, comprehensive evidence on detailed assessment methods and their bidirectional interactions remains limited. This scoping review aimed to examine the characteristics and prevalence of assessment methods for sleep and pain-related outcomes in individuals with chronic pain. Methods A comprehensive search of nine databases identified observational and interventional studies examining the relationship between sleep disturbances/disorders and chronic pain in adults. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) as well as gray literature sources, Open Grey. In addition, the following trial registries were searched for ongoing or unpublished trials: the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Results This review included 81 of 3,513 studies. Approximately 90.1% of studies relied on self-report sleep assessments, whereas only 9.9% incorporated objective measures. Additionally, 7.4% of studies used a combination of self-report and objective sleep assessments. The visual analog and numeric rating scales were the most frequently used methods for assessing pain-related outcomes (59.3%). Despite extensive research on sleep and chronic pain, critical gaps persist, particularly in the integration of multidimensional assessment tools. Conclusions This scoping review discovered imbalances in the content of both sleep and pain assessments. Future studies should integrate both objective and self-report assessment tools to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this interaction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-641/v2?src=rss">University Dropout Among Indigenous University Students: A Global Systematic Review [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background University dropout among indigenous students is a multifactorial phenomenon that significantly impacts education and equity. This systematic review aimed to consolidate global evidence on risk and protective factors associated with university dropout among indigenous populations. Methods A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA 2020 criteria, encompassing ten databases (Web of Science, Scopus, LILACS, Dialnet, PubMed/MEDLINE, Redalyc, Scielo, DOAJ, Latindex, and CLASE) from October 29, 2024, to November 30, 2024. Out of 23,403 initial records, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria, analyzing indigenous university students and their educational trajectories. Two independent reviewers conducted the study selection and data extraction, ensuring minimized bias. Variables included demographic characteristics, geographic context, academic field, dropout rates, and related factors. Results were synthesized through descriptive analysis, focusing on quantitative data. Results Among the 226,049 participants across 21 studies, only 2,340 (1.03%) were indigenous university students, predominantly from South America (9/21 studies). The average dropout rate was 33.59%, ranging from 20% to 66%, with the highest rates reported among female students in six studies (28.57%). However, three studies highlighted higher dropout rates among male students (14.29%). Economic barriers were the primary risk factor (85.7%), followed by linguistic challenges (47.6%) and geographic limitations (33.3%). Protective factors included financial support (76.2%), academic mentorship (47.6%), and social support (42.8%). Public universities accounted for most participants (17/21 studies), with limited representation from private institutions. Despite significant dropout rates, only seven studies provided detailed prevalence data. Conclusion This review highlights systemic inequities contributing to indigenous university dropout, emphasizing economic, linguistic, and geographic barriers. While financial support and mentorship are effective interventions, their implementation remains inconsistent. Addressing these disparities through targeted policies, culturally inclusive curricula, and equitable resource distribution is essential to reducing dropout rates and fostering academic retention among indigenous students.

                Himanen et al. identify positions, activities, and architectures of genes and enhancers in dog macrophages. The novel eClusterer tool calls super-enhancers and their precise enhancer content and transcriptional activity. Upon acute stress, genes respond via pause regulation, enhancers via initiation, and clustered enhancers via unified control of Pol II.

                Vasudev et al. demonstrate that thymic epithelial, mesenchymal, and hematopoietic antigen-presenting cells (HAPCs) change coordinately in composition and transcriptional profiles across the perinatal to juvenile transition 7–14 days after birth. Coincident changes in thymocyte phenotype and function suggest that remodeling of the perinatal thymus microenvironment affects thymocyte differentiation and selection.

Their findings lay a foundation for developing broad-spectrum antivirals and support repurposing FcRn-targeted therapeutics to combat astrovirus infections.

                In this study, using genome-wide approaches, Dilrangi and Aretakis et al. demonstrate that Caulobacter crescentus mRNA decay is coordinated with transcription and translation across the transcriptome. Co-transcriptional decay is broadly utilized by long mRNAs in the transcriptome, and polysome occupancy globally protects mRNAs from decay.

Specifically, they show that neuron-satellite glia contacts established during development are necessary for regulating neuronal morphology, metabolic signaling, neuronal activity, and sympathetic output to peripheral organs/tissues.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106194">Virtual Brain Inference (VBI), a flexible and integrative toolkit for efficient probabilistic inference on whole-brain models</a></h4>

              
                Network neuroscience has proven essential for understanding the principles and mechanisms underlying complex brain (dys)function and cognition. In this context, whole-brain network modeling—also known as virtual brain modeling—combines computational models of brain dynamics (placed at each network node) with individual brain imaging data (to coordinate and connect the nodes), advancing our understanding of the complex dynamics of the brain and its neurobiological underpinnings. However, there remains a critical need for automated model inversion tools to estimate control (bifurcation) parameters at large scales associated with neuroimaging modalities, given their varying spatio-temporal resolutions. This study aims to address this gap by introducing a flexible and integrative toolkit for efficient Bayesian inference on virtual brain models, called Virtual Brain Inference (VBI). This open-source toolkit provides fast simulations, taxonomy of feature extraction, efficient data storage and loading, and probabilistic machine learning algorithms, enabling biophysically interpretable inference from non-invasive and invasive recordings. Through in-silico testing, we demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of inference for commonly used whole-brain network models and their associated neuroimaging data. VBI shows potential to improve hypothesis evaluation in network neuroscience through uncertainty quantification and contribute to advances in precision medicine by enhancing the predictive power of virtual brain models.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90780">Separating the control of moving and holding in human post-stroke arm paresis</a></h4>

              
                Moving and holding-still (<i>holding</i>) have been posited to be separately controlled. The paretic arm after stroke exhibits different abnormalities during rest vs. movement, providing an opportunity to ask whether control of these behaviors is independently affected in stroke. We quantified resting postural abnormalities in human stroke patients by measuring their biases in force production as they held their hand still in various locations in a planar workspace and then assessed whether these resting force biases influenced reaching in the same workspace. Patients displayed marked resting force biases at each location, even when the arm was supported. However, these biases did not transfer to arm-supported planar reaching movements; rather, abnormal resting forces only appeared to switch on after a movement had fully stopped. These findings suggest that moving and holding are functionally separable modes of control. At the same time, resting biases mirrored characteristics of abnormal movement synergies, in line with a shared mechanism. This appears to contradict the functional separation of moving and holding observed in the same patients. To resolve this paradox, we propose a conceptual model that predicts a breakdown in this functional separation when patients move without weight support. This conceptual model posits that synergies are the manifestation of a spillover of posture into movement. Mapping these functional systems onto anatomical and physiological details of lesioned substrate after stroke may provide implementation-level insight into how normal arm motor control is assembled.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106699">Degradation of LMO2 in T cell leukaemia results in collateral breakdown of transcription complex partners and causes LMO2-dependent apoptosis</a></h4>

              
                LMO2 is an intrinsically disordered transcription factor activated in T cell leukaemia that is difficult to target. It forms part of a multi-protein complex that has bipartite DNA binding through heterodimeric basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and GATA proteins. To determine if degradation of LMO2 in the context of T cell acute leukaemias (T-ALL) has therapeutic potential, a chimeric intracellular antibody has been developed fusing an anti-LMO2 single-domain variable region with one of three E3 ligases to create biodegraders. The intracellular binary interaction of these biodegraders with LMO2 leads to its proteasomal degradation but, in addition, concomitant loss of bHLH proteins that associate with LMO2 in the DNA-binding complex. Chemical compound surrogates of the intracellular antibody paratope (called antibody-derived [Abd] compounds) have been modified to create proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) for orthogonal assays of effects of LMO2 degradation. These form a ternary complex with LMO2 and E3 ligase in leukaemia cells that induces degradation of LMO2 and is also accompanied by loss of associated bHLH proteins. This is accompanied by T-ALL growth inhibition, alterations in proteins involved in cell cycling and instigation of apoptosis. These effects do not occur in the absence of LMO2. Our work demonstrates that degradation of LMO2 affects T-ALL, and the lead compounds can eventually be developed into drugs for patient treatment. Our work describes methods for drug discovery starting with antibody fragments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101208">Range geography and temperature variability explain cross-continental convergence in range and phenology shifts in a model insect taxon</a></h4>

              
                Climate change may introduce conditions beyond species’ tolerances; to survive, species must avoid these extremes. Phenological shifts are one strategy, as species move their activity or life-history events in time to avoid extreme conditions. Species may also shift in space, moving their ranges poleward to escape extremes. However, whether species are more likely to exhibit one or both strategies, and whether this can be predicted based on a species’ functional traits, is unknown. Using a powerful macroecological dataset of European and North American odonate observations, we assessed range and phenology shifts between two time periods (1980–2002 and 2008–2018) to measure the strength and direction of the association between responses. Species with the greatest poleward range shifts also showed the largest phenological shifts toward earlier annual activity periods, with half of all species shifting in both space and time. This response was consistent across continents, despite highly divergent land use and biogeographical histories in these regions. Surprisingly, species’ range and phenology shifts were not related to functional traits; rather, southern species shifted their range limits more strongly, while increasing temperature variability hindered range shifts. By reducing risk through phenological shifts, the resulting larger populations may be more likely to disperse and expand species’ ranges. Species shifting in both space and time may be more resilient to extreme conditions, although further work integrating abundance data is needed. We also identified a small number of species (approximately 10%) that failed to shift at all; these species are likely to be particularly vulnerable to climate change and should be prioritized for conservation intervention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108498">Sex-specific exploration accounts for differences in valence learning in male and female mice</a></h4>

              
                Valence, the quality by which something is perceived as good or bad, appetitive or aversive, is a fundamental building block of emotional experience and a primary driver of adaptive behavior. Pavlovian fear and reward learning paradigms are widely used in preclinical research to probe mechanisms of valence learning but with limited consideration of sex as a biological variable despite known sex differences in neuropsychiatric disorders associated with impaired valence. Here, we compare appetitive-only, aversive-only and mixed-valence cue-outcome Pavlovian conditioning paradigms in male and female mice to dissociate effects of context, valence and salience in a sex-specific manner. Using a data-driven approach to identify behaviors indicative of valence learning in an unbiased manner, we compare task performance between paradigms in male and female mice. We show that while male and female mice acquire appetitive and aversive associations in both single- and mixed-valence paradigms, sex differences emerge in single-valence paradigms. Ultimately, we show that these apparent sex differences in valence learning are driven by non-specific baseline differences in exploratory behavior. Males explore more at baseline, altering their trajectory of cue-reward association acquisition whereas females explore less at baseline, increasing shock facilitated freezing in aversive-only contexts, masking cue discrimination. Overall, our findings illustrate how task design differentially impacts behavioral expression in male and female mice and demonstrate that mixed-valence paradigms afford a more accurate assessment of valence learning in both sexes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104815">Spatially defined multicellular functional units in colorectal cancer revealed from single cell and spatial transcriptomics</a></h4>

              
                While advances in single-cell genomics have helped to chart the cellular components of tumor ecosystems, it has been more challenging to characterize their specific spatial organization and functional interactions. Here, we combine single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics by Slide-seq, and in situ multiplex RNA analysis to create a detailed spatial map of healthy and dysplastic colon cellular ecosystems and their association with disease progression. We profiled inducible genetic CRC mouse models that recapitulate key features of human CRC, assigned cell types and epithelial expression programs to spatial tissue locations in tumors, and computationally used them to identify the regional features spanning different cells in the same spatial niche. We find that tumors were organized in cellular neighborhoods, each with a distinct composition of cell subtypes, expression programs, and local cellular interactions. Comparing to scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data from human CRC, we find that both cell composition and layout features were conserved between the species, with mouse neighborhoods correlating with malignancy and clinical outcome in human patient tumors, highlighting the relevance of our findings to human disease. Our work offers a comprehensive framework that is applicable across various tissues, tumors, and disease conditions, with tools for the extrapolation of findings from experimental mouse models to human diseases.

                Background In the present paper, assuming every module H is unitary and every ring S is commutative with identity, we address the concepts of bounded modules and Endo-R.B.modules. We provide some examples, corollaries, remarks, and properties our new concept. An Endo-R.B S-module is considered to be more powerful than bounded module and Endo-R.B module that will present both of them in some details in the introduction. Motivated by these notions, we introduce and discuss a new class of modules called the Endo-Greatly Bounded module (abbreviated as Endo-G.B. module), a concept which has not been previously reported in the literature. Methods We formally define the Endo-G.B. module and provide examples, corollaries, and properties to illustrate this new concept. The study employs scalar modules and fully invariant submodules as crucial tools to establish connections. It must be emphasized that scalar modules and prime played a major role in achieving new results in this paper. We specifically investigate the important relationships between an Endo-G.B module and prime module as well as their generalizations. Results We get and prove that every Endo-G.B. module is Bounded, where as the converse is not generally true. Furthermore, we establish new results connecting our new class of S-modules to cyclic bounded modules, projective modules, multiplication modules, and finitely annihilated modules. We also derive necessary and sufficient conditions for an Endo-G.B. module to exhibit specific flexible properties. Conclusions In this paper, we presented a new class of S- modules called Endo-greatly bounded modules, these findings highlight the depth and flexibility of Endo-G.B. modules with in modern algebraic frameworks. This study opens new directions for further research in module theory, particularly in exploring the interaction between bounded ness and endomorphism structures, and may motivate future algebraic investigations in commutative algebra.

                Background Credit card fraud detection remains a major challenge because of the highly imbalanced nature of transaction data. Conventional supervised models often suffer from low recall or high false positive rates, whereas unsupervised methods lack precision. Methods In this study, we propose a hybrid anomaly detection framework that combines an unsupervised autoencoder trained on normal transactions to capture reconstruction error patterns with a supervised XGBoost classifier trained on the same dataset. The hybrid system integrates both scores via an optimized thresholding mechanism to balance sensitivity and specificity. We evaluated the model on the publicly available Kaggle creditcard.csv dataset comprising 284,807 transactions, with only 492 labelled fraudulent. Results The proposed model achieved superior performance, with a recall of 0.9250, precision of 0.9569, F1-score of 0.9407, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.9407, with an accuracy of 0.9998, surpassing the results of similar published models using the same dataset. Conclusions This framework provides a practical, reproducible, high-performance solution for detecting financial fraud. The code, model configuration, and data-processing pipeline were made available to support transparency and future research.

The cell cycle is a series of regulated stages during which a cell grows, replicates its DNA, and divides. It consists of four phases – two growth phases (G1 and G2), a replication phase (S), and a division phase (M) – each characterized by distinct transcriptional programs and impacting most other cellular processes. In imaging assays, the cell cycle phase can be identified using specific cell-cycle markers. However, the use of dedicated cell-cycle markers can be impractical or even prohibitive, as they occupy fluorescent channels that may be needed for other reporters. To address this limitation we propose a method to infer the cell cycle phase from a widely used fluorescent reporter: SiR-DNA, thereby bypassing the need for phase-specific markers while leveraging information already present in common experimental setups. Our method is based on a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), enhanced with two auxiliary tasks: predicting the average intensity of phase-specific markers and enforcing temporal consistency through latent space regularization. The reconstruction task ensures that the latent space captures cell cycle–relevant features, while the temporal constraint promotes biological plausibility. The resulting model, CC-VAE, classifies cell cycle phases with high accuracy from widely used DNA markers and can thus be applied to high-content screening datasets not specifically designed for cell cycle analysis. CC-VAE is freely available, along with a new, publicly released dataset comprising over 600,000 labeled HeLa Kyoto nuclear images to support further development and benchmarking in the community.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013217">How cells tame noise while maintaining ultrasensitive transcriptional responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eui Min Jeong, Chang Yoon Chung, Jae Kyoung Kim</p>

Ultrasensitive transcriptional switches are essential for converting gradual molecular inputs into decisive gene expression responses, enabling critical behaviors such as bistability and oscillations. While cooperative binding, relying on direct repressor-DNA binding, has been classically regarded as a key ultrasensitivity mechanism, recent theoretical works have demonstrated that combinations of indirect repression mechanisms—sequestration, blocking, and displacement—can also achieve ultrasensitive switches with greater robustness to transcriptional noise. However, these previous works have neglected key biological constraints such as DNA binding kinetics and the limited availability of transcriptional activators, raising the question of whether ultrasensitivity and noise robustness can be sustained under biologically realistic conditions. Here, we systematically assess the impact of these factors on ultrasensitivity and noise robustness under physiologically plausible conditions. We show that while various repression combinations can reduce noise, only the full combination of all three indirect mechanisms consistently maintains low noise and high ultrasensitivity. As a result, biological oscillators employing this triple repression architecture retain precise rhythmic switching even under high noise, and even when activators are shared across thousands of target genes. Our findings offer a mechanistic explanation for the frequent co-occurrence of these repression mechanisms in natural gene regulatory systems.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003564">Plasmid streamlining drives the extinction of antibiotic resistance plasmids under selection for horizontal transmission</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andrew C. Matthews, Sonja Lehtinen, Tatiana Dimitriu</p>

Conjugative plasmids carrying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes are critical for the spread of AMR, due to their ability to transmit horizontally between bacterial hosts. We previously observed that during experimental evolution in the presence of abundant susceptible <i>Escherichia coli</i> hosts, the AMR plasmid R1 rapidly evolves variants with increased horizontal transmission due to mutations causing increased plasmid copy number. Yet AMR was progressively lost from the evolving populations. Here, we show that AMR loss was associated with evolution of streamlined plasmids in which the AMR region is spontaneously deleted, making plasmid carriage undetectable by plating on selective antibiotic-containing media. These plasmids transmit both vertically and horizontally more efficiently than the ancestral AMR plasmid, driving AMR extinction in bacterial populations and effectively acting as an intrinsic defence against AMR plasmids. A simple model of plasmid competition further shows that any horizontal or vertical transmission advantage conferred by plasmid streamlining would be enough to drive the displacement of competing AMR plasmids, with a given horizontal transmission advantage leading to faster replacement in conditions favoring horizontal transmission. Our results suggest that within-host plasmid evolution or engineered streamlined plasmids could be exploited to limit the spread of AMR in natural populations of bacteria.

                <p>by Kevin F. P. Bennett, Andrew W. Wood, Marcella D. Baiz, Lan-Nhi Phung, Irby J. Lovette, David P. L. Toews</p>

Introgression between species has the potential to shape evolutionary trajectories in important ways, but uncovering complex introgression dynamics has only recently been made possible by advances in genomics. Warblers of the avian family Parulidae exemplify rapid diversification and sexual trait divergence, and we endeavored to study historical introgression in the family. We sequenced multiple genomes of nearly every species, constructed a phylogeny for the family, and investigated gene flow across the genome and at genes known for controlling feather color. We found that DNA haplotypes including the gene <i>BCO2</i>, which encodes an enzyme that degrades yellow carotenoids, have spread among genera multiple times—from <i>Vermivora</i> to <i>Geothlypis</i> and from <i>Leiothlypis</i> to multiple <i>Cardellina</i> and <i>Setophaga</i> species. Patterns of inheritance in the latter case point to introgression that occurred 0.5 to 2 million years ago, and the shared haplotype among recipient species is less than 100 nucleotides long. Separately, we found evidence of introgression from red <i>Cardellina</i> species to both of the two red <i>Myioborus</i> species at <i>BDH1L</i> and from one red <i>Myioborus</i> species to the other at <i>CYP2J19</i>; both are key genes in the pathway that converts yellow carotenoids to red ketocarotenoids. Our results show that introgression is a common mechanism for the evolution of colorful plumage in parulid warblers and hint at complex histories of gene flow behind some of the Western Hemisphere’s most colorful birds.

                <p>by Qiu C. Wu, Aishwarya Swaminathan, Ashley Winward, Logan Lalonde, Yung Hwang, Noah Littman, Merav Socolovsky, Allon M. Klein</p>

Red blood cell production is regulated by erythropoietin (Epo), maintaining tissue oxygen tension in the steady state and in response to stress. To date, only a handful of factors other than Epo are known to stimulate erythropoiesis, limiting therapeutic options. We recently found that IL-17, a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine, interacts synergistically with Epo to increase formation of erythroid colonies <i>in vitro</i>. Here, we administered IL-17 to mice to determine whether it accelerates erythropoiesis <i>in vivo</i>. We found that while IL-17 alone had little effect on erythroid and other hematopoietic lineages, combined treatment with both IL-17 and Epo generated a specific and strong synergistic response in erythroid progenitors that significantly increased erythropoietic rate. IL-17 administration also accelerated the erythropoietic response of mice to hypoxia. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis showed that IL-17 acts by sensitizing erythroid progenitors to Epo, rather than through a distinct transcriptional response. Using a dynamical model, we propose that this mechanism optimizes conflicting requirements in the regulation of erythropoiesis, balancing the need for low-cost maintenance of the steady state, with a sufficiently fast stress response. Further, our findings suggest a potentially broadly applicable mechanism whereby pleiotropic cytokines are able to exert lineage-specific effects when their actions are dependent on synergism with lineage-specific factors.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ventral subiculum has long been appreciated as the major output structure of the ventral hippocampus but remains greatly understudied relative to the other hippocampal subregions. Over the last decade, investigation into ventral subiculum synapses and connectivity has revealed a critical role for this brain region in context-induced drug seeking, stress integration, and psychiatric disorders. While the majority of literature has historically focused on male rodent models, recent works including sex as a biological variable uncover that the ventral subiculum may have complex cell-type-, synapse-, and sex-specific roles in its functions. In this review, we discuss the primary functions of the ventral subiculum, emphasize works that uncover sex differences, and highlight avenues for future research.</p>
