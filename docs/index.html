                arXiv:2502.06810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a minimalist three-layer model for artificial consciousness, focusing on the emergence of self-awareness. The model comprises a Cognitive Integration Layer, a Pattern Prediction Layer, and an Instinctive Response Layer, interacting with Access-Oriented and Pattern-Integrated Memory systems. Unlike brain-replication approaches, we aim to achieve minimal self-awareness through essential elements only. Self-awareness emerges from layer interactions and dynamic self-modeling, without initial explicit self-programming. We detail each component's structure, function, and implementation strategies, addressing technical feasibility. This research offers new perspectives on consciousness emergence in artificial systems, with potential implications for human consciousness understanding and adaptable AI development. We conclude by discussing ethical considerations and future research directions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07247">A Relativistic Theory of Consciousness (shorten version)</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.07247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a shorten version of the full paper that was published in the journal Frontiers of Psychology in May 2022. In recent decades, the scientific study of consciousness has significantly increased our understanding of this elusive phenomenon. Yet, despite critical development in our understanding of the functional side of consciousness, we still lack a fundamental theory regarding its phenomenal aspect. The phenomenal aspect of consciousness is the first-person answer to what it is like question, and it has thus far proved recalcitrant to direct scientific investigation. The question of how the brain, or any cognitive system, can create conscious experience out of neural representations poses a great conundrum to science. Naturalistic dualists argue that it is composed of a primitive, private, nonreductive element of reality. Illusionists, on the other hand, argue that it is merely a cognitive illusion. We contend that both the dualist and illusionist positions are flawed because they tacitly assume consciousness to be an absolute property that does not depend on the observer. We developed a conceptual and a mathematical argument for a relativistic theory of consciousness in which a system either has or does not have phenomenal consciousness with respect to some observer. According to the theory, Phenomenal consciousness is neither private nor delusional, just relativistic. In the frame of reference of the cognitive system, it will be observable (first-person perspective) and in other frame of reference it will not (third-person perspective). These two cognitive frames of reference are both correct, just as in the case of an observer that claims to be at rest while another will claim that the observer has constant velocity. Neither observer position can be privileged, as they both describe the same underlying reality.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07256">Understanding and controlling the geometry of memory organization in RNNs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.07256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is a high-dimensional process that requires updating numerous parameters. Therefore, it is often difficult to pinpoint the underlying learning mechanisms. To address this challenge, we propose to gain mechanistic insights into the phenomenon of \emph{abrupt learning} by studying RNNs trained to perform diverse short-term memory tasks. In these tasks, RNN training begins with an initial search phase. Following a long period of plateau in accuracy, the values of the loss function suddenly drop, indicating abrupt learning. Analyzing the neural computation performed by these RNNs reveals geometric restructuring (GR) in their phase spaces prior to the drop. To promote these GR events, we introduce a temporal consistency regularization that accelerates (bioplausible) training, facilitates attractor formation, and enables efficient learning in strongly connected networks. Our findings offer testable predictions for neuroscientists and emphasize the need for goal-agnostic secondary mechanisms to facilitate learning in biological and artificial networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07429">From Thought to Action: How a Hierarchy of Neural Dynamics Supports Language Production</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.07429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans effortlessly communicate their thoughts through intricate sequences of motor actions. Yet, the neural processes that coordinate language production remain largely unknown, in part because speech artifacts limit the use of neuroimaging. To elucidate the unfolding of language production in the brain, we investigate with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) the neurophysiological activity of 35 skilled typists, while they typed sentences on a keyboard. This approach confirms the hierarchical predictions of linguistic theories: the neural activity preceding the production of each word is marked by the sequential rise and fall of context-, word-, syllable-, and letter-level representations. Remarkably, each of these neural representations is maintained over long time periods within each level of the language hierarchy. This phenomenon results in a superposition of successive representations that is supported by a hierarchy of dynamic neural codes. Overall, these findings provide a precise computational breakdown of the neural dynamics that coordinate the production of language in the human brain.

                arXiv:2408.01350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foraging is a crucial activity, yet the extent to which humans employ flexible versus rigid strategies remains unclear. This study investigates how individuals adapt their foraging strategies in response to resource distribution and foraging time constraints. For this, we designed a video-game-like foraging task that requires participants to navigate a four-areas environment to collect coins from treasure boxes within a limited time. This task engages multiple cognitive abilities, such as navigation, learning, and memorization of treasure box locations. Findings indicate that participants adjust their foraging strategies -- encompassing both stay-or-leave decisions, such as the number of boxes opened in initial areas and behavioral aspects, such as the time to navigate from box to box -- depending on both resource distribution and foraging time. Additionally, they improved their performance over time as an effect of both enhanced navigation skills and adaptation of foraging strategies. Finally, participants' performance was initially distant from the reward-maximizing performance of optimal agents due to the learning process humans undergo; however, it approximated the optimal agent's performance towards the end of the task, without fully reaching it. These results highlight the flexibility of human foraging behavior and underscore the importance of employing optimality models and ecologically rich scenarios to study foraging.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05394">A state-space framework for causal detection of hippocampal ripple-replay events</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.05394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hippocampal ripple-replay events are typically identified using a two-step process that at each time point uses past and future data to determine whether an event is occurring. This prevents researchers from identifying these events in real time for closed-loop experiments. It also prevents the identification of periods of nonlocal representation that are not accompanied by large changes in the spectral content of the local field potentials (LFPs). In this work, we present a new state-space model framework that is able to detect concurrent changes in the rhythmic structure of LFPs with nonlocal activity in place cells to identify ripple-replay events in a causal manner. The model combines latent factors related to neural oscillations, represented space, and switches between coding properties to explain simultaneously the spiking activity from multiple units and the rhythmic content of LFPs recorded from multiple sources. The model is temporally causal, meaning that estimates of the switching state can be made at each instant using only past information from the spike and LFP signals, or can be combined with future data to refine those estimates. We applied this model framework to simulated and real hippocampal data to demonstrate its performance in identifying ripple-replay events.

                arXiv:2408.01322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The objects we perceive guide our eye movements when observing real-world dynamic scenes. Yet, gaze shifts and selective attention are critical for perceiving details and refining object boundaries. Object segmentation and gaze behavior are, however, typically treated as two independent processes. Here, we present a computational model that simulates these processes in an interconnected manner and allows for hypothesis-driven investigations of distinct attentional mechanisms. Drawing on an information processing pattern from robotics, we use a Bayesian filter to recursively segment the scene, which also provides an uncertainty estimate for the object boundaries that we use to guide active scene exploration. We demonstrate that this model closely resembles observers' free viewing behavior on a dataset of dynamic real-world scenes, measured by scanpath statistics, including foveation duration and saccade amplitude distributions used for parameter fitting and higher-level statistics not used for fitting. These include how object detections, inspections, and returns are balanced and a delay of returning saccades without an explicit implementation of such temporal inhibition of return. Extensive simulations and ablation studies show that uncertainty promotes balanced exploration and that semantic object cues are crucial to forming the perceptual units used in object-based attention. Moreover, we show how our model's modular design allows for extensions, such as incorporating saccadic momentum or pre-saccadic attention, to further align its output with human scanpaths.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02904">ScholaWrite: A Dataset of End-to-End Scholarly Writing Process</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.02904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Writing is a cognitively demanding task involving continuous decision-making, heavy use of working memory, and frequent switching between multiple activities. Scholarly writing is particularly complex as it requires authors to coordinate many pieces of multiform knowledge. To fully understand writers' cognitive thought process, one should fully decode the end-to-end writing data (from individual ideas to final manuscript) and understand their complex cognitive mechanisms in scholarly writing. We introduce ScholaWrite dataset, the first-of-its-kind keystroke logs of an end-to-end scholarly writing process for complete manuscripts, with thorough annotations of cognitive writing intentions behind each keystroke. Our dataset includes LaTeX-based keystroke data from five preprints with nearly 62K total text changes and annotations across 4 months of paper writing. ScholaWrite shows promising usability and applications (e.g., iterative self-writing) for the future development of AI writing assistants for academic research, which necessitate complex methods beyond LLM prompting. Our experiments clearly demonstrated the importance of collection of end-to-end writing data, rather than the final manuscript, for the development of future writing assistants to support the cognitive thinking process of scientists. Our de-identified dataset, demo, and code repository are available on our project page.

                arXiv:2502.07388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) and data collection (DC) have been popular research issues. Different from existing works that consider MEC and DC scenarios separately, this paper investigates a multi-UAV-assisted joint MEC-DC system. Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the MEC latency and maximize the collected data volume. This problem can be classified as a non-convex mixed integer programming problem that exhibits long-term optimization and dynamics. Thus, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based approach that jointly optimizes the UAV movement, user transmit power, and user association in real time to solve the problem efficiently. Specifically, we reformulate the optimization problem into an action space-reduced Markov decision process (MDP) and optimize the user association by using a two-phase matching-based association (TMA) strategy. Subsequently, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC)-based approach that integrates the proposed TMA strategy (SAC-TMA) to solve the formulated joint optimization problem collaboratively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SAC-TMA is able to coordinate the two subsystems and can effectively reduce the system latency and improve the data collection volume compared with other benchmark algorithms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07373">EvoFlow: Evolving Diverse Agentic Workflows On The Fly</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.07373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past two years have witnessed the evolution of large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems from labor-intensive manual design to partial automation (\textit{e.g.}, prompt engineering, communication topology) and eventually to fully automated design. However, existing agentic automation pipelines often lack LLM heterogeneity and focus on single-objective performance optimization, limiting their potential to combine weaker models for more customized and cost-effective solutions. To address this challenge, we propose EvoFlow, a niching evolutionary algorithm-based framework to automatically search a population of heterogeneous and complexity-adaptive agentic workflows, rather than a single homogeneous, complex workflow. Technically, EvoFlow performs \textit{(1) tag-based retrieval} to extract parent workflows from an agentic population, evolves new workflows through \textit{(2) crossover} and \textit{(3) mutation}, and employs \textit{(4) niching-based selection} to maintain population diversity and quality. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmarks demonstrate that EvoFlow is: \textbf{(I) diverse}, evolving a population of workflows ranging from simple I/O tasks to complex multi-turn interactions; \textbf{(II) high-performing}, outperforming previous handcrafted and automated workflows by $1.23\%\sim29.86\%$; \textbf{(III) economical}, surpassing powerful \llmname{o1-preview} at $12.4\%$ of its inference cost using weaker open-source models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09225">Autonomous Driving using Spiking Neural Networks on Dynamic Vision Sensor Data: A Case Study of Traffic Light Change Detection</a></h4>

Abstract: Autonomous driving is a challenging task that has gained broad attention from both academia and industry. Current solutions using convolutional neural networks require large amounts of computational resources, leading to high power consumption. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide an alternative computational model to process information and make decisions. This biologically plausible model has the advantage of low latency and energy efficiency. Recent work using SNNs for autonomous driving mostly focused on simple tasks like lane keeping in simplified simulation environments. This paper studies SNNs on photo-realistic driving scenes in the CARLA simulator, which is an important step toward using SNNs on real vehicles. The efficacy and generalizability of the method will be investigated.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17438">Object-centric proto-symbolic behavioural reasoning from pixels</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.17438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous intelligent agents must bridge computational challenges at disparate levels of abstraction, from the low-level spaces of sensory input and motor commands to the high-level domain of abstract reasoning and planning. A key question in designing such agents is how best to instantiate the representational space that will interface between these two levels -- ideally without requiring supervision in the form of expensive data annotations. These objectives can be efficiently achieved by representing the world in terms of objects (grounded in perception and action). In this work, we present a novel, brain-inspired, deep-learning architecture that learns from pixels to interpret, control, and reason about its environment, using object-centric representations. We show the utility of our approach through tasks in synthetic environments that require a combination of (high-level) logical reasoning and (low-level) continuous control. Results show that the agent can learn emergent conditional behavioural reasoning, such as $(A \to B) \land (\neg A \to C)$, as well as logical composition $(A \to B) \land (A \to C) \vdash A \to (B \land C)$ and XOR operations, and successfully controls its environment to satisfy objectives deduced from these logical rules. The agent can adapt online to unexpected changes in its environment and is robust to mild violations of its world model, thanks to dynamic internal desired goal generation. While the present results are limited to synthetic settings (2D and 3D activated versions of dSprites), which fall short of real-world levels of complexity, the proposed architecture shows how to manipulate grounded object representations, as a key inductive bias for unsupervised learning, to enable behavioral reasoning.

	<p>Objectives: The treatment of emotional dysregulation (ED) poses a major challenge for clinicians managing adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This naturalistic longitudinal study aimed to evaluate the effects of combining mood stabilizers (MS) with standard pharmacotherapy in this population. Methods: Fifty-six adult patients with ADHD, with or without bipolar spectrum disorders, who were followed-up for at least 4 months at Pisa University Hospital were included and grouped based on the prescription of ADHD treatment with prior MS, with conomitant MS and without MS. Changes in self-reported ED, self-reported and informant-reported ADHD severity were assessed using RIPoSt-40, ASRS-v1.1, and CAARS-O:SV. Longitudinal analyses were conducted separately for each group using a pairwise one-sample paired Student&amp;amp;rsquo;s t-test. Results: A significant reduction in ED severity was observed in those treated with methylphenidate (MPH) and concomitant MS and in those with atomoxetine (ATX) without MS. Negative emotionality and emotional impulsivity significantly decreased in both these groups, while affective instability only improved in those with MPH and concomitant MS. Self-reported ADHD improvements were significant in all groups receiving MPH, whether with concomitant, prior, or without MS. Significant changes in informant-reported ADHD severity were found in those receiving MPH with concomitant or prior MS. Conclusions: The findings highlight the benefits of concomitant MS and MPH treatment on ED, suggest a preferential effect of ATX on negative emotionality, and confirm the effectiveness of MPH for adult ADHD symptoms, regardless of additional treatment with MS. Further studies are needed to explore whether and how MS and MPH may complement each other in reducing ED.</p>

	<p>Background: Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common pharmaco-resistant type of epilepsy. The chance of obtaining seizure freedom after resective surgery in pharmaco-resistant mesial temporal lobe patients (mTLE) is significantly higher compared to pharmaceutical treatment (at least 50&amp;amp;ndash;60% compared to less than 15%). However, some factors (e.g., craniotomy) may prevent epilepsy patients undergoing surgery. A recent advancement in epilepsy surgery, i.e., magnetic resonance guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT), has become an attractive alternative for performance of selective amygdala-hippo-campectomy, especially because of its minimal invasiveness. Among other medial temporal lobe structures, the hippocampus is particularly important for successful processing of vestibular inputs. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether mTLE patients who underwent MRgLITT perform worse on vestibular-dependent tests, including balancing, spatial orientation and rotational memory. Methods: Nine patients (Age 40.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14.5; 2 females) underwent vestibular-dependent assessments before and after MRgLITT using the following test battery: (I) clinical balancing test (CBT), (II) triangle completion test (TCT) and (III) rotational memory test (RM). Results: We found significant improvement from pre- to post-surgery in the vestibular-dependent spatial orientation test, namely in the wheelchair condition of the triangle completion test. Additionally, the obtained effect sizes were medium to large in favor of post-surgery assessment for the majority of conditions in the three tests applied in this study, indicating that the assessment of a larger number of patients could also, potentially, lead to significant results in these cases. Conclusions: This plausibility study is the first to assess vestibular-dependent balancing, spatial orientation and rotational memory functions before and after MRgLITT in mTLE patients. Even with a small sample of nine patients, significant changes and medium to high effect sizes in favor of surgery were observed. Nevertheless, prospective studies with larger sample sizes are necessary for appropriate estimation of MRgLITT effectiveness in these functional domains.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/2/ENEURO.0237-24.2024?rss=1">Growth Hormone Alters Remapping in the Hippocampal Area CA1 in a Novel Environment</a></h4>

              
                <p>Growth hormone (GH) is a neuromodulator that binds to receptors in the hippocampus and alters synaptic plasticity. A decline in GH levels is associated with normal aging, stress, and disease, and the mechanisms proposed involve the hippocampal circuit plasticity. To see how GH affects the hippocampal neural code, we recorded single neurons in the CA1 region of male Long&ndash;Evans rats with locally altered GH levels. Rats received injections of adeno-associated viruses into the hippocampus to make the cells overexpress either GH or an antagonizing mutated GH (aGH). Place cells were recorded in both familiar and novel environments to allow the assessment of pattern separation in the neural representations termed remapping. All the animals showed intact and stable place fields in the familiar environment. In the novel environment, aGH transfection increased the average firing rate, peak rate, and information density of the CA1 place fields. The tendency of global remapping increased in the GH animals compared with the controls, and only place cells of control animals showed significant rate remapping. Our results suggest that GH increases hippocampal sensitivity to novel information. Our findings show that GH is a significant neuromodulator in the hippocampus affecting how place cells represent the environment. These results could help us to understand the mechanisms behind memory impairments in GH deficiency as well as in normal aging.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/2/ENEURO.0304-20.2024?rss=1">The Effect of Targeted Memory Reactivation on Dogs Visuospatial Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>The role of sleep in memory consolidation is a widely discussed but still debated area of research. In light of the fact that memory consolidation during sleep is an evolutionary adaptive function, investigating the same phenomenon in nonhuman model species is highly relevant for its understanding. One such species, which has acquired human-analog sociocognitive skills through convergent evolution, is the domestic dog. Family dogs have surfaced as an outstanding animal model in sleep research, and their learning skills (in a social context) are subject to sleep-dependent memory consolidation. These results, however, are correlational, and the next challenge is to establish causality. In the present study, we aimed to adapt a TMR (targeted memory reactivation) paradigm in dogs and investigate its effect on sleep parameters. Dogs (<I>N</I> = 16) learned new commands associated with different locations and afterward took part in a sleep polysomnography recording when they were re-exposed to one of the previously learned commands. The results did not indicate a cueing benefit on choice performance. However, there was evidence for a decrease in choice latency after sleep, while the density (occurrence/minute) of fast sleep spindles was also notably higher during TMR recordings than adaptation recordings from the same animals and even compared with a larger reference sample from a previous work. Our study provides empirical evidence that TMR is feasible with family dogs, even during a daytime nap. Furthermore, the present study highlights several methodological and conceptual challenges for future research.</p>

                Background Maxillofacial prosthetic materials exhibit a range of qualities that vary considerably, including the hardness and stiffness of alloys and polymers, as well as the flexibility of elastomers and soft polymers. Silicone elastomers are the primary materials employed for maxillofacial prostheses due to their physical properties, which allow for adaptation to the movement of soft tissue. They also exhibit exceptional tensile and tear strength across a broad temperature range. The addition of nanoparticle enhance thermal and tear strength of maxillofacial silicon. This study estimates the influence of addition tantalum oxide nanoparticle on thermal conductivity and tear strength after addition on maxillofacial silicone. Method Tantalum oxide nanoparticles were added into VST-50F platinum silicone elastomer at two weight percentages: 1wt% and 1.5wt%. 60 specimens were prepared and classified into two groups: one control group for each property and two experimental groups. All collected data underwent statistical analysis by one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test, with significance set at p < 0.05. The Shapiro-Wilk test and Bartlett’s test were employed to assess the normality and homogeneity of the data, respectively. Result The one-way ANOVA test found a very significant difference between all groups, while Bonferroni’s test revealed a highly significant difference between the control and experimental groups. Thermal conductivity test found no significant difference between the 1wt% and 1.5wt% groups, however the tear strength test was highly significant. Conclusions The addition tantalum oxide nano particles improve tear strength and thermal conductivity.

                Background Climate change adaptation is an incomparable prior measure to tackle unpreventable climate calamities to enhance smallholder farming and food security. This empirical study assesses smallholder farmers’ adaptation options to climate change or variability for achieving food security. Methods Data were gathered from a survey of 328 respondents, selected randomly and proportionally from three different agro-ecological zones. Additional qualitative insights were collected through focus group discussions and interviews with key informants to reinforce the findings. The multinomial endogenous switching regression, independent t-test and the instrumental variable (2sls) regression were used as method of analysis Results The result indicated that ACAC impacted food security positively and significantly in the study area at a percent rate of 12.4, 16.3,18 and 27.7 when households adopting one, two, three, and four ACAC, respectively, in the HFBM case, and the same meaning was obtained from other food security measuring tools. However, the rate and manner of change differ at different agroecologies, signifying careful discernment when applying ACAC at different spacial areas, especially in agroecology. The change in agroecology declares that midlands have a negative likelihood propensity for climate adaptation compared to highlands, while lowlands have positive and insignificant implications. The mean comparison from the independent t-test showed statistically significant adopters and non-adopters food security measures, which also informed the positive contribution of CACA on households’ food security. Interestingly, factors such as distance to water sources, land size, ox ownership, crop income, and access to credit influenced food security in diverse ways depending on regional and contextual specifics. Conclusions Thus, ACAC impacts food security differently at different rates in different agroecologies in the area. Integrated and tailored technical, institutional, and policy interventions are needed to tackle the calamities of climate change leap to smallholder farming and food security

                Background A novel modality of cancer treatment based on exposure to non-contact electric fields called Electro-Capacitive Cancer Therapy (ECCT) has been developed. However, the effects of this modality on vital organs during cancer treatment have not been fully investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of non-contact electric field exposure on kidney and liver structures. Methods Female rats were randomly divided into one control group and three treatment groups with six replications each. Animals were treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight for mammary tumour induction. Animals were then exposed to electric fields (100 kHz, 50-60 V/m) for 10 hours a day for three weeks. Two kidney samples and two liver samples from different animals in each group were collected for observation of structural damage to the organs. Histopathological cross-sections of the kidneys and livers were made using the paraffin method and Hematoxylin-Eosin staining. Histological scoring used the post-examination masking method with 100 visual fields per group. Results There was no significant damages to the tubules, glomeruli, and interstitial of the kidneys, including congestion, after exposure to non-contact electric fields. In addition, healthy rats exposed to this electric field showed significantly lower renal interstitial damage. There was no significant cellular damage, congestion, and haemorrhage in the livers of all groups, except in the healthy rat group that showed significantly higher haemorrhage. Conclusions Exposure to non-contact electric fields may cause haemorrhage in the livers of healthy rats. However, in kidney tissue, exposure to this electric field was tolerable, and can even decrease the number of inflammations and haemorrhages in healthy rats.

                Background To evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention in the integral care of patients with diabetes mellitus. Methods A pre-experimental study was carried out with 103 patients with diabetes mellitus treated at Essalud, La Libertad, during the second quarter of 2024. Pre and post educational intervention information was collected about knowledge of the disease, complications, physical activity and diet, adherence to treatment and family support, number of medical and nursing controls per quarter, glycemia values, HbA1c and compliance with treatment after informed consent. The educational intervention included theoretical aspects of diabetes mellitus, self-care, physical activity, nutrition and family support in 2-hour workshops, once a week, for 2 months. Results Predominantly female, mean age 63.22 years, higher education, marital status married/cohabiting and main occupation employed/independent. The 97.1% had type 2 diabetes mellitus, 38.8% reported disease duration < 5 years, 72.8% were treated with metformin and the main comorbidity was hypertension (58.3%). The educational intervention improved knowledge about diabetes mellitus (p < 0.001), achieved a significant change in eating habits (p = 0.022) and family support (p = 0.043), and homogenized the level of support among families (p = 0.025). 51.5% of the participants were noncompliant with the prescribed treatment. A significant difference (p < 0.01) was observed in the proportion of patients complying with treatment before and after the intervention. 76.8% of patients who initially complied with treatment continued to do so after the intervention. The efficacy of the educational program on glycemic control was not evidenced. Regarding integral control, 83.5 % of the patients received quarterly medical care and 44.7 % received nursing care. Conclusion The educational program was effective in improving knowledge about DM2, adherence to healthy eating and significantly improved the level of family support and compliance with treatment.

                <p>by Daipeng Chen, Xinxin Liu, Haijiang Wang, Roeland M.H. Merks, David A. Baker</p>

The ubiquitous Notch receptor signalling network is essential for tissue growth and maintenance. Operationally, receptor activity is regulated by two principal, counterposed mechanisms: intercellular Notch transactivation triggered by interactions between receptors and ligands expressed in neighbouring cells; intracellular cis inhibition mediated by ligands binding to receptors expressed in the same cell. Moreover, different Notch receptor/ligand combinations are known to elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses, and together, these phenomena determine the strength, the duration and the specificity of Notch receptor signalling. To date, it has been assumed that these processes involve discrete ligand homomers and not heteromeric complexes composed of more than one ligand species. In this study, we explore the molecular basis of the opposing actions of the Notch ligands, DLL4 and JAG1, which control angiogenic sprouting. Through a combination of experimental approaches and mathematical modelling, we provide evidence that two mechanisms could underpin this process: 1) DLL4 rather than JAG1 induces efficient Notch1 receptor transactivation; 2) JAG1 directly blocks DLL4-dependent cis-inhibition of Notch signalling through the formation of a JAG1/DLL4 complex. We propose a new model of Notch signalling that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells, which is necessary for sprouting angiogenesis.

The accelerating growth of scientific literature overwhelms our capacity to manually distil complex phenomena like molecular networks linked to diseases. Moreover, biases in biomedical research and database annotation limit our interpretation of facts and generation of hypotheses. ENQUIRE (Expanding Networks by Querying Unexpectedly Inter-Related Entities) offers a time- and resource-efficient alternative to manual literature curation and database mining. ENQUIRE reconstructs and expands co-occurrence networks of genes and biomedical ontologies from user-selected input corpora and network-inferred PubMed queries. Its modest resource usage and the integration of text mining, automatic querying, and network-based statistics mitigating literature biases makes ENQUIRE unique in its broad-scope applications. For example, ENQUIRE can generate co-occurrence gene networks that reflect high-confidence, functional networks. When tested on case studies spanning cancer, cell differentiation and immunity, ENQUIRE identified interlinked genes and enriched pathways unique to each topic, thereby preserving their underlying context specificity. ENQUIRE supports biomedical researchers by easing literature annotation, boosting hypothesis formulation, and facilitating the identification of molecular targets for subsequent experimentation.

                <p>by Willem Le Duc, Christopher R. Butler, Georgios P. D. Argyropoulos, Sonja Chu, Cendri Hutcherson, Anthony C. Ruocco, Rutsuko Ito, Andy C. H. Lee</p>

Rodent and human data implicate the hippocampus in the arbitration of approach-avoidance conflict (AAC), which arises when an organism is confronted with a stimulus associated simultaneously with reward and punishment. Yet, the precise contributions of this structure are underexplored, particularly with respect to the decision-making processes involved. We assessed humans with hippocampal damage and matched neurologically healthy controls on a computerized AAC paradigm in which participants first learned whether individual visual images were associated with the reward or loss of game points and were then asked to approach or avoid pairs of stimuli with non-conflicting or conflicting valences. To assess hippocampal involvement more broadly in response conflict, we also administered a Stroop and a Go/No-go task. On the AAC paradigm, following similar learning outcomes in individuals with hippocampal damage and matched controls, both participant groups approached positive and negative image pairs at the same rate but critically, those with hippocampal damage approached conflict pairs more often than controls. Choice and response AAC data were interrogated using the hierarchical drift diffusion model, which revealed that, compared to controls, individuals with hippocampal damage were more biased towards approach, required less evidence to make a decision during conflict trials, and were slower to accumulate evidence towards avoidance when confronted with conflicting image pairs. No significant differences were found between groups in performance accuracy or response time on the response conflict tasks. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the importance of the hippocampus to the evidence accumulation processes supporting value-based decision-making under motivational conflict.

Repetitive stress, a common feature of modern life, is a major risk factor for psychiatric and sensory disorders. Despite the prevalence of perceptual abnormalities in these disorders, little is known about how repetitive stress affects sensory processing and perception. Here, we combine repetitive stress in mice, longitudinal measurement of cortical activity, and auditory-guided behaviors to test if sound processing and perception of neutral sounds in adults are modulated by repetitive stress. We found that repetitive stress alters sound processing, increasing spontaneous cortical activity while dampening sound-evoked responses in pyramidal and PV cells and heightening sound-evoked responses in SST cells. These alterations in auditory processing culminated in perceptual shifts, particularly a reduction in loudness perception. Additionally, our work reveals that the impact of stress on perception evolves gradually as the stressor persists over time, emphasizing the dynamic and evolving nature of this mechanism. Our findings provide insight into a possible mechanism by which repetitive stress alters sensory processing and behavior, challenging the idea that stress primarily modulates emotionally charged stimuli.

                Background Plastic waste is becoming the most significant environmental pollutant because it is challenging to degrade naturally due to its composition of long hydrocarbon polymer chains. The present study aims to find out the biodegradation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) using both pure microbial strains TA1 (Aspergillus tubignesis), TA2 (Aspergillus fumigatus), TA3 (Aspergillus niger), TA6 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), TA7, and TA8 (Proteus mirabilis) and a consortium of these strains under pot conditions. Methods The experiment used sterilized dumpsite soil surface-sterilized with 5% sodium hypochlorite for 3 minutes, rinsed with distilled water, and dried pots. A completely randomized design (CRD) was used with 32 treatments submerged in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastic of two thicknesses: 25 microns and 40 microns. Each treatment was replicated three times and conducted over two intervals: 6 months and 9 months. Results The results showed that the maximum biodegradation of 25-micron-thick LDPE films was achieved using the pure fungal isolate Aspergillus niger (TA3) 13.69%, followed by Aspergillus fumigatus (TA2) 11.9% and Aspergillus tubignesis (TA1) 10.54% after 9 months. For 40-micron-thick LDPE films, the degradation rates were 7.8%, 5.8%, and 4.6% respectively. Using a consortium of three fungal species resulted in a maximum weight loss of 19.17% for 25-micron-thick LDPE bags and 9.8% for 40-micron-thick LDPE bags over the same period. FTIR analysis revealed changes in the functional groups on the LDPE surface, indicating hydrocarbon degradation. Conclusion The study found that pure microorganisms resulted in less weight loss compared to microbial consortia, and fungi were more effective than bacteria in degrading the LDPE plastic. Despite the differences, the current study suggested that microbial consortia provide an eco-friendly solution to address LDPE-related environmental issues with minimal adverse effects.

                Introduction Health systems worldwide are struggling to ensure the affordability of medicines. Prescription, dispensing, and pharmaceutical expenditures are key variables that highlight the need to understand how global scientific evidence is generated against factors (implicit and non-explicit) that influence these variables. Objectives Explore and provide a detailed description of the characteristics of the global scientific production of Open Access articles related to the prescription, dispensing and pharmaceutical expenditure faced by health systems worldwide. Methods A five-stage scientometric mapping was performed based on a systematic search of 8 databases. The five stages are: i) retrieval, ii) migration, iii) analysis, iv) visualization and v) interpretation. Results A corpus of evidence from 103 systematic literature reviews was obtained, screened and sifted, visualizing the countries, authors, databases, journals, institutions and time periods that contributed most to evidence generation. Central research themes are identified and phenomena related to article publication are discussed. Conclusions The analysis reveals a clear leadership of the United Kingdom and the United States in scientific production on prescribing, dispensing and pharmaceutical expenditure in health systems worldwide. This scientific production is mainly focused on financing policies, pharmaceutical incentives and interventions, and rational use of medicines. There is also evidence of the scarcity of scientific production in Latin American publications and authors, which could generate interest for future research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-973/v2?src=rss">Sexual dysfunction and other prolactin-related side effects of antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia: Protocol for a systematic review with single-arm, pairwise, and network meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies [version </a></h4>

              
                Introduction Sexual dysfunctions are common yet underreported side effects of antipsychotics for schizophrenia, affecting 30-80% of treated individuals. These side effects can severely impact social interactions and treatment adherence for individuals with schizophrenia, but comprehensive comparative evidence assessing the risk profiles of different antipsychotics is lacking. This study aims to address this gap using network meta-analysis that integrates data from both randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies (NRS). Protocol This systematic review will include both RCTs and NRS focusing on participants with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychoses, without restrictions on symptoms, gender, ethnicity, age, or setting. For interventions, all second-generation antipsychotics will be included. The primary outcome will be the occurrence of at least one sexual adverse event of any kind. Secondary outcomes will be the occurrence of any sexual adverse event evaluated in men and women separately, and any adverse event related to the three phases of sexual response cycle separately: desire (e.g. libido, sexual thoughts), arousal (e.g. erection, lubrication) and orgasm (e.g. ejaculation, anorgasmia), and any adverse effect related to breast dysfunction and menstruation irregularities. Study selection and data extraction will be performed independently by two reviewers. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 1 and ROBINS-I will be employed to evaluate the risk of bias for RCTs and NRS, respectively. Single-arm meta-analysis of proportions will synthesize the average frequency of sexual adverse events in treated participants. Pairwise and network meta-analysis of RCTs and NRS will be used to evaluate comparative tolerability. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will explore possible heterogeneity in results and validate the findings’ robustness. The quality of the evidence will be evaluated using GRADE. Discussion This study will provide vital insights into the sexual side effects of antipsychotics by combining evidence from clinical trials and real-world practice, facilitating better decision-making in choosing the optimal antipsychotic for individuals.

                Background Urinary tract infection is considered a common bacterial infection. Nowadays there is an increase in the irrational and inappropriate use of drugs. Adverse drug reactions have been reported to be a main cause of morbidity, hospital admission, and sometimes death. For this, it is very important to do the analysis of prescriptions and to see the adverse drug reactions due to the prescribed drugs. Objective 1. To analyze the prescribing pattern of drugs used in urinary tract infections of the reproductive age group (15-44). 2. To analyze adverse reactions due to drugs used for UTI of reproductive age group (15-44). 3. To analyze the pattern of combination therapy for urinary tract patients of reproductive age group. 4. To analyze the Fixed Drug Combination. Methods It is a retrospective observational study. This study will include prescriptions for UTIs for females of reproductive age (15-44 years). Data will be collected from 47 prescription papers from the medical record section. Then we will review the available data for analysis of prescription patterns and adverse drug reactions.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Microglia serve as vital innate immune cells in the central nervous system, playing crucial roles in the generation and development of brain neurons, as well as mediating a series of immune and inflammatory responses. The morphologic transitions of microglia are closely linked to their function. With the advent of single-cell sequencing technology, the diversity of microglial subtypes is increasingly recognized. The intricate interactions between microglia and neuronal networks have significant implications for psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. A deeper investigation of microglia in neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer disease, depression, and epilepsy can provide valuable insights in understanding the pathogenesis of diseases and exploring novel therapeutic strategies, thereby addressing issues related to central nervous system disorders.

                Cai et al. demonstrate that methionine-mediated IL-5 secretion activates the NF-κB pathway and enhances integrin αvβ3 expression in endometrial cells, which improves endometrial receptivity. Meanwhile, methionine can also increase Th2 cells at the implantation sites by regulating IL-5 secretion, thus favoring maternal-fetal immune tolerance.

                Neske and Cardin use imaging and optogenetics to examine the impact of thalamocortical and corticocortical projections on the higher-order cortex. They show that thalamic projections from the LP to higher-order cortical area PM primarily contribute to state-dependent modulation. In contrast, projections from cortical areas V1 and LM contribute to PM visual encoding.

                Jiang et al. identify distinct populations of ventral tegmental area GABAergic neurons that represent forward and backward forces generated during motivated behavior. Their force tuning is independent of reward prediction and outcome valence, and optogenetic stimulation of these neurons can modulate force exertion in real time.

                In this manuscript, Drake et al. describe an aging-like transcriptional signature in retinal ganglion cells during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) like that of cortical neurons in patients with multiple sclerosis. Partial reprogramming with AAV2-Oct4-Sox2-Kl4 to rejuvenate the transcriptome results in improved RGC survival and visual acuity during EAE.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98258">NPRL2 gene therapy induces effective antitumor immunity in KRAS/STK11 mutant anti-PD1 resistant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a humanized mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Expression of <i>NPRL2/TUSC4</i>, a tumor-suppressor gene, is reduced in many cancers including NSCLC. Restoration of <i>NPRL2</i> induces DNA damage, apoptosis, and cell-cycle arrest. We investigated <i>NPRL2</i> antitumor immune responses in aPD1<sup>R</sup>/<i>KRAS/STK11<sup>mt</sup></i> NSCLC in humanized-mice. Humanized-mice were generated by transplanting fresh human cord blood-derived CD34 stem cells into sub-lethally irradiated NSG mice. Lung-metastases were developed from <i>KRAS/STK11<sup>mt</sup></i>/aPD1<sup>R</sup> A549 cells and treated with <i>NPRL2</i> w/wo pembrolizumab. <i>NPRL2</i>-treatment reduced lung metastases significantly, whereas pembrolizumab was ineffective. Antitumor effect was greater in humanized than non-humanized-mice. <i>NPRL2</i> + pembrolizumab was not synergistic in <i>KRAS/STK11<sup>mt</sup></i>/aPD1<sup>R</sup> tumors but was synergistic in <i>KRAS<sup>wt</sup></i>/aPD1<sup>S</sup> H1299. <i>NPRL2</i> also showed a significant antitumor effect on <i>KRAS<sup>mt</sup></i>/aPD1<sup>R</sup> LLC2 syngeneic-tumors. The antitumor effect was correlated with increased infiltration of human cytotoxic-T, HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>DC, CD11c<sup>+</sup>DC, and downregulation of myeloid and regulatory-T cells in TME. Antitumor effect was abolished upon in-vivo depletion of CD8-T, macrophages, and CD4-T cells whereas remained unaffected upon NK-cell depletion. A distinctive protein-expression profile was found after <i>NPRL2</i> treatment. <i>IFNγ, CD8b</i>, and <i>TBX21</i> associated with T-cell functions were significantly increased, whereas <i>FOXP3, TGFB1/B2</i>, and <i>IL-10RA</i> were strongly inhibited by <i>NPRL2</i>. A list of T-cell co-inhibitory molecules was also downregulated. Restoration of <i>NPRL2</i> exhibited significantly slower tumor growth in humanized-mice, which was associated with increased presence of human cytotoxic-T, and DC and decreased percentage of Treg, MDSC, and TAM in TME. <i>NPRL2</i>-stable cells showed a substantial increase in colony-formation inhibition and heightened sensitivity to carboplatin. Stable-expression of <i>NPRL2</i> resulted in the downregulation of MAPK and AKT-mTOR signaling. Taken-together, <i>NPRL2</i> gene-therapy induces antitumor activity on <i>KRAS/STK11<sup>mt</sup></i>/aPD1<sup>R</sup> tumors through DC-mediated antigen-presentation and cytotoxic immune-cell activation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98427">Multi-tissue network analysis reveals the effect of JNK inhibition on dietary sucrose-induced metabolic dysfunction in rats</a></h4>

              
                Excessive consumption of sucrose, in the form of sugar-sweetened beverages, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction‐associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and other related metabolic syndromes. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway plays a crucial role in response to dietary stressors, and it was demonstrated that the inhibition of the JNK pathway could potentially be used in the treatment of MAFLD. However, the intricate mechanisms underlying these interventions remain incompletely understood given their multifaceted effects across multiple tissues. In this study, we challenged rats with sucrose-sweetened water and investigated the potential effects of JNK inhibition by employing network analysis based on the transcriptome profiling obtained from hepatic and extrahepatic tissues, including visceral white adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and brain. Our data demonstrate that JNK inhibition by JNK-IN-5A effectively reduces the circulating triglyceride accumulation and inflammation in rats subjected to sucrose consumption. Coexpression analysis and genome-scale metabolic modeling reveal that sucrose overconsumption primarily induces transcriptional dysfunction related to fatty acid and oxidative metabolism in the liver and adipose tissues, which are largely rectified after JNK inhibition at a clinically relevant dose. Skeletal muscle exhibited minimal transcriptional changes to sucrose overconsumption but underwent substantial metabolic adaptation following the JNK inhibition. Overall, our data provides novel insights into the molecular basis by which JNK inhibition exerts its metabolic effect in the metabolically active tissues. Furthermore, our findings underpin the critical role of extrahepatic metabolism in the development of diet-induced steatosis, offering valuable guidance for future studies focused on JNK-targeting for effective treatment of MAFLD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102274">Alzheimer-mutant γ-secretase complexes stall amyloid β-peptide production</a></h4>

              
                Missense mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PSEN1) cause early-onset familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) and alter proteolytic production of secreted 38-to-43-residue amyloid β-peptides (Aβ) by the PSEN1-containing γ-secretase complex, ostensibly supporting the amyloid hypothesis of pathogenesis. However, proteolysis of APP substrate by γ-secretase is processive, involving initial endoproteolysis to produce long Aβ peptides of 48 or 49 residues followed by carboxypeptidase trimming in mostly tripeptide increments. We recently reported evidence that FAD mutations in APP and PSEN1 cause deficiencies in early steps in processive proteolysis of APP substrate C99 and that this results from stalled γ-secretase enzyme-substrate and/or enzyme-intermediate complexes. These stalled complexes triggered synaptic degeneration in a <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> model of FAD independently of Aβ production. Here, we conducted full quantitative analysis of all proteolytic events on APP substrate by γ-secretase with six additional PSEN1 FAD mutations and found that all six are deficient in multiple processing steps. However, only one of these (F386S) was deficient in certain trimming steps but not in endoproteolysis. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy in intact cells revealed that all six PSEN1 FAD mutations lead to stalled γ-secretase enzyme-substrate/intermediate complexes. The F386S mutation, however, does so only in Aβ-rich regions of the cells, not in C99-rich regions, consistent with the deficiencies of this mutant enzyme only in trimming of Aβ intermediates. These findings provide further evidence that FAD mutations lead to stalled and stabilized γ-secretase enzyme-substrate and/or enzyme-intermediate complexes and are consistent with the stalled process rather than the products of γ-secretase proteolysis as the pathogenic trigger.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97268">Mechanical forces pattern endocardial Notch activation via mTORC2-PKC pathway</a></h4>

              
                Notch signaling has been identified as a key regulatory pathway in patterning the endocardium through activation of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the atrioventricular canal (AVC) and proximal outflow tract (OFT) region. However, the precise mechanism underlying Notch activation remains elusive. By transiently blocking the heartbeat of E9.5 mouse embryos, we found that Notch activation in the arterial endothelium was dependent on its ligand Dll4, whereas the reduced expression of Dll4 in the endocardium led to a ligand-depleted field, enabling Notch to be specifically activated in AVC and OFT by regional increased shear stress. The strong shear stress altered the membrane lipid microdomain structure of endocardial cells, which activated mTORC2 and PKC and promoted Notch1 cleavage even in the absence of strong ligand stimulation. These findings highlight the role of mechanical forces as a primary cue for endocardial patterning and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying congenital heart diseases of endocardial origin.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97532">Immunogenicity and safety of a live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate based on multiple attenuation mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 were rapidly developed and were effective during the pandemic. However, some limitations remain to be resolved, such as the short-lived induced immune response and certain adverse effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new vaccines that address these issues. While live-attenuated vaccines are a highly effective modality, they pose a risk of adverse effects, including virulence reversion. In the current study, we constructed a live-attenuated vaccine candidate, BK2102, combining naturally occurring virulence-attenuating mutations in the <i>NSP14</i>, <i>NSP1</i>, spike, and <i>ORF7-8</i> coding regions. Intranasal inoculation with BK2102 induced humoral and cellular immune responses in Syrian hamsters without apparent tissue damage in the lungs, leading to protection against a SARS-CoV-2 D614G and an Omicron BA.5 strains. The neutralizing antibodies induced by BK2102 persisted for up to 364 days, which indicated that they confer long-term protection against infection. Furthermore, we confirmed the safety of BK2102 using transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human ACE2 (hACE2) that are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. BK2102 did not kill the Tg mice, even when virus was administered at a dose of 10<sup>6</sup> plaque-forming units (PFUs), while 10<sup>2</sup> PFU of the D614G strain or an attenuated strain lacking the furin cleavage site of the spike was sufficient to kill mice. These results suggest that BK2102 is a promising live-vaccine candidate strain that confers long-term protection without significant virulence.

">Decoding semantics from natural speech using human intracranial EEG</a></h4>

              
                Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold promise for restoring natural language production capabilities in patients with speech impairments, potentially enabling smooth conversation that conveys meaningful information via synthesized words. While considerable progress has been made in decoding phonetic features of speech, our ability to extract lexical semantic information (i.e. the meaning of individual words) from neural activity remains largely unexplored. Moreover, most existing BCI research has relied on controlled experimental paradigms rather than natural conversation, limiting our understanding of semantic decoding in ecological contexts. Here, we investigated the feasibility of decoding lexical semantic information from stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) recordings in 14 participants during spontaneous conversation. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we were able to decode word level semantic features during language production with an average accuracy of 21% across all participants compared to a chance level of 10%. This semantic decoding remained robust across different semantic representations while maintaining specificity to semantic features. Further, we identified a distributed left-lateralized network spanning precentral gyrus, pars triangularis, and middle temporal cortex, with low-frequency oscillations showing stronger contributions. Together, our results establish the feasibility of extracting word meanings from neural activity during natural speech production and demonstrate the potential for decoding semantic content from unconstrained speech.

">Persistent Disruptions in Prefrontal Connectivity Despite Behavioral Rescue by Environmental Enrichment in a Mouse Model of Rett Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Rett Syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the MECP2 gene, is characterized by severe motor, cognitive and emotional impairments. Some of the deficits may result from changes in cortical connections, especially downstream projections of the prefrontal cortex, which may also be targets of restoration following rearing conditions such as environmental enrichment that alleviate specific symptoms. Here, using a heterozygous Mecp2+/- female mouse model closely analogous to human Rett Syndrome, we investigated the impact of early environmental enrichment on behavioral deficits and prefrontal cortex connectivity. Behavioral analyses revealed that enriched housing rescued fine motor deficits and reduced anxiety, with enrichment-housed Mecp2+/- mice performing comparably to wild-type (WT) controls in rotarod and open field assays. Anatomical mapping of top-down anterior cingulate cortex (ACA) projections demonstrated altered prefrontal cortex connectivity in Mecp2+/- mice, with increased axonal density in the somatosensory cortex and decreased density in the motor cortex compared to WT controls. ACA axons revealed shifts in hemispheric distribution, particularly in the medial network regions, with Mecp2+/- mice exhibiting reduced ipsilateral dominance. These changes were unaffected by enriched housing, suggesting that structural abnormalities in prefrontal cortex connectivity persist despite behavioral improvements. Enriched housing rescued brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the hippocampus but failed to restore BDNF levels in the prefrontal cortex, consistent with the persistent deficits observed in prefrontal axonal projections. These findings highlight the focal nature of changes induced by reduction of MeCP2 and by exposure to environmental enrichment, and suggest that environmental enrichment starting in adolescence can alleviate behavioral deficits without reversing abnormalities in large-scale cortical connectivity.

">Molecular and morphological circuitry of the octopus sucker ganglion</a></h4>

              
                The octopus sucker is a profoundly complex sensorimotor structure. Each of the hundreds of suckers that line the octopus arm can move independently or in concert with one another. These suckers also contain an intricate sensory epithelium, enriched with chemotactile receptors. Much of the massive nervous system embedded in the octopus arm mediates control of the suckers. Each arm houses a large axial nerve cord (ANC), which features local enlargements corresponding to each sucker. There is also a sucker ganglion, a peripheral nervous element, situated in the stalk of every sucker. The structure and function of the sucker ganglion remains obscure. We examined the cellular organization and molecular composition of the sucker ganglion in Octopus bimaculoides. The sucker ganglion has an ellipsoid shape and features an unusual organization: the neuropil of the ganglion is distributed as a cap aborally (away from the sucker) and a small pocket orally (towards the sucker), with neuronal cell bodies concentrated in the space between. Using in situ hybridization, we detected positive expression of sensory (PIEZO) and motor (LHX3 and MNX) neuron markers in the sucker ganglion cell bodies. Nerve fibers spread out from the sucker ganglion, targeting the surrounding sucker musculature and the oral roots extending to the ANC. Our results indicate that the sucker ganglion is composed of both sensory and motor elements and suggest that this ganglion is not a simple relay for the ANC but facilitates local reflexes for each sucker.

">A novel model of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy produces a clinically relevant phenotype in mice</a></h4>

              
                One of the most common adverse side effects of chemotherapeutics is chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Paclitaxel, a highly effective chemotherapeutic, is associated with a high incidence of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) that persists for over a year in 64% of patients and worsens with cumulative PTX dose. Patients experiencing PIPN may reduce the dosage of chemotherapy or halt treatment due to this pain. Current preclinical models have improved our understanding of PIPN but have been ineffective in generating translational therapeutic options. These models administer a single cycle of PTX to induce a PIPN phenotype of mechanical and cold hypersensitivity that resolves within 28 days. However, this does not mirror the clinical dosing regimen or the patient experience of CIPN. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive and longitudinal behavioral profile of our novel model of PIPN in mice where three consecutive cycles of PTX (4 mg/kg, 4 doses/cycle) are given to mimic the clinical administration. Repeated cycles of PTX caused long-lasting mechanical and cold hypersensitivity in male and female C57Bl/6J mice that mirrors clinical observations of persistent CIPN without causing detrimental effects to rodent overall health, normal rodent behavior, or motor function. Our findings support the use of this translational model to facilitate a better understanding of PIPN and the development of effective treatment options. Improved pain management will enable the completion of cancer treatment, decrease health care expenditure, decrease mortality, and improve the quality of life for cancer patients and survivors.

">Joint visual-vestibular computation of head direction and reflexive eye movement</a></h4>

              
                Several cognitive maps have been identified, but what sensory signals drive them and how these are combined are not well understood. One such map, the head-direction representation, is believed to be primarily driven by vestibular motion signals in mammals. Here, we combine in vivo imaging of neuronal activity, genetic perturbation of neuronal circuits, behavioral testing, and theoretical modeling to show that the representation of head direction in mouse is driven by not only vestibular but also visual motion signals: both are essential, and the latter, originating in direction-selective retinal ganglion cell activity, dominates at low speeds. We show that, correspondingly, visual perturbations alter navigational behavior that relies on head-direction computation. Finally, we find that head-direction representation and the slow phase of reflexive eye movement are tightly correlated, and we propose a theoretical model that elucidates their emergence from coupled visual and vestibular processes. Our results suggest that the brain's estimate of head direction is built on an oculomotor reflex pathway driven by both visual and vestibular signals.

">Post-Synaptic Density Proteins in Oligodendrocytes are Required for Activity-Dependent Myelin Sheath Growth</a></h4>

              
                Compelling evidence demonstrates a functional link between neuronal activity and myelination, highlighting the vital importance of axon-oligodendrocyte crosstalk in myelin physiology and function. However, how neuronal activity is relayed to oligodendroglia to regulate myelin formation remains not fully understood. Here, we aimed to characterize how that myelination is regulated by glutamate vesicular release in zebrafish spinal cord. We compared oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and myelinating oligodendrocytes (mOLs) for their close apposition with pre-synaptic boutons and found that these are increased in number on mOLs during myelin internode elongation. Consistently, mOLs show more pre-synaptic boutons during myelin internode elongation compared to OPCs. In addition, we also found that oligodendroglial cells express the post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) along punctated domains, regardless of their differentiation stage. Genetically targeted PSD-95-GFP expression in oligodendroglia revealed post-synaptic-like domains along their processes and sheaths, which are contacted by axonal pre-synaptic varicosities. These contacts are increased in mOLs. Importantly, CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletion of dlg4 in oligodendroglia impairs myelin sheath growth, in vivo. Overall, our data indicate that PSD-95 is a key component of axons to oligodendrocytes neurotransmission that regulates myelin sheath growth.

">Sex specific disruptions in Protein Kinase Cγ signaling in a mouse model of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 14</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 14 (SCA14) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding protein kinase C gamma (PKC{gamma}), a Ca2+/diacylglycerol (DG)-dependent serine/threonine kinase dominantly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells. These mutations impair autoinhibitory constraints to increase the basal activity of the kinase, resulting in deficits in the cerebellum that are not observed upon simple deletion of the gene, and severe ataxia. To better understand the phenotypic impact of aberrant PKC{gamma} signaling in disease pathology, we developed a knock-in murine model of the SCA14 mutation {Delta}F48 in PKC{gamma}. This fully penetrant mutation is severe in humans and is mechanistically informative as it has high basal activity but is unresponsive to agonist stimulation. Genetic, behavioral, and molecular testing revealed that {Delta}F48 PKC{gamma} SCA14 mice have ataxia related phenotypes and an altered cerebellar phosphoproteome, effects that are more severe in male mice. Analysis of existing human data reveal that SCA14 has a significantly earlier age of onset for males compared with females. Our data from this clinically relevant mutation suggest that enhanced basal activity of PKC{gamma} is necessary and sufficient to cause ataxia and that treatment strategies to modulate aberrant PKC{gamma} may be particularly beneficial in males.

">Astrocyte gap junctions and Kir channels contribute to K+ buffering and regulate neuronal excitability</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are connected in a functional syncytium via gap junctions, which is thought to contribute to maintenance of extracellular K+ homeostasis. The prevailing hypothesis is that K+ released during neuronal firing is taken up by astrocytes via Kir channels and then distributed among neighboring astrocytes via gap junctions. Previous reports examining the role of Kir channels and gap junctions have shown both hyperexcitability and depression when each mechanism is blocked. Here, we tested the effect of blocking Kir channels and gap junctions, both independently and simultaneously, on field activity of cortical slices in response to a 3 s, 20 Hz stimulation train. Independently blocking either Kir channels or gap junctions increased the amplitude of the first fEPSC (field excitatory post-synaptic current) in response to a stimulation train, followed by suppression of fEPSCs during sustained stimulation. Surprisingly, blocking both gap junctions and Kir channels enhanced the suppression of neuronal activity, resulting in a ~75% decrease in fiber volley (pre-synaptic action potentials) amplitude in the first response, followed by a fast and strong suppression of sustained fEPSCs. Our results demonstrate that blocking Kir channels and gap junctions can increase the excitability of neurons when firing is sparse, but suppression results when the firing frequency is increased to cortical physiological ranges. This suggest that K+ buffering via Kir and gap junctions, likely mediated by astrocytes, together play a critical role in maintaining neuronal excitability, particularly during sustained activity.

">SNARE Protein Ykt6 Drives AMPAR Insertion at Synaptic Terminals During LTP</a></h4>

              
                Ykt6 is a SNARE protein essential for vesicular fusion along the secretory pathway. It has been implicated in -synuclein (Syn) pathology and is critically involved in -synuclein-dependent dementias. Syn disrupts AMPA receptor (AMPAR) expression at synaptic terminals, which is key for long-term potentiation (LTP) - the cellular basis of memory and learning. AMPAR expression at synaptic terminals relies on the secretory pathway; however, the role of Ykt6 in LTP and its perturbation under Syn pathological conditions remain unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that Ykt6 is highly expressed in the hippocampus of the mammalian brain, relocalizes to synaptic terminals during LTP, and regulates GluA1 surface expression. Moreover, we found that Ykt6 modulates the synaptic vesicular pools and dendritic arborization. Taken together, our findings establish Ykt6 as an essential SNARE for hippocampal neural function during LTP, with significant implications for -synuclein-dependent dementias.

">Neurons in the inferior colliculus use multiplexing to encode features of frequency-modulated sweeps</a></h4>

              
                Within the central auditory pathway, the inferior colliculus (IC) is a critical integration center for ascending sound information. Previous studies have shown that many IC neurons exhibit receptive fields for individual features of auditory stimuli, such as sound frequency, intensity, and location, but growing evidence suggests that some IC neurons may multiplex features of sound. Here, we used in vivo juxtacellular recordings in awake, head-fixed mice to examine how IC neurons responded to frequency-modulated sweeps that varied in speed, direction, intensity, and frequency range. We then applied machine learning methods to determine how individual IC neurons encode features of FM sweeps. We found that individual IC neurons multiplex FM sweep features using various strategies including spike timing, distribution of inter-spike intervals, and first spike latency. In addition, we found that decoding accuracy for sweep direction can vary with sweep speed and frequency range, suggesting the presence of mixed selectivity in single neurons. Accordingly, using static receptive fields for direction alone yielded poor predictions of neuron responses to vocalizations that contain simple frequency changes. Lastly, we showed that encoding strategies varied across individual neurons, resulting in a highly informative population response for FM sweep features. Together, our results suggest that multiplexing sound features is a common mechanism used by IC neurons to represent complex sounds.

">Aseptic, semi-sealed cranial chamber implants for chronic multi-channel neurochemical and electrophysiological neural recording in nonhuman primates</a></h4>

              
                We developed an implantable neural interface for monitoring both chemical and electrical forms of brain activity in monkeys that maintains aseptic properties for year-long periods while leveraging the modular functions (e.g., sensor moveability) provided by a chamber system. Invasive electrophysiological recordings, especially in subcortical structures from nonhuman primates usually involves implanting electrodes into the brain through a skull-mounted chamber. These electrodes may be attached temporarily for several hours of recording, or permanently. Permanent attachments are favorable to allow for sealing the chamber completely from externally originating pathogenic species that can infiltrate and compromise the health of the animal. A sealed chamber also reduces the need for frequent chamber cleaning required to minimize the accumulation of pathogenic organisms. However, neurochemical measurements require specialized electrodes with extremely fragile carbon fiber tips and are not compatible with recently developed sealed chamber systems. Here, we leveraged osseointegrating materials and hermetic sealing strategies to enable both neurochemical and electrical neural activity measurements from a sealed chamber with an aspirating port for culturing chamber fluid to ensure an aseptic environment. The system was shown to provide successful recordings of neural activity in two monkeys while maintaining negative bacteria culture results for over a year post-implant.

">From ancient fears to airborne threats: fMRI insights into neural fear responses</a></h4>

              
                Threat perception is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, shaped by evolutionary pressures and modern environmental demands. While ancestral threats (e.g., snakes) have been shown to elicit stronger neural responses than modern threats (e.g., guns), less is known about how the brain processes airborne threats, such as depictions of individuals wearing face masks. This fMRI study investigates neural responses to ancestral, modern, and airborne threats to identify shared and distinct activation patterns. Sixty participants viewed visual stimuli from the three categories while undergoing fMRI scanning. Results showed heightened activation in the fear-processing network for all affective stimuli. In addition, activation of the ventral attention network was found for the ancestral threats. Modern threats elicited less intense responses, primarily engaging cortical regions associated with context-specific analysis. Notably, airborne threats elicited neural responses of similar intensity to ancestral threats but activated cortical regions overlapping with those for modern threats. This dual pattern highlights the brain's capacity to integrate evolutionary biases with socially constructed threat awareness. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing airborne threats as a unique category of threat processing, with implications for public health and mental well-being.

">Dopaminergic mechanisms of dynamical social specialization in mouse microsocieties</a></h4>

              
                Social organization and division of labor are fundamental to animal societies, but how do these structures emerge from individual interactions, and what role does neuromodulation play in shaping them? Using behavioral tracking in a semi-natural environment, neural recordings, and computational models integrating reinforcement and social learning, we show that groups of three isogenic mice spontaneously develop specialized roles while solving a foraging task requiring individual decisions under social constraints. Moreover, these roles are shaped by dopaminergic activity in the ventral tegmental area. Strikingly, despite minor sex-differences in behavior when mice were tested alone, male triads formed stable worker-scrounger relationships driven by competition, whereas female triads adopted uniform, cooperative strategies. Model analysis revealed how intra- and inter-sex parameter differences in resource exploitation, combined with contingent and dynamic social interactions, drive behavioral specialization and labor division. Most notably, it highlighted how contingency, amplified by competition, magnifies individual differences and shapes social profiles. The plastic, adaptive nature of social organization within triads was confirmed by manipulating dopaminergic cell activity, which reshaped social roles and altered group structure. Our findings support a feedback loop where social context shapes neural states, which in turn reinforce behavioral specialization and stabilize social structures.

">Generation of C9orf72 repeat knock-in iPSC lines for modelling ALS and FTD</a></h4>

              
                Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models are powerful tools for neurodegenerative disease modelling, as they allow mechanistic studies in a human genetic environment and they can be differentiated into a range of neuronal and non-neuronal cells. However, these models come with inherent challenges due to line-to-line and clonal variability. To combat this issue, the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI) has generated an iPSC repository using a single clonal reference line, KOLF2.1J, into which disease-causing mutations and revertants are introduced via gene editing. Here we describe the generation and validation of lines carrying the most common causative mutation for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene, for the iNDI collection of neurodegenerative iPSC models. We demonstrate that these C9orf72 knock-in lines differentiate efficiently into neurons and display characteristic C9orf72-associated pathologies, including reduced C9orf72 levels and the presence of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) and RNA foci, which increase in abundance over time in culture. These pathologies are not present in revertant cells lacking the repeat expansion. These repeat expansion and revertant cell lines are now available to academic and for-profit institutions through the JAX iPS cell repository and will help to facilitate and standardise iPSC-based ALS/FTD research.

">Molecularly-guided spatial proteomics captures single-cell identity and heterogeneity of the nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Single-cell proteomics is an emerging field with significant potential to characterize heterogeneity within biological tissues. It offers complementary insights to single-cell transcriptomics by revealing unbiased proteomic changes downstream of the transcriptome. Recent advancements have focused on enhancing proteome coverage and depth, mostly in cultured cell lines, and a few recent studies have explored the potential of analyzing tissue micro-samples but were limited to homogenous peripheral tissues. In this current work, we utilize the power of spatial single cell-proteomics through immunostaining-guided laser capture microdissection (LCM) coupled with LC-MS to investigate the heterogenous central nervous system. We used this method to compare neuronal populations from cortex and substantia nigra, two brain regions associated with motor and cognitive function and various neurological disorders. Moreover, we used the technique to understand the neuroimmune changes associated with stab wound injury. Finally, we focus our application on the peripheral nervous system, where we compare the proteome of the myenteric plexus cell ganglion to the nerve bundle. This study demonstrates the utility of spatial single-cell proteomics in neuroscience research toward understanding fundamental biology and the molecular drivers of neurological conditions.

">Pallidal prototypic neuron and astrocyte activities regulate flexible reward-seeking behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral flexibility allows animals to adjust actions to changing environments. While the basal ganglia are critical for adaptation, the specific role of the external globus pallidus (GPe) is unclear. This study examined the contributions of two major GPe cell types--prototypic neurons projecting to the subthalamic nucleus (ProtoGPe[-&gt;]STN neurons) and astrocytes--to behavioral flexibility. Using longitudinal operant conditioning with context reversals, we found that ProtoGPe[-&gt;]STN neurons dynamically represent contextual information correlating with behavioral optimality. In contrast, GPe astrocytes exhibited gradual contextual encoding independent of performance. Deleting ProtoGPe[-&gt;]STN neurons impaired adaptive responses to changing action-outcome contingencies without altering initial reward-seeking acquisition, highlighting their specific role in enabling behavioral flexibility. Furthermore, we discovered that ProtoGPe[-&gt;]STN neurons integrate inhibitory striatal and excitatory subthalamic inputs, modulating downstream basal ganglia circuits to support flexible behavior. This research elucidates the complementary roles of ProtoGPe[-&gt;]STN neurons and astrocytes in cellular mechanisms of flexible reward-seeking behavior.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The approximate number system or «sense of number» is a crucial, presymbolic mechanism enabling animals to estimate quantities, which is essential for survival in various contexts (eg estimating numerosities of social companions, prey, predators, and so on). Behavioral studies indicate that a sense of number is widespread across vertebrates and invertebrates. Specific brain regions such as the intraparietal sulcus and prefrontal cortex in primates, or equivalent areas in birds and fish, are involved in numerical estimation, and their activity is modulated by the ratio of quantities. Data gathered across species strongly suggest similar evolutionary pressures for number estimation pointing to a likely common origin, at least across vertebrates. On the other hand, few studies have investigated the origins of the sense of number. Recent findings, however, have shown that numerosity-selective neurons exist in newborn animals, such as domestic chicks and zebrafish, supporting the hypothesis of an innateness of the approximate number system. Control-rearing experiments on visually naïve animals further support the notion that the sense of number is innate and does not need any specific instructive experience in order to be triggered.</span>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) are becoming increasingly prevalent, necessitating diverse treatment options to manage symptoms. The effectiveness of these treatments depends on accurate and sensitive diagnostic methods. This exploratory pilot study explores the use of eye tracking and compares it to neuropsychological tests on patients treated with deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS). Methods: We used the HTC Vive Pro Eye VR headset with Tobii eye tracker to measure eye movements in 10 Parkinson syndrome patients while viewing three 360-degree scenes. Eye movements were recorded pre- and post-dTMS, focusing on Fixation Duration, Longest Fixation Period, Saccade Rate, and Total Fixations. Neuropsychological assessments (MoCA, TUG, BDI) were conducted before and after stimulation. dTMS was performed using the Brainsway device with the H5 helmet, targeting the motor cortex (1 Hz) and the prefrontal cortex (10 Hz) for 7&amp;amp;ndash;12 sessions. Results: ROC analysis indicated a moderate ability to differentiate between states using eye movement parameters. Significant correlations were found between changes in the longest fixation period and MoCA scores (r = 0.65, p = 0.025), and between fixation durations and BDI scores (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.55, p = 0.043). Paired t-tests showed no significant differences in eye movement parameters, but BDI scores significantly reduced post-dTMS (t(5) = 2.57, p = 0.049). Conclusions: Eye-tracking parameters, particularly the Longest Fixation Duration and Saccade Rate, could serve as sensitive and feasible biomarkers for cognitive changes in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Syndrome, offering a quick alternative to traditional methods. Traditional neuropsychological tests showed a significant improvement in depressive symptoms after dTMS. Further research with larger sample sizes is necessary to validate these findings and explore the diagnostic utility of eye tracking.</p>

	<p>Background: Schizophrenia is a complex disorder characterized by disruptions in cognition, behavior, and emotions. Extensive research has uncovered alterations in a single modality (either the brain structure or function) in schizophrenia. However, the limitation is that a single modality could not offer a synchronous result between the brain structure and function because of different samples. Here, a multiparametric approach is essential to understand the common and distinct alterations between the brain structure and function in schizophrenia. Methods: We analyzed structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 146 participants (72 individuals with schizophrenia and 74 healthy controls). Individual morphological similarity and functional connectivity gradients were computed using a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique with diffusion map embedding. Furthermore, to understand how the alterations may be related to genetic underpinnings, gene expression enrichment analyses were conducted using Allen Brain Human Atlas and GOrilla. Results: Compared with controls, patients with schizophrenia had reduced scores on the principal functional gradient of the visual network and elevated scores on the principal functional gradient of the limbic network, the frontoparietal control network, and the default mode network. Additionally, the main functional gradient in individuals with schizophrenia showed compression along the primary axis compared to the healthy control group. These changes were linked to genes involved in synaptic signaling and neuronal development. Conclusions: These results indicate connectome gradient dysfunction in schizophrenia and its linkage with gene expression profiles, supporting widespread network-level abnormalities. The integration of neuroimaging provides insight into the neurobiological underpinnings and potential biomarkers for treatment evaluation in this disorder.</p>

	<p>The increasingly widespread use of stereo-EEG in the pre-surgical evaluation has led to greater recognition of the insula as both a source and surgical target for drug-resistant epilepsy. Clinicians have long appreciated the challenges of diagnosing and treating seizures arising from the insula. Insular-onset seizures present with a wide variety of semiologies due to its dense and complex integration with other brain structures, resulting in the insula&amp;amp;rsquo;s reputation as the &amp;amp;ldquo;great mimicker.&amp;amp;rdquo; Surgical access to the insula is guarded by the overlying frontal, temporal, and parietal opercula and requires careful negotiation of the Sylvian fissure, the vascular candelabra of the middle cerebral artery, and protection of crucial white matter structures (e.g., corona radiata). Despite these difficulties, open surgical intervention for insular epilepsy is associated with favorable seizure control rates, surpassing those achieved with less-invasive alternatives (e.g., laser ablation). Technical nuances that minimize the risk of adverse functional outcomes following open insular resection (especially hemiparesis) are of tremendous value to the epilepsy surgeon. Here, we review the literature on hemiparesis secondary to insular resection and detail strategies for achieving safe and thorough resection of the insula, with emphasis placed on the posterior insula. We supplement this review with four illustrative cases in which focal, drug-resistant epilepsy was managed via open insular resection with no resultant permanent hemiparesis. Technical insights accumulated through these cases are highlighted.</p>

	<p>Background: The COVID-19 pandemic represented a disruptive global event that significantly impacted mental health, posing specific challenges for vulnerable groups such as individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This group faced particular difficulties due to disrupted routines, limited access to therapies, and social isolation. This study examines the changes in mental health among individuals with ASD during and after the pandemic, highlighting contemporary challenges and the mitigation strategies implemented. Methods: A narrative review was conducted. The search was performed in scientific databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Teseo, Dialnet, and Google Scholar using key terms such as &amp;amp;ldquo;ASD&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;mental health&amp;amp;rdquo;, and &amp;amp;ldquo;pandemic&amp;amp;rdquo;. Studies published between 2020 and 2024 addressing the impact of COVID-19 on factors such as anxiety, depression, and stress, as well as therapeutic interventions, were selected. Results: Fifteen relevant studies were identified. The findings showed significant increases in the levels of anxiety and depression among individuals with ASD, which were primarily attributable to disrupted routines and social isolation. However, noteworthy innovations in virtual interventions were reported, demonstrating significant potential to mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic. Conclusions: The pandemic exacerbated preexisting challenges in the mental health of individuals with ASD, revealing structural vulnerabilities in access to therapy and emotional regulation. Nevertheless, it spurred innovations in virtual interventions that could transform support for this group in the future. This analysis underscores the importance of implementing inclusive, sustainable, and adaptive policies to improve the quality of life of individuals with ASD, particularly in the context of global crises.</p>

	<p>Objectives: This research investigated the impact of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on sense of agency (SoA) when focusing on cortical regions like the cerebellum, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the angular gyrus (AG). To this aim, three experiments were carried out, and agency was assessed through the Wundt Clock Paradigm, which provides a measure of intentional binding. Methods: The first experiment provided offline cathodal stimulation applied to the right cerebellum, with the return electrode placed on the left DLPFC, and participants were randomly assigned to either the placebo group or the active group. The second experiment adopted the same montage as the previous one, but the online stimulation was provided in a within-subjects design. Results: Since none of these studies targeting the cerebellum produced significant results on the agency measures, we carried out a third experiment aimed to replicate a previous study that provided inhibitory stimulation of the left AG. However, this also showed no modulations of SoA. Conclusions: Several explanations could be given for these negative results. For example, the inter-individual variability, task complexity, and limitations of tDCS technology may contribute to the inconsistencies of the results. Also, the failure to replicate a previous study raises the issue of the replicability crisis in psychology. Nevertheless, this study may represent an important reference for research aimed at modulating SoA through the neuromodulation of brain areas included in the agency network. Future studies could benefit from assessing individual cognitive abilities supporting agency, optimizing stimulation protocols, and exploring alternative brain stimulation techniques to obtain significant results.</p>

                Biopesticides are pest control products derived from natural sources such as microbes, macro-organisms (insects and pathogens), plant extracts, and certain minerals. Many biopesticides are considered environmentally safe and can complement or substitute conventional chemical pesticides. They can also be highly specific or broad spectrum with a unique mode of action controlling a wide range of pest species. Due to their target-specificity and low to no environmental residuality, biopesticides conform to the 3 pillars of Climate-Smart Agriculture, the Sustainable Development Goals, and, ultimately, the Paris Agreement. This review focuses largely on microbial biopesticides derived from fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes. It discusses (i) the various microbial biopesticide formulations, (ii) the mode of microbial biopesticide action, (iii) the factors that affect the potential efficacy of biopesticides, (iv) challenges to the adoption of microbial biopesticides, and (v) the role of microbial biopesticides in Integrated Pest Management programs. Finally, advancements in application techniques, as well as future research directions and gaps, are highlighted.

                <p>High-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced long&ndash;term potentiation (LTP) is generally regarded as a homosynaptic Hebbian-type LTP, where synaptic changes are thought to occur at the synapses that project from the stimulation site and terminate onto the neurons at the recording site. In this study, we first investigated HFS-induced LTP on urethane-anesthetized rats and found that cortical HFS enhances neural responses at the recording site through the strengthening of local connectivity with nearby neurons at the stimulation site rather than through synaptic strengthening at the recording site. This enhanced local connectivity at the stimulation site leads to increased output propagation, resulting in signal potentiation at the recording site. Additionally, we discovered that HFS can also nonspecifically strengthen distant afferent synapses at the HFS site, thereby expanding its impact beyond local neural connections. This form of plasticity exhibits a neo-Hebbian characteristic as it exclusively manifests in the presence of cholecystokinin release, induced by HFS. The cortical HFS-induced local LTP was further supported by a behavioral task, providing additional evidence. Our results unveil a previously overlooked mechanism underlying cortical plasticity: synaptic plasticity is more likely to occur around the soma site of strongly activated cortical neurons rather than solely at their projection terminals.</p>

As a purely mental action without obvious physical manifestations, inner speech has been notoriously difficult to quantify. To address this issue, the present study repurposed the phenomenon of speaking-induced suppression, wherein overt speech has been consistently shown to elicit reduced auditory evoked potentials compared with externally generated speech, as well as changes in oscillatory activity in gamma and theta frequency bands. Given the functional similarities between inner and overt speech, we used an established experimental protocol to investigate whether similar metrics could be used to distinguish the content of inner speech. Healthy participants (<I>n</I> = 129) produced an inner syllable at a precisely specified time. An audible syllable was concurrently presented which either matched or mismatched the content of the inner syllable. The results revealed that Match and Mismatch conditions could be differentiated on the basis of their evoked oscillations in the gamma, theta, and alpha bands. Notably, there was a gamma-band oscillation in the vicinity of the P2 that differed between the Match and Mismatch conditions, suggesting that "late" gamma-band activity may index consciously perceived expectancy violations, or cognitive prediction errors. Regarding the auditory evoked potentials, the N1 component was suppressed in the Match condition while the P2 component was suppressed in the Mismatch condition, replicating previous findings. This study provides support for the existence of "inner speaking-induced suppression", and demonstrates that inner syllables can be differentiated based on their influence on the electroencephalographic activity elicited by simultaneously-presented audible syllables.</p>

                <p>Extended performance of cognitively demanding tasks induces cognitive fatigue manifested with an overall deterioration of behavioral performance. In particular, long practice with tasks requiring impulse control is typically followed by a decrease in self-control efficiency, leading to performance instability. Here, we show that this is due to changes in activation modalities of key task-related areas occurring if these areas previously underwent intensive use. We investigated in 25 healthy adults the effects of extended practice with high cognitive demand (HCD) tasks on a Go-No Go task and the underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. We compared these effects with those induced by practice with similar, but low cognitive demand (LCD) tasks. HCD tasks were followed by an increase in response inhibition failures. These were correlated with the appearance of a distinct neural signature on fast response trials, characterized by lower levels of beta ([13&ndash;30] Hz) EEG activity in the prestimulus period, and by a lack of EEG markers of preresponse processing in frontal areas. Moreover, HCD tasks were followed by a decrease in N200 during correct withholds while LCD tasks were followed instead by a lesser fraction of hits and a decrease in P300, suggesting a decrease in engagement. Overall, these results show that exertion of cognitive control determines the appearance of two distinct modalities of response with different processing speeds, associated with distinct underlying neural activity.</p>

                Objective To estimate the prevalence of organophosphate (OP) poisoning in Nepal. Methods PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), Cochrane Library, Ovid, and Springer databases were searched. The search strategies were used in different databases until December 13, 2024. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist was used to assess the quality of the included studies. The R project was used to estimate the pooled prevalence rate and 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the results of the heterogeneity test. Results Eleven studies, involving 4809 participants. Heterogeneity indicated a P value of <0.100; therefore, we applied the random effects model for data synthesis. The overall prevalence of OP poisoning in Nepal was 36.7% (95% CI: 24.99-49.34) in Nepal. Funnel plot dots were not distributed symmetrically on either side of the central line, suggesting a potential publication bias. The results of the heterogeneity analysis revealed that hospital-based studies showed a higher prevalence rate of 36.9% (95% CI: 24.2-50.6) than community-based studies. Additionally, studies conducted in Other cities-based demonstrated a pooled prevalence rate of 43.38% (95% CI: 28.95-58.39), which was higher than that in Kathmandu-based studies. Conclusion The overall prevalence of OP poisoning was 36.7% in Nepal. The hospital-based studies indicated a higher pooled prevalence than community-based studies and other cities-based studies reported a higher prevalence than Kathmandu-based studies. Future research is warranted to provide more accurate and comprehensive evidence regarding the prevalence of OP poisoning in Nepal.

                Background This study investigates the connection between aggregate markups and income inequality, exploring how market power affects inequality in developed, emerging, and developing economies. The analysis aims to reveal how institutional differences and economic systems shape this relationship. Method The study examines data from 12 countries from 1997 to 2016 using a panel data approach. The analysis focuses on key variables such as the Gini index (measuring inequality), lagged markups, trade openness, GDP per capita, tax revenue, poverty, and R&D expenditure. A two-way fixed-effects model is applied to account for country and year-specific differences, while robust standard errors ensure reliability. Results The results show that higher markups are closely linked to greater income inequality, with the impact being particularly pronounced in emerging and developing economies. Integrating tax policies, trade openness, and GDP growth into the analysis indicates the limitations of relying solely on economic growth to achieve equity. The research highlights taxation and trade as effective levers for mitigating inequality and raises important questions about the role of innovation in this dynamic. Conclusion This study shows the interaction between market power and inequality across diverse economic systems. We examine how factors like market concentration and institutional quality drive inequality provides practical insights and policy recommendations for effectively addressing income disparities.

                Background Dengue infection during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal and neonatal complications; therefore, the objective of this research is to determine these outcomes and describe the clinical manifestations of the infection. Methods A systematic review of studies published in PubMed, MEDLINE, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus and thesis repositories published between 2013 and October 2023 was performed. DeCS and MeSH dengue and maternal-neonatal outcome were used. Thirteen studies were selected and the New Castle-Ottawa scale was used to assess their quality. Mantel-Haenszel hazard ratios were calculated to report the overall effect size using random-effects models. All analyses were performed in Rev Man 5.4.1 Results The 13 studies involved a population of 18,724 pregnant women, with cohorts ranging from 25 to 17,673 pregnant women. The most frequent outcomes in the pregnant women were cesarean section and postpartum hemorrhage, and in the newborns, preterm delivery and low birth weight. According to the New Castle-Ottawa scale, six studies were considered low risk and seven studies moderate risk. Dengue is a risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage (OR: 2.23 IC 0.24 – 20.38), premature rupture of membranes (OR: 1.04 IC 0.55-1.97) and cesarean section (OR: 1.39 IC 0.80 – 2.41). It could not be concluded that dengue is a risk factor for the neonatal outcomes studied. The clinical picture of pregnant women with dengue was predominantly fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, anemia, dyspnea and myalgia. Conclusions Pregnancy-related changes in the immune, cardiovascular and coagulation systems, among others, increase the probability of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in case of DENV infection, such as postpartum hemorrhage, premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, low birth weight and preterm delivery. Pregnant women should be considered a population at risk and should be included in dengue control, diagnosis and treatment policies.

                Background In this paper, we introduce the concept of H-implicative almost distributive lattices, which are a special class of lattices with both implicative and almost distributive properties. This study is aimed at extending the understanding of lattice structures and their ideals, particularly focusing on LI-ideals, a novel concept within H-implicative almost distributive lattices. Methods We define an LI-ideal of an implicative almost distributive lattice L and investigate its properties. The paper demonstrates that every LI-ideal in L is an almost distributive lattice ideal of L. Additionally, we explore the relationship between filters and LI-ideals, and we study the process of generating an LI-ideal from a given set. Lastly, we examine the construction of quotient structures via LI-ideals. Results We present several examples showing that every almost distributive lattice ideal is also an LI-ideal in an H-implicative almost distributive lattice. The study establishes key relationships between the concepts of filters and LI-ideals. Furthermore, we provide a method for generating an LI-ideal from a set and construct a quotient structure using an LI-ideal. Conclusions The paper introduces new concepts and relationships within the study of H-implicative almost distributive lattices. Our findings demonstrate the interconnection between almost distributive lattice ideals and LI-ideals and offer insights into how these ideals can be generated and used to construct quotient structures. This work provides a deeper understanding of lattice theory and opens new avenues for further research in the area of lattice ideals.

                Background & Purpose Falls and balance issues are significant concerns for the elderly. Treadmill training is increasingly recognized as a potential intervention to improve balance and reduce fall risk in this population. This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of treadmill training on balance in the elderly. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted in databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, PEDro, Cochrane Library, and ERIC from January 1, 1980, to January 1, 2025. The search focused on treadmill training’s impact on balance in older adults. From 74 identified studies, primary outcome measure was “Balance Improvement, risk of fall” and secondary were “Cognitive Function and Quality of Life,” and others. Articles were excluded for reasons like irrelevance to treadmill training, language barriers, or duplication, resulting in 16 final studies. Results Treadmill training demonstrated positive effects on balance and fall risk reduction, particularly in elderly individuals with Parkinson’s disease, spinal cord injuries, and age-related balance issues. Perturbation-based treadmill training significantly reduced fall rates, while underwater treadmill sessions improved mobility and cognitive function. Conclusion Treadmill training interventions are promising for improving balance and mobility in the elderly, including those with Parkinson’s disease, spinal cord injuries, and age-related balance issues. While these interventions show potential, further research is needed to determine optimal protocols, durations, and combinations with other interventions. This could lead to a more comprehensive approach for addressing balance and mobility challenges in the elderly, promoting healthy aging and reducing fall risks.

                Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) has been a well-known therapy since years ago, especially for renal stones less than 20 mm. This study compared the effectiveness of totally ultrasound-guided (US-guided) and fluoroscopy-guided (FS-guided) SWL in treating renal and ureteral stones. A protocol has been registered in PROSPERO databases for systematic reviews. A systematic literature search was conducted in five online databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, EMBASE, ProQuest, and Scopus). We included all available articles that compared the effectiveness and safety of US-SWL to FS-SWL. A risk of bias assessment was done using Risk of Bias (Rob) Tools for randomized interventional studies and Risk of bias in non-randomized studies interventions (ROBINS-I) Tools for Non-randomized studies. The primary outcome was the stone-free rate, and the secondary outcome was the complication rate. Subgroup analyses were performed for adult and pediatric groups. A comprehensive literature search identified seven comparative articles that matched the criteria: two randomized trials and six retrospective cohort studies comprising 1,255 patients (609 using US-SWL). The results revealed a significant difference in overall stone-free rates between US-guided and FS-guided SWL RR 0.76(95% CI; 0.61-0.95, p=0.02) and in adults RR 0.76(95% CI; 0.60-0.96), but not children groups RR 0.68(95% CI; 0.24-1.88). US-SWL might be favourable due to the radiation-free procedure and real-time presentation. Complication rates were low, and no life-threatening complications were reported. In conclusion, US-guided SWL is more effective than FS-guided SWL for treating renal stones, with a low incidence of complications. Further randomized controlled trials with larger populations are needed to explore the comparison more accurately.

                Background of the study The influence of macroeconomic indicators makes it important to study the relationship between macroeconomic indicators and stock market return. On further analysis it can be observed that different sectors respond differently to change in the macroeconomic indicator that is important for investors, researchers and policy makers. Methods The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is applied to study influence of macroeconomic indicators on sectoral return of NSE from April 2012 to August 2024. Results Findings of the study show that macroeconomic indicators influence sectoral return in the short run as well as long run and the influence is differential. The analysis of long run relationship shows that Foreign Institutional Investment (FII) significantly affects all the sectoral indices except IT. Index of industrial production (IIP) have significant relationship with Auto, IT, Media, Metal and Pharma. Money supply (MS) significantly affects Bank, FMCG and IT in the long run. Wholesale Price Index (WPI) has significant relationship with Auto, FMCG and Media in the long run. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPU) affects Auto, FMCG and Pharma in the long run. Crude oil price (COP) has significant effect only on Media in the long run. Exchange rate (ER) does not have significant effect on any of the sectoral index. Conclusion In the long run FII, IIP, EPU, MS and WIP are major determinants of stock market return. In the short run FII, ER and COP are major determinants of stock market return.

                <p>by Subhadip Biswas, Davit A Potoyan</p>

Many eukaryotic proteins and RNAs contain low-complexity domains (LCDs) with a strong propensity for binding and driving phase separation into biomolecular condensates. Mutations in LCDs frequently disrupt condensate dynamics, resulting in pathological transitions to solid-like states. Understanding how the molecular sequence grammar of LCDs governs condensate dynamics is essential for uncovering their biological functions and the evolutionary forces that shape these sequences. To this end, we present an energy landscape framework that operates on a continuous ‘stickiness’ energy scale rather than relying on an explicit alphabet-based sequence. Sequences are characterized by Wasserstein distance relative to thoroughly shuffled or random counterparts. Armed with an energy landscape framework, map diagrams of material and dynamical properties governed by key energy landscape features modulated by the degree of complexity in LCD arrangements, including the periodicity and local disorder in LCDs. Highly periodic LCD patterns promote elasticity-dominated behavior, while random sequences exhibit viscosity-dominated properties. Our results reveal that minimum sticker periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condensates, thereby avoiding transitions to glassy or solid-like states. Moreover, we demonstrate that the energy landscape framework explains the recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts systematic alterations in condensate viscoelasticity. Our work provides a unifying perspective on the sequence-encoded material properties whereby key features of energy landscapes are conserved while sequences are variable.

                <p>by Shan Zhong, Nader Pouratian, Vassilios Christopoulos</p>

Survival of species in an ever-changing environment requires a flexibility that extends beyond merely selecting the most appropriate actions. It also involves readiness to stop or switch actions in response to environmental changes. Although considerable research has been devoted to understanding how the brain switches actions, the computations underlying the switching process and how it relates to the selecting and stopping processes remain elusive. A normative theory suggests that switching is simply an extension of the stopping process, during which a current action is first inhibited by an independent pause mechanism before a new action is generated. This theory was challenged by the affordance competition hypothesis, according to which the switching process is implemented through a competition between the current and new actions, without engaging an independent pause mechanism. To delineate the computations underlying these action regulation functions, we utilized a neurocomputational theory that models the process of selecting, stopping and switching reaching movements. We tested the model predictions in healthy individuals who performed reaches in dynamic and uncertain environments that often required stopping and switching actions. Our findings suggest that unlike the stopping process, switching does not necessitate a proactive pause mechanism to delay movement initiation. Hence, the switching and stopping processes seem to be implemented by different mechanisms at the planning phase of the reaching movement. However, once the reaching movement has been initiated, the switching process seems to involve an independent pause mechanism if the new target location is unknown prior to movement initiation. These findings offer a new understanding of the computations underlying action switching, contribute valuable insights into the fundamental neuroscientific mechanisms of action regulation, and open new avenues for future neurophysiological investigations.

                <p>by Yanru Jiang, Rick Dale</p>

There is an important challenge in systematically interpreting the internal representations of deep neural networks (DNNs). Existing techniques are often less effective for non-tabular tasks, or they primarily focus on qualitative, ad-hoc interpretations of models. In response, this study introduces a cognitive science-inspired, multi-dimensional quantification and visualization approach that captures two temporal dimensions of model learning: the “information-processing trajectory” and the “developmental trajectory.” The former represents the influence of incoming signals on an agent’s decision-making, while the latter conceptualizes the gradual improvement in an agent’s performance throughout its lifespan. Tracking the learning curves of DNNs enables researchers to explicitly identify the model appropriateness of a given task, examine the properties of the underlying input signals, and assess the model’s alignment (or lack thereof) with human learning experiences. To illustrate this method, we conducted 750 runs of simulations on two temporal tasks: gesture detection and sentence classification, showcasing its applicability across different types of deep learning tasks. Using four descriptive metrics to quantify the mapped learning curves—<i>start</i>, <i>end - start</i>, <i>max</i>, <i>tmax</i>—, we identified significant differences in learning patterns based on data sources and class distinctions (all <i>p’s</i>  <  .0001), the prominent role of spatial semantics in gesture learning, and larger information gains in language learning. We highlight three key insights gained from mapping learning curves: <i>non-monotonic progress</i>, <i>pairwise comparisons</i>, and <i>domain distinctions</i>. We reflect on the theoretical implications of this method for cognitive processing, language models and representations from multiple modalities.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003002">vmTracking enables highly accurate multi-animal pose tracking in crowded environments</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hirotsugu Azechi, Susumu Takahashi</p>

In multi-animal tracking, addressing occlusion and crowding is crucial for accurate behavioral analysis. However, in situations where occlusion and crowding generate complex interactions, achieving accurate pose tracking remains challenging. Therefore, we introduced virtual marker tracking (vmTracking), which uses virtual markers for individual identification. Virtual markers are labels derived from conventional markerless multi-animal tracking tools, such as multi-animal DeepLabCut (maDLC) and Social LEAP Estimate Animal Poses (SLEAP). Unlike physical markers, virtual markers exist only within the video and attribute features to individuals, enabling consistent identification throughout the entire video while keeping the animals markerless in reality. Using these markers as cues, annotations were applied to multi-animal videos, and tracking was conducted with single-animal DeepLabCut (saDLC) and SLEAP’s single-animal method. vmTracking minimized manual corrections and annotation frames needed for training, efficiently tackling occlusion and crowding. Experiments tracking multiple mice, fish, and human dancers confirmed vmTracking’s variability and applicability. These findings could enhance the precision and reliability of tracking methods used in the analysis of complex naturalistic and social behaviors in animals, providing a simpler yet more effective solution.

                Background After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic which spread to 213 countries in 2020, Indonesia ranked 20th for morbidity with a mortality rate of 2.3%, higher than the global rate of 1.1%. In response, Indonesia issued a policy mandating mask use. This study aims to investigate the association between risk perception, sociodemographic factors, and knowledge of COVID-19, with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Methods It was an online study conducted from November 2020 to February 2021, during the first wave of COVID-19. Participants were provided written informed consent prior if agree/reject to completing participate the questionnaire study voluntarily. A total of 1153 respondents were selected. The dependent variable was consistent mask-wearing outside the home, while the independent variables were risk perception regarding COVID-19, sociodemographic factors (location, age, gender, education, occupation, family income, family members, social health scheme), and knowledge of COVID-19. Data were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Results The risk perception of COVID-19 as a viral disease that can cause death aOR: 2.502 was positively associated with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Regarding sociodemographic factor, individuals age between 25 to 44 years aOR: 0.486. While, knowledge of the need to change cloth masks every 4-6 hours aOR: 1.686; the transmission aOR: 1.974, the severe symptoms of COVID-19 aOR: 1.981; and of the confirmed diagnosis by PCR aOR: 2.238 were positively associated with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Conclusions The risk perception of potential fatality COVID-19 and knowledge of proper time to change cloth mask, the transmission, the severe symptom, and the confirmation of COVID-19 testing were positively associated with mask-wearing outside the home. While, age between 25 to 44 years was negatively associated. These findings underscore the importance of targeted public health interventions that address risk perception and enhance knowledge to promote mask use as effective COVID-19 prevention measures.

                Aim The aim of this study was to differentiate clinically suspected cases of leiomyoma and adenomyosis using 2d grey scale ultrasound with doppler.P Methods and materials 60 patients with a history of abnormal uterine bleeding (aub) and clinically suspected cases of uterine leiomyoma and adenomyosis were subjected to ultrasound. These patients underwent either myomectomy or total abdominal hysterectomy and the specimens were sent for histopathology. The data collected was analysed using statistical tools and sensitivity and specificity analysis was conducted to estimate the accuracy of ultrasound in differentiating leiomyoma and adenomyosis. Results Out of total of 60 patients 41 were diagnosed clinically as Leiomyoma, of which USG detected 36 cases to be Leiomyoma, leaving 5 cases unconfirmed. 19 patients were diagnosed clinically as Adenomyosis and USG detected 15 cases as Adenomyosis, leaving 4 cases unconfirmed. Out of 41 cases detected clinically as leiomyoma 37 were confirmed by histopathology. Out of 19 cases clinically diagnosed as adenomyosis 15 cases were confirmed by histopathology as adenomyosis. Conclusion The study revealed that USG findings for both Leiomyoma and Adenomyosis had a very strong correlation with histopathology with a P value of less than 0.001 which is statistically significant. These findings could be useful in clinical practice for differentiating between these two conditions, thereby facilitating better management and treatment of the patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1348/v2?src=rss">Ethiopia's Potato Seed System: Regulatory Challenges, Quality Assurance Issues, and Pathways for Improvement ─ A mini review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Ethiopia’s potato seed system is currently hindered by a disjointed regulatory framework, insufficient quality assurance processes, and a lack of collaboration among stakeholders, which collectively impede agricultural productivity and food security. The regulatory environment is characterized by inconsistent seed certification practices and a dependence on informal seed sources, negatively affecting the quality of potato seeds available to farmers. Although potatoes play a crucial role in global food security by providing high yields compared to other staple crops, the sector grapples with significant challenges due to bureaucratic inefficiencies, limited technical expertise, and the widespread presence of counterfeit seeds throughout the value chain. Methods To tackle these challenges, this mini-review outlines potential improvements, stressing the necessity for a unified regulatory framework tailored to the unique issues of vegetatively propagated crops. For this reason, we have used different literature source from web of science, Pubmed, Google Scholar, ResearchGate and other scientific websites. We have documented the most relevant information focusing on potato seed system, regulatory frameworks, quality assurance bottlenecks and pathways for improvement across the seed value chain. Results our paper highlights key recommendations that includes enhancing training for regulatory staff, investing in research for disease-resistant varieties, and bolstering public-private partnerships to encourage innovation and resource sharing. Furthermore, improving traceability in the seed supply chain is essential for maintaining seed quality and integrity. Conclusions This review calls for a comprehensive strategy that fosters stakeholder engagement and promotes sustainable practices to rejuvenate Ethiopia’s potato seed system, thereby supporting the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers and strengthening national food security through integrated seed sector development and capacity improvement of the seed regulatory body as well as smallholder farmers.

                Objective Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a chemical compound that can control the amount of bleeding and is often used in spinal surgery. TXA can be used alone or in combination. The study compared the effects of the two administrations, single-use or combined-use, providing a basis for the optimal route of TXA application. Methods Intravenous injection of TXA or topical TXA was used in the experimental group, and combined TXA was used in the control group. A systematic literature search without language restrictions was conducted until November 10, 2023. Statistical analyses were performed using Revman 5.4. Results Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one retrospective cohort study (RCS) were included, involving 682 patients. There were no significant differences in postoperative blood loss (PBL), preoperative haemoglobin (Hb), postoperative Hb, postoperative D-dimer level, operative time, nor complications between the two groups. However, there were statistically significant differences in intraoperative blood loss (IBL), total blood loss (TBL), and preoperative D-dimer levels between the two groups. (IBL: MD=48.63, 95%CI (confidence interval) =[12.61, 84.65], P=0.008, I 2=88%; TBL: MD=140.95, 95%CI= [25.97, 255.93], P=0.02, I 2=75%； Preoperative D-dimmer: MD=-0.15, 95%CI=[-0.19, -0.11], P<0.00001, I 2=0%). Conclusion During spinal surgery, single use of TXA was no better than combined use of TXA in terms of IBL, TBL, and preoperative D-dimer levels. However, the meta-analysis suggests that more high-quality studies need to be included to further compare the results between the two groups to make recommendations for the optimal use of TXA.

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6442b517-f2b5-45d5-8434-cde76abe83e4/ana27200-toc-0001-m.png"
     alt="Vitamin B12 Levels Association with Functional and Structural Biomarkers of Central Nervous System Injury in Older Adults"/>
<p>At low levels of B12, specifically when bound to transcobalamin for cellular uptake, evidence of slower conductivity in the brain could point toward impaired myelin. At high levels of B12, specifically when bound to the biologically inert transport protein haptocorrin, biomarkers of neurodegeneration appear in the serum, indicating neuroaxonal injury. The biological basis for this phenomenon has yet to be explored. Holo-HC = holo-haptocorrin; Holo-TC = holo-transcobalamin; VEP = visual evoked potentials.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Vitamin B12 (B12) plays a critical role in fatty- and amino-acid metabolism and nucleotide synthesis. While the association between B12 deficiency and neurological dysfunction is well-known, the exact threshold for adequacy remains undefined in terms of functional impairment and evidence of injury. The objective was to assess whether B12 levels within the current normal range in a cohort of healthy older adults may be associated with measurable evidence of neurological injury or dysfunction.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled 231 healthy elderly volunteers (median age 71.2 years old) with a median B12 blood concentration of 414.8 pmol/L (as measured by automated chemiluminescence assay). We performed multifocal visual evoked potential testing, processing speed testing, and magnetic resonance imaging to assess neurological status. Moreover, we measured serum biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury, astrocyte involvement, and amyloid pathology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Low (log-transformed) B12, especially decreased holo-transcobalamin, was associated with visual evoked potential latency delay (estimate = −0.04; <i>p</i> = 0.023), processing speed impairment (in an age-dependent manner; standardized β = −2.39; <i>p</i> = 0.006), and larger volumes of white matter hyperintensities on MRI (β = −0.21; <i>p</i> = 0.039). Remarkably, high levels of holo-haptocorrin (biologically inactive fraction of B12) correlated with serum levels of Tau, a biomarker of neurodegeneration (β = 0.22, <i>p</i> = 0.015).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Healthy older subjects exhibit neurological changes at both ends of the measurable “normal” B12 spectrum. These findings challenge our current understanding of optimal serum B12 levels and suggest revisiting how we establish appropriate nutritional recommendations. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Despite the popularity of Christian schools in Japan, Christians account for only 1.6% of the nation’s population. In the attempt to explore this inconsistency, we conducted an online survey in January 2020 to those between the ages of 15 and 29 living in Tokyo and Kanagawa. Our subjects include those who have enrolled in Christian schools, those who have some sort of affiliation, and those who do not have affiliation. We attempted to measure the difference in attitude by the degree of their affiliation. We focused on the notion of 'triple faith' which was proposed by Inoue and others. Many people in Japan believe in both Buddhism and Shintoism because neither requires a rite such as baptism. Christianity requires baptism, but that aside, in practice, many Japanese have triple faith including Christianity. Prosperity of Christian schools, preferences towards Christmas, and popularity of Christian-style weddings, all testify to this. This argument by Inoue and others conflicts with the common belief that Christianity never got a foothold in Japan. The results of cross tabulation of key questions and affiliation with Christian schools, combined with our interview results, show that those who have enrolled in Christian schools are more likely to have what may be referred to as triple faith. We have also provided a discussion on the possible reasons behind this finding.

     alt="Klf10 Regulates the Emergence of Glial Phenotypes During Hypothalamic Development"/>
<p>KLF10, a CREB target, is integral to hypothalamic gliogenesis, ensuring proper glial phenotype emergence and maintenance in adulthood via regulating potential target genes. The <i>Klf10</i>-deficient mouse provides a model to study the impact of reduced astrocytes and microglia on hypothalamic homeostasis.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Glial cells play a pivotal role in the Central Nervous System (CNS), constituting most brain cells. Gliogenesis, crucial in CNS development, occurs after neurogenesis. In the hypothalamus, glial progenitors first generate oligodendrocytes and later astrocytes. However, the precise molecular mechanisms governing the emergence of glial lineages in the developing hypothalamus remain incompletely understood. This study reveals the pivotal role of the transcription factor KLF10 in regulating the emergence of both astrocyte and oligodendrocyte lineages during embryonic hypothalamic development. Through transcriptomic and bioinformatic analyses, we identified novel KLF10 putative target genes, which play important roles in the differentiation of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Notably, in the absence of KLF10, there is an increase in the oligodendrocyte population, while the astrocyte population decreases in the embryonic hypothalamus. Strikingly, this decline in the number of astrocytes persists into adulthood, indicating that the absence of KLF10 leads to an extended period of oligodendrocyte emergence while delaying the appearance of astrocytes. Our findings also unveil a novel signaling pathway for <i>Klf10</i> gene expression regulation. We demonstrate that <i>Klf10</i> is a target of CREB and that its expression is upregulated via the BDNF-p38-CREB pathway. Thus, we postulate that KLF10 is an integral part of the hypothalamic developmental program that ensures the correct timing for glial phenotypes' generation. Importantly, we propose that the <i>Klf10</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mouse model represents a valuable tool for investigating the impact of reduced astrocyte and microglia populations in the homeostasis of the adult hypothalamus.</p>

<p>We investigated the basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic and non-cholinergic projections to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using two retrograde tracers, Fast Blue and Fluoro-Gold, and ChAT immunostaining in rats. Our results show that the RSC and ACC receive both spatially overlapping and differential projections from the BF, with the cholinergic and non-cholinergic projections varying between BF subregions and different rostrocaudal cortical regions.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The basal forebrain (BF) plays a crucial role in modulating cortical activation through its widespread projections across the cortical mantle. Previous anatomical studies have demonstrated that each cortical region receives a specific projection from the BF. In this study, we examined BF cholinergic and non-cholinergic projections to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using two retrograde tracers, Fast Blue (FB) and Fluoro-Gold (FG), in combination with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunostaining in rats. The RSC and ACC receive cholinergic and non-cholinergic projections mainly from the medial part of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band (HDB) and the vertical limb of the diagonal band (VDB). The main difference of BF projections to the RSC, ACC, and prelimbic cortex (PL) is that the ACC and PL receive projections from the rostral half of the medial globus pallidus (GP), whereas the RSC receives stronger non-cholinergic projections from the VDB and medial septum (MS). As the injection site shifts from rostral (PL) to caudal (RSC) through the ACC, the strong GP and weak MS/VDB projections of non-cholinergic neurons are reversed. Cholinergic projection neurons make up a similar proportion of the total projection neurons in both ACC (37%) and RSC (33%) injections. Double retrograde tracer injections in the RSC and ACC revealed a small number of double-labeled projection neurons in the MS/VDB and HDB. These findings indicate that the ACC and RSC receive both spatially overlapping and differential projections from the BF, with the cholinergic and non-cholinergic projections varying between BF subregions and different rostrocaudal cortical regions.</p>

                Tau phosphorylation plays an essential role in regulating tau’s microtubule-stabilizing function, but its hyperphosphorylation drives tauopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In a recent study, Kim and colleagues decipher that tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) phosphorylates tau at tyrosine 29, promoting its stabilization and aggregation by interfering with autophagic clearance, providing novel insights into tau pathology and potential therapeutic strategies.

                Nguyen et al. demonstrate that loss of acetyl-CoA synthesis enzymes in mouse skin depletes key epidermal barrier lipids, disrupts the skin barrier, and causes rapid fat loss. Sebum production is sustained using circulating lipids. These findings reveal the vital role of skin acetyl-CoA synthesis in local and systemic lipid metabolism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92180">Maturation and detoxification of synphilin-1 inclusion bodies regulated by sphingolipids</a></h4>

              
                Due to proteostasis stress induced by aging or disease, misfolded proteins can form toxic intermediate species of aggregates and eventually mature into less toxic inclusion bodies (IBs). Here, using a yeast imaging-based screen, we identified 84 potential synphilin-1 (SY1) IB regulators and isolated the conserved sphingolipid metabolic components in the most enriched groups. Furthermore, we show that, in both yeast cells and mammalian cells, SY1 IBs are associated with mitochondria. Pharmacological inhibition of the sphingolipid metabolism pathway or knockout of its key genes results in a delayed IB maturation and increased SY1 cytotoxicity. We postulate that SY1 IB matures by association with the mitochondrion membrane, and that sphingolipids stimulate the maturation via their membrane-modulating function and thereby protecting cells from SY1 cytotoxicity. Our findings identify a conserved cellular component essential for IB maturation and suggest a mechanism by which cells may detoxify the pathogenic protein aggregates through forming mitochondrion-associated IBs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102538">Flexibility in PAM recognition expands DNA targeting in xCas9</a></h4>

              
                xCas9 is an evolved variant of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system, engineered to improve specificity and reduce undesired off-target effects. How xCas9 expands the DNA targeting capability of Cas9 by recognising a series of alternative protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences while ignoring others is unknown. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying xCas9’s expanded PAM recognition and provide critical insights for expanding DNA targeting. We demonstrate that while wild-type Cas9 enforces stringent guanine selection through the rigidity of its interacting arginine dyad, xCas9 introduces flexibility in R1335, enabling selective recognition of specific PAM sequences. This increased flexibility confers a pronounced entropic preference, which also improves recognition of the canonical TGG PAM. Furthermore, xCas9 enhances DNA binding to alternative PAM sequences during the early evolution cycles, while favouring binding to the canonical PAM in the final evolution cycle. This dual functionality highlights how xCas9 broadens PAM recognition and underscores the importance of fine-tuning the flexibility of the PAM-interacting cleft as a key strategy for expanding the DNA targeting potential of CRISPR-Cas systems. These findings deepen our understanding of DNA recognition in xCas9 and may apply to other CRISPR-Cas systems with similar PAM recognition requirements.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100197">Mediator kinase inhibition suppresses hyperactive interferon signaling in Down syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Hyperactive interferon (IFN) signaling is a hallmark of Down syndrome (DS), a condition caused by Trisomy 21 (T21); strategies that normalize IFN signaling could benefit this population. Mediator-associated kinases CDK8 and CDK19 drive inflammatory responses through incompletely understood mechanisms. Using sibling-matched cell lines with/without T21, we investigated Mediator kinase function in the context of hyperactive IFN in DS over a 75 min to 24 hr timeframe. Activation of IFN-response genes was suppressed in cells treated with the CDK8/CDK19 inhibitor cortistatin A (CA), via rapid suppression of IFN-responsive transcription factor (TF) activity. We also discovered that CDK8/CDK19 affect splicing, a novel means by which Mediator kinases control gene expression. To further probe Mediator kinase function, we completed cytokine screens and metabolomics experiments. Cytokines are master regulators of inflammatory responses; by screening 105 different cytokine proteins, we show that Mediator kinases help drive IFN-dependent cytokine responses at least in part through transcriptional regulation of cytokine genes and receptors. Metabolomics revealed that Mediator kinase inhibition altered core metabolic pathways in cell type-specific ways, and broad upregulation of anti-inflammatory lipid mediators occurred specifically in kinase-inhibited cells during hyperactive IFNγ signaling. A subset of these lipids (e.g. oleamide, desmosterol) serve as ligands for nuclear receptors PPAR and LXR, and activation of these receptors occurred specifically during hyperactive IFN signaling in CA-treated cells, revealing mechanistic links between Mediator kinases, lipid metabolism, and nuclear receptor function. Collectively, our results establish CDK8/CDK19 as context-specific metabolic regulators, and reveal that these kinases control gene expression not only via TFs, but also through metabolic changes and splicing. Moreover, we establish that Mediator kinase inhibition antagonizes IFN signaling through transcriptional, metabolic, and cytokine responses, with implications for DS and other chronic inflammatory conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95398">Multimodal mismatch responses in mouse auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Our movements result in predictable sensory feedback that is often multimodal. Based on deviations between predictions and actual sensory input, primary sensory areas of cortex have been shown to compute sensorimotor prediction errors. How prediction errors in one sensory modality influence the computation of prediction errors in another modality is still unclear. To investigate multimodal prediction errors in mouse auditory cortex, we used a virtual environment to experimentally couple running to both self-generated auditory and visual feedback. Using two-photon microscopy, we first characterized responses of layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons to sounds, visual stimuli, and running onsets and found responses to all three stimuli. Probing responses evoked by audiomotor (AM) mismatches, we found that they closely resemble visuomotor (VM) mismatch responses in visual cortex (V1). Finally, testing for cross modal influence on AM mismatch responses by coupling both sound amplitude and visual flow speed to the speed of running, we found that AM mismatch responses were amplified when paired with concurrent VM mismatches. Our results demonstrate that multimodal and non-hierarchical interactions shape prediction error responses in cortical L2/3.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98521">Decoding the physics of observed actions in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Recognizing goal-directed actions is a computationally challenging task, requiring not only the visual analysis of body movements, but also analysis of how these movements causally impact, and thereby induce a change in, those objects targeted by an action. We tested the hypothesis that the analysis of body movements and the effects they induce relies on distinct neural representations in superior and anterior inferior parietal lobe (SPL and aIPL). In four fMRI sessions, participants observed videos of actions (e.g. breaking stick, squashing plastic bottle) along with corresponding point-light-display (PLD) stick figures, pantomimes, and abstract animations of agent–object interactions (e.g. dividing or compressing a circle). Cross-decoding between actions and animations revealed that aIPL encodes abstract representations of action effect structures independent of motion and object identity. By contrast, cross-decoding between actions and PLDs revealed that SPL is disproportionally tuned to body movements independent of visible interactions with objects. Lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) was sensitive to both action effects and body movements. These results demonstrate that parietal cortex and LOTC are tuned to physical action features, such as how body parts move in space relative to each other and how body parts interact with objects to induce a change (e.g. in position or shape/configuration). The high level of abstraction revealed by cross-decoding suggests a general neural code supporting mechanical reasoning about how entities interact with, and have effects on, each other.

">Altered Functional Network Energy Across Multiscale Brain Networks in Preterm vs. Full-Term Subjects: Insights from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study</a></h4>

              
                Infants born premature, or preterm, can experience altered brain connectivity, due in part to incomplete brain development at the time of parturition. Research has also shown structural and functional differences in the brain that persist in these individuals as they enter adolescence when compared to peers who were fully mature at birth. In this study, we examined functional network energy across multiscale functional connectivity in approximately 4600 adolescents from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study who were either preterm or full term at birth. We identified three key brain networks that show significant differences in network energy between preterm and full-term subjects. These networks include the visual network (comprising the occipitotemporal and occipital subnetworks), the sensorimotor network, and the high cognitive network (including the temporoparietal and frontal subnetworks). Additionally, it was demonstrated that full-term subjects exhibit greater instability, leading to more dynamic reconfiguration of functional brain information and increased flexibility across the three identified canonical brain networks compared to preterm subjects. In contrast, those born prematurely show more stable networks but less dynamic and flexible organization of functional brain information within these key canonical networks. In summary, measuring multiscale functional network energy offered insights into the stability of canonical brain networks associated with subjects born prematurely. These findings enhance our understanding of how early birth impacts brain development.

">Sex Specific Attenuation of Reward Preference</a></h4>

              
                Estradiol receptor signaling has a sex-specific impact on the brain's reward pathways, enhancing cocaine reinforcement in females but not in males. Selective activation of G-Protein Coupled Estradiol Receptor 1 (GPER-1) in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) attenuates the reinforcing effects of 0.1% saccharin (SACC) and cocaine in males but not females. This study investigated GPER-1 activation in the DLS and systemically using the GPER-1 agonist, G1, to assess its effect on SACC and cocaine preference in male and female rats. Five experiments were conducted using gonad-intact and gonadectomized animals to determine dose-response effects and the influence of circulating hormones. Intra-DLS GPER-1 activation with 20% G1 selectively reduced SACC preference in intact males but not females, while higher and lower concentrations had no effect. Systemic G1 administration attenuated cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in both sexes in a dose-dependent way. Interestingly, systemic administration of G1 did not alter SACC preference in either sex, regardless of the presence or absence of gonadal hormones. These findings suggest that GPER-1 activation influences reward processing in a site, reward, and sex-dependent manner.

">How Autism Impacts Children's Working Memory for Faces</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates how visual working memory (WM) functions in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) compared to typically developing (TD) children aged 7 to 12, focusing on their ability to remember faces. The primary goal was to understand the differences in visual WM performance between these two groups and identify the sources of memory recall errors. Findings indicate that children with ASD demonstrated significantly poorer visual WM compared to their TD counterparts, particularly in the precision of memory recall. Despite this difference, both groups exhibited similar rates of random guessing, suggesting that the challenges faced by children with ASD are more about accuracy than guessing strategy. This research sheds light on the specific deficits in visual WM associated with ASD, enhancing our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms at play and highlighting potential areas for targeted interventions to support these children.

">Rigid Control of Motor Unit Firing Rates in the Human Tibialis Anterior Muscle Persists during Neurofeedback</a></h4>

              
                The conventional framework of motor-unit (MU) control assumes that MUs in a MU pool are constrained by a fixed recruitment order and a common input. This rigid-control framework has been challenged by recent findings suggesting that MU activity could be flexibly modulated, potentially mediated by descending cortical inputs. In this study, rather than evaluating flexibility from the perspective of recruitment thresholds, we investigated control flexibility by assessing if human participants can voluntarily modulate MU firing rates beyond rigid-control constraints. Specifically, we examined whether participants could voluntarily modulate the firing rates of a pair of MUs from the tibialis anterior muscle during real-time feedback. Two tasks involving target-reach with different visual feedback derived from the MUs firing rates were conducted. In both tasks, there was no evidence that participants were able to change MU firing rates in a way that would violate rigid control robustly. Our findings demonstrate limited flexibility in MU control in human tibialis anterior muscle within single-session training, even when real-time MU activity feedback was provided. The results suggest that MU flexibility is not inherently present in the human lower limb.

">Calcium channel-coupled transcription factors facilitate direct nuclear signaling</a></h4>

              
                VGCCs play crucial roles within the CNS, in maintaining cell excitability, enabling activity-dependent neuronal development, and forming long-term memory by regulating Ca2+ influx. The intracellular carboxyl-terminal domains of VGCC 1 subunits help regulate VGCC function. Emerging evidence suggests that some VGCC C-termini have functions independent of channel gating and exist as stable proteins. Here, we demonstrate that all VGCC gene family members express bicistronic mRNA transcripts that produce functionally distinct C-terminal proteins (CTPs) in tandem with full-length VGCC 1 subunits. Two of these CTPs, 1CCT and 1ACT, cycle to and from the nucleus in a Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent fashion. 1CCT, 1ACT, and 1HCT regulate chromatin accessibility and/or bind directly to genes, regulating gene networks involved in neuronal differentiation and synaptic function in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This study elucidates a conserved process of coordinated protein expression within the VGCC family, coupling the channel function with VGCC C-terminal transcription factors.

">3-D Reconstruction of Fingertip Deformation during Contact Initiation</a></h4>

              
                Dexterous manipulations rely on tactile feedback from the fingertips, which provides crucial information about contact events, object geometry, interaction forces, friction, and more. Accurately measuring skin deformations during tactile interactions can shed light on the mechanics behind such feedback. To address this, we developed a novel setup using 3-D digital image correlation (DIC) to both reconstruct the bulk deformation and local surface skin deformation of the fingertip under natural loading conditions. Here, we studied the local spatiotemporal evolution of the skin surface during contact initiation. We showed that, as soon as contact occurs, the skin surface deforms very rapidly and exhibits high compliance at low forces (<0.05 N). As loading and thus the contact area increases, a localized deformation front forms just ahead of the moving contact boundary. Consequently, substantial deformation extending beyond the contact interface was observed, with maximal amplitudes ranging from 5% to 10% at 5 N, close to the border of the contact. Furthermore, we found that friction influences the partial slip caused by these deformations during contact initiation, as previously suggested. Our setup provides a powerful tool to get new insights into the mechanics of touch and opens avenues for a deeper understanding of tactile afferent encoding.

">SEX-DEPENDENT MODULATION OF BEHAVIORAL ALLOCATION VIA VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA-NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS SHELL CIRCUITRY</a></h4>

              
                Diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder, cocaine type (i.e., cocaine use disorder), outlined in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, imply that the disorder arises, at least in part, from the maladaptive allocation of behavior to drug use. To date, however, the neural circuits involved in the allocation of behavior have not been systematically evaluated. Herein, a chemogenetics approach (i.e., designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs)) was utilized in combination with a concurrent choice self-administration experimental paradigm to evaluate the role of the mesolimbic neurocircuit in the allocation of behavior. Pharmacological activation of hM3D(Gq) DREADDs in neurons projecting from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (AcbSh) induced a sex-dependent shift in the allocation of behavior in rodents transduced with DREADDs. Specifically, male DREADDs animals exhibited a robust increase in responding for a natural (i.e., sucrose) reward following pharmacological activation of the VTA-AcbSh circuit; female DREADDs rodents, in sharp contrast, displayed a prominent decrease in drug-reinforced (i.e., cocaine) responding. The sequential activation of hM3D(Gq) and KORD DREADDs within the same neuronal population validated the role of the VTA-AcbSh circuit in reinforced responding for concurrently available natural and drug rewards. Collectively, the VTA-AcbSh circuit is fundamentally involved in behavioral allocation affording a key target for the development of novel pharmacotherapies.

">Self-supervised image restoration in coherent X-rayneuronal microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Coherent X-ray microscopy is emerging as a transformative technology for neuronal imaging, with the potential to offer a scalable solution for reconstruction of neural circuits in millimeter sized tissue volumes. Specifically, X-ray holographic nanotomography (XNH) brings together outstanding capabilities in terms of contrast, spatial resolution and data acquisition speed. While recent XNH developments already enabled generating valuable datasets for neurosciences, a major challenge for reconstruction of neural circuits remained overcoming resolving power limits to distinguish smaller neurites and synapses in the reconstructed volumes. Here we present a self-supervised image restoration approach that improves simultaneously spatial resolution, contrast, and data acquisition speed. This enables revealing synapses with XNH, marking a major milestone in the quest for generating connectomes of full mammalian brains. We demonstrate that this method is effective for various types of neuronal tissues and acquisition schemes. We propose a scalable implementation compatible with multi-terabyte image volumes. Altogether, this work brings large scale X-ray nanotomography to a new precision level.

">Feedback and feedforward control are differentially delayed in cerebellar ataxia</a></h4>

              
                Damage to the cerebellum can cause ataxia, a condition associated with impaired movement coordination. Typically, coordinated movement relies on a combination of anticipatory mechanisms (specifically, feedforward control) and corrective mechanisms (embodied by feedback control). Here, we show that in 3D reaching in VR, ataxia preserves the visuomotor feedforward and feedback control structure compared to the control group. However, the ataxia group exhibits a small increase in feedback delay (~20 ms) and a substantial increase in feedforward delay (~70 ms) together with a reduced feedback gain (~25% lower). Our results suggest that the feedforward and feedback pathways remain largely intact in ataxia, but that time delay deficits and temoral discoordination amongst these control pathways may contribute to the disorder. We also find that providing a preview---analogous to driving on a clear night and seeing the road ahead vs.~driving in the fog---improves tracking performance in the ataxia group, although the control group was significantly better able to exploit this preview information. Overall, our results indicate that the feedforward control and preview utilization are relatively well-preserved in individuals with cerebellar ataxia, and that preview could potentially be leveraged to enhance the feedforward performance of those with ataxia.

">Real-world visual search goes beyond eye movements: Active searchers select 3D scene viewpoints too</a></h4>

              
                Visual search is a ubiquitous task; people search for objects on a daily basis. However, the majority of the existing visual search literature focuses on passive search on a 2D computer screen, a far cry from emulating a real-world environment. Search is a real-world task that involves active observation. Search targets may be occluded, completely out of the observer's line of sight, or oriented in unconventional ways. This is typically mitigated by actively selecting viewpoints, an important aspect of search behaviour with limited scope on a computer screen. Our goal was to explore viewpoint selection in active visual search. Subject eye and head movements were tracked as they moved freely while searching for toy objects in a controlled 3-dimensional environment, yielding the first such record of search-driven viewpoint selection. We found that subjects utilized their full range of eye and head motion to move from viewpoint to viewpoint, apparently employing a variety of objectives including changing viewing height and pose depending on object 3D pose. Subjects were also adept at selecting unobstructed views to search through otherwise occluded areas with objects. Furthermore, subjects completed the search task with high accuracy, even with no training on the environment. Although no learning was found in terms of accuracy over the duration of the experiment, increases in efficiency were found for other metrics such as response time, number of fixations, and distance travelled, particularly in target present trials where the target was not visible from the starting location. These results paint the story of a visual system that selects and moves to useful and informative views to facilitate the successful execution of an active visual search task, and stresses the significance of active vision research in understanding how vision is used in naturalistic environments.

">Cell-generated mechanical forces play a role in epileptogenesis after injury</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with a significantly increased risk of epilepsy. One of the consequences of severe TBI is progressive brain atrophy, which is frequently characterized by organized tissue retraction. Retraction is an active process synchronized by mechanical interactions between surviving cells. This results in unbalanced mechanical forces acting on surviving neurons, potentially activating mechanotransduction and leading to hyperexcitability. This novel mechanism of epileptogenesis was examined in organotypic hippocampal cultures, which develop spontaneous seizure-like activity in vitro. Cell-generated forces in this model resulted in contraction of hippocampal tissue. Artificial imbalances in mechanical forces were introduced by placing cultured slices on surfaces with adhesive and non-adhesive regions. This modeled disbalance in mechanical forces that may occur in the brain after trauma. Portions of the slices that were not stabilized by substrate adhesion underwent increased contraction and compaction, revealing the presence of cell-generated forces capable of shaping tissue geometry. Changes in tissue geometry were followed by excitability changes that were specific to hippocampal sub-region and orientation of contractile forces relative to pyramidal cell apical-basal axis. Results of this study suggest that imbalanced cell-generated forces contribute to development of epilepsy, and that force imbalance may represent a novel mechanism of epileptogenesis after trauma.

">Brain bases for navigating acoustic features</a></h4>

              
                Whether physical navigation shares neural substrates with mental travel in other behaviourally relevant domains is debated. With respect to sound, pure tone working memory in humans elicits hippocampal as well as auditory cortical and inferior frontal activity, and rodent work suggests that hippocampal cells that usually track an animal's physical location can also map to tone frequency when task-relevant. We generated a sound dimension based on the density of random-frequency tones in a stack, resulting in a percept ranging from low- ("beepy") to high-density ("noisy"). We established that unlike tone frequency, which listeners automatically associate with vertical position, this density dimension elicited no consistent spatial mapping. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, human participants (both sexes) held in mind the density of a series of tone stacks and, after a short maintenance period, adjusted further stacks to match the target ("navigation"). Density was represented most strongly in bilateral non-primary auditory cortex, specifically bilateral planum polare. Encoding and maintenance activity in hippocampus, inferior frontal gyrus, planum polare and posterior cingulate was positively associated with subsequent navigation success. Bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and hippocampus were among regions with elevated activity during navigation, compared to a parity-judgment condition with closely matched acoustics and motor demands. Bilateral orbitofrontal cortex was more active when navigation was toward a target density than when participants adjusted density in a control condition with no particular target. We find that self-initiated travel along a non-spatial auditory dimension engages a brain system overlapping with that supporting physical navigation.

">Offset analgesia and onset hyperalgesia: A comparison between women with non-suicidal self-injury and healthy women</a></h4>

              
                Individuals who engage in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) exhibit reduced pain sensitivity compared to the general population. It has been argued that this hypoalgesic characteristic may be attributable to hyper-effective pain modulation; however, empirical support for this theory remains inconsistent. The aim of the study was to use a combined offset analgesia (OA) and onset hyperalgesia (OH) protocol to investigate if women with NSSI have a propensity to inhibit nociceptive signals to a higher degree (stronger OA response) and facilitate nociceptive signals to a lesser degree (weaker OH response), compared to a control group. Data was collected from 76 women, 18-35 age (37 with NSSI and 39 healthy controls). The OA and OH protocol was combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The NSSI group displayed a weaker OH response, compared to the control group. This suggests that women with NSSI do not facilitate nociceptive signals to the same extent as healthy women. However, there were no significant differences between the groups regarding OA. Across all participants, we observed stronger activation in the primary sensory cortex during the OH condition, compared to the control condition. The results offer partial support for the general hypothesis that women with NSSI demonstrate enhanced pain modulation.

">Transcriptomic and spatial GABAergic neuron subtypes in zona incerta mediate distinct innate behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the anatomical connection and behaviors of transcriptomic neuron subtypes is critical to delineating cell type-specific functions in the brain. Here we integrated single-nucleus transcriptomic sequencing, in vivo circuit mapping, optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches to dissect the molecular identity and function of heterogeneous GABAergic neuron populations in the zona incerta (ZI) in mice, a region involved in modulating various behaviors. By microdissecting ZI for transcriptomic and spatial gene expression analyses, our results revealed two non-overlapping Ecel1- and Pde11a-expressing GABAergic neurons with dominant expression in the rostral and medial zona incerta (ZIrEcel1 and ZImPde11a), respectively. The GABAergic projection from ZIrEcel1 to periaqueductal gray mediates self-grooming, while the GABAergic projection from ZImPde11a to the oral part of pontine reticular formation promotes transition from sleep to wakefulness. Together, our results revealed the molecular markers, spatial organization and specific neuronal circuits of two discrete GABAergic projection neuron populations in segregated subregions of the ZI that mediate distinct innate behaviors, advancing our understanding of the functional organization of the brain.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Altered brain connectivity and atypical neural oscillations have been observed in autism, yet their relationship with autistic traits in nonclinical populations remains underexplored. Here, we employ electroencephalography to examine functional connectivity, oscillatory power, and broadband aperiodic activity during a dynamic facial emotion processing task in 101 typically developing children aged 4 to 12 years. We investigate associations between these electrophysiological measures of brain dynamics and autistic traits as assessed by the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition (SRS-2). Our results revealed that increased facial emotion processing–related connectivity across theta (4 to 7 Hz) and beta (13 to 30 Hz) frequencies correlated positively with higher SRS-2 scores, predominantly in right-lateralized (theta) and bilateral (beta) cortical networks. Additionally, a steeper 1/<span style="font-style:italic;">f</span>-like aperiodic slope (spectral exponent) across fronto-central electrodes was associated with higher SRS-2 scores. Greater aperiodic-adjusted theta and alpha oscillatory power further correlated with both higher SRS-2 scores and steeper aperiodic slopes. These findings underscore important links between facial emotion processing-related brain dynamics and autistic traits in typically developing children. Future work could extend these findings to assess these electroencephalography-derived markers as potential mechanisms underlying behavioral difficulties in autism.</span>

We show that discarding an action plan reduces working memory load, with stronger initial theta band activity compared to withholding it. This oscillatory difference was localized in the (para-)hippocampus and anterior temporal lobe, likely reflecting the need to dissolve action plan features first to enable the following decrease of working memory load. Contrary, when exposed to the embedded stimulus, withholding was associated with higher theta, alpha, and beta band activity relative to discarding. This study advances our understanding of inhibition by revealing distinct neurophysiological mechanisms and functional neuroanatomical structures involved in withholding versus discarding an action.</span>

	<p>Background: Autism spectrum disorder has been argued to involve impairments in domain-general predictive abilities. There is strong evidence that individuals with ASD have trouble navigating the dynamic world due to an inability to predict the outcomes of particular events. There is also evidence that this is apparent across the diagnostic criteria of ASD and common among correlates of ASD. However, the question remains as to whether this impairment in predictive abilities is domain-specific or domain-general, with little research investigating prediction in linguistic measures. Methods: The current study investigated whether individuals with ASD showed atypicalities in linguistic prediction using a cloze probability task. In Experiment 1, 33 individuals with ASD were compared to 64 typically developing individuals in an offline cloze task. Results: There was no significant effect of an ASD diagnosis on the cloze probability. However, individuals with higher levels of autistic traits were significantly more likely to produce lower-probability (non-modal) cloze responses. In Experiment 2, 19 individuals with ASD were compared to 22 typically developing individuals in a lab-based cloze task, in which we also measured the reaction times to begin speaking (i.e., voice onset time). The results showed that individuals with ASD had significantly slower reaction times (~200 ms) but, similarly to Experiment 1, did not show differences in the cloze probability of the responses produced. Conclusions: We conclude that individuals with ASD do show inefficiency in linguistic prediction, as well as indicating which ASD traits most strongly correlate with these inefficiencies.</p>

	<p>Background: Sexual characteristics in brain neurophysiological activity are a significant area of research in cognitive neuroscience. As a sport that involves minimal physical movement, shooters remain largely stationary during aiming, facilitating the collection of their neural activity compared to athletes in other sports. Objectives: To investigate the neural characteristics of novice shooters of different genders under competitive conditions. Methods: Sixteen subjects participated in a shooting competition following four weeks of training. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data and behavioral data (shooting scores, aiming curves, and pressure curves) were recorded during the competition, and the power spectral density (PSD) and phase-locking value (PLV) network features were extracted to explore further the correlation between the shooting scores and neural activity. Results: In our sample, (1) there were no significant differences in shooting scores between males and females; (2) there were differences in PSD values across the theta, alpha, alpha-2, beta, and gamma frequency bands between males and females; and (3) there were differences in PLV network properties in the theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands between males and females. Correlation analysis revealed associations between shooting scores and neural activity in male and female novices. Conclusions: The case study demonstrated that males and females exhibited different neural activity characteristics in the shooting competition, providing a foundation for further investigation into the sex differences in neural activity in shooting competition.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: This study evaluates the potential of electroencephalography (EEG) as a noninvasive tool for distinguishing between healthy individuals (n = 79), those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 36), and dementia patients (n = 7). Methods: Using a 14-channel Emotiv EPOC-X headset, we analyzed power spectral density during a 2-min eyes-closed resting state. Results: Our results demonstrated that while EEG effectively differentiated dementia patients from healthy controls, it did not show significant differences between MCI and healthy controls. This indicates that EEG holds promise for identifying advanced cognitive decline but faces challenges in early-stage detection. Conclusions: The study contributes to the growing body of literature by highlighting EEG&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential as a cost-effective alternative to invasive diagnostic methods while also identifying the need for larger sample sizes and task-oriented approaches to improve its diagnostic precision.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The misuse of veterinary drugs is a growing concern, with increasing evidence of their presence in illicit drug markets and their use as alternatives to traditional substances. Methods: This study explores Reddit discussions on the misuse of veterinary drugs on Reddit, focusing on xylazine, carfentanil, medetomidine, pentobarbital, phenylbutazone, and acepromazine. Reddit was utilised for its abundant real-time data on users&amp;amp;rsquo; thoughts and experiences with substance misuse. Through a combination of manual and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven thematic analysis, we examined posts and comments to explore patterns of misuse. Results: The themes analysed included adverse effects, polysubstance misuse, routes of administration, motivations for misuse, and methods of obtaining these drugs. Our findings revealed that xylazine, medetomidine, carfentanil, and pentobarbital exhibit significant potential for misuse, while phenylbutazone and acepromazine are not widely misused. Despite this, phenylbutazone and acepromazine have been identified as adulterants in the illicit drug supply in the United States. The most discussed themes included motivations for misuse, followed by public experiences and perceptions, as well as adverse effects. Conclusions: The dual-method approach of combining manual interpretation with AI analysis allowed for a comprehensive understanding of social media discussions. This research highlights the importance of monitoring online platforms for early indicators of emerging drug trends, offering valuable insights to inform public health policies and intervention strategies. Impact Statement: This research highlights the growing public health risk posed by veterinary drug misuse, underscoring the need for enhanced monitoring, regulatory frameworks, and education to address their diversion into illicit markets. By leveraging social media as an early detection tool for emerging drug trends, our findings can inform targeted interventions.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Unilateral hand movements alter the excitability of the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (ipsi-M1) and contralateral spinal motoneurons. Although this excitability increases during complex, high muscle-activity movements, few studies have examined the excitability of ipsi-M1 and contralateral spinal motoneurons during complex movements while accounting for muscle activity. This study investigated the excitability of ipsi-M1 and contralateral spinal motoneurons during complex and simple movement tasks with comparable muscle activity between the two tasks. Methods: Nineteen healthy adult volunteers participated in this study. The ball rotation task was set as the complex movement task (BR condition), and the grasping task was set as the simple movement task (grasp condition), with peak muscle activity values comparable between the tasks. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and F-waves were recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle contralateral to the movement during task execution. The excitability parameters of ipsi-M1 and contralateral spinal motoneurons were calculated by dividing the MEP, F-wave persistence, and F/M amplitude values recorded in each condition by the corresponding values recorded at rest. These parameters were compared across the rest, BR, and grasp conditions. Results: All the excitability parameters of ipsi-M1 and contralateral spinal motoneurons increased during both the BR and grasp conditions compared with the rest condition but did not differ significantly between the BR and grasp conditions. Conclusions: The excitability of ipsi-M1 and contralateral spinal motoneurons was strongly influenced by the amount of muscle activity but not by the complexity of the movement.</p>

	<p>Background: Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a recognized precursor of stroke that also indicates a high risk of recurrence. The Hyperintense Acute Reperfusion Marker (HARM), which is linked to blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier disruption, may serve as a novel imaging biomarker for TIA. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 715 patients with TIA evaluated the predictive value of HARM for stroke recurrence and its association with TOAST subtype. Imaging findings, including those of diffusion-weighted imaging, were analyzed using logistic regression. Results: HARM-positive patients had significantly higher recurrence rates at 3 months (20.9%; odds ratio [OR] = 5.3) and 1 year (30.2%; OR = 5.8) compared to HARM-negative patients, relative to other imaging markers (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). HARM was significantly associated with the cardioembolic stroke (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: HARM is a promising imaging biomarker for predicting stroke recurrence and etiology in patients experiencing TIA. Incorporating HARM into clinical frameworks may enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracy.</p>

	<p>Cerebral lateralisation is a core organising principle of the brain that is characterised by a complex pattern of hemispheric specialisations and interhemispheric interactions. In various mental disorders, functional and/or structural hemispheric asymmetries are changed compared to healthy controls, and these alterations may contribute to the primary symptoms and cognitive impairments of a specific disorder. Since multiple genetic and epigenetic factors influence both the pathogenesis of mental illness and the development of brain asymmetries, it is likely that the neural developmental pathways overlap or are even causally intertwined, although the timing, magnitude, and direction of interactions may vary depending on the specific disorder. However, the underlying developmental steps and neuronal mechanisms are still unclear. In this review article, we briefly summarise what we know about structural, functional, and developmental relationships and outline hypothetical connections, which could be investigated in appropriate animal models. Altered cerebral asymmetries may causally contribute to the development of the structural and/or functional features of a disorder, as neural mechanisms that trigger neuropathogenesis are embedded in the asymmetrical organisation of the developing brain. Therefore, the occurrence and severity of impairments in neural processing and cognition probably cannot be understood independently of the development of the lateralised organisation of intra- and interhemispheric neuronal networks. Conversely, impaired cellular processes can also hinder favourable asymmetry development and lead to cognitive deficits in particular.</p>

     alt="Exploring Anatomical Links Between the Crow's Nidopallium Caudolaterale and Its Song System"/>
<p>The crow's nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) projects densely to the dorsal intermediate arcopallium (AID) and the striatum, paralleling important song system pathways. Connections from the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (MAN) to NCL and HVC run in parallel but remain distinct. These findings suggest the NCL is part of a general motor system with minimal direct interaction with the song system.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Crows are corvid songbirds that exhibit remarkable cognitive control, including their ability to vocalize on command. The activity of single neurons from the crow's associative telencephalic structure nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) is correlated with the execution of this vocal and many non-vocal behaviors. However, whether anatomical connections directly link the crow NCL to its “song system” remains unclear. To address this, we used fluorescent tracers along with histological staining methods to characterize the connectivity of the crow's NCL in relation to its song system. Consistent with previous findings in other songbirds, we found that the NCL sends dense projections into the dorsal intermediate arcopallium (AID) directly adjacent to the song system's telencephalic motor output, the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA). Similarly, we demonstrate dense NCL projections into the striatum engulfing the basal ganglia song nucleus “area X.” Both of these descending projections mirror the projections of the nidopallial song nucleus HVC (proper name) into RA and area X, with extremely sparse NCL fibers extending into area X. Furthermore, we characterized the distribution of cells projecting from the lateral part of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (MAN) to NCL. Notably, a separate medial population of MAN cells projects to HVC. These two sets of connections—MAN to NCL and MAN to HVC—run in parallel but do not overlap. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that the NCL is part of a “general motor system” that parallels the song system but exhibits only minimal monosynaptic interconnections with it.</p>
