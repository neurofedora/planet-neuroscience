">Neural signatures of harm aversion predict later willingness to exert effort for others rewards</a></h4>

              
                Prosocial behaviours, actions that incur personal costs to benefit others, are central to human social life. Two key domains are moral harm aversion, where individuals forgo personal gains to prevent harming others, and prosocial effort, which involves exerting effort to benefit others. Although previous studies suggest a relationship between these behaviours, it remains unclear whether neural responses in one domain can predict prosocial motivation in another. Here, we tested whether neural sensitivity to morally salient information in harm aversion could predict prosocial effort later. Participants completed two tasks: a harm aversion task during fMRI, in which they traded off monetary profit against delivering electric shocks to another person; and, one week later, a prosocial effort task outside the scanner, in which they decided whether rewards for others were worth the required physical effort. We focused on three regions implicated in cost-benefit decision-making and social cognition: the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula (AI), and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Behaviourally, greater harm aversion was associated with increased prosocial effort. Neurally, AI responses to others harm predicted sensitivity to others rewards in the effort task, consistent with a role in representing others outcomes across positive and negative valences. By contrast, TPJ responses to profit from harming others predicted decreased sensitivity to others rewards, suggesting a role in context-dependent valuation that may constrain prosocial behaviour. These findings demonstrate that neural responses to morally salient information in one context correlate with prosocial motivation in another, highlighting mechanisms that bridge moral sensitivity and effortful prosociality.

">Distributed neural computation and the evolution of the first brains</a></h4>

              
                Brains likely evolved from diffuse nerve nets in the pre-Cambrian, but we do not know what the first brains looked like or how they were organized. Acoel worms, the sister lineage to all other animals with brains, offer a window into this transition. We studied the three-banded panther worm Hofstenia miamia, whose brain is diffuse and unlike any previously described: it shows little anatomical or functional regionalization or stereotypy. Worms forage successfully even after large portions of the brain are removed, suggesting most regions can perform most computations. Neural cell type markers are also distributed across the brain with little regionalization. High-resolution studies of hunting reveal that more brain tissue improves performance, but no specific brain region is required. These results lead us to propose that H. miamia's brain is built from computationally pluripotent 'tiles', whose interactions generate coherent behavior. This architecture suggests that early brains arose by condensation of diffuse nerve nets into unregionalized brains, with regionalization evolving secondarily.

">GlialCAM Cytoplasmic Signaling in Oligodendrocytes and Astrocytes is Essential for White Matter Homeostasis in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Glial cell adhesion molecule (GlialCAM) is an astrocyte- and oligodendrocyte-expressed transmembrane protein with two extracellular IgG-like domains and a cytoplasmic tail with putative signaling functions. While numerous studies have explored functions for the GlialCAM IgG-like domains in brain development and physiology, functions for its cytoplasmic signaling tail remain largely unknown. Therefore, we developed a mutant mouse model that expresses a truncated GlialCAM construct (GlialCAM -CT) that contains intact extracellular and transmembrane domains but lacks the cytoplasmic tail. Deletion of the GlialCAM cytoplasmic domain in glial cells of the brain results in vacuolization within white matter regions without disrupting neurovascular barrier integrity. Consequently, mutant mice exhibited selective deficits in motor coordination, muscular strength, and memory. Single cell transcriptome sequencing identifies GlialCAM-dependent defects in ECM remodeling pathways in white matter tracts. In situ spatial profiling revealed robust activation of astrocytes and microglia in the mutant brain. Proteomic analysis identified GlialCAM cytoplasmic tail interactors with links to MAPK signaling and cytoskeletal regulatory networks. These data reveal important functions for the GlialCAM cytoplasmic tail in homeostasis of white matter tracts in the adult murine brain. The GlialCAM -CT model may also be useful for studying the pathogenesis and possible treatment of neurological diseases linked to white matter degeneration.

                Background Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) incidence in Northeastern Thailand is very high and a major cause of mortality. CCA patients typically have a poor prognosis and short-term survival rate due to late-stage diagnosis. Thailand is the first Southeast Asian country to approve medicinal cannabis treatment, especially for palliative care with advanced cancer patients. Methods A retrospective cohort study compared survival among 491 newly diagnosed advanced CCA patients between September 2019 and June 2021. Of these, 404 received standard palliative pain management (ST), and 87 received medicinal cannabis treatment (CT). Patients were enrolled from four tertiary hospitals and two secondary hospitals in five provinces of Northeast Thailand. Cumulative survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and independent prognostic factors were analyzed using Cox regression. Results For ST patients, follow-up time was 790 person-months, with a mortality rate of 48.35/100 person-months. For CT patients, follow-up time was 476 person-months, with a mortality rate of 10.9/100 person-months. The median survival time after registration at a palliative clinic was 0.83 months (95% CI: 0.71–0.95) for ST and 5.66 months (95% CI: 1.94–9.38) for CT. Multivariate analysis showed CT was significantly associated with prolonged survival (HRadj = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.20–0.37; p < 0.001). Conclusions The medical cannabis increased overall survival rates among CCA patients. In this retrospective cohort, Medicinal cannabis treatment was associated with more prolonged survival among advanced CCA patients in Northeastern Thailand. While this association remained significant after multivariable adjustment, unmeasured or residual confounding factors may have influenced the observed outcomes. Although the association remained significant after adjustment, unmeasured or residual confounders may have influenced outcomes. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings and explore potential mechanisms.

                Background Postoperative immobilization in patients with lower extremity fractures frequently leads to constipation, affecting approximately 50–70% of patients. Non-pharmacological nursing interventions such as Swedish abdominal massage and warm water drinking therapy are potential approaches to alleviate this problem. Objective The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of Swedish abdominal massage and warm water drinking therapy in reducing constipation scores among patients with postoperative lower extremity fractures. Methods A quasi-experimental pre–posttest design without a control group was conducted with 30 respondents selected using a simple random sampling technique. Constipation was assessed using the Constipation Assessment Scale (CAS) before and after intervention. Data were analyzed using independent t-tests, and results were interpreted with attention to baseline differences between groups. Results Both interventions significantly reduced constipation scores. The mean post-intervention CAS score was 4.60 in the warm water group and 3.56 in the Swedish abdominal massage group (p < 0.001). Although Swedish abdominal massage showed a greater within-group reduction, baseline imbalances in constipation scores may have influenced the observed differences. Conclusion Swedish abdominal massage and warm water therapy are effective nurse-led, non-pharmacological interventions for reducing postoperative constipation. The findings should be interpreted cautiously due to baseline differences and small sample size. Future research with larger samples, controlled designs, and statistical adjustments is recommended to confirm these preliminary findings.

                Background It is imperative to deliver exceptional services in order to improve patient contentment and cultivate enduring loyalty in the healthcare sector, which is becoming more competitive. The direct impact of leadership and governance on patient experience and retention remains underexplored, despite the increasing recognition of their role in determining care delivery. This investigation investigates the connections between healthcare organizations’ corporate governance, service quality, patient satisfaction, and loyalty, as well as entrepreneurial leadership. Methods Data were obtained from 384 executive patients in hospitals throughout Indonesia using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results The findings indicate that corporate governance and service quality are considerably improved by entrepreneurial leadership, while patient satisfaction and loyalty are positively impacted by corporate governance. Nevertheless, patient satisfaction was found to be moderately influenced by service quality, while patient loyalty was significantly influenced. As a result, patient satisfaction was demonstrated to be a critical factor in the development of patient loyalty. These results emphasize the importance of high service quality, effective governance, and entrepreneurial leadership in promoting patient satisfaction and loyalty. Conclusions The research offers valuable insights for healthcare managers and policymakers who are interested in enhancing organizational performance and improving patient retention. This research theoretically enhances comprehension of the impact of leadership and governance frameworks on patient retention and service quality. In practical terms, it provides valuable recommendations for hospital administrators and policymakers to improve patient satisfaction and loyalty by implementing effective leadership, robust governance, and continuous service improvement.

                Introduction With the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), its integration into medical fields has gained momentum. AI is increasingly applied for diagnosing and managing temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD), affecting one of the most complex joints in the body. This review aims to highlight the AI-driven approaches in diagnosing and treating TMD. Methods A comprehensive literature search conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, focusing on English-language studies published since 2007. References from relevant articles were also examined. Results A total of 21 studies met the inclusion criteria, covering diverse AI applications in TMD. These studies included AI-driven medical image segmentation (3), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (3), temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) detection (4), Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) articular disc displacements and deformities (5), decision support systems (5), and AI-based sound analysis for TMJ assessment (1). The findings suggest that AI, particularly deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques, has demonstrated promising accuracy in detecting and classifying TMD and its related pathologies. AI automates segmentation, improves diagnostic consistency, and assists clinicians through predictive modeling. Discussion Despite advancements, challenges remain, as many studies rely on small datasets, limiting generalizability. The absence of standardized evaluation metrics and external validation hinders clinical adoption. Ethical concerns, data privacy issues, and workflow integration pose additional barriers. Future research should focus on larger datasets, model interpretability, and rigorous clinical validation. Conclusion AI is emerging as a valuable tool in TMD diagnosis and management, promising improved accuracy and efficiency, but further development is essential for real-world implementation.

                Background Standard multi-drug therapy (MDT) with duration of 6-12 months is generally effective for treating leprosy. However, in cases of lepromatous (LL) and borderline lepromatous (BL) patients with high bacterial loads and complicated circumstances often faces non-adherence. Ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, has shown promising efficacy against Mycobacterium leprae in in-vitro and in-vivo studies, therefore accelerates bacterial clearance. Methods This single-center retrospective cohort study investigated the effects of adding ofloxacin to MDT in 21 patients diagnosed with LL or BL leprosy at Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. Bacterial load and viability were tracked using the Bacteriological Index (BI) and Morphological Index (MI), and were compared before and after the patients were given ofloxacin. Findings Adding ofloxacin to MDT led to a significant reductions in both BI and MI. The median MI dropped to zero after six months of combined treatment (p<0.001), with significant differences between baseline and 6, 9, and 12-months. BI also significantly declined (p=0.007), with significant reductions between baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12-month assessments. The proportion of patients reaching an MI of zero also steadily increased. Interpretation Ofloxacin as an adjunctive therapy to MDT substantially improves treatment of leprosy with high bacterial and morphological index. Faster bacterial clearance prevent prolonged treatment duration, potentially improving adherence, outcomes and reducing relapse risk. Ofloxacin is the only second-line leprosy treatment covered by the national health insurance in Indonesia. Earlier initiation of this adjunctive therapy may offer greater benefits.

                Objective The rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors, predictive of type 2 diabetes, relates largely to increasing obesity and sedentary lifestyle, but also to early metabolic life events. Considering the consequences on health of developing MetS in young adulthood, the objective of this study is to better characterize and understand MetS phenotypes in a young adult born with small weight for gestational age (SGA). Methods A nested case-control study is designed within the French community-based Haguenau cohort, including 92 male and female young SGA adults divided into cases (with MetS at follow-up, n=46) and controls (free of MetS, n=46), matched for age and sex, all free of MetS at baseline. Serum metabolic signatures will be first determined at the end of follow-up (30 years of age) to characterise phenotypes related to MetS using an untargeted mass spectrometry metabolomic approach. Results will be compared to those obtained in a population of adults born with adequate weight for gestational age (AGA), matched for age and sex, to reveal the specific part of phenotypes related to the imprint of the foetal environment. Lastly, the baseline signatures (20 y.o.) will be identified to explore early dysfunctions around 10 years before diagnosis and evaluate the capacities of serum metabolites to predict evolution towards MetS in SGA. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethical committee of the University of Paris-St Louis, and all subjects gave written informed consent. Research findings will be disseminated through peer reviewed publications and at national and international conferences with domain-specific societies, to researchers, clinicians, and policy markers sharing findings. This project was supported by the ‘Fondation Francophone de Recherche sur le Diabète’.

                Background Digital transformation in banking is accelerating, yet internal adoption of key applications remains suboptimal. BRISPOT is a digital credit system used by relationship managers (RMs) in the SME segment of Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI). Methods Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) integrated with Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), this quantitative study surveyed 150 RMs. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Results Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions significantly affected behavioral intention to use BRISPOT. Behavioral intention had a strong influence on actual usage. However, trust did not moderate the intention–use relationship. Conclusions The integration of UTAUT and SCT offers a robust explanation of digital adoption behavior among internal users. System usability and institutional support are critical for driving adoption. Trust, while conceptually important, may be context-dependent.

                <p>by Hongru Du, Matthew V. Zahn, Sara L. Loo, Tijs W. Alleman, Shaun Truelove, Bryan Patenaude, Lauren M. Gardner, Nicholas Papageorge, Alison L. Hill</p>

Human behavior plays a crucial role in infectious disease transmission, yet traditional models often overlook or oversimplify this factor, limiting predictions of disease spread and the associated socioeconomic impacts. Here we introduce a feedback-informed epidemiological model that integrates human behavior with disease dynamics in a credible, tractable, and extendable manner. From economics, we incorporate a dynamic decision-making model where individuals assess the trade-off between disease risks and economic consequences, and then link this to a risk-stratified compartmental model of disease spread taken from epidemiology. In the unified framework, heterogeneous individuals make choices based on current and future payoffs, influencing their risk of infection and shaping population-level disease dynamics. As an example, we model disease-decision feedback during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the decision to participate in paid, in-person work was a major determinant of disease risk. Comparing the impacts of stylized policy options representing mandatory, incentivized/compensated, and voluntary work abstention, we find that accounting for disease-behavior feedback has a significant impact on the relative health and economic impacts of policies. Including two crucial dimensions of heterogeneity—health and economic vulnerability—the results highlight how inequities between risk groups can be exacerbated or alleviated by disease control measures. Importantly, we show that a policy of more stringent workplace testing can potentially slow virus spread and, surprisingly, increase labor supply since individuals otherwise inclined to remain at home to avoid infection perceive a safer workplace. In short, our framework permits the exploration of avenues whereby health and wealth need not always be at odds. This flexible and extendable modeling framework offers a powerful tool for understanding the interplay between human behavior and disease spread.

                <p>by Théo Pinettes, Quentin J Leclerc, Kévin Jean, Laura Temime</p>

Nosocomial infections of both patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) in hospitals may play an important part in the overall dynamics of a viral pandemic, as evidenced by the recent COVID-19 experience. A strategy to control this risk consists in dedicating some hospitals to the care of infected patients only, with HCWs alternating between shifts of continuous stay within these hospitals and periods of isolation. This strategy has been implemented locally in various settings and generalized in Egypt. Here, using a mathematical model coupling hospitals and community, we assess the impact of this strategy on overall epidemic dynamics. We find that quarantine hospitals may significantly reduce the number of cumulative cases, as well as the peak incidence, when effective control strategies are in place in the community and symptomatic HCWs comply with self-isolation recommendations. Our results, which are robust to variations in assumed biological characteristics of the virus, suggest that the quarantine hospital strategy could be considered in future pandemic contexts to best protect the entire population.

Using data from gene combination double knockout (CDKO) experiments, top ranked synthetic lethal (SL) gene pairs were highly inconsistent among different SL scores. This leads to a significant concern that SL prediction models highly depend on SL scores. In this paper, we introduce a new gene combination effect (GCE) measurement, log-fold change of dual-gRNA expression before and after CRISPR-cas9 lentivirus transfection. We show it is a direct and highly consistent measurement of GCE in all CDKO experiments. We therefore develop a multi-layer encoder model for individual sample specific GCE prediction, MLEC-iGeneCombo. Under a deep learning framework, MLEC-iGeneCombo is a systems biology model that contains sample specific multi-omics encoder, network encoder and cell-line encoder. For the first time, MLEC-iGeneCombo predicts GCE for a new cell. Using data from 18 CDKO experiments, MLEC-iGeneCombo achieves an average GCE prediction performance, 71.9%. All three encoders significantly improve the model’s prediction performance (p≤0.01), and their combined use yields the best GCE prediction performance. Our source code is available at https://github.com/karenyun/MLEC-iGeneCombo.

                <p>by Guillermo Martín-Sánchez, Christian K. Machens, William F. Podlaski</p>

Hippocampal remapping, in which place cells form distinct activity maps across different environments, is a well-established phenomenon with a range of theoretical interpretations. Some theories propose that remapping helps to minimize interference between competing spatial memories, whereas others link it to shifts in an underlying latent state representation. However, how these interpretations of remapping relate to one another, and what types of activity changes they are compatible with, remains unclear. To unify and elucidate the mechanisms behind remapping, we here adopt a neural coding and population geometry perspective. Assuming that hippocampal population activity can be understood through a linearly-decodable latent space, we show that there are three possible mechanisms to induce remapping: (i) a true change in the mapping between neural and latent space, (ii) modulation of activity due to non-spatial mixed selectivity of place cells, or (iii) neural variability in the null space of the latent space that reflects a redundant code. We simulate and visualize examples of these remapping types in a network model, and relate the resultant remapping behavior to various models and experimental findings in the literature. Overall, our work serves as a unifying framework with which to visualize, understand, and compare the wide array of theories and experimental observations about remapping, and may serve as a testbed for understanding neural response variability under various experimental conditions.

                <p>by Sobhan Shukueian Tabrizi, Sina Barazandeh, Helyasadat Hashemi Aghdam, A. Ercument Cicek</p>

Protein-RNA interactions are essential in gene regulation, splicing, RNA stability, and translation, making RNA a promising therapeutic agent for targeting proteins, including those considered undruggable. However, designing RNA sequences that selectively bind to proteins remains a significant challenge due to the vast sequence space and limitations of current experimental and computational methods. Traditional approaches rely on in vitro selection techniques or computational models that require post-generation optimization, restricting their applicability to well-characterized proteins.
We introduce RNAtranslator, a generative language model that formulates protein-conditional RNA design as a sequence-to-sequence natural language translation problem for the first time. By learning a joint representation of RNA and protein interactions from large-scale datasets, RNAtranslator directly generates binding RNA sequences for any given protein target without the need for additional optimization. Our results demonstrate that RNAtranslator produces RNA sequences with natural-like properties, high novelty, and enhanced binding affinity compared to existing methods. This approach enables efficient RNA design for a wide range of proteins and even proteins with no RNA-interaction data available, paving the way for new RNA-based therapeutics and synthetic biology applications

                <p>by Daniel Chapman, Flavia Occhibove, James M. Bullock, Pieter S. A. Beck, Juan A. Navas-Cortes, Steven M. White</p>

Mathematical and computational models play a crucial role in understanding the epidemiology of economically important plant disease outbreaks, and in evaluating the effectiveness of surveillance and disease management measures. A case in point is <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>, one of the world’s most deadly plant pathogens. Since its European discovery in olives in Puglia, Italy in 2013, there remain key knowledge gaps that undermine landscape-scale containment efforts of the outbreak, most notably concerning the year of introduction, the rate of spread, dispersal mechanisms and control efficacy. To address this, we developed a spatially explicit simulation model for the outbreak spreading among olive groves coupled to a simulation of the real surveillance and containment measures. We used Approximate Bayesian Computation to fit the model to surveillance and remote-sensing infection data, comparing the fits for three alternative dispersal mechanisms (isotropic, wind and road). The model accurately explained the rate and spatiotemporal pattern of the outbreak and found weak support for the wind dispersal model over the isotropic model. It suggests that the bacterium may have been introduced as early as 2003 (95% CI [2000, 2009]), earlier than previous estimates and congruent with anecdotal evidence. The isotropic model estimates the pathogen is spreading at 5.7 km y<sup>-1</sup> (95% CI [5.4-5.9]) under containment measures, down from 7.2 km y<sup>-1</sup> (95% CI [6.9-7.5]) without containment measures. Our estimate of an approximately 10-year lag between introduction and detection highlights the need for stronger biosecurity and surveillance for earlier detection of emerging plant pathogens. The outputs from simulations without any disease management also suggest that while containment measures have caused some slowing of <i>X. fastidiosa</i> spread, stronger measures will be required to contain the outbreak fully.

                <p>by Nicholas Steyn, Marc Chadeau-Hyam, Paul Elliott, Christl A. Donnelly</p>

Epidemic prevalence surveys monitor the spread of an infectious disease by regularly testing representative samples of a population for infection. State-of-the-art Bayesian approaches for analysing epidemic survey data were constructed independently and under pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we compare two existing approaches (one leveraging Bayesian P-splines and the other approximate Gaussian processes) with a novel approach (leveraging a random walk and fit using sequential Monte Carlo) for smoothing and performing inference on epidemic survey data. We use our simpler approach to investigate the impact of survey design and underlying epidemic dynamics on the quality of estimates. We then incorporate these considerations into the existing approaches and compare all three on simulated data and on real-world data from the SARS-CoV-2 REACT-1 prevalence study in England. All three approaches, once appropriate considerations are made, produce similar estimates of infection prevalence; however, estimates of the growth rate and instantaneous reproduction number are more sensitive to underlying assumptions. Interactive notebooks applying all three approaches are also provided alongside recommendations on hyperparameter selection and other practical guidance, with some cases resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster runtime.

                <p>by Peter Scarfe, Paul B. Hibbard</p>

Ocular convergence is one of the critical cues from which to estimate the absolute distance to objects in the world, because unlike most other distance cues a one-to-one mapping exists between absolute distance and ocular convergence. However, even when accurately converging their eyes on an object, humans tend to underestimate its distance, particularly for more distant objects. This systematic bias in distance perception has yet to be explained and questions the utility of vergence as an absolute distance cue. Here we present a probabilistic geometric model that shows how distance underestimation can be explained by the visual system estimating the most likely distance in the world to have caused an accurate, but noisy, ocular convergence signal. Furthermore, we find that the noise in the vergence signal needed to account for human distance underestimation is comparable to that experimentally measured. Critically, our results depend on the formulation of a likelihood function that takes account of the generative function relating distance to ocular convergence.

                <p>by Saeed Mohammadzadeh, Emma Lejeune</p>

In cardiac cells, structural organization is an important indicator of cell maturity and healthy function. Healthy and mature cardiomyocytes exhibit a highly organized structure, characterized by well-aligned almost crystalline morphology with densely packed and organized sarcomeres. Immature and/or diseased cardiomyocytes typically lack this highly organized structure. Critically, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) offer a valuable model for studying human cardiac cells in a controlled, patient-specific, and minimally invasive manner. However, these cells often exhibit a disorganized and difficult to quantify structure both in their immature form and as disease models. In this work, we extend the SarcGraph computational framework—designed specifically to assess the structural and functional behavior of hiPSC-CMs—to better accommodate the structural features of immature cells. There are two key enhancements: (1) incorporating a deep learning-based z-disc classifier, and (2) introducing a novel ensemble graph-scoring approach. These modification significantly reduced false positive sarcomere detections, particularly in immature cells, and improved the detection of longer myofibrils in mature samples. With this enhanced framework, we analyze an open-source dataset published by the Allen Institute for Cell Science, where, for the first time, we are able to extract key structural features from these data using information from each individually detected sarcomere. Not only are we able to use these structural features to predict expert scores, but we are also able to use these structural features to identify bias in expert scoring and offer an alternative unsupervised learning approach based on explainable clustering. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our modified SarcGraph algorithm in extracting biologically meaningful structural features, enabling a deeper understanding of hiPSC-CM structural integrity. By making our code and tools open-source, we aim to empower the broader cardiac research community and foster further development of computational tools for cardiac tissue analysis.

                <p>by Yuting Liu, Leiru Huang, Ruipeng Wang, Fukang Qi, Yiwen Liu, Qingyuan Chen, Morgane Mialon, Lili Chen, Berangere Pinan-Lucarre, Shangbang Gao</p>

Nicotine exposure elicits diverse behavioral changes, yet the underlying neural pathways and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that chronic nicotine exposure markedly increases both the initiation and duration of reversals in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Strikingly, these reversals were tightly coupled with the rhythmic body contractions of the defecation motor program (DMP). Through pharmacological, genetic, in situ electrophysiological, and calcium imaging analyses, we show that nicotine enhances the activity of the AVA interneuron via selective upregulation of ACR-16, a nicotinic ACh receptor critical for nicotine-induced motor coupling. Ablation of touch receptor neurons (TRNs) or inhibition of TRNs-mediated mechanosensation completely abolished this coupling. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of TRNs in nicotine-treated animals evoked stronger AVA depolarization, and nicotine amplified gentle touch-evoked reversals. Together, these findings reveal a potential interoceptive effect of nicotine mediated by sensitization of the TRNs-AVA mechanosensory pathway, providing new insight into the neural and molecular basis of nicotine’s modulation of sensory-motor coupling.

Sexual reproduction in basidiomycete fungi is governed by <i>MAT</i> loci (<i>P/R</i> and <i>HD</i>), which exhibit remarkable evolutionary plasticity, characterized by expansions, rearrangements, and gene losses often associated with mating system transitions. The sister genera <i>Cryptococcus</i> and <i>Kwoniella</i> provide a powerful framework for studying <i>MAT</i> loci evolution owing to their diverse reproductive strategies and distinct architectures, spanning bipolar and tetrapolar systems with either linked or unlinked <i>MAT</i> loci. Building on recent comparative genomic analyses, we generated additional chromosome-level assemblies, uncovering distinct trajectories shaping <i>MAT</i> loci organization. Contrasting with the small-scale expansions and gene acquisitions observed in <i>Kwoniella</i>, our analyses revealed independent expansions of the <i>P/R</i> locus in tetrapolar <i>Cryptococcus</i>, possibly driven by pheromone gene duplications. Notably, these expansions coincided with a pronounced GC-content reduction best explained by reduced GC-biased gene conversion following recombination suppression, rather than relaxed codon usage selection. Diverse modes of <i>MAT</i> locus linkage were also identified, including three previously unrecognized transitions: one resulting in a pseudobipolar arrangement and two leading to bipolarity. All three transitions involved translocations. In the pseudobipolar configuration, the <i>P/R</i> and <i>HD</i> loci remained on the same chromosome but genetically unlinked, whereas the bipolar transitions additionally featured rearrangements that fused the two loci into a nonrecombining region. Mating assays confirmed a sexual cycle in <i>Cryptococcus decagattii</i>, demonstrating its ability to undergo mating and sporulation. Progeny analysis in <i>Kwoniella mangrovensis</i> revealed substantial ploidy variation and aneuploidy, likely stemming from haploid–diploid mating, yet evidence of recombination and loss of heterozygosity indicates that meiotic exchange occurs despite irregular chromosome segregation. Our findings underscore the importance of continued diversity sampling and provide further evidence for convergent evolution of fused <i>MAT</i> loci in basidiomycetes, offering new insights into the genetic and chromosomal changes driving reproductive transitions.

                <p>by Ashley M. Ingiosi</p>

Astrocytes help control sleep and arousal. A new study in PLOS Biology shows that a wake-promoting signal called histamine affects how astrocytes respond to and modulate other brain signals and reduces time spent awake through astroglial histamine-1-receptors.

Astrocytes are increasingly understood to modulate sleep and arousal. This Primer highlights a recent PLOS Biology study elucidating the mechanisms of this regulation, revealing that histamine-1-receptor signaling in astrocytes modulates intracellular calcium and extracellular adenosine dynamics to regulate arousal.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1036/v1?src=rss">Taking Flight with Aviation English: How are Malaysian Teachers Preparing the Next Generation? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Aviation English, a specialised language field for areas like aircraft maintenance, involves more complex pedagogy than general English, as it addresses specific learner needs within an aviation context. Teachers in this field must understand aviation-specific content and students’ linguistic needs to design courses that meet professional communication demands while adhering to legal and safety standards emphasizing clarity. Methods This study examined Malaysian aviation English teachers’ experiences in developing tailored courses. Using semi-structured interviews with three teachers from aviation schools accredited by the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA) and the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM), data were transcribed and analysed in ATLAS.ti, with rigor ensured through member checking, prolonged engagement, and external audits. Results Findings revealed three key themes: teachers’ understanding of aviation English, integration of aviation content, and instructional challenges. Participants described an extensive learning process in acquiring aviation knowledge and creatively integrating it into lessons through relevant activities and real-life applications. Challenges included varied student abilities, limited resources, and inadequate institutional support. Conclusions The study explored how English teachers acquire and apply aviation knowledge and teaching skills, highlighting areas that could benefit from improved training and credentialing. Limitations include a small sample size and brief data collection period (March to August 2024), restricting generalisability, while the thematic analysis method may limit deeper exploration of nuanced experiences. Nonetheless, the study offers insights to enhance aviation English instruction for aviation students’ linguistic and professional needs.

                Background and Objectives Controlling blood pressure is a central objective in the management of hypertension. However, it is often inadequate due to environmental and/or patient-related factors. The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of uncontrolled blood pressure and to identify the associated risk factors in hypertensive patients followed up in health centers in Settat city. Materials and Methods A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2023 to February 2024 in 21 primary care facilities (12 urban and 9 rural) in Settat, including 1004 hypertensive patients. Data were collected using a validated questionnaire covering medical, therapeutic and knowledge aspects of hypertension. Compliance medication was assessed by the Girerd test, and physical activity by the Global Physical Activity questionnaire recommended by the World Health Organization. Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were taken in accordance with international standards. Results Uncontrolled blood pressure affected 57.9% (n=581) of patients. Multivariable analysis revealed a significant association with rural environment (OR = 3.13; 95% CI [2.06-4.74]), advanced age (OR = 1.39; CI95% [1.09-1.63]), low monthly income (OR = 1.37; CI95% [1.21-1.56]), high-salt diet (OR = 1.39; CI95% [1.15-1.69]) and poor compliance with medication (OR = 7.24; CI95% [5.09-10.31]). Conclusion Unsatisfactory blood pressure control in Moroccan hypertensive patients has highlighted the need to take into account the sociodemographic dimension in the management of hypertension, and the role of health centers in supplying patients with antihypertensive drugs and therapeutic and behavioral education to optimize blood pressure control.

                Background While systematic barriers preventing nurses from advancing into research capability and leadership positions have been well-documented, the compounded challenges faced by Global Majority nurses remain underexplored. Purpose This commentary expands upon Vamadevan et al.’s (2025) systematic narrative review to examine intersectional barriers preventing Global Majority nurses from developing research capability and achieving leadership positions within UK healthcare systems. Methods Drawing on recent empirical evidence and workforce statistics, this analysis examines how structural discrimination, cultural isolation, and systemic inequities create additional barriers for Global Majority nurses beyond those identified in existing nursing career development research. Key Arguments Global Majority nurses face intersecting challenges that compound existing structural barriers to research capability development, including systematic discrimination in recruitment and career progression, cultural isolation due to lack of diverse representation in leadership positions, and exclusion from informal networks facilitating professional advancement. Current diversity initiatives operate within systems maintaining structural barriers and adopt deficit models placing change burden on individuals rather than addressing institutional practices. Implications Comprehensive systemic reforms are required including transparent recruitment and promotion processes, targeted mentorship programmes addressing cultural and professional challenges, organisational culture change initiatives addressing systemic racism, and equitable research funding access. Conclusion Excluding Global Majority perspectives from research capability development represents both moral imperative and practical necessity for UK healthcare systems. Transformative action is essential to create inclusive and equitable pathways for all nursing professionals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1033/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Upper Eyelid Blepharoplasty Following Repeated Botulinum Toxin Injections: A Case Report [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Dermatochalasis of the upper eyelids is a frequent age-related condition that may impair vision and pose a major aesthetic concern. Although both surgical and nonsurgical treatments are available, improper or repeated administration of nonsurgical approaches, such as botulinum toxin (BT) injections, can lead to functional issues, including eyelid heaviness, ocular fatigue, and patient dissatisfaction. We report the case of a 45-year-old Syrian man with bilateral upper eyelid dermatochalasis who had received multiple periocular BT injections over two years. Despite initial improvement, he developed recurrent skin redundancy, ocular heaviness, fatigue, headaches, and aesthetic dissatisfaction. Clinical examination revealed bilateral eyelid skin redundancy and superior visual field restriction with preserved levator function. Bilateral upper eyelid blepharoplasty was performed, involving careful excision of redundant skin, removal of excessive preaponeurotic fat likely accentuated by prior BT treatment and partial excision of the orbicularis oculi muscle, while preserving the levator apparatus and orbital septum integrity. The procedure was completed without complications. Postoperatively, the patient experienced complete resolution of eyelid heaviness and subjective improvement in the visual field, as well as a more defined eyelid contour and improved symmetry. Patient satisfaction, measured using the Blepharoplasty Outcomes Evaluation (BOE) questionnaire, increased from 25% preoperatively to 96.8% at three and six months postoperatively. This case demonstrates that upper eyelid blepharoplasty remains the gold standard for managing dermatochalasis, particularly when nonsurgical interventions have failed or produced functional complications. The procedure can successfully restore eyelid function, improve visual performance, and achieve high aesthetic satisfaction, highlighting the importance of proper patient selection and timely surgical intervention in the management of upper eyelid aging.

                Background The relationship between military necessity and the protection of cultural heritage under international humanitarian law has been and continues to be governed by a constant tension that has shaped both doctrine and practice. While the principle of military necessity, rooted in and derived from the 1863 Lieber Code and codified in later instruments such as the 1907 Hague Conventions, remains one of the most fundamental principles permitting the adoption of measures necessary to achieve legitimate military objectives, it has also been used to justify the destruction of cultural property. Conversely, cultural heritage, deserving special protection under instruments such as the 1954 Hague Convention and its Protocols, represents the collective memory and identity of societies. Methods To evaluate the role of military necessity in the prosecution of crimes against cultural heritage, this paper uses a critical doctrinal and analytical approach, looking at both treaty law and international jurisprudence. It asks whether military necessity is a valid practical safeguard or a legal pretext for destruction. Results The paper contends that the incorporation of “imperative military necessity” has engendered critical legal loopholes resulting from warring parties’ exploitation of the prioritization of military interests over the preservation of cultural heritage, rendering cultural heritage vulnerable in armed conflicts. International tribunals, such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Court (ICC), have endeavoured to restrict these justifications by criminalizing deliberate attacks and applying standards of necessity and proportionality. Conclusions The paper concludes that, despite treaties and jurisprudence limiting the scope of military necessity, the ongoing recognition of the necessity exception reveals structural weaknesses in international humanitarian law, thereby rendering cultural heritage vulnerable in armed conflict. Accordingly, it advocates for the strict limitation of the ‘imperative military necessity’ exception to provide better protection for cultural heritage during armed conflict.

                Guo et al. identify the peptide Vulnusin as an acute wound signal that activates C4da nociceptors through the PPK1/PPK26 ion channel in Drosophila larvae. Vulnusin localizes in the extracellular space apical to the epidermis when uninjured but reaches the C4da nociceptor upon damage to trigger the nociceptive rolling behavior.

                Luo et al. identify distinct supramammillary-dentate gyrus subcircuits that differentially regulate memory and emotion. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) models, these pathways show aberrant activity, but targeted optogenetic activation selectively restores cognitive or affective functions, revealing circuit-level mechanisms underlying diverse AD symptoms and highlighting potential therapeutic targets.

                Nikkola et al. demonstrate that Lynch syndrome-associated urothelial cancers are mismatch-repair deficient and evolve through a mutagenic process dominated by 5-methylcytosine deamination and microsatellite instability. This results in a distinct mutational landscape marked by the absence of TERT promoter mutations and near-universal mutation of ARID1A, FGFR3, and KMT2D.

                Stress granules (SGs) and P-bodies (PBs) are dynamic RNA-protein condensates regulating mRNA fate. While assembly mechanisms are well studied, emerging insights into their dissolution are now coming to light. Here, Garg et al. highlight the current understanding of disassembly mechanisms and their implications in neurodegeneration and cancer.

Manipulating these vlPAG glutamatergic neurons and their projections to the nucleus tractus solitarius modulates inflammation-induced sickness behaviors and hypometabolic states, including hypothermia, cardiovascular depression, reduced locomotion, and appetite suppression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104220">Dual transcranial electromagnetic stimulation of the precuneus boosts human long-term memory</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques have the potential to improve memory functions. However, the results so far have been relatively modest and time-consuming. Here, we implemented a novel 3-min combination of personalized repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (intermittent theta burst, iTBS) coupled with simultaneous application of gamma transcranial alternating current stimulation (γtACS) over the precuneus, a brain area connected with the hippocampus, to modulate long-term memory in healthy subjects. Only dual electromagnetic stimulation of the precuneus produced an increase in long-term associative memory as compared to iTBS alone and sham conditions in a sample of healthy volunteers. The effects were replicated in another independent sample, in which the increased associative memory was retained for up to 1 week. Moreover, dual stimulation increased gamma oscillations and precuneus–hippocampus functional connectivity through the white matter tracts linking the precuneus with the temporal lobe. These findings show that dual stimulation may lead neuronal assemblies in a state favorable to enhance long-term plasticity. Personalized dual electromagnetic stimulation of the precuneus may represent a new powerful approach for enhancing memory functions in several healthy and clinical conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102449">Pan-tissue transcriptome analysis reveals sex-dimorphic human aging</a></h4>

              
                Complex diseases often exhibit sex dimorphism in morbidity and prognosis, many of which are age-related. However, the underlying mechanisms of sex-dimorphic aging remain foggy, with limited studies across multiple tissues. We systematically analyzed ~17,000 transcriptomes from 35 human tissues to quantitatively evaluate the individual and combined contributions of sex and age to transcriptomic variations. We discovered extensive sex dimorphisms during aging with distinct patterns of change in gene expression and alternative splicing (AS). Intriguingly, the male-biased age-associated AS events have a stronger association with Alzheimer’s disease, and the female-biased events are often regulated by several sex-biased splicing factors that may be controlled by estrogen receptors. Breakpoint analysis showed that sex-dimorphic aging rates are significantly associated with decline of sex hormones, with males having a larger and earlier transcriptome change. Collectively, this study uncovered an essential role of sex during aging at the molecular and multi-tissue levels, providing insight into sex-dimorphic regulatory patterns.

                Though the responses of the rich variety of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) reflect the totality of visual processing in the retina and provide the sole conduit for those processed responses to the brain, we have much to learn about how the brain uses these signals to guide behavior. An impediment to developing a comprehensive understanding of the role of retinal circuits in behavior is the paucity of causal studies in the intact primate visual system. Here, we demonstrate the ability to optogenetically activate individual RGCs with flashes of light focused on single RGC somas in vivo, with no evidence for activation of neighboring cells. The ability to selectively activate specific cells is the first step toward causal experiments that directly link retinal circuits to visual experience and behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104028">Neuronal detection triggers systemic digestive shutdown in response to adverse food sources in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                The ability to sense and adapt to adverse food conditions is essential for survival across species, but the detailed mechanisms of neuron-digestive crosstalk in food sensing and adaptation remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a novel mechanism by which <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> detect unfavorable food sources through neurons and initiate a systemic response to shut down digestion, thus safeguarding against potential harm. Specifically, we demonstrate that NSY-1, expressed in AWC neurons, detects <i>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</i> (SS) as an unfavorable food source, prompting the animal to avoid and halt digestion of SS. Upon detection, the animals activate the AWC<sup>OFF</sup> neural circuit, leading to a systemic digestive shutdown, which is mediated by NSY-1-dependent STR-130. Additionally, NSY-1 mutation triggers the production of insulin peptides, including INS-23, which interact with the DAF-2 receptor to modulate SS digestion and affect the expression of intestinal BCF-1. These findings uncover a crucial survival strategy through neuron-digestive crosstalk, where the NSY-1 pathway in AWC neurons orchestrates food evaluation and initiates digestive shutdown to adapt effectively to harmful food sources.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105545">Pleomorphic effects of three small-molecule inhibitors on transcription elongation by Mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA polymerase</a></h4>

              
                The <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> RNA polymerase (MtbRNAP) is the target of the first-line anti-tuberculosis inhibitor rifampin, however, the emergence of rifampin resistance necessitates the development of new antibiotics. Here, we communicate the first single-molecule characterization of MtbRNAP elongation and its inhibition by three diverse small-molecule inhibitors: N(α)-aroyl-N-aryl-phenylalaninamide (D-IX216), streptolydigin (Stl), and pseudouridimycin (PUM) using high-resolution optical tweezers. Compared to <i>Escherichia coli</i> RNA polymerase (EcoRNAP), MtbRNAP transcribes more slowly, has similar mechanical robustness, and only weakly recognizes <i>E. coli</i> pause sequences. The three small-molecule inhibitors of MtbRNAP exhibit strikingly different effects on transcription elongation. In the presence of D-IX216, which inhibits RNAP active-center bridge-helix motions required for nucleotide addition, the enzyme exhibits transitions between slowly and super-slowly elongating inhibited states. Stl, which inhibits the RNAP trigger-loop motions also required for nucleotide addition, inhibits RNAP primarily by inducing pausing and backtracking. PUM, a nucleoside analog of UTP, in addition to acting as a competitive inhibitor, induces the formation of slowly elongating RNAP inhibited states. Our results indicate that the three classes of small-molecule inhibitors affect the enzyme in distinct ways and show that the combination of Stl and D-IX216, which both target the RNAP bridge helix, has a strong synergistic effect on the enzyme.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Interregional communication within the human brain is essential for maintaining
                    functional integrity. A promising approach for investigating how brain regions
                    communicate relies on the assumption that the brain operates as a complex
                    network. In this context, positron emission tomography (PET) images have been
                    suggested as a valuable source for understanding brain networks. However, such
                    networks are typically assembled through direct computation without accounting
                    for outliers, impacting the reliability of group representative networks. In
                    this study, we used brain [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose PET data from
                    1,227 individuals in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) continuum from the
                    Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort to develop a novel
                    method for constructing stable metabolic brain networks that are resilient to
                    spurious data points. Our multiple sampling scheme generates brain networks with
                    greater stability compared with conventional approaches. The proposed method is
                    robust to imbalanced datasets and requires 50% fewer subjects to achieve
                    stability than the conventional method. We further validated the approach in an
                    independent AD cohort (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 114) from São Paulo, Brazil
                    (Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo). This innovative
                    method is flexible and improves the robustness of metabolic brain network
                    analyses, supporting better insights into brain connectivity and resilience to
                    data variability across multiple radiotracers for both health and disease.</span>

">Shedding light on left hippocampal mGlu5 in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) plays a central role in synaptic plasticity and memory, and has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While asymmetries in hippocampal function have been observed in AD patients, the lateralized contribution of mGlu5 signaling to cognitive decline remains unclear. Here, we show the presence of a physiological left-right asymmetry in mGlu5 expression in the hippocampus of wild-type mice, with higher levels in the left hemisphere, consistent with previous observations. Importantly, we reveal that this asymmetry is lost in J20 AD model mice due to a selective reduction of mGlu5 in the left hippocampus. Then, using the light-controllable negative allosteric modulator Alloswitch-1, we demonstrate that selective inhibition of mGlu5 in the left, but not right, hippocampus is both necessary and sufficient to restore working and short-term memory in J20 mice. This left-specific modulation also reverses downstream pathological signaling, including aberrant Pyk2 and GSK3-{beta} activation and tau hyperphosphorylation, in both hippocampi. Our findings identify a functional lateralization of mGlu5 in hippocampal circuits and highlight the potential of spatially targeted photopharmacology for precise intervention in early AD pathology.

">Characterisation of cold-selective lamina I spinal projection neurons</a></h4>

              
                Skin cooling is detected by primary afferents that express the Trpm8 channel, but how this information is conveyed to the brain remains poorly understood. We have previously identified a population of lamina I projection neurons belonging to the anterolateral system (ALS) that receive numerous contacts from Trpm8-expressing primary afferents. Here, using a semi-intact somatosensory preparation, we show that these cells correspond to the cold-selective ALS neurons identified in previous physiological studies. We also confirm the presence of synapses from Trpm8 afferents onto these cells at the ultrastructural level. Based on our previous transcriptomic findings, we identify calbindin as a molecular marker, and show that this can be used to target the cold-selective ALS neurons for anterograde tracing studies. We provide evidence that they project to 3 brain regions that are associated with thermosensation: the rostralmost part of the lateral parabrachial area, the caudal part of the periaqueductal grey matter, and the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. Our findings provide important insights into the organisation of neuronal circuits that underlie thermoregulation and the perception of cold stimuli applied to the skin.

">Toothy: an interactive platform for dentate spike curation</a></h4>

              
                Dentate spikes (DSs) are hippocampal population events that occur during low-arousal states, defined by large-amplitude positive voltage peaks recorded in the hilus of the dentate gyrus (DG). DSs can be classified into two types (DS1 and DS2), with DS2 linked to transient increases in arousal, brain-wide neural activation, and functional relevance for memory encoding. Despite growing interest in their physiological and functional properties, no standardized framework exists for detecting and classifying DSs. We present Toothy, an open-source tool for DS detection and classification in large-scale electrophysiological recordings. Toothy offers a modular and interactive workflow comprising three key steps: (1) ingestion and preprocessing of local field potential (LFP) recordings, (2) detection of hippocampal population events, and (3) classification of DS types using peri-event current source density (CSD) profiles. To support both flexibility and reproducibility, features include compatibility with multiple recording formats, customizable processing parameters, interactive event review tools, and comprehensive logging of event detection and classification parameters. In addition to DS detection, Toothy can also detect sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs; an oscillatory population event recorded in the CA1 region), enabling comparative analysis between DSs and SPW-Rs. Toothy provides a standardized, reproducible pipeline for DS detection and classification, advancing broader efforts towards investigating hippocampal dynamics across diverse settings.

">Increased HCN1 activity in human excitatory neurons drives excessive network bursting in Dravet syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe childhood epilepsy caused by mutations of the sodium channel NaV1.1. These mutations are thought to compromise the ability of inhibitory interneurons to regulate network activity, leading to seizure events. However, standard treatments to restore inhibition have limited efficacy, suggesting the existence of additional pathological mechanisms. Here, we use hiPSC-derived neuronal networks containing both excitatory and inhibitory neurons to show that excessive bursting activity in DS cultures is driven by excitatory neurons. This rise in bursting frequency is caused by the increased expression of HCN1 pacemaker channels in excitatory neurons, and bursting activity can be normalised using a channel blocker. With this work, we propose a new pathophysiological mechanism in DS and identify HCN1 as a novel therapeutic target.

">The impact of human brain geometry on the transport of an intrathecal tracer</a></h4>

              
                Background: Intrathecal contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), utilizing the contrast agent gadobutrol as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tracer is emerging as a useful method to study glymphatic function in the human brain. A consistent finding with this technique is large inter-individual variability regarding tracer propagation. In this study, we outline an approach which predicts the distribution of tracer in the parenchyma based only on geometric information from brain tissue as captured by MRI, addressing one possible explanation for this variability. Methods: Registrations are computed from pre-injection MRI, and used to map images at 24 hours after tracer injection to perform predictions of tracer enrichment in the parenchyma in other patients. We apply the method to a dataset of human brain MRI of 134 patients examined for different tentative diagnoses including idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, spontaneous intracranial hypotension and idiopathic intracranial hypertension, as well as a group of reference patients. Results: Tracer enrichment mapped between patients by image registration correlate strongly with actual observed enrichment. For patients in the reference group, the relative root mean squared error on our predictions is on average 26% in the gray matter, and 15% or less in other brain regions. Predictions are generally less reliable in the gray matter, and for patients with identified CSF leaks. Conclusion: We show that predictions made from purely geometrical considerations correlate strongly with actual MRI tracer enrichment for patients with similar diagnoses, thus quantifying the role of geometry in tracer enrichment.

">N-terminally acetylated Met11-Tau: a new pathological truncated Tau species with functional relevance in Alzheimer Disease</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer disease (AD) are characterized by progressive accumulation of pathological Tau proteins. Among the diverse Tau species, truncated variants are emerging as key contributors, yet their identity remains elusive, particularly for the N-terminal truncated ones. The present study identifies and characterizes a novel N-terminally truncated and N-alpha-acetylated form of the Tau protein. Using a newly developed antibody specifically targeting this truncated variant, we demonstrate that this species accumulates early in degenerating neurons in both transgenic mouse models of AD-related Tau pathology and post-mortem brain tissues from AD patients. Importantly, in vivo functional experiments reveal that expression of this truncated Tau species exacerbates Tau pathology, whereas targeted immunotherapeutic with the specific antibody significantly reduces pathological Tau accumulation and prevents associated memory impairments. These findings position this newly identified Tau variant as both a marker of neurofibrillary degeneration and a pathogenic driver of neurodegeneration and supports its potential as a therapeutic target in Tau-related disorders, notably AD.

">Neural activity profiles reveal overlapping, intermingled subpopulations spanning area borders in mouse sensorimotor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cortical control of movement is a distributed computation spanning multiple densely-interconnected regions. Although we have rich anatomical atlases and a coarse understanding of how function maps to areas and subregions, we lack a detailed account of how behaviorally-relevant activity is organized across the cortical sheet. Here, we trained head-fixed mice to perform a 15-target reach-to-grasp task while we performed cellular-resolution, two-photon calcium imaging across five regions of sensorimotor cortex (>39,000 layer 2/3 neurons). We characterized each neurons trial-averaged peri-event activity with interpretable metrics and mapped these response properties across areas, revealing large-scale spatial structure. Neuronal response profiles often shifted abruptly at anatomical borders: motor areas showed sharper tuning and more linear relationships with target location, whereas somatosensory areas displayed more heterogeneous response patterns. Neural response properties also differed according to somatotopic representation. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction of the neural feature matrix revealed that areas varied in their average response profiles, but also that each area contained subpopulations. Neurons in each subpopulation had characteristic response profiles and were distributed across multiple cortical areas. The spatial distributions of the subpopulations overlapped, with neurons from different subpopulations salt-and-pepper intermingled in the overlap zones. Together, these results describe activity structure across sensorimotor cortex and identify several distinct but spatially-overlapping subpopulations with characteristic activity patterns during reach-to-grasp behavior.

                The spinal cord connects the brain to peripheral systems. Yet its integration with cerebral networks remains a key neuroscience question. Capturing structural and functional central nervous system (CNS) changes throughout the lifespan is essential for characterizing healthy and pathological aging. Leveraging a unique multimodal dataset combining spinal and cerebrospinal imaging, we jointly mapped the spinal cord structural and functional architecture across adulthood. Our results revealed age-related changes across these modalities and identified organizational principles shared with the brain. These changes were most pronounced in the somatosensory pathway, with microstructural decline coupled to shifts in functional connectivity and local spontaneous activity as aging progresses. Extending analyses to the brain uncovered convergent CNS-wide aging mechanisms, including gray matter loss, functional dedifferentiation, and increased spontaneous activity, highlighting shared neural aging trajectories. Together, our findings provide a systems-level view of alterations with age and lay the groundwork for early biomarkers of sensorimotor decline.

">Hippocampal multi-layered RNAseq prioritizes oligodendrocyte dysfunction over immune-driven neuroinflammation in neurolupus pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is a severe manifestation of lupus marked by cognitive and mood disorders, yet its hippocampal molecular underpinnings remain poorly understood. Here, we provide a region-specific transcriptomic map of the hippocampus in MRL/Lpr mice --a validated NPSLE model-- compared to MRL+/+ controls. Bulk RNA-seq combined with integrative analyses (e.g. differential expression, GSEA, WGCNA, cell-type deconvolution) uncovered a robust disease-specific signature centered on oligodendrocyte dysfunction and myelination failure. Key myelin-related genes (Mbp, Plp1, Mog) and lineage-defining transcription factors (Sox10, Nkx6-2, Olig2) were repressed, while OPC markers remained unchanged, indicating a maturation blockade rather than lineage loss. Gene set enrichment highlighted widespread suppression of oligodendrocyte differentiation, axon ensheathment, and Wnt/retinoic acid signaling, alongside dysregulation of extracellular matrix components critical for axo-glial interactions. Co-expression network analysis revealed a disease-associated module enriched in myelination programs, with hub genes spanning structural, transcriptional, and adhesion-related functions. Deconvolution analysis confirmed a selective reduction of mature oligodendrocytes, contrasting with preserved neuronal populations and absence of classical astroglial or microglial activation signatures. RT-qPCR and Western blot validated the repression of myelination pathways at both mRNA and protein levels. Collectively, these findings challenge the inflammation-centric paradigm of NPSLE, revealing a cell-intrinsic vulnerability of the oligodendrocyte lineage. This conceptual shift --from immune-driven damage to impaired glial development-- redefines NPSLE pathogenesis and suggests novel therapeutic avenues targeting oligodendrocyte maturation and remyelination rather than focusing solely on immunosuppression.

">Common-specific edge-centric connectome across Four Episodes in Bipolar Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a heterogeneous psychiatric illness marked by dynamic mood states, including manic (BipM), depressive (BipD), mixed (mBD), and remitted (rBD) episodes. These clinical fluctuations are accompanied by widespread functional disruptions in the brain. However, the shared and individual specific neural mechanisms across distinct episodes of BD remain poorly understood. Methods: We analyzed resting state fMRI data from 190 participants (BD patients in four episodes and healthy controls) using edge centric functional connectomes (eFC), which capture time resolved cofluctuations between brain regions. A common orthogonal basis extraction (COBE) algorithm was applied to decompose individual eFC matrices into shared and individual specific subspaces. We characterized the spatial topology, genetic relevance, and circuit level correlates of the shared component. Dynamic properties (entropy, identifiability) and symptom prediction models were assessed using entropy metrics, intraclass correlation coefficients, and support vector regression. Results: The shared eFC pattern was stable across participants, aligned with the sensory association gradient, and exhibited significant heritability and test retest reliability . Entropy of individual loadings increased with illness duration and was significantly elevated in BD, particularly in mBD. Microcircuit modeling revealed that this shared pattern was inversely related to external input strength , indicating intrinsic network dominance. mBD was associated with globally elevated eFC entropy and markedly reduced fingerprint stability. Symptom severity (HDRS, YMRS, HAMA) was significantly predicted from individual network topographies across BD phases, highlighting clinically meaningful dynamic signatures. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that BD episodes are underpinned by a conserved functional scaffold and distinct individual specific neural fingerprints. Edge centric dynamics especially those derived from individual specific decompositions offer robust biomarkers for mood state characterization and symptom severity, and may facilitate future personalized interventions in BD.

">Improved interpretability in LFADS models using a learned, context-dependent per-trial bias</a></h4>

              
                The computation-through-dynamics perspective argues that biological neural circuits process information via the continuous evolution of their internal states. Inspired by this perspective, Latent Factor Activity using Dynamical systems (LFADS, Pandarinath et al., 2018) identifies a generative model consistent with the neural activity recordings. LFADS models neural dynamics with a recurrent neural network (RNN) generator, which results in excellent fit to the data. However, it has been difficult to understand the dynamics of the LFADS generator. In this work, we show that this poor interpretability arises in part because the generator implements complex, multi-stable dynamics. We introduce a simple modification to LFADS that ameliorates issues with interpretability by providing an inferred per-trial bias (modeled as a constant input) to the RNN generator, enabling it to contextually adapt a simpler dynamical system to individual trials. In both simulated neural recordings from pendulum oscillations and real recordings during arm movements in nonhuman primates, we observed that the standard LFADS learned complex, multi-stable dynamics, whereas the modified LFADS learned easier-to-understand contextual dynamics. This enabled direct analysis of the generator, which reproduced at a single-trial level previous results shown only through more complex analyses at the trial average. Finally, we applied the per-trial inferred bias LFADS model to human intracortical brain computer interface recordings during attempted finger movements and speech. We show that modifying neural dynamics using linear operations of the per-trial bias addresses non-stationarity and identifies the extent of behavioral variability, problems known to plague BCI. We call our modification to LFADS as "contextual LFADS".

">Brain-derived neurotrophic factor supports pericyte and vascular homeostasis in the aging brain</a></h4>

              
                Microvascular circulation in the brain is often impaired in connection with the loss of pericytes in old age. The neurotrophic factor BDNF also decreases in the aging brain. We hypothesized that BDNF regulates the homeostasis of cerebral pericytes and microvasculature. We used differently aged C57BL/6J mice, and C57BL6 mice with conditional knockout of Bdnf gene. Collagen IV-positive microvessels and PDGFR{beta}-positive pericytes in the brain were counted after immunological staining. Pericytes were also quantified by Western blot of PDGFR{beta} and CD13 in isolated cerebral microvessels. The level of BDNF and TrkB phosphorylation was determined in brain homogenates. To demonstrate the direct effect of BDNF on pericytes, TrkB and pericytes were co-stained in brain tissue, single-cell sequencing and transcriptomic analysis were used to identify and characterize Ntrk2-expressing pericytes, and TrkB was also detected in the pericyte cell line by Western blot. Cultured pericytes were further treated with recombinant BDNF in the presence and absence of an Akt inhibitor and examined for PDGFR{beta} expression. The length and branching of microvessels and pericytes decreased in conjunction with the reduction in mature BDNF and TrkB phosphorylation in aging brains. Deficiency of BDNF in neurons or astrocytes was sufficient to reduce cerebral microvessels, PDGFR{beta} and CD13 concentrations and Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in isolated blood vessels. A subset of pericytes in the brain and cultured pericytes expressed TrkB. BDNF treatment increased PDGFR{beta} expression along with Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in cultured cells. The effect of BDNF on PDGFR{beta} expression was abolished by treatment with Akt inhibitor. Therefore, BDNF induces the expression of PDGFR{beta} and CD13 by activating Akt signaling in pericytes, promoting the homeostasis of pericytes and microvasculature in the aging brain. Our study identified a BDNF-mediated mechanism that regulates microvascular integrity in the aged brain.

">Disrupted emotional resilience and neurovisceral integration in early small vessel disease</a></h4>

              
                Background Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a major cause of cognitive decline and late-life depression, yet its early affective markers are poorly understood. Ageing is typically associated with enhanced emotion regulation, including greater differentiation of affective states and a shift toward positivity. Whether SVD disrupts these resilience mechanisms before overt clinical impairment is unknown. Methods Eighty-two adults were studied: young (n=22) and middle-aged (n=23) adults without brain abnormalities, and middle-aged adults with early SVD (n=37). Participants completed an ecologically grounded social emotion fMRI paradigm and self-report questionnaires of interoceptive and emotional awareness. Group differences in emotional differentiation, positivity, and neurovisceral integration were analysed to assess the effects of healthy ageing and early SVD. Results Compared with young adults, middle-aged adults without SVD showed preserved emotional differentiation, positivity bias, and intact neurovisceral integration. In contrast, early SVD was associated with reduced emotional differentiation, loss of the age-related positivity effect, and altered insular encoding of arousal. Impaired neurovisceral integration translated into diminished heart rate adaptation during sustained emotional processing. Self-report alexithymia ratings and interoceptive profiles further indicated reduced emotional awareness and embodied self-regulation in adults with SVD. These effects persisted after adjustment for cognition, cardiovascular risk factors, depression, and anxiety. Conclusions Early SVD is associated with affective-interoceptive disintegration evident across behavioural, neural, and physiological levels. Altered embodied regulation of emotion may constitute an early marker of vascular brain injury and a target for preventative interventions.

">Dim light at night impacts circadian rhythms and Alzheimer's disease-like neuroinflammation and neuropathology in humanized APP SAA knock-in mice</a></h4>

              
                Artificial light at night (light pollution) is widespread but understudied in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sleep and circadian disruption have been linked to amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) accumulation and neuroinflammation, but whether dim light at night (dLAN) modifies these processes remains unclear. We tested whether chronic dLAN exposure (8 lux during the dark phase, 8 weeks) alters circadian rhythms, amyloid pathology, and neuroinflammation in 12-13 month-old humanized APP knock-in (KI) mice. hAPPSAA KI mice, which develop plaques, were compared with hAPPWT KI controls carrying only a humanized APP sequence. dLAN reduced circadian rhythm amplitude and stability while increasing fragmentation in both genotypes within two weeks. In hAPPSAA KI mice, dLAN modestly increased hippocampal plaque burden and soluble neocortical A{beta}. Astrocyte reactivity was elevated by genotype but not altered by nighttime light exposure. In contrast, microglial markers (CD45, MHCII) were increased with dLAN with CD45+ area elevated in hippocampus, and MHCII+ cell counts greater in the cortex and hippocampus of hAPPSAA KI mice. There were also distinct spatial responses between the microglia markers suggesting that dLAN primes microglia toward an antigen-presenting phenotype (MHCII) in the presence of A{beta}. Yet, the microglia/macrophage priming was not associated with amplified cytokine or chemokine levels at the 8-week dLAN exposure timepoint in the brain. These findings add to growing evidence that nighttime light exposure can disrupt circadian and immune regulation, and suggest that environmental light pollution should be further explored as a modifiable factor contributing to Alzheimer's disease progression.

">Temporal Dynamics of Flexible Cognitive Control</a></h4>

              
                In dynamic environments, flexible cognitive control adaptively adjusts processing through proactive mechanisms deployed in advance and reactive mechanisms engaged upon conflict. Previous studies have primarily focused on identifying neural networks supporting specific control components, while less is known about how multiple components interact over time to support adaptive control. To characterize these temporal dynamics, we combined EEG recordings with a face-word Stroop paradigm under changing conflict environment. A hierarchical Bayesian model was used to estimate trial-wise learning rate, predicted conflict level, and prediction error, providing computational indices of cognitive control flexibility. Neural correlation analysis revealed that these variables correlated with Theta, Alpha, and Beta oscillations in distinct brain regions. Connectivity analysis among these regions indicated enhanced cross-frequency directional interactions triggered by stimuli. Furthermore, connections reflecting updates to predicted conflict level prior to stimulus onset indexed individual strength in proactive control, while connections reflecting learning rate updates after stimulus onset indexed reactive control. These findings highlight how oscillatory dynamics coordinate multiple control components and provide new insight into how proactive and reactive control emerge as distinct modes within this interconnected neural architecture of flexible cognitive control.

">Homeostatic Binary Networks: A simple framework for learning with overlapping patterns</a></h4>

              
                Memories are rarely stored in isolation: experiences overlap in time and context, leading to neuronal activity patterns that share elements across episodes. While such overlap supports generalization and abstraction, it also increases interference and threatens representational stability. Here we introduce Homeostatic Binary Networks (HBNs), a minimal recurrent framework that combines binary activity, adjustable inhibition, Hebbian learning, and homeostatic plasticity to address these challenges. First, we formalize an Episode Generation Protocol (EGP) that creates compositional episodes with controllable overlap and noise, and define a corresponding semantic structure as conditional probabilities between concepts. We then show analytically and through simulations that recurrent synapses converge to conditional firing probabilities, thereby encoding asymmetric semantic relationships across concepts. These recurrent dynamics enable reliable recall and replay of overlapping episodes without representational collapse. Finally, by incorporating feed-forward plasticity with a neuronal maturity mechanism, output neurons form selective receptive fields in a one-shot manner and refine them through replay, yielding robust unsupervised classification of overlapping episodes. Together, our results demonstrate how simple principles such as neural and synaptic competition can support the stable representation and organization of overlapping memories, providing a mechanistic bridge between episodic and semantic structure in memory systems.

">Adults up to 80 years old maintain effective movement planning when facing complex body dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Aging can significantly impact motor performance, especially in highly complex tasks such as multi-joint movements where the nervous system needs to adequately coordinate mechanical interactions between joints. This coordination is inherently challenging for the brain. Effective coordination of multiple joints relies on intact feedforward control to predict movement dynamics in the initial phase of the movement, and on feedback control to fine-tune the execution in the final phase. However, the effect of aging on these specific control mechanisms remains controversial. In our experiment we investigated a pure elbow motion task using the KINARM exoskeleton. A group of 50 young (20-35 years old), 80 old (55-70 years old) and 30 older-old (80+ years old) healthy participants were recruited. Each participant performed 30deg elbow rotations while stabilizing the shoulder joint. Movements were directed toward two distinct targets in both flexion and extension directions. The task was performed under two controlled speed conditions to maximally challenge the motor system, as higher elbow velocities increase interaction torques at the shoulder, demanding greater neuromuscular effort for stabilization. The timing and magnitude of anticipatory EMG activity of the agonist shoulder muscle, necessary to counteract interaction torques, were preserved across all age groups. Moreover, increasing elbow velocity did not result in any performance differences between young and older old adults, indicating that shoulder stabilization during movement initiation remained intact with age. However, older adults exhibited reduced ability to stabilize the shoulder position until the end of the movement, leading to decreased reaching accuracy with older age. These results suggest that feedforward control, essential for movement planning, which is essential for shoulder stabilization during initiation, is preserved during healthy aging and remains resilient to increased motor demands, even in older old adults. In contrast, feedback control appears to deteriorate with age, potentially contributing to reduced movement precision in the final phase of the multi-joint movement.

">Representations in the hippocampal-entorhinal system emerge from learning sensory predictions</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampal formation and adjacent parahippocampal areas are central to intelligent behaviour such as memory and navigation. Understanding how systems in the brain generate structured representations from experience remains a fundamental goal in neuroscience. A central open question is whether a single computational principle can account for the diverse neural responses observed across the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit. Existing models often rely on hand-crafted features or specialized learning mechanisms unrelated to sensory observations, and typically express representations of only a small subset of known cell types. Further, representations learned in such models are often not empirically evaluated against neural representations observed in the navigating brain. Here, we introduce a neurobiologically-inspired and robust computational model in which diverse cell types emerge from a single learning objective with minimal hand-engineered assumptions. Our model applies contrastive graph representation learning to transitions between high-dimensional visual observations, constructing a metric space in which temporally adjacent sensory observations are mapped to nearby states. Inspired by the anatomical information flow of the hippocampal-entorhinal system, and anchored in output representations based on neural coding in the entorhinal cortex, the model gives rise to activity resembling place cells, grid cells, boundary vector cells, band cells, corner cells, and conjunctive cells among others. Across varied environments and sensory streams, the framework captures not only diverse neural response patterns but also the functional dependencies between them, mirroring the proposed sequential representational structure observed in the hippocampal-entorhinal system. Crucially, place-cell-like features of the model quantitatively reproduce remapping dynamics observed in CA1 of freely moving animals, and afford theoretical explanatory power of existing neurobiologically-informed models. This work thus offers a unified computational model of spatial coding in the hippocampal-entorhinal system and a testable framework for generating mechanistic hypotheses in silico, to be evaluated in vivo.

">Highly Correlated Activity across Higher-Order Thalamic Nuclei in Awake and Anesthetized States</a></h4>

              
                Higher-order (HO) thalamic nuclei are enigmatic. Unlike first-order thalamic regions which are known to primarily relay sensory signals to the neocortex, the functions of HO thalamic nuclei remain far less clear. Although previous studies indicate HO thalamic nuclei influence cortical processing and consciousness, most studies examined single nuclei in isolation. To investigate the effect of conscious state across nuclei, we simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA) across multiple thalamic nuclei in awake and anesthetized mice during sensory stimulation. The effect of voluntary locomotion was also studied in the awake state. Surprisingly, we found that LFP traces were strongly correlated across HO nuclei in both states, which cannot be explained by volume conduction alone, suggesting the existence of shared synaptic inputs. Anesthesia significantly reduced MUA across HO nuclei, while in the awake state locomotion and sensory stimuli activated many nuclei, including those that have not classically been regarded as sensory or motor. Moreover, we found that sensory responses of HO nuclei depended on the sensory modality and conscious state of the animal. These findings challenge the classical view of the higher-order thalamus being the aggregate of isolated, independent nuclei.

">Integrative lipidomics of brain and plasma uncovers sex-specific metabolic signatures in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Lipid dysregulation is increasingly recognized as a key feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). A central unresolved question, however, is whether lipidomic signatures identified in accessible peripheral biofluids faithfully recapitulate the pathogenic alterations within the central nervous system (CNS). This gap impedes the development of reliable biomarkers and constrains a comprehensive understanding of PD pathophysiology. To address this challenge, we employed a cross-species lipidomic approach. We modeled PD in both male and female mice by injecting human -synuclein preformed fibrils into the substantia nigra. Three months post-injection, lipidomic profiles of the midbrain and plasma were generated and compared. These findings were further validated in plasma from male and female PD patients and age-matched controls, enabling the identification of conserved alterations. We identified shared dysregulation of sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, and fatty acids in the brains and plasma of diseased mice as well as in plasma from PD patients. Notably, lipids associated with lipid droplet biogenesis, including triacylglycerols and monoacylglycerols, were elevated in diseased mouse brains and patient plasma. These alterations coincided with a marked accumulation of lipid droplets in the mouse midbrain and were further corroborated by increased lipid droplet abundance in macrophages derived from PD patients. Interestingly, lipid droplet accumulation exhibited sex-specific patterns: male mice displayed greater microglial accumulation, whereas female mice showed enhanced neuronal deposition. Together, these findings demonstrate that peripheral lipidomic signatures reflect CNS pathology in PD, highlighting new opportunities for biomarker discovery and therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, sex-specific lipid droplet accumulation in innate immune cells and neurons implicates these pathways as mechanistic contributors to PD and underscores the necessity of sex-stratified strategies in biomarker discovery and disease modeling.

">Suppressing cortical glutamatergic neurons produces paradoxical interictal discharges and seizures</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Seizures are traditionally attributed to excessive excitation or deficient inhibition, yet recent clinical and slice data show they can also paradoxically arise when inhibition outweighs excitation. We chemogenetically suppressed neocortical glutamatergic neurons to test whether such suppression elicits epileptic activity in vivo. Methods: CaMKII-driven Gi-coupled hM4Di or Gq-coupled hM3Dq Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADDs) were expressed in cortical glutamatergic neurons of Rasgrf2-jGCaMP8m and wildtype C57BL/6J mice. Widefield calcium imaging and 32-channel transparent electrocorticography were performed before and after systemic clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 1.25 ~ 5 mg/kg). Results: DREADD activation induced intermittent, large-amplitude, synchronized calcium transients confined to the CaMKII-hM4Di focus, accompanied by focal ECoG spikes that persisted for >3 h and sometimes evolved into seizures. By contrast, CNO activation of excitatory neurons via CaMKII-hM3Dq DREADDs desynchronized activity without epileptiform discharges. The same process duplicated in wild-type animals provoked similar epileptiform discharges. Conclusion: Selective suppression of excitation can paradoxically drive cortical networks into hypersynchronous, epileptic states, challenging the simple excess-excitation model of ictogenesis. These findings highlight that seizures may result from relative inhibitory dominance, and that considering this excess inhibition mechanism could inspire new therapeutic approaches.

">Delayed protective effect of chronic variable stress on optic tract axonal degeneration after experimental TBI</a></h4>

              
                Of the 2.8 million individuals who seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year, nearly 300,000 require hospitalization, with up to 60% of these needing intensive care. Intensive care treatment of TBI involves stressful events such as sleep disruption, noise, and painful procedures, potentially leading to chronic stress in patients undergoing such treatment. Given that physiologic stress can exacerbate neuroinflammation and impair normal neural function, we hypothesized that chronic variable stress (CVS) following TBI would exacerbate behavioral and pathological outcomes. We tested this hypothesis by subjecting adolescent male mice to blunt TBI, followed by two weeks of CVS or control conditions. We assessed brain pathologic responses to injury 2-, 5-, 20-, and 28-weeks post-injury. We found chronic optic tract degeneration by Fluoro-jade B staining in TBI groups. Unexpectedly, CVS+TBI mice did not show evidence of optic tract axon degeneration 20 weeks after injury, but did at the other time points. CVS led to increased microglial phagocytic markers early after injury, regardless of TBI status, and TBI led to increased microglial phagocytic markers in a delayed fashion as well. Notably, microglial phagocytosis markers were not elevated in TBI+CVS groups compared to TBI only groups 20 weeks post-injury. There was no effect of TBI or CVS on behavioral measures taken at the end of CVS. These findings suggest a delayed, but not permanent, protective effect on axonal degeneration after TBI, potentially related to altered microglial and astrocytic phagocytic activity.

">Mapping function in the tree shrew visual system using functional ultrasound imaging.</a></h4>

              
                We adapted functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) for awake, head-fixed northern tree shrews and used it to produce brain-wide functional maps of visual processing at ~100 microns spatial resolution and ~100 ms temporal resolution. Using classical retinotopic stimuli, full-field noise, motion localizers, and object versus scrambled object contrasts, we demonstrate robust, spatially specific hemodynamic responses across primary and extrastriate visual cortex, superior colliculus and subcortical structures. fUSI reliably reveals retinotopic reversals, laterality, and stimulus-selective modules, and yields high signal-to-noise %CBV changes that enable single-session mapping and targeting of electrophysiology or perturbations. These mesoscale maps provide a systems-level complement to recent high-density electrophysiological surveys of tree shrew visual cortex, which reported a compressed ventral-stream hierarchy and surprisingly early emergence of object coding in V2 (Lanfranchi et al., 2025). Together, our results establish fUSI as a powerful, scalable tool for brain-wide functional mapping in the tree shrew, bridging large-scale circuit measurement and single-neuron electrophysiology and accelerating this species utility as a bridge between rodent genetics and primate vision.

">Progressive Loss of Astrocytic AIBP Expression during Alzheimer's Disease Pathology</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes and microglia play crucial roles in mediating neuroinflammation during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. ApoA-I binding protein (APOA1BP, also known as AIBP/NAXE) attenuates neuroinflammation by blocking amyloid {beta}-induced TLR4 inflammaraft formation and oxidative stress. Apoa1bp knockout in APP/PS1 mice exacerbates microgliosis, increases amyloid plaque burden, neuronal cell loss, and reduces survival at 6 months. Although APOA1BP mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in humans, its cell-type-specific distribution in the brain remains unclear. To examine AIBP protein expression in the human brain, we performed immunohistochemistry on hippocampal sections from postmortem brain specimens from subjects aged 75-96 of both sexes. Using GFAP and IBA1 to label astrocytes and microglia, respectively, we found that AIBP protein was highly expressed in astrocytes, but not in microglia. Stratification of subjects by Braak stage (I-II, III-IV, V-VI) revealed a progressive decline in astrocytic AIBP expression with advancing AD pathology. Meta-analysis of RNA-seq profiling indicated enriched Apoa1bp expression in adult mouse astrocytes. Systemic Apoa1bp knockout in the APP/PS1 mouse exacerbated astrogliosis. These findings demonstrate that AIBP is predominantly expressed in astrocytes and its expression declines with AD progression, suggesting a potential role for AIBP in astrocyte-mediated neuroprotection and AD pathogenesis.

">Olfactory proteomics reveals the capacity of the HDAC1 inhibitor pyroxamide to halt the α-synuclein preformed fibrils-induced damage in nasal epithelial, microglial and dopaminergic neuronal cell lines</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder mainly characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons originating in the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta and projecting to other brain regions, giving rise to motor and non-motor symptoms. Despite significant progress in understanding the molecular and cellular disruptions associated with PD, there remains an unmet clinical need for effective therapies. In this study, proteomic analysis of the olfactory tract (OT) in controls with no known neurological history (n=17) and PD subjects (n=21) revealed Lewy body disease (LBD) stage-dependent proteostatic impairment, accompanied by progressive modulation of the alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) functional interactome. Differential OT omic profiles (OMS) were used in a computational drug repurposing approach, reveling the HDAC1 inhibitor pyroxamide as one of the top drug candidates with in silico potential to restore altered OMS. To explore the potential therapeutic effects of pyroxamide, in vitro assays were performed using alpha-syn preformed fibrils (PFFs). Pyroxamide treatment reduced alpha-syn PFFs-induced toxicity in olfactory epithelial, microglial and dopaminergic neuronal cell lines, producing a protective effect against hydrogen peroxide-induced damage exclusively in brain-derived cell types. These findings confirm the suitability of omics profiles in drug repurposing workflows against PD, offering valuable insights into the potential of HDAC1 inhibitors in the therapeutic pipeline of PD.

">Patient-specific functional brain architecture explains cortical patterns of tau PET in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                The spatial distribution of tau pathology, the core driver of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD), varies markedly across individuals. While tau is thought to spread along brain networks, the role of inter-individual variability in shaping these patterns remains underexplored. Using resting-state fMRI and tau- PET from 805 participants across the AD continuum, we studied whether subject-specific functional connectivity (FC) profiles enhance the characterization of tau deposition patterns. A hybrid approach integrating individual and group- average FC outperformed both alone, particularly in symptomatic individuals and at finer spatial resolutions, the latter underscoring a critical but often overlooked role of spatial scale. Individualized FC also better captured individual tau topographies than canonical tau-PET maps derived from cohort-level data. These effects were specific to tau, and not seen for {beta}-amyloid, and their predictive power increased with spatial granularity. Furthermore, baseline FC also predicted future tau accumulation at the individual level, supporting its prognostic value. Together, these findings provide strong evidence that individual functional brain architecture shapes tau propagation in humans, supporting the network spread hypothesis by showing that variability in connectivity translates into heterogeneity in tau distribution. This work advances biological understanding of tau propagation in AD, highlighting functional connectivity as a mechanistic substrate that supports prognostic assessment of tau trajectories.

                Background Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common gastrointestinal emergency with unpredictable clinical progression. Early identification of severe cases is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality. The Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), a marker of systemic inflammation, has emerged as a potential prognostic tool. This study investigates the utility of NLR in assessing AP severity using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017–2018 cycle. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,250 NHANES participants diagnosed with AP. Descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis (EDA) summarized demographic and clinical variables, including age, BMI, WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and NLR. Chi-square and t-tests assessed associations between variables and disease severity. Logistic regression identified independent predictors. Three machine learning models Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost were trained to classify AP severity. Feature importance and performance metrics were evaluated. Results NLR was significantly higher in severe AP (p < 0.001) and correlated with WBC (r = 0.62) and lymphocytes (r = -0.55). Logistic regression confirmed NLR as a strong predictor (OR = 2.43). Random Forest and XGBoost models showed superior performance, with XGBoost achieving an F1-score of 0.91. Feature importance ranked NLR, WBC, and triglycerides among top predictors. Conclusion NLR is a clinically relevant, low-cost biomarker that enhances early severity prediction in AP. Combined with machine learning, it provides robust risk stratification to aid clinical decision-making.

                This policy brief explores possible itineraries towards teachers’ satisfaction, and students’ performance through remuneration, morale, and learning in Uganda’s government secondary schools. The satisfaction of teachers is a key determinant of the performance of students in government secondary schools in Uganda. The existing remuneration packages do not mostly fulfil the needs of educators. Therefore, teacher morale is low, hence reduced effectiveness in teaching. Educational policies can only be effective if they take cognizance of the relationship between teacher remuneration, their job satisfaction, and student output. It is, therefore, imperative for policymakers to come up with holistic strategies addressing these interrelated factors in a bid to enhance the quality of education that is being dispensed. The government should increase investment in teacher salaries. It should also set up a fund for performance-based incentives and regular professional development training that will empower teachers and put them in high spirits. Stakeholders’ collaboration between educational institutions and the local community is also highly welcome for an environment among educators. Raising the issue of pay and morale leads to better output, and targeted policy pathways create room for the government to have a happy teaching workforce, raising students’ performances, which will trickle down for long periods

Participants were selected via purposive sampling. Data were collected using three standardized questionnaires: the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) [5], the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) [9], and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) [12]. Data were analyzed using both univariate (ANOVA) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Results The results indicated a significant difference between the two groups across all measured variables (p < 0.05). Patients with GI disorders reported significantly higher levels of perceived stress and neuroticism. Conversely, healthy controls scored significantly higher on the other four personality traits: extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness as well as on all components of resilience (personal competence, trust in instincts, tolerance of negative affect, positive acceptance of change, and spiritual influences). Conclusion The findings suggest that psychological factors, including specific personality traits and lower resilience, are significantly associated with GI disorders. Integrating psychological assessments and interventions, such as stress management and resilience training, into the standard care for patients with GI conditions is strongly recommended.

A cohort study. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a skin disease, but its clinical impact is systemic with more than 30% of patients suffering from other allergic diseases and mental health disorders. Early disease control could prevent the development of comorbidities or reduce the severity of the condition. Topical treatments, such as skin moisturizers, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, have proven to be effective in achieving clinical control in AD; However, sustained improvement is observed in approximately 50–70% of patients, depending on disease severity, treatment adherence, and individual response. Early detection of patients with a low probability of response to topical treatment would help start with other therapies and improve the quality of life of patients. Several clinical and laboratory biomarkers have been proposed to predict the prognosis of AD. In this study, we present a protocol for developing a model to predict the clinical response of AD patients to topical treatment. To achieve this goal, a cohort study will be performed for the prognostic model using the following steps: 1. Selection of predictive variables for the model 2. Evaluation of the quality of the collected data and control of lost data 3. Data statistical management 4. Strategies to select the variables to include at the end of the model 5. Evaluation of the performance of different possible models (predictive accuracy) 6. selection of the best model. 7. Validation The performance and internal validation of the model will be assessed, and if high diagnostic performance is confirmed, external validation will be justified to assess its clinical impact ( Figure 1).

                Background This study investigates the psychological and technological factors influencing the utilization of mental health applications among medical students at Umm Al-Qura University in the holy city of Makkah, Saudi Arabia, The study aims to evaluate the prevalence, perceptions, and barriers related to mental health applications usage, identify demographic and psychological factors influencing their adoption, and estimate the prevalence of mental health conditions among undergraduate medical students at Umm Al-Qura University in 2024. Methods A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted at Umm Al-Qura University among 255 undergraduate medical students using a simple random sampling technique. Data were collected through a validated, self-administered (English) online questionnaire adapted from a previously published study. The questionnaire assessed sociodemographic characteristics, smartphone usage, mental health app use, and perceived barriers. The Statistical analysis included Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and logistic regression, performed using R software version 4.2.2. And confidentiality was strictly maintained. Results The SEM model exhibited an exemplary fit (CFI = 1.000, TLI = 1.029, RMSEA < 0.001, SRMR = 0.027). Cognitive Influence was significantly represented by variables such as the perceived importance of mental health and awareness of available resources. In contrast, neither Social Influence nor Technology Compatibility exhibited significant predictive pathways to Cognitive Influence. The covariance between Social Influence and Technology Compatibility was significant (p = 0.011), suggesting a potential indirect relationship. Observed variables, including “Technology helps positively” and “Peer influence item,” demonstrated strong factor loadings (p < 0.001). Conclusion This research underscores the intricate interplay between psychological, technological, and demographic variables in the adoption of mental health applications. Interventions designed to enhance cognitive awareness and promote tailored application development may significantly improve uptake among medical students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1026/v1?src=rss">Antecedents of data analytics adoption: A systematic literature review from 2018-2024 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The rise of data analytics adoption has transformed multiple industries through technological advancements. However, utilizing big data analytics presents challenges that depend on adoption models used by individuals or organizations. Whilst numerous models on big data analytics exist, understanding the most influential theories shaping research in this domain remains limited. The study systematically explores the antecedents of data analytics adoption, aims to map the evolution of the field and uncover underexplored domains and integration gaps. Methods A rigorous systematic literature review of 43 peer-reviewed articles published between 2018 and 2024, collected mostly from Scopus and Web of Science databases, was conducted, employing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. Advanced bibliometric tools like VOSviewer and Microsoft Excel were employed to identify key trends, thematic clusters and integration gaps. Results The study reveals research concentration in manufacturing sectors and developed Asian countries. The review identifies five interconnected adoption dimensions: technological; organizational; environmental; individual; and data-related factors. The Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework dominates organizational-level studies, while the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) primarily guides individual-level investigations. Having identified five key research clusters, the review highlights that theoretical fragmentation persists between behavioral and resource-based perspectives. Conclusion This study synthesizes the theoretical model of big data analytics research, providing guidance for future researchers in selecting an appropriate theoretical framework, differentiating between individual and organizational adoption levels and identifying significant determinants for technology adoption studies.

                Background Leukemia, a heterogeneous group of blood cancers, poses significant challenges to global health due to its complexity, diverse risk factors, and variable outcomes. Accurate and early diagnosis is critical but remains a significant hurdle, particularly in low-resource settings. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and image processing offer transformative solutions to improve leukemia detection and classification, addressing limitations in traditional diagnostic methods. Methods This study systematically reviewed over 25,000 scientific articles sourced from Scopus, employing a PRISMA-guided methodology to ensure a comprehensive and rigorous analysis. The analysis focused on the application of AI, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in diagnosing four primary leukemia types: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It also examined global epidemiological trends, risk factors, and disparities in healthcare access. Results Key risk factors for leukemia include genetic syndromes like Down syndrome, environmental exposures to toxins such as benzene, ionizing radiation, and viral infections. Socio-economic disparities and geographical differences significantly impact leukemia incidence and outcomes. AI-based models, especially CNNs, demonstrated enhanced accuracy, speed, and reliability in diagnosing leukemia compared to traditional methods. However, challenges such as data variability, model scalability, and unequal access to AI technologies continue to hinder widespread adoption. Conclusion AI and image processing technologies hold immense potential to revolutionize leukemia diagnostics by enabling early detection, precise classification, and personalized treatment planning.

                <p>by Charlotte R. Taylor, Vincent Tse, Drew D. Willoughby, Maxine Levesque, Trisha V. Vaidyanathan, Jeanne T. Paz, Kira E. Poskanzer</p>

Classical neuromodulators regulate arousal states, spanning deep sleep to vigilant wakefulness, primarily by activating cortical neurons. However, cortical astrocytes also express neuromodulatory G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). While astrocytic noradrenergic receptors have been shown to modulate two critical regulators of arousal—cortical synchrony and extracellular adenosine levels—how other neuromodulatory signaling pathways similarly shape arousal remains unclear. Astrocytes in mammalian cortex express particularly high levels of the wake-promoting, Gq-coupled histamine-1-receptor (H1R), yet little is known about how astrocytic H1R contributes to regulation of arousal. To address this gap, we used pharmacological and genetic approaches in murine cortex to test how astrocyte-H1R signaling affects astrocyte calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), cortical neural activity across sleep/wake, and extracellular adenosine—an astrocytic output that regulates cortical arousal. Using ex vivo two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in acute cortical slices, we show that H1R mediates cell-autonomous astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to histamine (HA) and attenuates responses to norepinephrine (NE). Next, in vivo fiber photometry and electrophysiology results show that H1R deletion in cortical astrocytes disrupts local astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> during wake and extracellular adenosine dynamics specifically around REM sleep transitions, when HA release is minimal. Further, astrocyte-specific H1R deletion in cortex promotes wakefulness and reduces REM sleep time. Our results indicate that H1R activity modulates astrocyte responses to non-histaminergic inputs by inducing lasting changes in astrocyte physiology that modulate extracellular adenosine and REM sleep. Our findings contribute to an emerging model in which neuromodulator GPCRs synergistically shape astrocyte physiology to regulate arousal behavior and adenosine signaling in the cortex.

                This essay compares how Ngugi wa Thiong’o and Abdulrazak Gurnah, two leading East African writers, represent postcolonial identity and historical trauma through fiction. It examines their contrasting approaches to literary resistance: Ngugi embraces radical language politics and collective cultural reclamation, while Gurnah employs narrative ambiguity, exile experiences, and linguistic hybridity. The analysis reveals how intergenerational trauma operates in their works, with memory functioning as a morally charged force shaping identity and narrative authority. Despite their differences, Ngugi prioritizing political clarity and revolutionary consciousness, Gurnah exploring subtle psychological details and narrative dissonance, both authors demonstrate literature’s ethical power to contest historical erasure and reimagine postcolonial futures with compassion and complexity.

                Castelli et al. identify two ripple profiles in hippocampal CA1. Radsink ripples integrate superficial- and deep-sublayer pyramidal cells into dense, higher-dimensional coactivity motifs that stably reactivate recent waking experience during sleep. LMsink ripples primarily recruit deep-sublayer cells into sparse, lower-dimensional motifs that gradually drift from reactivating prior toward recent representations.

                Kamath et al. examine the neural mechanism by which hunger makes animals take more risks. They show that hunger neurons in the hypothalamus suppress threat and salience-related dopamine signals in the tail of the striatum during bouts of novelty exploration and risk assessment.

                Jia et al. develop SCOPE-C, a method to map open chromatin and associated chromatin loops from low-input samples. Applying it to the fetal cortex of humans, macaques, and mice, they show that human excitatory neurons form extended enhancer-promoter networks, enriched with human-biased enhancers and neurodevelopmental disorder SNPs, compared with those of other species.

                Zan et al. have identified a neuroglial microcircuit within the central amygdala modulating anxiety symptoms comorbid with chronic pain through astrocytes. They find that pain induces dynorphin release by activating the CeLPdyn-CeM microcircuit. Dynorphin activates astrocytes by acting on kappa receptors to increase CeM neuron excitability by releasing gliotransmitter.
