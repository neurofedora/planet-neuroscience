              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Cross‐hierarchical plasticity of corticofugal projections to dLGN after neonatal monocular enucleation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Perception is the result of interactions between the sensory periphery, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. Inputs from the retina project to the first-order dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which projects to the primary visual cortex (V1). In return, the cortex innervates the thalamus. While layer 6 projections innervate all thalamic nuclei, cortical layer 5 neurons selectively project to the higher-order lateral posterior nucleus (LP) and not to dLGN. It has been demonstrated that a subpopulation of layer 5 (Rbp4-Cre+) projections rewires to dLGN after monocular (Grant et al., 2016) or binocular enucleation (Frangeul et al., 2016) in young postnatal mice. However, the exact cortical regional origin of these projections was not fully determined, and it remained unclear whether these changes persisted into adulthood. In this study, we report gene expression changes observed in the dLGN after monocular enucleation at birth using microarray, qPCR at P6 and in situ hybridisation at P8. We report that genes that are normally enriched in dLGN, but not LP during development are preferentially downregulated in dLGN following monocular enucleation. Comparisons with developmental gene expression patters in dLGN suggest more immature and delayed gene expression in enucleated dLGN. Combined tracing and immuno-histochemical analysis revealed that the induced layer 5 fibres that innervate enucleated dLGN originate from putative primary visual cortex and they retain increased VGluT1+ synapse formation into adulthood. Our results indicate a new form of plasticity when layer 5 driver input takes over the innervation of an originally first order thalamic nucleus after early sensory deficit.</p>

                <p>The major pathology in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) is neuron injury induced by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and the activation of microglial cells. The objective of this study is to determine the effect and mechanism of miR-132-3p in regulating neuroinflammation and the degeneration of dopaminergic neuron in PD. The expressions of miR-132-3p in brain tissues of PD patients, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2 cells and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse models were detected. The effect of miR-132-3p and GLRX in cell viability, apoptosis and inflammation was verified in BV-2 cells. The activation of Iba1 in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase were detected in PD mouse models and the mobility of mouse models was assessed as well. The targeting relationship between miR-132-3p and GLRX was confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Elevated expression of miR-132-3p and decreased expression of GLRX were found in PD patients and cells models. Overexpression of miR-132-3p can induce activation of microglial cells, which can be reversed by GLRX overexpression. Collected evidence in both cell model and mouse models showed the effect of miR-132-3p in enhancing the activation of microglial cells and the loss of microglia cells, which was achieved by mediating GLRX.</p>

                Mass spectrometry imaging is a promising tool complement to the histology study for evaluation of presence of different tissue types in the sample. To make this method faster, more accurate and precise we have presented earlier the cosine similarity measure maps (CSMM). The method provides the spatial distribution of cosine similarity measure metrics between chosen MSI pixel and the rest of the image. In cases when samples under test are heterogeneous and not guaranteed to have clear clusters with distinct borders, it is interesting to analyze the heterogeneity, area borders and their sensitivity to reference CSMM pixel selection. Here we present the software for interactive building of CSMM for different parameters, their visual analysis and saving such CSMM in publication-ready quality without additional programming. Source code, example datasets, binaries, and other information are available at https://github.com/EvgenyZhvansky/Interactive_CSMM.

                Cow's milk is currently the most consumed product worldwide. However, due to various direct and indirect contamination sources, different chemical and microbiological contaminants have been found in cow's milk. This review details the main contaminants found in cow's milk, referring to the sources of contamination and their impact on human health. A comparative approach highlights the poor efficacy and effects of the pasteurization process with other methods used in the treatment of cow's milk. Despite pasteurization and related techniques being the most widely applied to date, they have not demonstrated efficacy in eliminating contaminants. New technologies have appeared as alternative treatments to pasteurization. However, in addition to causing physicochemical changes in the raw material, their efficacy is not total in eliminating chemical contaminants, suggesting the need for new research to find a solution that contributes to improving food safety.

     alt="High associative neuron numbers could drive cognitive performance in corvid species"/>
<p>Corvids possess cognitive skills, matching those of nonhuman primates. Here we investigated the number of neurons and their distribution over six telencephalic areas in three corvid and three non-corvid species to check, if higher amounts of neurons in associative areas could drive cognitive performance in corvids. Indeed, neuron numbers in the associative mesopallium and nidopallium were twice as high in corvids in comparison to non-corvids possibly contributing to cognitive flexibility and complexity in these species.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Corvids possess cognitive skills, matching those of nonhuman primates. However, how these species with their small brains achieve such feats remains elusive. Recent studies suggest that cognitive capabilities could be based on the total numbers of telencephalic neurons. Here we extend this hypothesis further and posit that especially high neuron counts in associative pallial areas drive flexible, complex cognition. If true, avian species like corvids should specifically accumulate neurons in the avian associative areas meso- and nidopallium. To test the hypothesis, we analyzed the neuronal composition of telencephalic areas in corvids and noncorvids (chicken, pigeons, and ostriches—the species with the largest bird brain). The overall number of pallial neurons in corvids was much higher than in chicken and pigeons and comparable to those of ostriches. However, neuron numbers in the associative mesopallium and nidopallium were twice as high in corvids and, in correlation with these associative areas, the corvid subpallium also contained high neuron numbers. These findings support our hypothesis that large absolute numbers of associative pallial neurons contribute to cognitive flexibility and complexity and are key to explain why crows are smart. Since meso-/nidopallial and subpallial areas scale jointly, it is conceivable that associative pallio-striatal loops play a similar role in executive decision making as described in primates.</p>

     alt="Neural organization of the third optic neuropil, the lobula, in the highly visual semiterrestrial crab Neohelice granulata"/>
<p>The manuscript presents a detailed description, derived from Golgi-impregnated preparations, of the layered organization and the small columnar elements that compose the third optic neuropil, the lobula of a semiterrestrial crab.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The visual neuropils (lamina, medulla, and lobula complex) of malacostracan crustaceans and hexapods have many organizational principles, cell types, and functional properties in common. Information about the cellular elements that compose the crustacean lobula is scarce especially when focusing on small columnar cells. Semiterrestrial crabs possess a highly developed visual system and display conspicuous visually guided behaviors. In particular, <i>Neohelice granulata</i> has been previously used to describe the cellular components of the first two optic neuropils using Golgi impregnation technique. Here, we present a comprehensive description of individual elements composing the third optic neuropil, the lobula, of that same species. We characterized a wide variety of elements (140 types) including input terminals and lobula columnar, centrifugal, and input columnar elements. Results reveal a very dense and complex neuropil. We found a frequently impregnated input element (suggesting a supernumerary cartridge representation) that arborizes in the third layer of the lobula and that presents four variants each with ramifications organized following one of the four cardinal axes suggesting a role in directional processing. We also describe input elements with two neurites branching in the third layer, probably connecting with the medulla and lobula plate. These facts suggest that this layer is involved in the directional motion detection pathway in crabs. We analyze and discuss our findings considering the similarities and differences found between the layered organization and components of this crustacean lobula and the lobula of insects.</p>

                Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires mass immunization to control the symptoms and global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Data from developed countries reported a high prevalence of parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. However, parental vaccine hesitancy data in countries with low and middle income are scarce. The goal of this study was to assess the prevalence of parental vaccine hesitancy and identify subgroups with higher odds of vaccine hesitancy. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on parents of children aged <18 years from October 10, 2021, to October 31, 2021. Parents aged ≥18 years underwent face-to-face interviews in randomly selected places in Bangladesh using a vaccine hesitancy questionnaire. Predictors were identified using binary logistic regression analysis. Results: Data from 2633 eligible parents were analyzed. Overall, 42.8% reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy for their youngest child. The final model suggested that children's age, parent's age, religion, occupation, monthly household income, permanent address, living location, the status of tobacco use, adherence with the regular government vaccination programs (other than COVID-19), perception about COVID-19 vaccine efficacy among Bangladeshi children, self-vaccination intention, report about family members' illness or death from COVID-19, and perceived COVID-19 threat were the independent predictors of parental vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions: Vaccine hesitation varied based on sociodemographic characteristics, religion, behavior, and perceived COVID-19 threat. Therefore, interventions focused on addressing vaccine hesitancy among subgroups are warranted.

Although these therapies often result in remarkable improvements in infants and children, benefits in adults are modest and treatment is not curative. Concerns have been raised about the enormous costs of these medications, the ultimate burden to taxpayers, and the costs to society of withholding treatments and sacrificing or disadvantaging some individuals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The recursive-adaptive rental subscription model (R-ARSM) in the new normal: an application to the housing sector [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The last three decades have witnessed a remarkable transformation from a traditional billing system to a subscription model. Many organizations have adopted the subscription models especially in the service sectors like telecommunication, internet service providers, and satellite television operators. During the lockdown occasioned by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, people were forced to subscribe for their daily needs, and their lifestyle was altered, and people must reset to cope with the new normal. The new normal era has exposed many people to subscribe to what they could afford based on length of time and limited resources. Unexpected daily economic challenges emerged, and people relocated to affordable places which led to rent default, rent arrears, and refund requests. This paper focused on how to solve rent default, rent arrears, and refund request problems in the public and private housing sector. Methods: Relying on this, we proposed recursive-adaptive rental subscription models (R-ARSM) that could allow tenants options to subscribe for house rent with available resources. The R-ARSM concept mimics the internet subscription, mobile phone subscription, and satellite television subscription models whereby services to customers on annually, monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly rates are terminated when the subscribed amount elapses. Results: The model based on the penalty constant showed that it is a balanced model for both landlords and tenants in the housing sector. The R-ARSM showed promising results, it is time-dependent and indicates the tenant's available balance per period. Conclusions: The analysis revealed that the R-ARSM concept would solve refund requests and rent default problems if implemented.

Lutas et al. find that dopamine-triggered molecular signals in amygdala facilitate learning of the motivational salience of stimuli. Dopamine release weakens when salient events occur in rapid succession, limiting molecular signaling in amygdala neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Selective autophagy controls innate immune response through a TAK1/TAB2/SH3PX1 axis</a></h4>

              
                Tsapras et al. perform a yeast-two-hybrid screen to identify Atg8a-interacting proteins in Drosophila. They show that Atg8a interacts with TAK1 via an LIR motif. Atg8a also interacts with TAB2. TAB2 interacts with SH3PX1. Selective autophagic degradation of TAK1/TAB2 complex is fine-tuned by SH3PX1 to control innate immune responses.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Macrophages activated by hepatitis B virus have distinct metabolic profiles and suppress the virus via IL-1β to downregulate PPARα and FOXO3</a></h4>

              
                Li et al. show that HBV can stimulate macrophages to undergo M1- or M2-like polarization and reprogram mitochondrial metabolism. Both M1- and M2-like macrophages can suppress HBV gene expression and viral replication, with the former exhibiting a stronger effect, by releasing IL-1β to downregulate the transcription factors PPARα and FOXO3.

                Yang et al. show that HDAC3 and FOXK1 form a transcriptional complex to positively regulate STAT1/2 expression, which is required for the cascade activation of type I interferon response. Lysosomal degradation of FOXK1, reduction of type I interferon response, and impaired antiviral immunity are observed in HDAC3 knockout macrophages.

                H2-M is an MHCII peptide editor that selects for stable peptide-MHCII complexes. Ghosh et al. show that H2-M loss reduces plasma membrane p/MHCII:BCR association and BCR signal strength, highlighting a mechanism by which B-1a cell clonal selection and development directly depend on the functional association of H2-M with MHCII.

                Hunziker et al. reveal that, within minutes, influenza viruses reprogram host cells for infection by unraveling the global changes to the cellular phosphoproteome. These virus-induced changes result in formation of filopodia that enhance virus uptake. However, host cells can counteract this via the actin-remodeling protein cortactin to limit virus endocytosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Preexisting memory CD4 T cells in naïve individuals confer robust immunity upon hepatitis B vaccination</a></h4>

              
                Antigen recognition through the T cell receptor (TCR) αβ heterodimer is one of the primary determinants of the adaptive immune response. Vaccines activate naïve T cells with high specificity to expand and differentiate into memory T cells. However, antigen-specific memory CD4 T cells exist in unexposed antigen-naïve hosts. In this study, we use high-throughput sequencing of memory CD4 TCRβ repertoire and machine learning to show that individuals with preexisting vaccine-reactive memory CD4 T cell clonotypes elicited earlier and higher antibody titers and mounted a more robust CD4 T cell response to hepatitis B vaccine. In addition, integration of TCRβ sequence patterns into a hepatitis B epitope-specific annotation model can predict which individuals will have an early and more vigorous vaccine-elicited immunity. Thus, the presence of preexisting memory T cell clonotypes has a significant impact on immunity and can be used to predict immune responses to vaccination.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A low-tech, cost-effective and efficient method for safeguarding genetic diversity by direct cryopreservation of poultry embryonic reproductive cells</a></h4>

              
                Chickens are an important resource for smallholder farmers who raise locally adapted, genetically distinct breeds for eggs and meat. The development of efficient reproductive technologies to conserve and regenerate chicken breeds safeguards existing biodiversity and secures poultry genetic resources for climate resilience, biosecurity, and future food production. The majority of the over 1600 breeds of chicken are raised in low and lower to middle income countries under resource-limited, small-scale production systems, which necessitates a low-tech, cost-effective means of conserving diversity is needed. Here, we validate a simple biobanking technique using cryopreserved embryonic chicken gonads. The gonads are quickly isolated, visually sexed, pooled by sex, and cryopreserved. Subsequently, the stored material is thawed and dissociated before injection into sterile host chicken embryos. By using pooled GFP and RFP-labelled donor gonadal cells and Sire Dam Surrogate mating, we demonstrate that chicks deriving entirely from male and female donor germ cells are hatched. This technology will enable ongoing efforts to conserve chicken genetic diversity for both commercial and smallholder farmers, and to preserve existing genetic resources at poultry research facilities.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A genetic compensatory mechanism regulated by Jun and Mef2d modulates the expression of distinct class IIa Hdacs to ensure peripheral nerve myelination and repair</a></h4>

              
                The class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) have pivotal roles in the development of different tissues. Of this family, Schwann cells express <i>Hdac4</i>, <i>5</i> and <i>7</i> but not <i>Hdac9</i>. Here we show that a transcription factor regulated genetic compensatory mechanism within this family of proteins, blocks negative regulators of myelination ensuring peripheral nerve developmental myelination and remyelination after injury. Thus, when <i>Hdac4</i> and <i>5</i> are knocked-out from Schwann cells in mice, a JUN-dependent mechanism induces the compensatory overexpression of <i>Hdac7</i> permitting, although with a delay, the formation of the myelin sheath. When <i>Hdac4,5</i> and <i>7</i> are simultaneously removed, the Myocyte-specific enhancer-factor d (MEF2D) binds to the promoter and induces the <i>de novo</i> expression of <i>Hdac9</i>, and although several melanocytic lineage genes are misexpressed and Remak bundle structure is disrupted, myelination proceeds after a long delay. Thus, our data unveil a finely tuned compensatory mechanism within the class IIa <i>Hdac</i> family, coordinated by distinct transcription factors, that guarantees the ability of Schwann cells to myelinate during development and remyelinate after nerve injury.

                Basement membranes (BMs) are complex macromolecular networks underlying all continuous layers of cells. Essential components include collagen IV and laminins, which are affected by human genetic variants leading to a range of debilitating conditions including kidney, muscle, and cerebrovascular phenotypes. We investigated the dynamics of BM assembly in human pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids. We resolved their global BM composition and discovered a conserved temporal sequence in BM assembly that paralleled mammalian fetal kidneys. We identified the emergence of key BM isoforms, which were altered by a pathogenic variant in <i>COL4A5</i>. Integrating organoid, fetal and adult kidney proteomes we found dynamic regulation of BM composition through development to adulthood, and with single-cell transcriptomic analysis we mapped the cellular origins of BM components. Overall, we define the complex and dynamic nature of kidney BM assembly and provide a platform for understanding its wider relevance in human development and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Native proline-rich motifs exploit sequence context to target actin-remodeling Ena/VASP protein ENAH</a></h4>

              
                The human proteome is replete with short linear motifs (SLiMs) of four to six residues that are critical for protein-protein interactions, yet the importance of the sequence surrounding such motifs is underexplored. We devised a proteomic screen to examine the influence of SLiM sequence context on protein-protein interactions. Focusing on the EVH1 domain of human ENAH, an actin regulator that is highly expressed in invasive cancers, we screened 36-residue proteome-derived peptides and discovered new interaction partners of ENAH and diverse mechanisms by which context influences binding. A pocket on the ENAH EVH1 domain that has diverged from other Ena/VASP paralogs recognizes extended SLiMs and favors motif-flanking proline residues. Many high-affinity ENAH binders that contain two proline-rich SLiMs use a noncanonical site on the EVH1 domain for binding and display a thermodynamic signature consistent with the two-motif chain engaging a single domain. We also found that photoreceptor cilium actin regulator (PCARE) uses an extended 23-residue region to obtain a higher affinity than any known ENAH EVH1-binding motif. Our screen provides a way to uncover the effects of proteomic context on motif-mediated binding, revealing diverse mechanisms of control over EVH1 interactions and establishing that SLiMs can’t be fully understood outside of their native context.

                Fertility in female mammals, including mice and humans, is dependent on the presence of a zona pellucida (ZP) around growing oocytes and unfertilized eggs. A ZP is required to stabilize contacts between oocyte microvilli and follicle cell projections that traverse the ZP to form gap junctions that support the health of growing oocytes and developing follicles. In the absence of a ZP, due to inactivation or mutation of genes encoding ZP proteins, there is a loss of contacts between growing oocytes and neighboring follicle cells and a concomitant reduction in the production of ovulated eggs that results in female infertility.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Intrinsic mechanisms in the gating of resurgent Na+ currents</a></h4>

              
                The resurgent component of the voltage-gated sodium current (I<sub>NaR</sub>) is a depolarizing conductance, revealed on membrane hyperpolarizations following brief depolarizing voltage steps, which has been shown to contribute to regulating the firing properties of numerous neuronal cell types throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Although mediated by the same voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels that underlie the transient and persistent Nav current components, the gating mechanisms that contribute to the generation of I<sub>NaR</sub> remain unclear. Here, we characterized Nav currents in mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons, and used tailored voltage-clamp protocols to define how the voltage and the duration of the initial membrane depolarization affect the amplitudes and kinetics of I<sub>NaR</sub>. Using the acquired voltage-clamp data, we developed a novel Markov kinetic state model with parallel (fast and slow) inactivation pathways and, we show that this model reproduces the properties of the resurgent, as well as the transient and persistent, Nav currents recorded in (mouse) cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Based on the acquired experimental data and the simulations, we propose that resurgent Na<sup>+</sup> influx occurs as a result of fast inactivating Nav channels transitioning into an open/conducting state on membrane hyperpolarization, and that the decay of I<sub>NaR</sub> reflects the slow accumulation of recovered/opened Nav channels into a second, alternative and more slowly populated, inactivated state. Additional simulations reveal that extrinsic factors that affect the kinetics of fast or slow Nav channel inactivation and/or impact the relative distribution of Nav channels in the fast- and slow-inactivated states, such as the accessory Navβ4 channel subunit, can modulate the amplitude of I<sub>NaR</sub>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Urinary metabolic biomarkers of diet quality in European children are associated with metabolic health</a></h4>

              
                Urinary metabolic profiling is a promising powerful tool to reflect dietary intake and can help understand metabolic alterations in response to diet quality. Here, we used <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy in a multicountry study in European children (1147 children from 6 different cohorts) and identified a common panel of 4 urinary metabolites (hippurate, <i>N</i>-methylnicotinic acid, urea, and sucrose) that was predictive of Mediterranean diet adherence (KIDMED) and ultra-processed food consumption and also had higher capacity in discriminating children’s diet quality than that of established sociodemographic determinants. Further, we showed that the identified metabolite panel also reflected the associations of these diet quality indicators with C-peptide, a stable and accurate marker of insulin resistance and future risk of metabolic disease. This methodology enables objective assessment of dietary patterns in European child populations, complementary to traditional questionary methods, and can be used in future studies to evaluate diet quality. Moreover, this knowledge can provide mechanistic evidence of common biological pathways that characterize healthy and unhealthy dietary patterns, and diet-related molecular alterations that could associate to metabolic disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of the human ATM kinase and mechanism of Nbs1 binding</a></h4>

              
                DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can lead to mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, genome instability, and cancer. Central to the sensing of DSBs is the ATM (Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) kinase, which belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) family. In response to DSBs, ATM is activated by the MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) protein complex through a poorly-understood process that also requires double-stranded DNA. Previous studies indicate that the FxF/Y motif of Nbs1 directly binds to ATM, and is required to retain active ATM at sites of DNA damage. Here we report the 2.5 Å resolution cryo-EM structures of human ATM and its complex with the Nbs1 FxF/Y motif. In keeping with previous structures of ATM and its yeast homolog Tel1, the dimeric human ATM kinase adopts a symmetric, butterfly-shaped structure. The conformation of the ATM kinase domain is most similar to the inactive states of other PIKKs, suggesting that activation may involve an analogous realigning the N and C lobes along with relieving the blockage of the substrate-binding site. We also show that the Nbs1 FxF/Y motif binds to a conserved hydrophobic cleft within the Spiral domain of ATM, suggesting an allosteric mechanism of activation. We evaluate the importance of these structural findings with mutagenesis and biochemical assays.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of host-microbe cell adherence by receptor domain shuffling</a></h4>

              
                Stable adherence to epithelial surfaces is required for colonization by diverse host-associated microbes. Successful attachment of pathogenic microbes to host cells via adhesin molecules is also the first step in many devastating infections. Despite the primacy of epithelial adherence in establishing host-microbe associations, the evolutionary processes that shape this crucial interface remain enigmatic. Carcinoembryonic antigen associated cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) encompass a multifunctional family of vertebrate cell surface proteins which are recurrent targets of bacterial adhesins at epithelial barriers. Here we show that multiple members of the primate CEACAM family exhibit evidence of repeated natural selection at protein surfaces targeted by bacteria, consistent with pathogen-driven evolution. Divergence of CEACAM proteins between even closely related great apes is sufficient to control molecular interactions with a range of bacterial adhesins. Phylogenetic analyses further reveal that repeated gene conversion of CEACAM extracellular domains during primate divergence plays a key role in limiting bacterial adhesin host tropism. Moreover, we demonstrate that gene conversion has continued to shape CEACAM diversity within human populations, with abundant human CEACAM1 variants mediating evasion of adhesins from pathogenic <i>Neisseria</i>. Together this work reveals a mechanism by which gene conversion shapes first contact between microbes and animal hosts.

                Expansion of the available repertoire of reagents for visualization and manipulation of proteins will help understand their function. Short epitope tags linked to proteins of interest and recognized by existing binders such as nanobodies facilitate protein studies by obviating the need to isolate new antibodies directed against them. Nanobodies have several advantages over conventional antibodies, as they can be expressed and used as tools for visualization and manipulation of proteins <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we characterize two short (&lt;15 aa) NanoTag epitopes, 127D01 and VHH05, and their corresponding high-affinity nanobodies. We demonstrate their use in <i>Drosophila </i>for <i>in vivo</i> protein detection and re-localization, direct and indirect immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation. We further show that CRISPR-mediated gene targeting provides a straightforward approach to tagging endogenous proteins with the NanoTags. Single copies of the NanoTags, regardless of their location, suffice for detection. This versatile and validated toolbox of tags and nanobodies will serve as a resource for a wide array of applications, including functional studies in <i>Drosophila</i> and beyond.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">iMyoblasts for ex vivo and in vivo investigations of human myogenesis and disease modeling</a></h4>

              
                Skeletal muscle myoblasts (iMyoblasts) were generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using an efficient and reliable transgene-free induction and stem cell selection protocol. Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, qPCR, digital RNA expression profiling, and scRNA-Seq studies identify iMyoblasts as a <i>PAX3+/MYOD1+</i> skeletal myogenic lineage with a fetal-like transcriptome signature, distinct from adult muscle biopsy myoblasts (bMyoblasts) and iPSC-induced muscle progenitors. iMyoblasts can be stably propagated for &gt;12 passages or 30 population doublings while retaining their dual commitment for myotube differentiation and regeneration of reserve cells. iMyoblasts also efficiently xenoengrafted into irradiated and injured mouse muscle where they undergo differentiation and fetal-adult MYH isoform switching, demonstrating their regulatory plasticity for adult muscle maturation in response to signals in the host muscle. Xenograft muscle retains PAX3+ muscle progenitors and can regenerate human muscle in response to secondary injury. As models of disease, iMyoblasts from individuals with Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy revealed a previously unknown epigenetic regulatory mechanism controlling developmental expression of the pathological <i>DUX4</i> gene. iMyoblasts from Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy R7 and R9 and Walker Warburg Syndrome patients modeled their molecular disease pathologies and were responsive to small molecule and gene editing therapeutics. These findings establish the utility of iMyoblasts for ex vivo and in vivo investigations of human myogenesis and disease pathogenesis and for the development of muscle stem cell therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Personalized computational heart models with T1-mapped fibrotic remodeling predict sudden death risk in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</a></h4>

              
                Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated with risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) arising from the proliferation of fibrosis in the heart. Current clinical risk stratification criteria inadequately identify at-risk patients in need of primary prevention of VA. Here, we use mechanistic computational modeling of the heart to analyze how HCM-specific remodeling promotes arrhythmogenesis and to develop a personalized strategy to forecast risk of VAs in these patients. We combine contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and T1 mapping data to construct digital replicas of HCM patient hearts that represent the patient-specific distribution of focal and diffuse fibrosis and evaluate the substrate propensity to VA. Our analysis indicates that the presence of diffuse fibrosis, which is rarely assessed in these patients, increases arrhythmogenic propensity. In forecasting future VA events in HCM patients, the imaging-based computational heart approach achieved 84.6%, 76.9%, and 80.1% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, respectively, and significantly outperformed current clinical risk predictors. This novel VA risk assessment may have the potential to prevent SCD and help deploy primary prevention appropriately in HCM patients.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Topoisomerase VI is a chirally-selective, preferential DNA decatenase</a></h4>

              
                DNA topoisomerase VI (topo VI) is a type IIB DNA topoisomerase found predominantly in archaea and some bacteria, but also in plants and algae. Since its discovery, topo VI has been proposed to be a DNA decatenase, however robust evidence and a mechanism for its preferential decatenation activity was lacking. Using single-molecule magnetic tweezers measurements and supporting ensemble biochemistry, we demonstrate that <i>Methanosarcina mazei</i> topo VI preferentially unlinks, or decatenates DNA crossings, in comparison to relaxing supercoils, through a preference for certain DNA crossing geometries. In addition, topo VI demonstrates a significant increase in ATPase activity, DNA binding and rate of strand passage, with increasing DNA writhe, providing further evidence that topo VI is a DNA crossing sensor. Our study strongly suggests that topo VI has evolved an intrinsic preference for the unknotting and decatenation of interlinked chromosomes by sensing and preferentially unlinking DNA crossings with geometries close to 90°.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Whole-brain in vivo base editing reverses autistic-like behaviors in mice</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder associated with deficits in social communication and stereotypical behaviors. Numerous ASD-related genetic mutations have been identified and genome editing methods have been developed but successful genome editing in the whole-brain scale to alleviate autistic-like behaviors in animal models has not been achieved. Here we report the development of a new CRISPR-mediated cytidine base editor (CBE) system, which converts C/G base pairs to T/A. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this system by targeting an ASD-associated de novo mutation in the MEF2C gene (c.104T>C, p.L35P). We constructed a Mef2c L35P knock-in mouse and observed that Mef2c L35P heterozygous mice displayed autistic-like behaviors, including deficits in social behaviors and repetitive behaviors. We programmed the CBE to edit the C/G base pairs of the mutated Mef2c gene (c.104T>C, p.L35P) to T/A base pairs and delivered it via a single dose intravenous injection of blood brain barrier (BBB)-crossing AAV-PHPeB vector into the mouse brain. This treatment restored MEF2C protein levels and reversed impairments in social interactions and repetitive behaviors in Mef2c L35P heterozygous mice. Together, this work presents an in vivo gene editing strategy in which correcting a single nucleotide mutation in the whole-brain scale could be successfully achieved, further providing a new therapeutic framework for neurodevelopmental disorders.

                The proper function of the nervous system is dependent on the appropriate timing of neuronal firing. Synapses continually undergo rapid activity-dependent modifications that require feedback mechanisms to maintain network activity within a window in which communication is energy efficient and meaningful. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) and homeostatic intrinsic plasticity (HIP) are such negative feedback mechanisms. Accumulating evidence implicates that Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its cleavage product amyloid-beta (A{beta}) play a role in the regulation of neuronal network activity, and in particular HSP. AD features impaired neuronal activity with regional early hyper-activity and A{beta}-dependent hyperexcitability has also been demonstrated in AD transgenic mice. We demonstrate similar hyper-activity in AD transgenic neurons in culture that have elevated levels of both human APP and A{beta}. To examine the individual roles of APP and A{beta} in promoting hyperexcitability we used an APP construct that does not generate A{beta}, or elevated A{beta} levels independently of APP. Increasing either APP or A{beta} in wild type (WT) neurons leads to increased frequency and amplitude of calcium transients. Since HSP/HIP mechanisms normally maintain a setpoint of activity, we examined whether homeostatic synaptic/intrinsic plasticity was altered in AD transgenic neurons. Using methods known to induce HSP/HIP, we demonstrate that APP protein levels are regulated by chronic modulation of activity and show that AD transgenic neurons have an impaired response to global changes in activity. Further, AD transgenic compared to WT neurons failed to adjust the length of their axon initial segments (AIS), an adaptation known to alter excitability. Thus, we present evidence that both APP and A{beta} influence neuronal activity and that mechanisms of HSP/HIP are disrupted in neuronal models of AD.

                Motor neurons are commonly thought of as mere relays between the central nervous system and the movement apparatus, yet, in mammals about one-third of them function exclusively as regulators of muscle proprioception. How these gamma motor neurons acquire properties to function differently from the muscle force-producing alpha motor neurons remains unclear. Here, we found that upon selective loss of the orphan nuclear receptors Err2 and Err3 (Err2/3) in mice, gamma motor neurons acquire characteristic structural (e.g. synaptic wiring), but not functional (e.g. physiological firing rates) properties necessary for regulating muscle proprioception, thus disrupting gait and precision movements in vivo. Moreover, Err2/3 operate via transcriptional activation of neural activity modulators, one of which (Kcna10) promoted gamma motor neuron functional properties. Our work identifies a long-sought mechanism specifying gamma motor neuron properties necessary for proprioceptive movement control, which implies a feature-specific terminal differentiation program implementing neuron subtype-specific functional but not structural properties.

                Neural progenitor cells (NPC) represent potential cell transplantation therapies for CNS injuries. To understand how lesion environments influence transplanted NPC fate in vivo, we derived NPC expressing a ribosomal protein-hemagglutinin tag (RiboTag) for transcriptional profiling of transplanted NPC. Here, we show that NPC grafted into uninjured CNS generate cells that are transcriptionally similar to healthy astrocytes and oligodendrocyte lineages. In striking contrast, NPC transplanted into serum-exposed CNS lesions after stroke or spinal cord injury generate cells that share transcriptional, morphological and functional features with newly proliferated host astroglia that restrict inflammation and fibrosis and thereby protect adjacent neural tissue. Our findings reveal overlapping differentiation potentials of grafted NPC and proliferating host astrocytes; and show that in the absence of other interventions, non-cell autonomous cues in CNS lesions direct the differentiation of grafted NPC predominantly towards a naturally occurring neuroprotective wound repair astroglial phenotype.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Norepinephrine and dopamine contribute to distinct repetitive behaviors induced by novel odorant stress in male and female mice</a></h4>

              
                Exposure to unfamiliar odorants induces an array of repetitive defensive and non-defensive behaviors in rodents which likely reflect adaptive stress responses to the uncertain valence of novel stimuli. Mice genetically deficient for dopamine {beta}-hydroxylase (Dbh-/-) lack the enzyme required to convert dopamine (DA) into norepinephrine (NE), resulting in globally undetectable NE and supranormal DA levels. Because catecholamines modulate novelty detection and reactivity, we investigated the effects of novel plant-derived odorants on repetitive behaviors in Dbh-/- mice and Dbh+/- littermate controls, which have catecholamine levels comparable to wild-type mice. Unlike Dbh+/- controls, which exhibited vigorous digging in response to novel odorants, Dbh-/- mice displayed excessive grooming. Drugs that block NE synthesis or neurotransmission suppressed odorant-induced digging in Dbh+/- mice, while a DA receptor antagonist attenuated grooming in Dbh-/- mice. The testing paradigm elicited high circulating levels of corticosterone regardless of Dbh genotype, indicating that NE is dispensable for this systemic stress response. Odorant exposure increased NE and DA abundance in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of Dbh+/- mice, while Dbh-/- animals lacked NE and had elevated PFC DA levels that were unaffected by novel smells. Together, these findings suggest that novel odorant-induced increases in central NE tone contribute to repetitive digging and reflect psychological stress, while central DA signaling contributes to repetitive grooming. Further, we have established a simple method for repeated assessment of stress-induced repetitive behaviors in mice, which may be relevant for modeling neuropsychiatric disorders like Tourette syndrome or obsessive-compulsive disorder that are characterized by stress-induced exacerbation of compulsive symptoms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prior exposure to speech rapidly modulates cortical processing of high-level linguistic structure</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity has been shown to track hierarchical linguistic units in connected speech and these responses can be directly modulated by changes in speech intelligibility caused by spectral degradation. In the current study, we manipulate prior knowledge to increase the intelligibility of physically identical speech sentences and test the hypothesis that the tracking responses can be enhanced by this intelligibility improvement. Cortical magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses to intelligible speech followed by either the same (matched) or different (unmatched) unintelligible speech were measured in twenty-three normal hearing participants. Driven by prior knowledge, cortical coherence to "abstract" linguistic units with no accompanying acoustic cues (phrases and sentences) was enhanced relative to the unmatched condition, and was lateralized to the left hemisphere. In contrast, cortical responses coherent to word units, aligned with acoustic onsets, were bilateral and insensitive to contextual information changes. No such coherence changes were observed when prior experience was not available (unintelligible speech before intelligible speech). This dissociation suggests that cerebral responses to linguistic information are directly affected by intelligibility, which in turn are powerfully shaped by physical cues in speech. These results provide an objective and sensitive neural index of speech intelligibility, and explain why previous studies have reported no effect of prior knowledge on cortical entrainment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The rates of adult neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis are linked to cell cycle regulation through p27-dependent gene repression of SOX2</a></h4>

              
                Cell differentiation involves profound changes in global gene expression that often have to occur in coordination with cell cycle exit. Because cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 reportedly regulates proliferation of neural progenitor cells in the subependymal neurogenic niche of the adult mouse brain, but can also have effects on gene expression, we decided to molecularly analyze its role in adult neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis. At the cell level, we show that p27 restricts residual cyclin-dependent kinase activity after mitogen withdrawal to antagonize cycling, but it is not essential for cell cycle exit. Contrasting gene expression with chromatin accessibility, we find that p27 is coincidentally necessary to globally repress many genes involved in the transit from multipotentiality to differentiation, including those coding for neural progenitor transcription factors SOX2, OLIG2, and ASCL1. Our data reveal both direct association of p27 with regulatory sequences in the three genes and an additional hierarchical relationship where p27 repression of the Sox2 gene leads to reduced levels of SOX2-downstream targets Olig2 and Ascl1. In vivo, p27 is also required for the regulation of the proper level of SOX2 necessary for neuroblasts and oligodendroglial progenitor cells to timely exit cell cycle in a lineage-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impacts of development and adult sex on brain cell numbers in the Black Soldier Fly, Hermetia illucens L. (Diptera: Stratiomyidae)</a></h4>

              
                The Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens, Diptera: Stratiomyidae) has been introduced across the globe, with numerous industry applications predicated on its tremendous growth during the larval stage. However, basic research on H. illucens biology (for example, studies of their central nervous system) are lacking. Despite their small brain volumes, insects are capable of complex behaviors; understanding how these behaviors are completed with such a small amount of neural tissue requires understanding processing power (e.g. number of cells) within the brain. Brain cell counts have been completed in only a few insect species (mostly Hymenoptera), and almost exclusively in adults. This limits the taxonomic breadth of comparative analyses, as well as any conclusions about how development and body size growth may impact brain cell populations. Here, we present the first images and cell counts of the H. illucens brain at four time points across development (early, mid, and late larval stages, and both male and female adults) using immunohistochemistry and isotropic fractionation. To assess sexual dimorphism in adults, we quantified the number of cells in the central brain vs. optic lobes of males and females separately. To assess if increases in body size during development might independently affect different regions of the CNS, we quantified the larval ventral nerve cord and central brain separately at all three stages. Together, these data provide the first description of the nervous system of a popular, farmed invertebrate and the first study of brain cell numbers using IF across developmental stages in any insect.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Towards the identification and optimization of the "dose-response" relationship of transcranial direct current stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is being investigated as a therapeutic tool in several neuropsychiatric disorders, but its mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood and its effectiveness is highly variable from subject to subject. Some of this inter-subject variance is thought to stem from individual differences in head anatomy, which result in different electric field distributions across individuals for the same stimulation settings. In a recent block-randomized, sham-controlled pilot study, 18 older adults with mild-to-moderate motor and cognitive impairments underwent a 2-week, 10-session intervention of 2 mA bipolar tDCS with the anode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cathode over the right supraorbital region (anodal F3 vs. FP2 using sponge electrodes in the 10-20 EEG system). tDCS, compared to sham stimulation, improved average cognitive-motor performance over a two-week follow-up. For a subset of 12 participants from this cohort who underwent structural brain MRIs at baseline, we derived tDCS-induced electric field properties using MRI-derived realistic, individualized finite element modeling. We hypothesized that the electric field component orthogonal (E_n) to the cortex over the left DLPFC would correlate with observed cognitive-motor improvements. Across the 12 subjects the average tDCS-induced electric field over the target area was highly variable with a standard deviation of the surface average E_n over the left DLPFC of 21% of the mean. For those subjects who were randomized to tDCS intervention (n=6), those who exhibited greater improvement in cognitive-motor performance were exposed to greater normal component of the tDCS electric field averaged over the left DLPFC (r_(95 %) [isin][-0.99,-0.59]). In contrast, averaged over the right DLPFC, E_n was a poor predictor of outcome (r_(95 %) [isin][-0.08,0.97]), as was the amplitude of the current injected (a widely adopted dosing parameter). In light of these results, we conducted a retrospective modeling experiment using personalized montage optimization algorithms to achieve a desired E_namplitude over the left DLPFC. The optimized montages induced an average E_n on the left DLPFC comparable to the bipolar montages, but with half the variability (standard deviation was 11% compared to 21% with bipolar montages). In addition, these results suggest that optimized multichannel montages afford more focal targeting, with lower "spill-over" of electric field onto other cortical areas. These proof-of-concept results, though based upon a small sample size, indicate that assessment of the E-field distribution is critical when evaluating the effects of tDCS intervention. They also reinforce the importance of controlled cortical electric field dosing in tDCS and the potential advantages of optimized multichannel stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual uncertainty unveils the distinct role of haptic cues in multisensory grasping</a></h4>

              
                Multisensory grasping movements (i.e., seeing and feeling a handheld object while grasping it with the contralateral hand) are superior to movements guided by each separate modality. This multisensory advantage might be driven by the integration of vision with either the haptic position only or with both position and size cues. To contrast these two hypotheses, we manipulated visual uncertainty (central vs. peripheral vision) and the availability of haptic cues during multisensory grasping. We showed a multisensory benefit irrespective of the degree of visual uncertainty suggesting that the integration process involved in multisensory grasping can be flexibly modulated by the contribution of each modality. Increasing visual uncertainty revealed the role of the distinct haptic cues. The haptic position cue was sufficient to promote multisensory benefits evidenced by faster actions with smaller grip apertures, whereas the haptic size was fundamental in fine-tuning the grip aperture scaling. These results support the hypothesis that, in multisensory grasping, vision is integrated with all haptic cues, with the haptic position cue playing the key part. Our findings highlight the important role of non-visual sensory inputs in sensorimotor control and hint at the potential contributions of the haptic modality in developing and maintaining visuomotor functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The scotopic band: primate detailed scotopic vision and perceptual uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                Primates perceive detailed images in photopic (daylight) vision via a preferred-processing, high-acuity pathway, made up of a small photopic center (the fovea), and dedicated eye movements, whose function is to shift images of target objects to the fovea and keep them while foveal cones sense the image. Thus, the preferred processing pathway processes images serially, not in parallel. No such pathway is known for scotopic (night-light) vision or mesopic (twilight) vision - though details are informative in dim light, even vital; it remains unclear whether and how scotopic vision of details is accomplished. Here we show that primates do have a scotopic preferred-processing pathway. It consists of a Scotopic Center, located on a Scotopic Band, and eye movements that shift target images not to the fovea but directly to the scotopic center. In contrast to the stationary fovea, the scotopic center can relocate over the scotopic band. The scotopic center relocates to match changing visual conditions and contextual needs. Ambient light intensity is mapped monotonically onto the scotopic band, with mesopic vision at one end. The dimmer the light is, the more dorsal the scotopic center relocates on the scotopic band. Importantly, the scotopic center relocates (or SET) not only in passive response to ambient light but also actively, driven by internal factors. In near-threshold conditions the scotopic center relocates to a more dorsal band location than in salient conditions. That the same relocation of the scotopic center can be instigated both by dimming the ambient light and by reducing the detectability of targets indicates that, at the core, the longitudinal axis of the scotopic band encodes the level of perceptual uncertainty.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single cell sequencing reveals microglia induced angiogenesis by specific subsets of endothelial cells following spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in dynamic alterations of the microenvironment at the lesion site, which inevitably leads to neuron degeneration and functional deficits. The prominent deterioration of the milieu, derived from the destruction of spinal vascular system, not only activates innate immunity but also makes cells in the lesion lose nutrient supports. Limited endogenous angiogenesis happens after SCI, but the cell events at the lesion site underpinning this process have not been delineated so far. Here, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of tissues in the spinal lesion at different time points after rat SCI. After performing clustering and cell-type identification, we focused on the vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which play a pivot role in angiogenesis, and drew a comprehensive cellular and molecular atlas for endogenous angiogenesis after SCI. We found that microglia and macrophage promote endogenous angiogenesis by regulating EC subsets through SPP1 and IGF1 signal pathways. Our results indicated that immune cells promotes angiogenesis by the regulation of specific cell subsets of vascular ECs, which provides new clues for the development of interventions for SCI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Temporal and Contextual Stability of Activity Levels in Hippocampal CA1 Cells</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have shown that the activity levels of hippocampal neurons during exploration are not constant but change on a daily to weekly scale. However, a few other studies suggest that their activity levels are preserved over time. To resolve this contradiction, we repeatedly measured the neural activity of the mouse hippocampus in four different environments. The activity level of hippocampal neurons fluctuated greatly in one environment, but the mean activity level across all the environments was more stable. Each cell's preferred environment frequently changed over time. The number of environments in which a cell showed activity varied across cells, ranging from zero to four, and the value also tended to be preserved. Cells that showed place cell activity in many environments had higher mean firing rates and higher spatial information content, whereas cells active only in a small number of environments were suitable for coding environmental identity. These results suggest that although the activity level in a single environment appears unstable, each cell has not only an inherent activity level but also play a characteristic role in the coding of space.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two roles for choice selective inhibition in decision-making circuits</a></h4>

              
                During perceptual decision-making, the firing rates of cortical neurons reflect upcoming choices. Recent work showed that excitatory and inhibitory neurons are equally selective for choice. However, functional consequences of inhibitory choice selectivity in decision-making circuits are unknown. We developed a circuit model of decision-making which accounts for the specificity of inputs to and outputs from inhibitory neurons. We found that selective inhibition expands the space of circuits supporting decision-making, allowing for weaker or stronger recurrent excitation when connected in a competitive or feedback motif. The specificity of inhibitory outputs sets the trade-off between speed and accuracy of decisions by altering the attractor dynamics in the circuit. Recurrent neural networks trained to make decisions display the same dependence on inhibitory specificity and the strength of recurrent excitation. Our results reveal two concurrent roles for selective inhibition in decision-making circuits: stabilizing strongly connected excitatory populations and maximizing competition between oppositely selective populations.

                Mistuning of synaptic transmission has been proposed to underlie many psychiatric disorders, with decreased reuptake of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate as one contributing factor. Synaptic tuning occurs through several diverging and converging forms of plasticity. By recording evoked field postsynaptic potentials in the CA1 area in hippocampal slices, we found that inhibiting glutamate transporters using DL-TBOA causes retuning of synaptic transmission, resulting in a new steady state with reduced synaptic strength and a lower threshold for inducing long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). Moreover, we also found reduced threshold for LTP in a rat model of depression that has decreased levels of glutamate transporters. Most importantly, we found that the antidepressant ketamine counteracts the effects of increased glutamate on the various steps involved in synaptic retuning. We therefore propose that ketamine's mechanism of action as an antidepressant is to restore adequate synaptic tuning.

                Locomotion has long been associated with rhythmic oscillations in the rat hippocampus. Running speed and acceleration affect the spectral density at the theta (6-10 Hz) and gamma (30-150 Hz) bands and the rhythmic entrainment of neuronal activity. However, less is known about other oscillatory rhythms. Recent studies have shown that oscillatory activity in the delta (1-4 Hz) band also relates to locomotion in stationary conditions, such as running on a treadmill or in a running wheel. To further investigate the effects of stationary running on hippocampal oscillations, we recorded CA1 local field potentials and neuronal activity while rats ran at different speed protocols on a treadmill. We found a remarkable oscillatory activity at 2 Hz that was strongly modulated by running speed. Delta power and peak frequency were highest at the fastest running speed, both in constant and progressively increasing speed protocols. Delta and theta oscillations co-occurred and showed independent relationships in their instantaneous power and frequency. Moreover, the delta phase modulated the amplitude of low-gamma (20-50 Hz) oscillations and the spiking activity of putative pyramidal neurons in a speed-dependent manner. Finally, spectral components in the delta frequency range, but not theta, predicted running speed using a naive Bayes classifier. In summary, our study shows that locomotion-related delta oscillations convey information about stationary running speed and coordinate hippocampal rhythmic activity in a speed-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A sparse set of spikes corresponding to reliable correlations is highly informative of visual stimulus on single trials</a></h4>

              
                Spike trains in cortical neuronal populations vary in number and timing trial-to-trial, rendering a viable single trial coding scheme for sensory information elusive. Correlations between pairs of neocortical neurons can be segmented into either sensory or noise according to their stimulus specificity. Here we show that pairs of spikes, corresponding to reliable sensory correlations in imaged populations in layer 2/3 of mouse visual cortex are particularly informative of visual stimuli. This set of spikes is sparse and exhibits comparable levels of trial-to-trial variance relative to the full spike train. Despite this, correspondence of pairs of spikes to a specific set of sensory correlations identifies spikes that carry more information per spike about the visual stimulus than the full set or any other matched set of spikes. Moreover, this sparse subset is more accurately decoded, regardless of the decoding algorithm employed. Our findings suggest that consistent pairwise correlations between neurons, rather than first-order statistical features of spike trains, may be an organizational principle of a single trial sensory coding scheme.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multilevel Development of Cognitive Abilities in an Artificial Neural Network</a></h4>

              
                Several neuronal mechanisms have been proposed to account for the formation of cognitive abilities through postnatal interactions with the physical and socio-cultural environment. Here, we introduce a three-level computational model of information processing and acquisition of cognitive abilities. We propose minimal architectural requirements to build these levels and how the parameters affect their performance and relationships. The first sensorimotor level handles local nonconscious processing, here during a visual classification task. The second level or cognitive level globally integrates the information from multiple local processors via long-ranged connections and synthesizes it in a global, but still nonconscious manner. The third and cognitively highest level handles the information globally and consciously. It is based on the Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) theory and is referred to as conscious level. We use trace and delay conditioning tasks to, respectively, challenge the second and third levels. Results first highlight the necessity of epigenesis through selection and stabilization of synapses at both local and global scales to allow the network to solve the first two tasks. At the global scale, dopamine appears necessary to properly provide credit assignment despite the temporal delay between perception and reward. At the third level, the presence of interneurons becomes necessary to maintain a self-sustained representation within the GNW in the absence of sensory input. Finally, while balanced spontaneous intrinsic activity facilitates epigenesis at both local and global scales, the balanced excitatory-inhibitory ratio increases performance. Finally, we discuss the plausibility of the model in both neurodevelopmental and artificial intelligence terms.

                The compounding symptomatology of comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) gives rise to an interaction of maladaptive neurobiological processes, the etiology of which remains elusive. Here, we devised an optogenetic strategy aimed at rescuing maladaptive responses to fearful stimuli in male c57BL/6 mice following chronic ethanol administration and forced abstinence. In the first experiment, we confirmed that fear acquisition and maladaptive contextual generalization was potentiated in ethanol-exposed mice during fear conditioning and exposure to a novel environment, respectively. In the second experiment, using an activity-dependent tet-tag system, we labeled and artificially inhibited the neural ensemble selectively activated by contextual fear conditioning in the dorsal hippocampus to attenuate behavioral dysfunctions resulting from ethanol exposure. We found that acute optogenetic inhibition during exposure to a novel environment suppressed maladaptive generalization in ethanol-exposed mice. These results provide further evidence for a crucial link between ethanol exposure and impaired fear memory processing by providing cellular and behavioral insights into the neural circuitry underlying AUD and PTSD comorbidity.

                Individual differences in behavior are associated with changes in the correlation of neural activity between brain areas. Such differences in 'functional connectivity' are thought to reflect individual differences in brain structure that alter the flow of neural activity between regions. Here, in contrast, we show that individual differences in functional connectivity and behavior can be explained by differences in how frequently an individual expresses distinct cortex-wide spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity. This suggests variability in sampling of cortex-wide neural dynamics may underlie individuals' unique behavioral phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The geometry of hippocampal CA2 representations enables abstract coding of social familiarity and identity</a></h4>

              
                Social recognition memory encompasses two distinct processes: familiarity - the ability to rapidly distinguish a novel from familiar individual - and recollection, the recall of detailed episodic memories of prior encounters with familiar individuals. Although it is clear that the hippocampus is important for different forms of episodic memory, including spatial memory and social recognition memory, whether and how neural activity in this single brain region may be able to encode both social familiarity and social recollection remains unclear. We addressed such questions using microendoscopic calcium imaging from pyramidal neurons in the dorsal CA2 region of the hippocampus (dCA2), an area crucial for social recognition memory that encodes social and spatial information, as mice explored novel and familiar conspecifics. Here we demonstrate that the geometry of dCA2 representations in neural activity space enables social familiarity, social identity, and spatial information to be readily disentangled. Importantly, highly familiar littermates were encoded in higher-dimensional neural representations compared to novel individuals. As a result of this coding strategy, dCA2 neural activity was able to both provide an abstract, low-dimensional representation of social familiarity that could readily distinguish a novel from familiar individual and encode detailed episodic memories associated with familiar individuals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Post-embryonic maturation of the C. elegans motor circuit</a></h4>

              
                During development, animals can maintain behavioral output even as the underlying circuits structurally remodel. After hatching, C. elegans undergoes substantial motor neuron expansion and synapse re-wiring while the animal continuously moves with an undulatory pattern. To understand how the circuit transitions from its juvenile to mature configuration without disrupting functional output, we reconstructed the C. elegans motor circuit by electron microscopy across larval development. We observed: 1) Embryonic motor neurons transiently interact with the developing post-embryonic motor neurons prior to remodeling of their juvenile wiring; 2) Post-embryonic neurons initiate synapse development with their future partners as their neurites navigate through the juvenile nerve cords; 3) Embryonic and post-embryonic neurons sequentially build structural machinery needed for the adult circuit before the embryonic neurons relinquish their roles to post-embryonic neurons; 4) This transition is repeated region by region along the body in an anterior to posterior sequence, following the birth order of post-embryonic neurons. Through this orchestrated, programmed and gradual rewiring, the motor circuit transforms from asymmetric to symmetric wiring. These maturation strategies support the continuous maintenance of motor patterns as the juvenile circuit develops into the adult configuration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predictive coding in ASD: inflexible weighting of prediction errors when switching from stable to volatile environments</a></h4>

              
                Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been widely reported to show atypicalities in predictive coding, though there remains a controversy regarding what causes such atypical processing. Suggestions range from overestimation of volatility to rigidity in the reaction to environmental changes. Here, we tested two accounts directly using duration reproduction of volatile and non-volatile interval sequences. Critically, both sequences had the same set of intervals but differed in their stimulus presentation orders. Comparing individuals with ASD vs. their matched controls, we found both groups to respond to the volatility in a similar manner, albeit with a generally reduced prior in the ASD group. Interestingly, though, relative to the control group, the ASD group exhibited a markedly reduced trust in the prior in the volatile trial session when this was performed after the non-volatile session, while both groups performed comparably in the reverse session order. Our findings suggest that it is not the learning of environmental volatility that is compromised in ASD. Rather, it is their response to a change of the volatility regimen from stable to volatile, which causes a highly inflexible weighting of prediction errors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Morphological analysis of human and mouse dendritic spines reveals a morphological continuum and differences across ages and species</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic spines have diverse morphologies, with a wide range of head and neck sizes, and these morphological differences likely generate different synaptic and functional properties. To explore how this morphological diversity differs across species we analyzed 3D confocal reconstructions of ~8,000 human spines and ~1,700 mouse spines, labeled by intracellular injections in fixed tissue. Using unsupervised machine-learning algorithms, we computationally separated spine heads and necks and systematically measured morphological features of spines in apical and basal dendrites from cortical pyramidal cells. Human spines had unimodal distributions of parameters, without any evidence of morphological subtypes. Their spine necks were longer and thinner in apical than in basal spines, and spine head volumes of an 85-years-old individual were larger than those of a 40-years-old individual. Human spines overall had longer and thicker necks and bigger head volumes than mouse spines. Our results indicate that human spines form part of a morphological continuum, are larger and longer than those of mice, and become larger with increasing adult age. These morphological differences in spines across species could generate functional differences in biochemical and electrical spine compartmentalization, or in synaptic properties, across species and ages.

	<p>Background: Sexual dysfunctions (SD) are common but underreported in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and have negative impacts on the quality of life (QoL) and partnership. Methods: We analyzed the data set from the PRISM study for demographics of SD and their influence on quality of life and partnership. Results: 449/861 (52.1%) PD patients reported SD, with male patients being affected more often and having a longer course of disease. The most common SD in men was erectile dysfunction (ED) (n = 152), while women&amp;amp;rsquo;s most frequent complaints were orgasm dysfunction (n = 84) and reduced libido (n = 81). Hypersexual SDs were reported significantly more often by men. Spousal caregivers of patients reporting inability to relax and enjoy sex and reduced libido indicated a negative influence on the relationship in general. Negative effects on the sexual relationship were reported significantly more often for patients with ED, difficulties with sexual arousal, inability to relax and enjoy sex, and reduced libido. Hypersexual dysfunctions showed no effect on the relationship. Conclusion: SD is a common but underreported problem in the treatment of patients with PD. Due to the negative influence on the relationship and QoL of patients and caregivers, SD should be assessed routinely.</p>

	<p>This study presents the case of a brain-injured patient whose pathological awakening after coma and absence of interaction led to a diagnosis of lack of consciousness when standard clinical scales were administered. However, we were able to demonstrate conscious perception in this patient from initial clinical assessments using the Motor Behaviour Tool in the acute stage, complemented by a systematic search for potential obstacles blocking his execution of motor responses (pitfalls). This refinement of the diagnosis enabled prediction of a favourable outcome despite the severity of the lesions, with the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s evolution confirming our prediction. Faced with an unresponsive patient, every specialist should go beyond the absence of response with the standard scores, consider the possibility of a hidden consciousness and look for rigorous ways of proving it.</p>

	<p>Schizophrenia is widely seen as a disorder of dysconnectivity. Neuroimaging studies have examined both structural and functional connectivity in the disorder, but these modalities have rarely been integrated directly. We scanned 29 patients with schizophrenia and 25 healthy control subjects, and we acquired resting state fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging. We used the Functional and Tractographic Connectivity Analysis Toolbox (FATCAT) to estimate functional and structural connectivity of the default mode network. Correlations between modalities were investigated, and multimodal connectivity scores (MCS) were created using principal component analysis. Of the 28 possible region pairs, 9 showed consistent (&amp;amp;gt;80%) tracts across participants. Correlations between modalities were found among those with schizophrenia for the prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and lateral temporal lobes, with frontal and parietal regions, consistent with frontotemporoparietal network involvement in the disorder. In patients, MCS correlated with several aspects of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, with higher multimodal connectivity associated with outward-directed (externalizing) behavior and lower multimodal connectivity related to psychosis per se. In this preliminary sample, we found FATCAT to be a useful toolbox to directly integrate and examine connectivity between imaging modalities. A consideration of conjoint structural and functional connectivity can provide important information about the network mechanisms of schizophrenia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Exploring links FROM sensory perception TO MOVEMENT and behavioral motivation in the Caudal nidopallium of female songbirds</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Decision making resides at the interface between sensory perception and movement production. Female songbirds in the context of mate choice are an excellent system to define neural circuits through which sensory perception influences production of courtship behaviors. Previous experiments by our group and others have implicated secondary auditory brain sites, including the caudal nidopallium (NC), in mediating behavioral indicators of mate choice. Here, we used anterograde tracer molecules to define projections that emerge from NC in female songbirds, identifying pathways through which NC influences downstream sites implicated in signal processing and decision making. Our results reveal that NC sends projections into the arcopallium, including the ventral intermediate arcopallium (AIV). Previous work revealed that AIV also receives input from another auditory area implicated in song preference and mate choice (caudal mesopallium, CM), suggesting that convergent input from multiple auditory areas may play important roles in initiating mate choice behaviors. In the present results, NC projects to an area implicated in postural and locomotory control (dorsal arcopallium, Ad), suggesting that NC may play a role in directing those forms of copulatory behavior. NC projections also systematically avoid a vocal motor region of the arcopallium that is innervated by CM (robust nucleus of the arcopallium, RA). These results suggest a model in which both NC and CM project to arcopallial pathways implicated in behavioral motivation. These brain regions may exert different influences on pathways through which auditory information can direct different facets of behavioral responses to information detected in those auditory signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Impact of Eye Closure on Anticipatory {alpha} Activity in a Tactile Discrimination Task</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>One of the very first observations made regarding &alpha; oscillations (8&ndash;14 Hz), is that they increase in power over posterior areas when awake participants close their eyes. Recent work, especially in the context of (spatial) attention, suggests that &alpha; activity reflects a mechanism of functional inhibition. However, it remains unclear how eye closure impacts anticipatory &alpha; modulation observed in attention paradigms, and how this affects subsequent behavioral performance. Here, we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 33 human participants performing a tactile discrimination task with their eyes open versus closed. We replicated the hallmarks of previous somatosensory spatial attention studies: &alpha; lateralization across the somatosensory cortices as well as &alpha; increase over posterior (visual) regions. Furthermore, we found that eye closure leads to (1) reduced task performance; (2) widespread increase in &alpha; power; and (3) reduced anticipatory visual &alpha; modulation (4) with no effect on somatosensory &alpha; lateralization. Regardless of whether participants had their eyes open or closed, increased visual &alpha; power and somatosensory &alpha; lateralization improved their performance. Thus, we provide evidence that eye closure does not alter the impact of anticipatory &alpha; modulations on behavioral performance. We propose there is an optimal visual &alpha; level for somatosensory task performance, which can be achieved through a combination of eye closure and top-down anticipatory attention.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The influence of extrovert and introvert personality types on the acceptance of virtual learning during the COVID-19 pandemic: a survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, all courses taught in Malaysian schools and universities were conducted entirely virtually, after a movement control order was imposed in Malaysian on 18th March 2020. According to the research by Offir et al., (2007), extroversion-introversion (E-I) personalities have been shown to influence students’ involvement in class, their learning style and their understanding of the course materials. The purpose of this research was to explore how extrovert and introvert personality traits influence the acceptance of virtual learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A case study was conducted, focusing on a group of students taught by one of the researchers in our research team, HR. A total of 31 Diploma students (13 first year students and 18 second year students) taking Grooming and Professional Etiquette  at  Multimedia University, Malaysia (MMU) participated in the study. Open-ended questions were used to learn about the personality of each participant, as well as to provide a better understanding on how the opposing personas differs in their experiences with virtual learning. Results: Our results showed that 54.83% (17) of the students were introverts, 29.03 % (9) were extroverts, and 16.1% (5) were private-public-introvert-extroverts (PPIEs). The results for the acceptance level of virtual learning varied based on the different personality types. Results showed the extroverts expressed that the virtual learning experience was unpleasant, while the introverts and the PPIEs found virtual learning a useful and pleasant experience. Conclusion: This study was mainly descriptive, with open-ended questions used to gain insight on how different personality types differ in their acceptance of fully virtual learning. In future studies, inferential analysis could be carried out to test the hypotheses and assumptions. Future studies could also compare and contrast both students and lecturers’ acceptance of, and engagement in, online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to follow up predictive factors for α-synuclein–related neurodegenerative diseases in a multicenter cohort of idiopathic/isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with iRBD from 12 centers underwent a detailed assessment for potential environmental and lifestyle risk factors via a standardized questionnaire at baseline. Patients were then prospectively followed and received assessments for parkinsonism or dementia during follow-up. The cumulative incidence of parkinsonism or dementia was estimated with competing risk analysis. Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the predictive value of environmental/lifestyle factors over a follow-up period of 11 years, adjusting for age, sex, and center.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 319 patients who were free of parkinsonism or dementia, 281 provided follow-up information. After a mean follow-up of 5.8 years, 130 (46.3%) patients developed neurodegenerative disease. The overall phenoconversion rate was 24.2% after 3 years, 44.8% after 6 years, and 67.5% after 10 years. Patients with older age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.05) and nitrate derivative use (aHR = 2.18) were more likely to phenoconvert, whereas prior pesticide exposure (aHR = 0.21–0.64), rural living (aHR = 0.53), lipid-lowering medication use (aHR = 0.59), and respiratory medication use (aHR = 0.36) were associated with lower phenoconversion risk. Risk factors for those converting to primary dementia and parkinsonism were generally similar, with dementia-first converters having lower coffee intake and beta-blocker intake, and higher occurrence of family history of dementia.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings elucidate the predictive values of environmental factors and comorbid conditions in identifying RBD patients at higher risk of phenoconversion. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dynamic inference of cell developmental complex energy landscape from time series single-cell transcriptomic data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qi Jiang, Shuo Zhang, Lin Wan</p>

Time series single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are emerging. However, dynamic inference of an evolving cell population from time series scRNA-seq data is challenging owing to the stochasticity and nonlinearity of the underlying biological processes. This calls for the development of mathematical models and methods capable of reconstructing cellular dynamic transition processes and uncovering the nonlinear cell-cell interactions. In this study, we present GraphFP, a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation on graph based model and dynamic inference framework, with the aim of reconstructing the cell state-transition complex potential energy landscape from time series single-cell transcriptomic data. The free energy of our model explicitly takes into account of the cell-cell interactions in a nonlinear quadratic term. We then recast the model inference problem in the form of a dynamic optimal transport framework and solve it efficiently with the adjoint method of optimal control. We evaluated GraphFP on the time series scRNA-seq data set of embryonic murine cerebral cortex development. We illustrated that it 1) reconstructs cell state potential energy, which is a measure of cellular differentiation potency, 2) faithfully charts the probability flows between paired cell states over the dynamic processes of cell differentiation, and 3) accurately quantifies the stochastic dynamics of cell type frequencies on probability simplex in continuous time. We also illustrated that GraphFP is robust in terms of cluster labelling with different resolutions, as well as parameter choices. Meanwhile, GraphFP provides a model-based approach to delineate the cell-cell interactions that drive cell differentiation. GraphFP software is available at https://github.com/QiJiang-QJ/GraphFP.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The structural coverage of the human proteome before and after AlphaFold</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eduard Porta-Pardo, Victoria Ruiz-Serra, Samuel Valentini, Alfonso Valencia</p>

The protein structure field is experiencing a revolution. From the increased throughput of techniques to determine experimental structures, to developments such as cryo-EM that allow us to find the structures of large protein complexes or, more recently, the development of artificial intelligence tools, such as AlphaFold, that can predict with high accuracy the folding of proteins for which the availability of homology templates is limited. Here we quantify the effect of the recently released AlphaFold database of protein structural models in our knowledge on human proteins. Our results indicate that our current baseline for structural coverage of 48%, considering experimentally-derived or template-based homology models, elevates up to 76% when including AlphaFold predictions. At the same time the fraction of dark proteome is reduced from 26% to just 10% when AlphaFold models are considered. Furthermore, although the coverage of disease-associated genes and mutations was near complete before AlphaFold release (69% of Clinvar pathogenic mutations and 88% of oncogenic mutations), AlphaFold models still provide an additional coverage of 3% to 13% of these critically important sets of biomedical genes and mutations. Finally, we show how the contribution of AlphaFold models to the structural coverage of non-human organisms, including important pathogenic bacteria, is significantly larger than that of the human proteome. Overall, our results show that the sequence-structure gap of human proteins has almost disappeared, an outstanding success of direct consequences for the knowledge on the human genome and the derived medical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Foraging as sampling without replacement: A Bayesian statistical model for estimating biases in target selection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alasdair D. F. Clarke, Amelia R. Hunt, Anna E. Hughes</p>

Foraging entails finding multiple targets sequentially. In humans and other animals, a key observation has been a tendency to forage in ‘runs’ of the same target type. This tendency is context-sensitive, and in humans, it is strongest when the targets are difficult to distinguish from the distractors. Many important questions have yet to be addressed about this and other tendencies in human foraging, and a key limitation is a lack of precise measures of foraging behaviour. The standard measures tend to be run statistics, such as the maximum run length and the number of runs. But these measures are not only interdependent, they are also constrained by the number and distribution of targets, making it difficult to make inferences about the effects of these aspects of the environment on foraging. Moreover, run statistics are underspecified about the underlying cognitive processes determining foraging behaviour. We present an alternative approach: modelling foraging as a procedure of generative sampling without replacement, implemented in a Bayesian multilevel model. This allows us to break behaviour down into a number of biases that influence target selection, such as the proximity of targets and a bias for selecting targets in runs, in a way that is not dependent on the number of targets present. Our method thereby facilitates direct comparison of specific foraging tendencies between search environments that differ in theoretically important dimensions. We demonstrate the use of our model with simulation examples and re-analysis of existing data. We believe our model will provide deeper insights into visual foraging and provide a foundation for further modelling work in this area.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Polypolish: Short-read polishing of long-read bacterial genome assemblies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ryan R. Wick, Kathryn E. Holt</p>

Long-read-only bacterial genome assemblies usually contain residual errors, most commonly homopolymer-length errors. Short-read polishing tools can use short reads to fix these errors, but most rely on short-read alignment which is unreliable in repeat regions. Errors in such regions are therefore challenging to fix and often remain after short-read polishing. Here we introduce Polypolish, a new short-read polisher which uses all-per-read alignments to repair errors in repeat sequences that other polishers cannot. Polypolish performed well in benchmarking tests using both simulated and real reads, and it almost never introduced errors during polishing. The best results were achieved by using Polypolish in combination with other short-read polishers.

Individual-based modeling is widely applied to investigate the ecological mechanisms driving microbial community dynamics. In such models, the population or community dynamics emerge from the behavior and interplay of individual entities, which are simulated according to a predefined set of rules. If the rules that govern the behavior of individuals are based on generic and mechanistically sound principles, the models are referred to as next-generation individual-based models. These models perform particularly well in recapitulating actual ecological dynamics. However, implementation of such models is time-consuming and requires proficiency in programming or in using specific software, which likely hinders a broader application of this powerful method. Here we present <i>McComedy</i>, a modeling tool designed to facilitate the development of next-generation individual-based models of microbial consumer-resource systems. This tool allows flexibly combining pre-implemented building blocks that represent physical and biological processes. The ability of <i>McComedy</i> to capture the essential dynamics of microbial consumer-resource systems is demonstrated by reproducing and furthermore adding to the results of two distinct studies from the literature. With this article, we provide a versatile tool for developing next-generation individual-based models that can foster understanding of microbial ecology in both research and education.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Efficient ReML inference in variance component mixed models using a Min-Max algorithm</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fabien Laporte, Alain Charcosset, Tristan Mary-Huard</p>

Since their introduction in the 50’s, variance component mixed models have been widely used in many application fields. In this context, ReML estimation is by far the most popular procedure to infer the variance components of the model. Although many implementations of the ReML procedure are readily available, there is still need for computational improvements due to the ever-increasing size of the datasets to be handled, and to the complexity of the models to be adjusted. In this paper, we present a Min-Max (MM) algorithm for ReML inference and combine it with several speed-up procedures. The ReML MM algorithm we present is compared to 5 state-of-the-art publicly available algorithms used in statistical genetics. The computational performance of the different algorithms are evaluated on several datasets representing different plant breeding experimental designs. The MM algorithm ranks among the top 2 methods in almost all settings and is more versatile than many of its competitors. The MM algorithm is a promising alternative to the classical AI-ReML algorithm in the context of variance component mixed models. It is available in the MM4LMM R-package.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Endogenously produced catecholamines improve the regulatory function of TLR9-activated B cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nadine Honke, Torsten Lowin, Birgit Opgenoorth, Namir Shaabani, Alexander Lautwein, John R. Teijaro, Matthias Schneider, Georg Pongratz</p>

The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) contributes to immune balance by promoting anti-inflammatory B cells. However, whether B cells possess a self-regulating mechanism by which they modulate regulatory B cell (Breg) function is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the ability of B cells to synthesize their own catecholamines upon stimulation with different B cell activators and found that expression of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), required to generate catecholamines, is up-regulated by Toll-like receptor (TLR)9. This TLR9-dependent expression of TH correlated with up-regulation of adrenergic receptors (ADRs), enhanced interleukin (IL)-10 production, and overexpression of the co-inhibitory ligands programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Fas ligand (FasL). Moreover, concomitant stimulation of ß1-3-ADRs together with a B cell receptor (BCR)/TLR9 stimulus clearly enhances the anti-inflammatory potential of Bregs to suppress CD4 T cells, a crucial population in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Furthermore, TH up-regulation was also demonstrated in B cells during the course of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a mouse model for the investigation of RA. In conclusion, our data show that B cells possess an autonomous mechanism to modulate their regulatory function in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. These findings help to better understand the function of B cells in the regulation of autoimmune diseases and the interplay of SNS.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of pulsed electromagnetic field versus pulsed high intensity laser in the treatment of men with osteopenia or osteoporosis: a randomized controlled trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Osteoporosis has been related to a negative impact on several aspects of patient health, including physical, mental, and emotional well-being. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) and pulsed Nd-YAG laser therapy (HILT) on men with osteopenia or osteoporosis.   Methods: Ninety-five men with osteopenia or osteoporosis (mean age, 52 years; mean height, 176 cm; mean weight, 83 kg; mean body-mass index (BMI), 26.86 kg/m2) took part in the study, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 received PEMF and exercise program (PEMF +EX), Group 2 received HILT and exercise program (HILT+EX), and Group 3 received exercise program only (EX). PEMF was applied three times per week for 12 weeks using a full-body mat, while HILT was applied to the lower back and hip regions with a total dose of energy of 3000 J delivered in two treatment stages. Flexibility, aerobic exercise, strength, weight-bearing, and balance exercises are included in exercise program, which is followed by whole-body vibration training. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the total hip and lumbar spine, bone markers, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and fall risk are all outcome measures. Results: There were no significant differences in the parameters between the groups at the baseline (P > 0.05). Patients in all groups, however, showed significant improvements in all measured parameters following treatment (P< 0.05), with Group 1 and Group 2 showing much greater improvements than Group 3. Conclusion: After 12-weeks of treatment, PEMF combined with exercise is more effective than HILT combined with exercise or exercise alone in increasing BMD and promoting bone formation, suppressing bone-resorption markers, and improving quality of life and fall risk, with the effects lasting up to six months. This study was registered in the ClinicalTrial.gov PRS (NCT05029440, 26/08/2021).

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cardiac arrest (CA) is a major health burden with brain damage being a significant contributor to mortality. We found lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), including a species containing docosahexaenoic acid (LPC-DHA), was significantly decreased in plasma post-CA, supplementation of which significantly improved neurological outcomes. The aim of this study is to understand the protective role of LPC-DHA supplementation on the brain post-CA.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We first evaluated associations between the plasma level of LPC-DHA and neurological injury and outcomes of human patients with CA. We then utilized a rat CA model and cell cultures to investigate therapeutic and mechanistic aspects of plasma LPC-DHA supplementation.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that decreased plasma LPC-DHA was strongly associated with neurological outcomes and disappearance of the difference between gray and white matter in the brain after CA in human patients. In rats, the decreased plasma LPC-DHA was associated with decreased levels of brain LPC-DHA after CA, and supplementing plasma LPC-DHA normalized brain levels of LPC-DHA and alleviated neuronal cell death, activation of astrocytes, and expression of various inflammatory and mitochondrial dynamics genes. We also observed deceased severity of metabolic alterations with LPC-DHA supplementation using untargeted metabolomics analysis. Furthermore, LPC treatment showed a similar protective effect for neurons and astrocytes in mixed primary brain cell cultures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The observed neuroprotection accompanied with normalized brain LPC-DHA level by plasma supplementation implicate the importance of preventing the decrease of brain LPC-DHA post-CA for attenuating brain injury. Furthermore, the data supports the causative role of decreased plasma LPC-DHA for brain damage after CA. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Outcome of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy treated by Interleukin‐ 7</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Restoring anti-JC virus (JCV) immunity is the only treatment of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Interleukin-7 is a cytokine that increases number and function of T cells. We analyzed a population of PML patients who received recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) to estimate survival and its determinants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>After exclusion of patients with missing data or receiving other immunotherapies, findings from 64 patients with proven PML who received rhIL-7 between 2007 and 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Logistic regression was used to analyze variables associated with one-year survival.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Underlying conditions were HIV/AIDS (n = 27, 42%), hematological malignancies (n = 16, 25%), primary immunodeficiencies (n = 13, 20%), solid organ transplantation (n = 4, 6%) and chronic inflammatory diseases (n = 4, 6%). One-year survival was 54.7% and did not differ by underlying condition. Survival was not associated with baseline characteristics, but with a &gt; 50% increase in blood lymphocytes (OR 4.1, 95%CI 1.2–14.9) and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (OR 5.9, 95%CI 1.7–23.3), and a &gt; 1 log copies/mL decrease in cerebrospinal fluid JCV DNA (OR 7.6, 95%CI 1.6–56.1) during the first month after rhIL-7 initiation. Side effects were mainly local and flu-like symptoms (n = 8, 12.5%) and PML-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (n = 5, 8%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this non-controlled retrospective study, survival did not differ from that expected in HIV/AIDS patients, but might have been improved in those with hematological malignancies, primary immunodeficiencies and transplant recipients. RhIL-7 might have contributed to the increase in blood lymphocytes and decrease of CSF JCV replication that were associated with better survival.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Estimating the sample size of sham-controlled randomized controlled trials using existing evidence [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the power is often ‘reverse engineered’ based on the number of participants that can realistically be achieved. An attractive alternative is planning a new trial conditional on the available evidence; a design of particular interest in RCTs that use a sham control arm (sham-RCTs). Methods: We explore the design of sham-RCTs, the role of sequential meta-analysis and  conditional planning in a systematic review of renal sympathetic denervation for patients with arterial hypertension. The main efficacy endpoint was mean change in 24-hour systolic blood pressure. We performed sequential meta-analysis to identify the time point where the null hypothesis would be rejected in a prospective scenario. Evidence-based conditional sample size calculations were performed based on fixed-effect meta-analysis. Results: In total, six sham-RCTs (981 participants) were identified. The first RCT was considerably larger (535 participants) than those subsequently published (median sample size of 80). All trial sample sizes were calculated assuming an unrealistically large intervention effect which resulted in low power when each study is considered as a stand-alone experiment. Sequential meta-analysis provided firm evidence against the null hypothesis with the synthesis of the first four trials (755 patients, cumulative mean difference -2.75 (95%CI -4.93 to -0.58) favoring the active intervention)). Conditional planning resulted in much larger sample sizes compared to those in the original trials, due to overoptimistic expected effects made by the investigators in individual trials, and potentially a time-effect association. Conclusions: Sequential meta-analysis of sham-RCTs can reach conclusive findings earlier and hence avoid exposing patients to sham-related risks. Conditional planning of new sham-RCTs poses important challenges as many surgical/minimally invasive procedures improve over time, the intervention effect is expected to increase in new studies and this violates the underlying assumptions. Unless this is accounted for, conditional planning will not improve the design of sham-RCTs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of the knowledge, attitudes and practices of Lebanese shoppers towards food labeling: The first steps in the Nutri-score roadmap [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Food labeling is a fundamental educational tool for advocating for public awareness. It emphasizes knowledge of the nutrient content of food and thus directs the choice towards the healthiest food products. This cross-sectional survey aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding nutrition label use in Lebanon through a valid questionnaire. Methods: Overall, 768 participants (mean age: 30.8 ±12, males: 60.2%) were recruited randomly between February and May 2020. We used word of mouth and social media to recruit our sample population. Results: Social media was the most accessed tool to attain nutrition information by responders (39.8%). More than half the participants expressed positive attitudes to check information related to sugars (66.4%), vitamins (64.9%), total fats (61.7%), proteins (59.1%), and calories (58.7%) on the food label. Expiry date, price, and brand name were the top three considerations while reading food labels. About half (46.5%) reported to “always” look at the food label. Responders reported reading labels related primarily to sugars (44.3%), calories (38.8%), and total fats (36.8%). The optimal total KAP score was 46; our findings revealed a mean KAP score of 14.46 ±7 (31.4%). When categorizing the KAP scores, 15% had high scores, and 85% scored low. Spearman’s coefficients showed positive correlations between knowledge-attitude, knowledge-practice, and attitude-practice scores, with p<0.001. The regression analysis revealed that gender, age, BMI, residency area, educational level, university degree, health and diet statuses, and activity level were significant predictors of the KAP score. Being on a diet had the highest odds (OR=3.107, CI=1.904-5.072, p<0.001). Conclusion: The low awareness of food labels leads Lebanese people to choose unhealthy food options. A planned educational program is recommended to ease the interpretation of these labels.

                Background: Rainfall is the main source of water on the earth’s surface. It infiltrates and percolates deep into the soil for groundwater recharge. Rainfall patterns, amounts, durations, and intensities can vary daily, monthly, annually, and spatially. It is therefore important to accurately estimate rainfall return periods, which can be employed in hydraulic design and flood control measures. Methods: This research considered the survival analysis approach for the prediction of rainfall return periods including intensity, and months during which these would occur in south-western Nigeria. Twenty years’ of annual rainfall data were obtained from three metrological stations and these were subjected to nine different probability plotting position methods.  Results from the plotting positions was further subjected to four  survival models using five years of censor time. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used to determine the best-fitting model for the dataset. Results: The Laplace probability plotting position in conjunction with the log-logistic distribution best describes the datasets, since it gave the lowest AIC value of 22.53. The log-logistic distribution is also suitable for the prediction of return period from the Weibull probability plotting position since the AIC values were 6.934 and -4.332 respectively.  The Hirsh plotting position in conjunction with the Weibull distribution is also suitable for the description of the dataset. Conclusion: The established parametric models are suitable for the accurate prediction of return periods of peak rainfall events during any month of the year.

The demographic information of the data was analysed and the softcopy of the data uploaded to the Mendeley database for easy retrieval after deidentification (see Data Availability statement). The associated questionnaire can be found in the extended data. In Africa, this appears to be the broadest dataset associated with academics’ perception of utilizing digital platforms for research sharing. This implies that scholars can use this dataset to quantitatively analyse the extent to which different internet-based platforms are being utilized for research communication. Considering the current restrictions on in-person social gatherings due to COVID-19, researchers working on related studies may readily utilize this set of data, saving time and cost. A comprehensive but non-exhaustive number of 20 online platforms were assessed based on academics' awareness and current engagement with them, and the challenges they have faced using them. This offers a wide range of areas for studies to be anchored. Furthermore, researchers interested in specific online platforms can also evaluate the extent to which academic staff in African universities are aware of and willing to utilize them for research dissemination. This data will enable scholars and researchers in Africa and beyond to understand the extent to which academics in varsities are willing to adopt digital repositories for research sharing in the context of Africa.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Reduction in Cognitive Processing Speed Surrounding Multiple Sclerosis Relapse</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore the longitudinal relationship between multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses and information processing efficiency among persons with relapsing–remitting MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a Swedish nationwide cohort study of persons with incident relapsing–remitting MS (2001–2019). Relapse information and symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) scores were obtained from the Swedish MS Registry. Follow-up was categorized into 2 periods based on relapse status: “relapse” (90 days pre-relapse to 730 days post-relapse, subdivided into 10 periods) and “remission.” Linear mixed models compared SDMT scores during the relapse periods to SDMT scores recorded during remission (reference) with results reported as β-coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for age, sex, SDMT type (written vs oral), time-varying, disease-modifying therapy exposure and sequence of SDMT.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 10.7 (4.3) years, 31,529 distinct SDMTs were recorded among 3,877 persons with MS. There was a significant decline in information processing efficiency that lasted from 30 days pre-relapse up to 550 days post-relapse, with the largest decline occurring 0 to 30 days post-relapse (β-coefficient: −4.00 (95% CI = −4.61 to −3.39), relative to the period of remission.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found evidence of cognitive change up to 1 month prior to relapse onset. The reduction in SDMT lasted 1.5 years and was clinically significant up to 3 months post-relapse. These results suggest that the effects of a relapse on cognition are longer than previously thought and highlight the importance of reducing relapse rates as a potential means of preserving cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Cortical correlates of gait compensation strategies in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Gait impairment in persons with Parkinson's disease is common and debilitating. Compensation strategies (e.g. external cues) are an essential part of rehabilitation, but their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using EEG, we explored the cortical correlates of three categories of strategies: external cueing, internal cueing, and action observation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eighteen participants with Parkinson's disease and gait impairment were included. We recorded 126-channel EEG both during stance and gait on a treadmill under four conditions: (1) uncued; (2) external cueing (listening to a metronome); (3) internal cueing (silent rhythmic counting); and (4) action observation (observing another person walking). To control for the effects of sensory processing of the cues, we computed relative power changes as the difference in power spectral density between walking and standing for each condition.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Relative to uncued gait, the use of all three compensation strategies induced a decrease of beta band activity in sensorimotor areas, indicative of increased cortical activation. Parieto-occipital alpha band activity decreased with external and internal cueing, and increased with action observation. Only internal cueing induced a change in frontal cortical activation, showing a decrease of beta band activity compared to uncued gait.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The application of compensation strategies resulted in changed cortical activity compared to uncued gait, which could not be solely attributed to sensory processing of the cueing modality. Our findings suggest there are multiple routes to control gait, and different compensation strategies seem to rely on different cortical mechanisms to achieve enhanced central motor activation in persons with Parkinson's disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sensing complementary temporal features of odor signals enhances navigation of diverse turbulent plumes</a></h4>

              
                We and others have shown that during odor plume navigation, walking <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> bias their motion upwind in response to both the frequency of their encounters with the odor (Demir et al., 2020), and the intermittency of the odor signal, which we define to be the fraction of time the signal is above a detection threshold (Alvarez-Salvado et al., 2018). Here we combine and simplify previous mathematical models that recapitulated these data to investigate the benefits of sensing both of these temporal features, and how these benefits depend on the spatiotemporal statistics of the odor plume. Through agent-based simulations, we find that navigators that only use frequency or intermittency perform well in some environments - achieving maximal performance when gains are near those inferred from experiment - but fail in others. Robust performance across diverse environments requires both temporal modalities. However, we also find a steep tradeoff when using both sensors simultaneously, suggesting a strong benefit to modulating how much each sensor is weighted, rather than using both in a fixed combination across plumes. Finally, we show that the circuitry of the <i>Drosophila </i>olfactory periphery naturally enables simultaneous intermittency and frequency sensing, enhancing robust navigation through a diversity of odor environments. Together, our results suggest that the first stage of olfactory processing selects and encodes temporal features of odor signals critical to real-world navigation tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dynamics and nanoscale organization of the postsynaptic endocytic zone at excitatory synapses</a></h4>

              
                At postsynaptic sites of neurons, a prominent clathrin-coated structure, the endocytic zone (EZ), controls the trafficking of glutamate receptors and is essential for synaptic plasticity. Despite its importance, little is known about how this clathrin structure is organized to mediate endocytosis. We used live-cell and super-resolution microscopy to reveal the dynamic organization of this poorly understood clathrin structure in rat hippocampal neurons. We found that a subset of endocytic proteins only transiently appeared at postsynaptic sites. In contrast, other proteins were persistently enriched and partitioned at the edge of the EZ. We found that uncoupling the EZ from the synapse led to the loss of most of these components, while disrupting interactions with the actin cytoskeleton or membrane did not alter EZ positioning. Finally, we found that plasticity-inducing stimuli promoted the reorganization of the EZ. We conclude that the EZ is a stable, highly organized molecular platform where components are differentially recruited and positioned to orchestrate the endocytosis of synaptic receptors.
