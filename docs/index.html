              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">"Acute Kidney Injury predictive models: advanced yet far from application in resource-constrained settings." [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients, particularly critically ill patients. It poses a public health challenge in resource-constrained settings due to high administrative costs. AKI is commonly misdiagnosed due to its painless onset and late disruption of serum creatinine, which is the gold standard biomarker for AKI diagnosis. There is increasing research into the use of early biomarkers and the development of predictive models for early AKI diagnosis using clinical, laboratory, and imaging data. This field note provides insight into the challenges of using available AKI prediction models in resource-constrained environments, as well as perspectives that practitioners in these settings may find useful

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, and the mechanism of its occurrence is still not fully elucidated. Accumulating evidence has suggested that the gut acts as a potential origin of PD pathogenesis. Recent studies have identified that inflammatory bowel disease acts as a risk factor for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The aim of this study was to further explore the molecular mechanism between PD and Crohn&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (CD). The gene expression profiles of PD (GSE6613) and CD (GSE119600) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and were identified as the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two diseases. Next, analyses were performed, including functional enrichment analysis, a protein&amp;amp;ndash;protein interaction network, core genes identification, and clinical correlation analysis. As a result, 178 common DEGs (113 upregulated genes and 65 downregulated genes) were found between PD and CD. The functional analysis found that they were enriched in regulated exocytosis, immune response, and lipid binding. Twelve essential hub genes including BUB1B, BUB3, DLGAP5, AURKC, CBL, PCNA, RAF1, LYN, RPL39L, MRPL13, RSL24D1, and MRPS11 were identified from the PPI network by using cytoHubba. In addition, inflammatory and metabolic pathways were jointly involved in these two diseases. After verifying expression levels in an independent dataset (GSE99039), a correlation analysis with clinical features showed that LYN and RAF1 genes were associated with the severity of PD. In conclusion, our study revealed the common pathogenesis of PD and CD. These common pathways and hub genes may provide novel insights for mechanism research.</p>

	<p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are being used in patients with various advanced malignancies, and patient outcomes have improved considerably. Although ICIs can effectively treat tumors, 30&amp;amp;ndash;60% of patients experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a rare irAE that has become a novel topic in neuroimmunology and has received increasing attention in recent years. Herein, we report a rare case of GAD65-antibody&amp;amp;ndash;associated AE after metastatic small cell lung cancer treatment with pembrolizumab. The patient received IVIg therapy for AE and continuous pembrolizumab therapy without suspension of tumor treatment. At 1 year follow-up, both the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s AE symptoms and tumors were stable. We consider that the treatment of ICI-associated AE should be more individualized with prudent decision-making and should balance the tumor progression and AE treatment. In addition, we have also comprehensively reviewed the literature of ICI-associated AE, and summarized the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of AE caused by ICI, thus broadening our understanding of the neurological complications caused by ICI.</p>

	<p>Central venous catheters (CVCs) are increasingly used across specialties for invasive haemodynamic monitoring and for the delivery of fluids, medications, and nutritional support. Cerebral air embolism (CAE) is a rare but potentially fatal complication associated with the insertion, maintenance, and removal of CVCs. It can occur through different mechanisms, including the direct retrograde ascension of air into the cerebral veins and paradoxical embolism due to a right-to-left intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunt. The &amp;amp;ldquo;hand-knob&amp;amp;rdquo; area is the cortical region within the primary motor cortex that contains the representation of the hand. It is located in the superior precentral gyrus and is the site of less than 1% of all ischaemic strokes. We report here the case of a patient who experienced an ischaemic stroke of the right &amp;amp;ldquo;hand-knob&amp;amp;rdquo; area, due to paradoxical CAE through a previously undiagnosed patent foramen ovale (PFO), after the insertion of a catheter in the right internal jugular vein. We also provide an overview of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of CAE. Suspecting CAE in the case of an acute neurological event occurring in close temporal relationship with central venous catheterization is paramount to allow the early recognition and treatment of this uncommon form of iatrogenic stroke.</p>

                Elko et al. use a multiplexed assay to track epitope-specific antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccination. They identify conserved sites where antibodies cross-recognize endemic coronaviruses, but with divergent kinetics compared to SARS-CoV-2. The evolving recognition of polymorphic residues within otherwise conserved sites may influence the formation of broadly neutralizing antibodies.

                Tau and -synuclein are major players in neurodegenerative diseases, but their physiological role, particularly in dendrites, is poorly understood. Here we show that, surprisingly, lack of tau protein induces the development of a more elaborate dendritic arbor of hippocampal pyramidal cells in organotypic tissue. Using high-speed volumetric lattice light-sheet microscopy and single particle tracking, we found a more directional KIF1A-mediated transport in dendrites of Tau KO cells. Increased transport processivity correlated with longer and straighter dendritic microtubules as revealed by three-dimensional super-resolution microscopy of cultured hippocampal neurons. Unbiased mass spectrometric analysis of tissue showed highly increased expression of -synuclein in Tau KO hippocampi. Overexpression of -synuclein mimicked the transport characteristics observed in Tau KO cells. Our data indicate that tau and -synuclein shape microtubule-dependent transport in neuronal dendrites, thereby promoting dendritic arborization during maturation. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that transport efficiency and length and straightness of microtubules are correlated.

                Dravet syndrome (DS), an intractable childhood epileptic encephalopathy with a high fatality rate, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in one allele of SCN1A, which encodes Nav1.1. In contrast to other epilepsies, pharmaceutical treatment for DS is limited. Here, we demonstrate that viral vector-mediated delivery of a codon-modified SCN1A cDNA improves DS comorbidities in juvenile and adolescent DS mice (Scn1aA1783V/WT). Notably, bilateral vector injections into the hippocampus or thalamus of DS mice improved the survival of the mice, reduced the occurrence of epileptic spikes, provided protection from thermally-induced seizures, and corrected background electrocorticography activity. Together, our results provide a proof-of-concept for the potential of SCN1A delivery as a therapeutic approach for infants and adolescents with DS-associated comorbidities.

                Among the cues that a mosquito uses to find a host for blood-feeding, the smell of the host plays an important role. Previous studies have shown that host odors contain hundreds of chemical odorants, which are detected by different receptors on the peripheral sensory organs of mosquitoes. But how individual odorants are encoded by downstream neurons in the mosquito brain is not known. We developed an in vivo preparation for patch-clamp electrophysiology to record from projection neurons and local neurons in the antennal lobe of Aedes aegypti. Combining intracellular recordings with dye-fills, morphological reconstructions, and immunohistochemistry, we identify different sub-classes of antennal lobe neurons and their putative interactions. Our recordings show that an odorant can activate multiple neurons innervating different glomeruli, and that the stimulus identity and its behavioral preference are represented in the population activity of the projection neurons. Our results provide the first detailed description of olfactory neurons in the central nervous system of mosquitoes and lay a foundation for understanding the neural basis of their olfactory behaviors.

                In multiple sclerosis and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, both resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages contribute to demyelination as well as spontaneous remyelination. Nevertheless, the specific roles of microglia versus macrophages are unknown. We investigated the influence of microglia in EAE using the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor, PLX5622, to deplete microglial population and Ccr2RFP/+ fmsEGFP/+ mice, to distinguish peripheral macrophages and microglia. PLX5622 treatment depleted microglia and meningeal macrophages, and provoked a massive infiltration of CCR2+ macrophages into demyelinating lesions and spinal cord parenchyma. PLX5622 treatment did not alter EAE chronic phase. In contrast, microglia and meningeal macrophages depletion reduced the expression of CD80 co-stimulatory molecule in dendritic and myeloid cells and reduced T cell reactivation and proliferation in the spinal cord parenchyma, inducing a significant delay in EAE onset. Altogether, these data points to a specific role of CNS microglia meningeal macrophages in antigen presentation and T cell reactivation at initial stages of the EAE model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A low-cost device for cryoanesthesia of neonate rodents</a></h4>

              
                Studying the development of neural circuits in rodent models requires surgical access to the neonatal brain. Since commercially available stereotaxic and anesthetic equipment is designed for use in adults, reliable targeting of brain structures in such young animals can be challenging. Hypothermic cooling (cryoanesthesia) has been used as a preferred anesthesia approach in neonates. This commonly involves submerging neonates in ice, an approach that is poorly controllable and potentially stressful to animals. We have developed an affordable, simple to construct device - CryoPup - that allows for fast and robust cryoanesthesia of rodent pups. CryoPup consists of a microcontroller controlling a Peltier element and a heat exchanger. It is capable of both cooling and heating, thereby also functioning as a heating pad during recovery. Importantly, it has been designed for size compatibility with common stereotaxic frames. This open-source device will facilitate future studies into the development of neural circuits in the postnatal brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Overall patterns of eye-specific retino-geniculo-cortical projections to layers III, IV and VI in primary visual cortex of the prosimian galago, and correlation with cytochrome oxidase blobs.</a></h4>

              
                Studies in galago have not provided a comprehensive description of the organization of eye specific retino-geniculate-cortical projections to the recipient layers in V1. Here we demonstrate the overall patterns of ocular dominance domains in layers III, IV and VI revealed after injecting the transneuronal tracer wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into one eye. We also correlate these patterns with the array of cytochrome oxidase (CO) blobs in tangential sections through the unfolded and flattened cortex. In layer IV, we observed for the first time that eye-specific domains form an interconnected pattern of bands 200-250 um wide arranged such that they do not show orientation bias and do not meet the V1 border at right angles, as is the case in macaques. We also observed distinct patterns of ocular dominance patches in layer III and layer VI. The patches in layer III, likely corresponding to patches of K LGN input described previously, align with layer IV ocular dominance columns (ODCs) of the same eye dominance. Moreover, the layer III patches overlap partially with virtually all CO blobs in both hemispheres, implying that CO blobs receive K LGN input from both eyes. Finally, we found that CO blobs straddle the border between neighboring layer IV ODCs. These results, together with studies showing that a high percentage of cells in CO blobs are monocular, suggest that CO blobs consist of ipsilateral and contralateral subregions that are in register with underlying layer IV ocular dominance columns of the same eye dominance. In macaques and humans, CO blobs are centered on ODCs in layer IV. Our finding that CO blobs in galago straddle the border of neighboring layer IV ODCs suggests that this may represent an alternative way by which visual information is processed by eye specific modular architecture in mammalian V1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Along-tract quantification of resting-state BOLD hemodynamic response functions in white matter</a></h4>

              
                Detailed knowledge of the BOLD hemodynamic response function (HRF) is crucial for accurate analysis and interpretation of functional MRI data. Considerable efforts have been made to characterize the HRF in gray matter (GM) but much less is known about BOLD effects in white matter (WM). However, recent reports have demonstrated reliable detection and analyses of WM BOLD signals after stimulation and in a resting state. WM and GM differ in energy requirements and blood flow, so neurovascular couplings may well be different. We aimed to derive a comprehensive characterization of the HRF in WM across a population, including accurate measurements of its shape and its variation along and between WM pathways, using resting-state fMRI acquisitions. Our results show that the HRF is significantly different between WM and GM. Features of the HRF, such as a prominent initial dip, show strong relationships with features of the tissue microstructure derived from diffusion imaging, and these relationships differ between WM and GM, consistent with BOLD signal fluctuations reflecting different energy demands and differences in neurovascular coupling between tissues of different composition. We also show that the HRF varies significantly along WM pathways, and is different between different WM pathways. Thus, much like in GM, changes in flow and/or oxygenation are different for different parts of the WM. These features of the HRF in WM are especially relevant for interpretation of the biophysical basis of BOLD effects in WM.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long wavelength light reduces the negative consequences of dim light at night in the Cntnap2 mouse model of autism.</a></h4>

              
                Many patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show disturbances in their sleep/wake cycles, and may be particularly vulnerable to the impact of circadian disruptors. We have previously shown that exposure to dim light at night (DLaN) in contactin associated protein-like 2 knock out (Cntnap2 KO) mice disrupts diurnal rhythms, increases repetitive behaviors while reducing social interactions. These negative effects of DLaN may be mediated by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to blue light (480nm). In this study, we used a light-emitting diode (LED) array that enabled us to shift the spectral properties of the DLaN while keeping the intensity at 10 lx. First, using wild-type (WT) mice, we confirmed that the short-wavelength enriched lighting produced a strong acute suppression of locomotor activity (masking), a robust light-induced phase shifts and c-Fos expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, while the long-wavelength enriched lighting evoked much weaker responses. Furthermore, exposure of WT mice to the short-wavelength light at night reduced the amplitude of locomotor activity rhythms and impaired social interactions. Mice lacking the melanopsin expressing ipRGCs (Opn4DTA mice) were resistant to these negative effects of DLaN. Importantly, the shift of the DLaN stimulus to longer wavelengths ameliorated the negative impact on the activity rhythms and autistic behaviors (i.e. reciprocal social interactions, repetitive grooming) of the Cntnap2 KO model. The short-, but not the long-wavelength enriched, DLaN triggered cFos expression in the peri-habenula region as well as in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Finally, DLaN-driven c-Fos induction in BLA glutamatergic neurons was about 3-fold higher in the Cntnap2 KO mice, suggesting that these cells may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of photic disruption. Broadly, our findings suggest that the spectral properties of light at night should be considered in the management of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Masked target visibility is selectively impaired by 20 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation</a></h4>

              
                It has been proposed that both conscious and unconscious perception are associated with a feedforward sweep of oscillatory activity in the gamma band (>40 Hz), while conscious perception also requires recurrent feedback via beta band (~20 Hz) oscillations. To investigate the causal relationship between these oscillations and (un)conscious visual perception, we assessed the effect of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in the gamma (40 Hz) and beta (20 Hz) bands on the objective and subjective visibility of targets in a metacontrast backward masking task. We expected that 40hz-tACS would affect both the correct categorization of the target (i.e. objective visibility) and the reports of conscious perception (i.e. subjective visibility). Moreover, we expected that 20Hz-tACS would selectively affect the subjective visibility. Our results showed that target visibility was selectively compromised by 20Hz-tACS but, in contrast to our hypothesis, this effect was specific to objective visibility. Although the power of local beta oscillations increased after 20Hz-tACS, inter-areal beta synchrony could have nevertheless been impaired, a possibility that should be investigated in the future by means of source reconstructed high density electroencephalography recordings. In summary, we provided evidence supporting that 20Hz-tACS is capable of modulating target visibility, suggesting a possible a causal link between synchrony in this frequency band and visual perception. Future studies could build upon this result by investigating other forms of stimulation and other model organisms, further contributing to our knowledge of how conscious access causally depends on brain oscillations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Longitudinal brain studies in adult zebrafish by MRI</a></h4>

              
                Zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been successfully used for decades in developmental studies and disease modelling. The remarkable intake of zebrafish as a model system is partly due to its transparency during the early weeks of its development, allowing in vivo imaging of cellular and molecular processes. However, this key advantage wears off when tissues become opaque as the animal reaches juvenile and adult stages, rendering access to tissues for live imaging and longitudinal studies difficult. Here we aimed to provide a novel approach to image and assess tissue integrity of adult zebrafish using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) on live zebrafish suitable for longitudinal studies. We built a 3D-printed life support chamber and designed a protocol-directed sedation regime to recover adult zebrafish post scanning in a 9.4T MRI scanner. Our life support chamber is cheap and easy to create using 3D printing, allowing other groups to copy our template for quick setup. Additionally, we optimised the delivery of contrast agent to enhance brain signals in order to refine current delivery, usually delivered by intravenous in rodents. We show here that immersion in gadolinium was a viable alternative to intraperitoneal injection to reduce T1 relaxation times. This could lead to improved image contrast in adult zebrafish disease models. In conclusion, we provide here a detailed methodology to allow longitudinal studies of brain tissue integrity of adult zebrafish, combining safe and efficient delivery of contrast agent and live MRI. This technique can be used to bridge the gap between in vivo studies and longitudinal brain analysis in adult zebrafish which can be applied to the ever-growing number of adult zebrafish models of ageing and neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Doing what's not wanted: Conflict in incentives and misallocation of behavioural control lead to drug-seeking despite adverse outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Despite being aware of negative consequences and wanting to quit, long-term addicts find it difficult to quit seeking and consuming drugs. This inconsistency between the (often compulsive) behavioural patterns and the explicit knowledge of negative consequences represents a cognitive conflict which is a central characteristic of addiction. Neurobiologically, differential cue-induced activity in distinct striatal subregions, as well as the dopamine connectivity spiraling from ventral striatal regions to the dorsal regions, play critical roles in compulsive drug seeking. The focus of this work is to illustrate the mechanisms that lead to a cognitive conflict and it's impact on actions taken i.e. addictive choices. We propose an algorithmic model that captures how the action choices that the agent makes when reinforced with drug-rewards become incongruent with the presence of negative consequences that often follow those choices. We advance the understanding of having a decision hierarchy in representing "cognitive control" and how lack of such control at higher-level in the hierarchy could potentially lead to consolidated drug-seeking habits. We further propose a cost-benefit based arbitration scheme, which mediates the allocation of control across different levels of the decision-making hierarchy. Lastly, we discuss how our work on extending a computational model to an algorithmic one, could in turn also helps us improve the understanding of how drugs hijack the dopamine-spiralling circuit at an implementation level.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Specific detection and deletion of the Sigma-1 receptor in neurons and glial cells for functional characterization in vivo</a></h4>

              
                The chaperon protein sigma-1 receptor (S1R) has been discovered over forty years ago. Recent pharmacological studies using S1R exogenous ligands demonstrated a promising therapeutical potential of targeting the S1R for several neurological disorders. Although intensive in vitro studies have revealed S1Rs are mainly residing at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the cell-specific in vivo expression pattern of S1Rs is still unclear, mainly due to the lack of a reliable detection method which also prevented a comprehensive functional analysis. Here, first, we identified a highly specific antibody using S1R knockout (KO) mice and established an immunohistochemical protocol involving a 1% SDS antigen retrieval step. Second, we characterized the S1R expression in the mouse brain and can demonstrate that the S1R is widely expressed: in principal neurons, interneurons, and all glial cell types. Finally, we generated a novel Cre-dependent S1R conditional KO mouse (S1R flox) to study cell type-specific functions of the S1R. As a proof of concept, we successfully ablated S1R expressions in neurons or microglia employing neuronal and microglial Cre-expressing mice, respectively. In summary, we provide powerful tools to cell-specifically detect, delete and functionally characterize S1R in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intraoperative Spinal Cord Stimulation Mitigates Pain after Spine Surgery in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Managing postoperative pain after spine surgery is challenging, and up to 40% of operated patients develop failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) resulting in intractable back and/or leg pain. While spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been shown to effectively alleviate such chronic pain, it is unknown if intraoperative SCS can mitigate the development of central sensitization that potentially causes intense postoperative pain and FBSS after spine surgery. Methods: As an experimental spine surgery, unilateral T13 laminectomy was performed in mice to expose the dorsal part of L4-5 spinal segments that receive sensory inputs from the hind limb. After the laminectomy, a group of mice received intraoperative SCS epidurally applied to the exposed side of the dorsal part of the spinal cord for an hour under anesthesia before closing the surgical wounds. Secondary mechanical hypersensitivity, a behavioral manifestation of central sensitization, was measured in hind paws using von Frey assay one day before and at predetermined times after surgery. In addition, because von Frey assay is a nocifensive reflex-based analysis that primarily assesses the sensory-discriminative domain of pain, we also performed a conflict avoidance test to capture the affective-motivational domain of pain at selected timepoints post-laminectomy. Results: Mice that underwent unilateral T13 laminectomy developed mechanical hypersensitivity in both hind paws, which gradually resolved in 1-2 weeks. The extent of the hypersensitivity was significantly less in the contralateral hind paw (relative to the laminectomy) than in the ipsilateral hind paw only in females. Intraoperative SCS applied to the exposed side of the dorsal -spinal cord significantly inhibited the development of hind paw mechanical hypersensitivity only in the SCS-applied side. When paws were mechanically stimulated in their preferred place to present a conflict between pain/discomfort and natural preference, mice avoided the conflict after laminectomy, spending less time in the place than before the surgery. However, mice treated with intraoperative SCS after laminectomy did not avoid the conflict. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that spine surgery for unilateral laminectomy induces central sensitization that results in postoperative pain hypersensitivity. Intraoperative SCS after laminectomy can mitigate the development of this hypersensitivity on the SCS-applied side.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of Aversive Classical Conditioning on Pupil Dilation and Microsaccades</a></h4>

              
                Unintentional shifts of gaze and the modulation of pupil size are both highly automated processes that serve to regulate the initial influx of visual information. The present work investigated these mechanisms as they came to differentially respond to initially unthreatening stimuli following aversive conditioning. The classical conditioning experimental paradigm employed simple grating stimuli (Gabor patches) shown individually at various (5) on-screen locations, one of which was paired with a noxious auditory unconditioned stimulus (US). Aversively paired Gabor patches elicited an attenuated initial constriction of the pupil (pupillary light response; PLR) along with more rapid re-dilation compared to otherwise identical but unpaired gratings. Modulation of both the PLR and the rate of re-dilation following conditioning showed pronounced individual differences. Rapid eye movements away from fixation (microsaccades) were suppressed for the aversively associated compared to unassociated stimulus locations at several post-stimulus latencies. Mutual information between pupil dilation and microsaccade rate, meanwhile, did not differ between the aversively associated and unassociated visual on-screen locations. Together, these results suggest that measures of pupil diameter and microsaccade rate supply complementary information on early-stage processes of associative learning through experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stability of steady-state visual evoked potential contrast response functions</a></h4>

              
                A repeated measure of neural activity that is stable over time when unperturbed is needed to be able to meaningfully measure neuroplastic changes in the brain. With sensory-evoked potentials in particular, repeated presentation of stimuli can generate neuroplasticity by itself under certain conditions. We assessed the repeated-measure within-day and across-day stability of the steady-state visual-evoked potential (ssVEP), a high signal-to-noise electrophysiological readout of neural activity in human visual cortex, in preparation for studies of visual cortical neuroplasticity. Steady-state VEP contrast-sweep responses were measured daily for 4 days (four 20-trial blocks per day, 22 participants). Response amplitudes were stable in individual participants, with measured across-block and across-day coefficients of variation (CV= SD / Mean) of 12+/-1% and 19+/-2%, respectively. No consistent changes in response amplitude were observed either across blocks or across days. We conclude that contrast-sweep steady-state VEPs provide a stable human neurophysiological measure well-suited for repeated-measures studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TMS-evoked responses are driven by recurrent large-scale network dynamics</a></h4>

              
                A major question in systems and cognitive neuroscience is to what extent neurostimulation responses are driven by recurrent activity. This question finds sharp relief in the case of TMS-EEG evoked potentials (TEPs). TEPs are spatiotemporal waveform patterns with characteristic inflections at [~]50ms, [~]100ms, and [~]150-200ms following a single TMS pulse that disperse from, and later reconverge to, the primary stimulated regions. What parts of the TEP are due to recurrent activity? And what light might this shed on more general principles of brain organization? We studied this using source-localized TMS-EEG analyses and whole-brain connectome-based computational modelling. Results indicated that recurrent network feedback begins to drive TEP responses from [~]100ms post-stimulation, with earlier TEP components being attributable to local reverberatory activity within the stimulated region. Subject-specific estimation of neurophysiological parameters additionally indicated an important role for inhibitory GABAergic neural populations in scaling cortical excitability levels, as reflected in TEP waveform characteristics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cognitive exertion affects the appraisal of one's own and other people's pain</a></h4>

              
                Evaluating correctly others' pain is a crucial prosocial ability, especially relevant for the healthcare system. In clinical settings, caregivers assess their patients' pain under high workload and fatigue, often while dealing with competing information/tasks. However, the effect played by such cognitive strain in the appraisal of others' pain remains unclear. Following embodied accounts that posit a shared representational code between self and others' states, it could be hypothesized that the representation of people's pain might be influenced by cognitive exertion similarly to first-hand experiences. Fifty participants underwent one of two demanding tasks, involving either working memory (Experiment 1: N-Back task) or cognitive interference (Experiment 2: Stroop task). After each task, participants were exposed to painful laser stimulations at three intensity levels (low, medium, high), or video-clips of patients experiencing three intensity levels of pain (low, medium, high). Participants rated the intensity of each pain event on a visual analogue scale. We found that the two tasks influenced rating of both one's own and others' pain, by decreasing the sensitivity to medium and high events. This was observed either when comparing the demanding condition to a control (Stroop), or when modelling linearly the difficulty/performance of each depleting task (N-Back). These effects were mirrored by the analysis of physiological responses (Heart Variability and Skin Conductance) evoked by one's own pain. We provide converging evidence that cognitive exertion affects the subsequent appraisal of one's own and likewise others' pain. Healthcare personnel should be aware that high workload might alter their cognitive abilities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An Internal Model of Sensorimotor Context in Freely Swimming Electric Fish</a></h4>

              
                Nervous systems are hypothesized to learn and store internal models that predict the sensory consequences of motor actions. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms for generating accurate predictions under real-world conditions in which the sensory consequences of action depend on environmental context. Using novel methods for underwater neural recording in freely swimming electric fish, we demonstrate that complex movement-related input to the active electrosensory system is effectively cancelled, despite being highly-dependent on the nearby environment. Computational modeling and closed-loop electrophysiological experiments indicate that the cerebellum-like circuitry of the electrosensory lobe generates context-specific predictions of self-generated input by combining motor signals with electrosensory feedback. These results provide mechanistic insight into sophisticated internal models supporting natural behavior in freely moving animals.

                Deep learning has become an effective tool for classifying biological sex based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but research on what features within the brain are most relevant to this classification is still lacking. Model interpretability has become a powerful way to understand "black box" deep-learning models and select features within the input data that are most relevant to the correct classification. However, very little work has been done employing these methods to understand the relationship between the temporal dimension of functional imaging signals and classification of biological sex, nor has there been attention paid to rectifying problems and limitations associated with feature explanation models, e.g. underspecification and instability. We provide a methodology to limit the impact of underspecification on the stability of the measured feature importance, and then, using intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) from fMRI data, we provide a deep exploration of sex differences among functional brain networks. We report numerous conclusions, including activity differences in the visual and cognitive domains, as well as major connectivity differences.

                Relapse, a critical issue in alcohol addiction, can be attenuated by disruption of alcohol-associated memories. Memories are thought to temporarily destabilize upon retrieval during the reconsolidation process. Here, we characterized the alcohol-specific transcriptional dynamics that regulate these memories. Using a mouse place-conditioning procedure, we found that alcohol memory retrieval increased the expression of Arc and Zif268 in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Alcohol seeking was abolished by post-retrieval non-specific inhibition of gene transcription in the DH, as well as by downregulating ARC expression in the DH using antisense-oligodeoxynucleotides. Since sucrose memory retrieval also increased Arc and Zif268 expression, we performed an RNA-sequencing assay, and revealed alterations in the expression of Adcy8, Neto1, Slc8a3 in the DH and Fkbp5 in the mPFC, caused by the retrieval of alcohol but not sucrose memories. This offers a first insight into the unique transcriptional dynamics underpinning alcohol memory reconsolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alzheimer's disease biomarker profiling in a memory clinic cohort without common comorbidities</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease is a multifactorial disorder with a heterogeneous patient population. Comorbidities such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes are known contributors to the disease progression. Indeed, therapies targeting these disorders have been shown efficient in dementia prevention. However, their mechanistic contribution to Alzheimer's pathology and neurodegeneration has not been fully clarified. In the current study, we used CSF samples from a memory clinic cohort of 90 patients without diagnosed hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes nor other neurodegenerative disorder, to investigate 13 molecular markers representing key mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Levels were compared between clinical groups of subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. Associations between markers and groups of markers were analyzed by linear regression. Two-step cluster analysis was used to determine patient clusters. Two key markers were further analyzed by immunofluorescence staining in hippocampus from control and AD individuals without hypertension, hypercholesterolemia nor diabetes. CSF angiotensinogen, thioredoxin-1, and interleukin-15 were the biomarkers with the most prominent associations with Alzheimer's pathology, synaptic and axonal damage. Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 kDa and neurofilament light chain were increased in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer cases. When we grouped biomarkers by biological function, we found that inflammatory and survival components were associated with Alzheimer's pathology, synaptic dysfunction and axonal damage. Moreover, a vascular/metabolic component was associated with synaptic dysfunction. In data-driven analysis, two patient clusters were identified; Older participants with increased CSF markers of oxidative stress, vascular pathology and neuroinflammation were assigned to cluster 1, that was also smaller and characterized by increased synaptic and axonal damage, compared to individuals in cluster 2. Clinical groups were evenly distributed between the clusters. Analysis of post-mortem hippocampal tissue, showed that, compared to controls, angiotensinogen staining was higher in Alzheimer's disease and was also found to co-localize with phosphorylated-tau. In a population free of common comorbidities, we could still find associations between Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and markers of pathways associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (i.e., neuroinflammation, vascular function, oxidative stress and cholesterol homeostasis), suggesting that these pathways are contributing to Alzheimer's disease mechanisms even in absence of clinically diagnosed comorbidities. The identification of distinct biomarker-driven endophenotypes of cognitive disorder patients, further highlights the biological heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease and the importance of developing tailored prevention and treatment strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Whole-brain dynamical modeling for classification of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Simulated whole-brain connectomes demonstrate an enhanced inter-individual variability depending on data processing and modeling approach. By considering the human brain connectome as an individualized attribute, we investigate how empirical and simulated whole-brain connectome-derived features can be utilized to classify patients with Parkinson's disease against healthy controls in light of varying data processing and model validation. To this end, we applied simulated blood oxygenation level-dependent signals derived by a whole-brain dynamical model simulating electrical signals of neuronal populations to reveal differences between patients and controls. In addition to the widely used model validation via fitting the dynamical model to empirical neuroimaging data, we invented a model validation against behavioral data, such as subject classes, which we refer to as behavioral model fitting and show that it can be beneficial for Parkinsonian patient classification. Furthermore, the results of machine-learning reported in this study also demonstrated that performance of the patient classification can be improved when the empirical data are complemented by the simulation results. We also showed that temporal filtering of blood oxygenation level-dependent signals influences the prediction results, where the filtering in the low-frequency band is advisable for Parkinsonian patient classification. In addition, composing the feature space of empirical and simulated data from multiple brain parcellation schemes provided complementary features that improve prediction performance. Based on our findings, we suggest including the simulation results with empirical data is effective for inter-individual research and its clinical application.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modeling and Inference Methods for Switching Regime-Dependent Dynamical Systems with Multiscale Neural Observations</a></h4>

              
                Realizing neurotechnologies that enable long-term neural recordings across multiple spatial-temporal scales during naturalistic behaviors requires new modeling and inference methods that can simultaneously address two challenges. First, the methods should aggregate information across all activity scales from multiple recording sources such as spiking and field potentials. Second, the methods should detect changes in the regimes of behavior and/or neural dynamics during naturalistic scenarios and long-term recordings. Prior regime detection methods are developed for a single scale of activity rather than multiscale activity, and prior multiscale methods have not considered regime switching and are for stationary cases. Here, we address both challenges by developing a Switching Multiscale Dynamical System model and the associated filtering and smoothing methods. This model describes the encoding of an unobserved brain state in multiscale spike-field activity. It also allows for regime-switching dynamics using an unobserved regime state that dictates the dynamical and encoding parameters at every time-step. We also design the associated switching multiscale inference methods that estimate both the unobserved regime and brain states from simultaneous spike-field activity. We validate the methods in both extensive numerical simulations and prefrontal spike-field data recorded in a monkey performing saccades for fluid rewards. We show that these methods can successfully combine the spiking and field potential observations to simultaneously track the regime and brain states accurately. Doing so, these methods lead to better state estimation compared with single-scale switching methods or stationary multiscale methods. These modeling and inference methods effectively incorporate both regime-detection and multiscale observations. As such, they could facilitate investigation of latent switching neural population dynamics and improve future brain-machine interfaces by enabling inference in naturalistic scenarios where regime-dependent multiscale activity and behavior arise.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Angelman syndrome patient neuron screen identifies a potent and selective clinical ASO targeting UBE3A-ATS with long lasting effect in cynomolgus monkey</a></h4>

              
                Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the loss of neuronal E3 ligase UBE3A with no available treatment. Restoring UBE3A levels via downregulation of the paternally cis-acting long non-coding antisense transcript (UBE3A-ATS) is a potentially disease modifying. Developing molecules targeting human UBE3A-ATS is challenging because its expression and function is restricted to neurons and lacks species sequence conservation. To overcome this, we performed a library screen of locked-nucleic acid (LNA)-modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) on AS patient-derived neurons. Rounds of optimization led to the identification of RO7248824, which selectively and potently reduces UBE3A-ATS, while concomitantly upregulating UBE3A mRNA and protein. These properties held true in both human AS patient- and neurotypical-, as well as cynomolgus monkey-derived neurons. Tool molecules targeting murine UBE3A-ATS , revealed a steep relationship between UBE3A-ATS knock-down and UBE3A mRNA/protein upregulation in both wild-type (WT) and AS Ube3am-/p+ mice, whereby an almost 90% downregulation was required to achieve a 50% reactivation, respectively. This relationship was confirmed in cynomolgus monkeys. Repeated lumbar intrathecal administrations of RO7248824 was well tolerated without adverse in-life effects and produced a robust, long lasting (> 3 months) paternal UBE3A reactivation in multiple monkey brain regions. Our results demonstrate that AS induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons serve as an excellent translational tool leading to the identification of LNA-modified ASOs with excellent drug-like properties translating to infrequent, intrathecal dosing and serves as the basis for the ongoing clinical development of RO7248824 for AS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pharmacological determination of the fractional block of Nav channels required to impair neuronal excitability and ex vivo seizures</a></h4>

              
                Voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) are essential for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. Of the different channel subtypes, Nav1.1, Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 are prominently expressed in the adult central nervous system (CNS). All three of these sodium channel subtypes are sensitive to block by the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), with TTX being almost equipotent on all three subtypes. In the present study we have used TTX to determine the fractional block of Nav channels required to impair action potential firing in pyramidal neurons and reduce network seizure-like activity. Using automated patch-clamp electrophysiology, we first determined the IC50s of TTX on mouse Nav1.1, Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 channels expressed in HEK cells, demonstrating this to be consistent with previously published data on human Nav channels. We then compared this data to the potency of block of Nav current measured in pyramidal neurons from neocortical brain slices. Interestingly, we found that it requires nearly 10-fold greater concentration of TTX over the IC50 to induce significant block of action potentials using a current-step protocol. In contrast, concentrations near the IC50 resulted in a significant reduction in AP firing and increase in rheobase using a ramp protocol. Surprisingly, a 20% reduction in action potential generation observed with 3 nM TTX resulted in significant block of seizure-like activity in the 0 Mg2+ model of epilepsy. Additionally, we found that approximately 50% block in pyramidal cell intrinsic excitability is sufficient to completely block all seizure-like events. These data serve as a critical starting point in understanding how fractional block of Nav channels affect intrinsic neuronal excitability and seizure-like activity. It further suggests that seizures can be controlled without significantly compromising intrinsic neuronal activity and determines the required fold over IC50 for novel and clinically relevant Nav channel blockers to produce efficacy and limit side effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological Markers of Memory Consolidation in the Human Brain when Memories are Reactivated during Sleep</a></h4>

              
                Human accomplishments depend on learning, and effective learning depends on consolidation. Consolidation is the process whereby new memories are gradually stored in an enduring way in the brain so that they can be available when needed. For factual or event knowledge, consolidation is thought to progress during sleep as well as during waking states, and to be mediated by interactions between hippocampal and neocortical networks. However, consolidation is difficult to observe directly, but rather is inferred through behavioral observations. Here, we investigated overnight memory change by measuring electrical activity in and near the hippocampus. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were made in five patients from electrodes implanted to determine whether a surgical treatment could relieve their seizure disorders. One night, while each patient slept in a hospital monitoring room, we recorded electrophysiological responses to 10-20 specific sounds that were presented very quietly, to avoid arousal. Half of the sounds had been associated with objects and their precise spatial locations that patients learned before sleep. After sleep, we found systematic improvements in spatial recall, replicating prior results. We assume that when the sounds were presented during sleep, they reactivated and strengthened corresponding spatial memories. Notably, the sounds also elicited oscillatory intracranial EEG activity, including increases in theta, sigma, and gamma EEG bands. Gamma responses, in particular, were consistently associated with the degree of improvement in spatial memory exhibited after sleep. We thus conclude that this electrophysiological activity in the hippocampus and adjacent medial temporal cortex reflects sleep-based enhancement of memory storage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inter-brain coupling analysis reveals learning-related attention of primary school students</a></h4>

              
                Learning-related attention is one of the most important factors influencing learning. While technologies have enabled the automatic detection of students' attention levels, the detected states might fail to be learning-related if students did not attend learning tasks (e.g., the attention level of a student who reads comics secretly during classroom learning). This phenomenon poses challenges to the practical application, especially in the primary school stage, which is crucial for students to set up learning attitudes/strategies. Inspired by the emerging inter-person perspective in neuroscience, we proposed an inter-brain attention coupling method to detect learning-related attention. Our method is based on the premise that learning-related attention should follow the structures of course contents, which is reflected in the attention dynamics shared across students. We hypothesized that one's level of learning-related attention could be detected in the inter-brain attention coupling, which is defined as the degree to which an individual student's attention dynamics match the attention dynamics averaged across classmates. To test this idea, wearable EEG devices were used to monitor students' attention levels in a class of primary school students during classroom learning. We found that one's inter-brain attention coupling was positively correlated with academic performance: higher performances are associated with higher coupling to the class-average attention dynamics. No significant correlation was found between students' attention levels averaged within the individual and their academic performances. These results demonstrated the value of inter-brain attention coupling in assessing primary school students' learning process. We argued that inter-person coupling analysis could be useful in monitoring learning-related attention in real-world educational contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhancing associative learning in rats with a computationally designed training protocol</a></h4>

              
                Associative learning requires the activation of protein kinases with distinct temporal dynamics. Learning protocols with computationally designed intertrial intervals (ITIs) that maximize the interaction between fast-activated protein kinase A (PKA) and slow-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) enhance nonassociative learning in Aplysia. Here, we tested whether an optimal learning protocol with irregular ITIs, predicted computationally to increase the overlap between PKA and ERK signaling in rat hippocampus, would enhance associative learning in mammals. We simulated ~1000 training protocols with irregular ITIs and identified an optimal protocol, predicted to induce stronger associative learning than standard protocols with fixed ITIs. With auditory fear conditioning, we showed that male adult rats exposed to the optimal conditioning protocol exhibited stronger fear memory retrieval and impaired fear memory extinction, compared to rats that received either massed or spaced conditioning protocols with fixed ITIs. With fear extinction, we likewise observed that fear conditioned rats exposed to the optimal extinction protocol showed improved extinction of contextual fear memory, compared to rats that received standard extinction protocols. Together, these findings demonstrate the capacity of a behavioral intervention driven by a computational model of memory-related signaling pathways to enhance associative learning in mammals and may provide greater insight into strategies to improve cognition in humans.

	<p>Calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) is a protein responsible for causing Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. In the absence of an experimentally designed protein molecule, homology modelling was performed. Through homology modelling, different CALHM1 models were generated and validated through Rampage. To carry out further in silico studies, through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation experiments, various flavonoids and alkaloids from Bauhinia variegata were utilised as inhibitors to target the protein (CALHM1). The sequence of CALHM1 was retrieved from UniProt and the secondary structure prediction of CALHM1 was done through CFSSP, GOR4, and SOPMA methods. The structure was identified through LOMETS, MUSTER, and MODELLER and finally, the structures were validated through Rampage. Bauhinia variegata plant was used to check the interaction of alkaloids and flavonoids against CALHM1. The protein and protein&amp;amp;ndash;ligand complex were also validated through molecular dynamics simulations studies. The model generated through MODELLER software with 6VAM A was used because this model predicted the best results in the Ramachandran plot. Further molecular docking was performed, quercetin was found to be the most appropriate candidate for the protein molecule with the minimum binding energy of &amp;amp;minus;12.45 kcal/mol and their ADME properties were analysed through Molsoft and Molinspiration. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that CALHM1 and CALHM1&amp;amp;ndash;quercetin complex became stable at 2500 ps. It may be seen through the study that quercetin may act as a good inhibitor for treatment. With the help of an in silico study, it was easier to analyse the 3D structure of the protein, which may be scrutinized for the best-predicted model. Quercetin may work as a good inhibitor for treating Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, according to in silico research using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, and future in vitro and in vivo analysis may confirm its effectiveness.</p>

	<p>We suggest a later timeline for full language capabilities in Homo sapiens, placing the emergence of language over 200,000 years after the emergence of our species. The late Paleolithic period saw several significant changes. Homo sapiens became more gracile and gradually lost significant brain volumes. Detailed realistic cave paintings disappeared completely, and iconic/symbolic ones appeared at other sites. This may indicate a shift in perceptual abilities, away from an accurate perception of the present. Language in modern humans interact with vision. One example is the McGurk effect. Studies show that artistic abilities may improve when language-related brain areas are damaged or temporarily knocked out. Language relies on many pre-existing non-linguistic functions. We suggest that an overwhelming flow of perceptual information, vision, in particular, was an obstacle to language, as is sometimes implied in autism with relative language impairment. We systematically review the recent research literature investigating the relationship between language and perception. We see homologues of language-relevant brain functions predating language. Recent findings show brain lateralization for communicative gestures in other primates without language, supporting the idea that a language-ready brain may be overwhelmed by raw perception, thus blocking overt language from evolving. We find support in converging evidence for a change in neural organization away from raw perception, thus pushing the emergence of language closer in time. A recent origin of language makes it possible to investigate the genetic origins of language.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Spinal ascending pathways for somatosensory information processing</a></h4>

              
                The somatosensory system processes diverse types of information including mechanical, thermal, and chemical signals. It has an essential role in sensory perception and body movement and, thus, is crucial for organism survival. The neural network for processing somatosensory information comprises multiple key nodes. Spinal projection neurons represent the key node for transmitting somatosensory information from the periphery to the brain. Although the anatomy of spinal ascending pathways has been characterized, the mechanisms underlying somatosensory information processing by spinal ascending pathways are incompletely understood.

                A dopamine D2 receptor mutation was recently identified in a family with a novel hyperkinetic movement disorder (Mov Disord 36: 729-739, 2021). That allelic variant D2-I212F is a constitutively active and G protein-biased receptor. We now describe mice engineered to carry the D2-I212F variant, Drd2I212F. The mice exhibited gait abnormalities resembling those in other mouse models of chorea and/or dystonia, and had decreased striatal D2 receptor expression. Electrically evoked IPSCs in midbrain dopamine neurons and striatum from Drd2I212F mice exhibited slow onset and decay compared to wild type mice. In the presence of dopamine, current decay initiated by photolytic release of sulpiride from CyHQ-sulpiride was slower in midbrain slices from Drd2I212F mice than Drd2+/+ mice. Furthermore, in contrast to wild type mice in which dopamine is more potent at neurons in the nucleus accumbens than in the dorsal striatum, reflecting activation of Go vs. Gi1, dopamine had similar potencies in those two brain regions of Drd2I212F mice. Repeated cocaine treatment, which decreases dopamine potency in the nucleus accumbens of wild type mice, had no effect on dopamine potency in Drd2I212F mice. The results demonstrate the utility of this mouse model for investigating the role of pathogenic DRD2 variants in early-onset hyperkinetic movement disorders.

	<p>In recent years, the increasing incidence of morbidity of brain stroke has made fast and accurate segmentation of lesion areas from brain MRI images important. With the development of deep learning, segmentation methods based on the computer have become a solution to assist clinicians in early diagnosis and treatment planning. Nevertheless, the variety of lesion sizes in brain MRI images and the roughness of the boundary of the lesion pose challenges to the accuracy of the segmentation algorithm. Current mainstream medical segmentation models are not able to solve these challenges due to their insufficient use of image features and context information. This paper proposes a novel feature enhancement and context capture network (FECC-Net), which is mainly composed of an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module and an enhanced encoder. In particular, the ASPP model uses parallel convolution operations with different sampling rates to enrich multi-scale features and fully capture image context information in order to process lesions of different sizes. The enhanced encoder obtains deep semantic features and shallow boundary features in the feature extraction process to achieve image feature enhancement, which is helpful for restoration of the lesion boundaries. We divide the pathological image into three levels according to the number of pixels in the real mask area and evaluate FECC-Net on an open dataset called Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS). The experimental results show that our FECC-Net outperforms mainstream methods, such as DoubleU-Net and TransUNet. Especially in small target tasks, FECC-Net is 4.09% ahead of DoubleU-Net on the main indicator DSC. Therefore, FECC-Net is encouraging and can be relied upon for brain MRI image applications.</p>

	<p>Background: To prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), hyperventilation (HV) activation has been avoided in electroencephalograms (EEGs) since April 2020. The influence of omitting HV in EEG on epilepsy diagnosis remains uncertain for patients with epilepsies other than child absence epilepsy. We hypothesized that EEGs with HV would show more interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) than EEGs without HV in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Methods: We reviewed the EEGs of seizure-free patients with JME who underwent EEG, both with and without HV, from January 2019 to October 2021, in our institution, and compared IEDs between EEG with and without HV. Results: This study analyzed 23 JME patients. The IED-positive rate was significantly higher in EEG with HV (65.2%) than in EEG without HV (34.8%, p = 0.016). The mean&amp;amp;plusmn;standard deviation number of IEDs per minute was significantly larger during HV (1.61 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.25 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;1) than during non-activation of both first EEG (0.57 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.93 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;1, p = 0.039) and second EEG (0.39 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.76 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;1, p = 0.009). Conclusions: In JME patients, performing HV during EEG may increase IEDs and appears to facilitate the accurate diagnosis of epilepsy.</p>

	<p>Neuropeptide S (NPS) is a factor associated with the central regulation of body weight, stress, anxiety, learning, memory consolidation, wakefulness&amp;amp;ndash;sleep cycle, and anti-inflammatory and neuroplastic effects. Its stress-reducing, anti-anxiety, arousal without anxiety, and pro-cognitive effects represent an interesting option for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. The purpose of the study was to examine the potential associations of NPS levels in the blood with clinical and metabolic parameters during the rehabilitation therapy of patients with schizophrenia. Thirty-three male subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia were randomly divided into two groups. The rehabilitation group (REH, N16) consisted of patients who were subjected to structured, 3-month intensive rehabilitation therapy, and the control group (CON, N17) consisted of patients who were subjected to a standard support mechanism. Both groups continued their pharmacological treatment as usual. The NPS concentration, as well as clinical and metabolic parameters, were compared in both groups. Additionally, a group of healthy (H) males (N15) was tested for NPS reference scores. To look for the specificity and selectivity of the NPS relationship with clinical results, various factor models of the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) were analyzed, including the original PANSS 2/3 model, its modified four-factor version, the male-specific four-factor model, and two five-factorial models validated in large groups in clinical and multi-ethnic studies. Results and conclusions: (1) Structured rehabilitation therapy, compared to unstructured supportive therapy, significantly reduced the level of schizophrenia disorders defined by various factor models derived from PANSS. (2) The clinical improvement within the 3-month rehabilitation therapy course was correlated with a significant decrease in neuropeptide S (NPS) serum level. (3) The excitement/Hostility (E/H) factor, which included schizophrenic symptoms of the psychotic disorganization, was specific and selective for the reduction in serum NPS, which was stable across all analyzed factor models. (4) The long-term relationship between serum NPS and clinical factors was not accompanied by basic metabolic parameters.</p>

	<p>Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most malignant glioma among astrocytomas and is a lethal form of brain cancer. Many RAB genes are involved in different cancers but RAB42 (Ras-associated binding 42) is seldom studied in GBM. Our study aimed to explore the role of RAB42 expression in the development and prognosis of GBM. Methods: All GBM patient data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases. The relevance of RAB42 expression to the clinicopathologic characteristics of GBM patients was analyzed. The overall survival (OS) significance was determined using log-rank. Significantly enriched KEGG pathways were screened using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Results: High expression of RAB42 was observed in GBM specimens compared with normal samples, which was also verified in cell lines and tissue samples. Elevated RAB42 expression was correlated with higher GBM histological grade. The prognosis of GBM patients with high RAB42 expression was worse than those with lower RAB42. A total of 35 pathways, such as the P53 pathway, were significantly activated in highly RAB42-expressed GBM samples. Conclusions: High RAB42 expression is related to the development of GBM, and RAB42 is a probable prognostic marker for GBM.</p>

	<p>The deep brain stimulation (DBS) in early-stage Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) pilot trial began more than a decade ago and remains the only investigation of DBS in mildly symptomatic patients. Patients completed therapeutic washouts biannually for two years, outpatient assessments through five years, and a longitudinal washout assessment after 11 years. Here, the patient experience of participating in the early DBS pilot trial is described. Semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were coded, analyzed using an iterative inductive-deductive approach, and used to develop a conceptual framework. Ten participants (n = 6 early optimal drug therapy (ODT), n = 4 early DBS + ODT) were interviewed. Motivations for participation included benefit to future PD patients and potential personal benefit, while hesitations included risk of surgical complications. While early ODT patients who received standard-of-care DBS described significant changes in their functional capacities after surgery, early DBS patients described a maintenance of quality of life that made PD less impactful over an extended period. Patients expressed high satisfaction with trial participation and early DBS. This study suggests that the PD experience with early DBS may notably differ from standard-of-care DBS. The FDA has approved a pivotal clinical trial evaluating DBS in early-stage PD (IDEG050016).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Effects of Noise Exposure and Aging on Behavioral Tone Detection in Quiet and Noise by Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging leads to degeneration of the peripheral and central auditory systems, hearing loss, and difficulty understanding sounds in noise. Aging is also associated with changes in susceptibility to or recovery from damaging noise exposures, although the effects of the interaction between acute noise exposure and age on the perception of sounds are not well studied. We tested these effects in the CBA/CaJ mouse model of age-related hearing loss using operant conditioning procedures before and after noise exposure and longitudinally measured changes in their sensitivity for detecting tones in quiet or noise backgrounds. Cochleae from a subset of the behaviorally tested mice were immunolabeled to examine organ of Corti damage relative to what is expected based on aging alone. Mice tested in both quiet and noise background conditions experienced worse behavioral sensitivity immediately after noise exposure, but mice exposed at older ages generally showed greater threshold shifts and reduced recovery over time. Surprisingly, day-to-day stability in thresholds was markedly higher for mice detecting signals in the presence of a noise masker compared with detection in quiet conditions. Cochlear analysis revealed decreases in the total number of outer hair cells (OHCs) and the number of ribbons per inner cell in high-frequency regions in aged, noise-exposed mice relative to aging alone. Our findings build on previous work showing interactions between age and noise exposure and add that background noise can increase the stability of behavioral hearing sensitivity after noise damage.</p>

                Background: Managing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using available resources is essential to reduce the health burden of disease. The severity of COVID-19 is affected by nutritional status. In this study the effect of natural product use prior to infection with COVID-19 on disease severity and hospitalization was explored. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Between March and July 2021, a self-administered survey was conducted in Jordan. Individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and were ≥18 years old were the study population. Study measures included the use of natural products, COVID-19 severity, and hospitalization status. A multivariate regression model was used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean age (mean ± SD) of the study sample (n=2,148) was 40.25 ± 15.58 years old. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the regular intake of carnation (OR [0.56], CI [0.37–0.85]), onion (OR [0.69], CI [0.52–0.92]), lemon (OR [0.68], CI [0.51–0.90]), and citrus fruits (OR [0.66], CI [0.50–0.89]) before infection were associated with a substantial reduction in COVID-19 severity (P<0.01). Also, the consumption of carnation (OR [0.55], CI [0.34–0.88]), lemon (OR [0.57], CI [0.42–0.78]), and citrus fruits (OR [0.61], CI [0.44–0.84]) were associated with a significant decrease in the frequency of COVID-19-induced hospitalization (P<0.01). Conclusions: Regular consumption of carnation, lemon, and citrus fruits before infection was associated with better outcomes for COVID-19. Studies on other populations are required to confirm these findings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Extension of the PRISMA 2020 statement for living systematic reviews (LSRs): protocol [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: While the PRISMA 2020 statement is intended to guide the reporting of original systematic reviews, updated systematic reviews, and living systematic reviews (LSRs), its explanation and elaboration document notes that additional considerations for updated systematic reviews and LSRs may need to be addressed. This paper reports the protocol for developing an extension of the PRISMA 2020 statement for LSRs. Methods: We will follow the EQUATOR Network’s guidance for developing health research reporting guidelines. We will review the literature to identify possible items of the PRISMA 2020 checklist that need modification, as well as new items that need to be added. Then, we will survey representatives of different stakeholder groups for their views on the proposed modifications of the PRISMA 2020 checklist. We will summarize, present, and discuss the results of the survey in an online meeting, aiming to reach consensus on the content of the LSR extension. We will then draft the checklist, explanation and elaboration for each item, and flow diagram for the PRISMA 2020 extension. Then, we will share these initial documents with stakeholder representatives for final feedback and approval. Discussion: We anticipate that the PRISMA 2020 extension for LSRs will benefit LSR authors, editors, and peer reviewers of LSRs, as well as different users of LSRs, including guideline developers, policy makers, healthcare providers, patients, and other stakeholders.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">SALARECON connects the Atlantic salmon genome to growth and feed efficiency</a></h4>

Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) is the most valuable farmed fish globally and there is much interest in optimizing its genetics and rearing conditions for growth and feed efficiency. Marine feed ingredients must be replaced to meet global demand, with challenges for fish health and sustainability. Metabolic models can address this by connecting genomes to metabolism, which converts nutrients in the feed to energy and biomass, but such models are currently not available for major aquaculture species such as salmon. We present SALARECON, a model focusing on energy, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism that links the Atlantic salmon genome to metabolic fluxes and growth. It performs well in standardized tests and captures expected metabolic (in)capabilities. We show that it can explain observed hypoxic growth in terms of metabolic fluxes and apply it to aquaculture by simulating growth with commercial feed ingredients. Predicted limiting amino acids and feed efficiencies agree with data, and the model suggests that marine feed efficiency can be achieved by supplementing a few amino acids to plant- and insect-based feeds. SALARECON is a high-quality model that makes it possible to simulate Atlantic salmon metabolism and growth. It can be used to explain Atlantic salmon physiology and address key challenges in aquaculture such as development of sustainable feeds.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deriving time-concordant event cascades from gene expression data: A case study for Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI)</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anika Liu, Namshik Han, Jordi Munoz-Muriedas, Andreas Bender</p>

Adverse event pathogenesis is often a complex process which compromises multiple events ranging from the molecular to the phenotypic level. In toxicology, Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) aim to formalize this as temporal sequences of events, in which event relationships should be supported by causal evidence according to the tailored Bradford-Hill criteria. One of the criteria is whether events are consistently observed in a certain temporal order and, in this work, we study this time concordance using the concept of “first activation” as data-driven means to generate hypotheses on potentially causal mechanisms. As a case study, we analysed liver data from repeat-dose studies in rats from the TG-GATEs database which comprises measurements across eight timepoints, ranging from 3 hours to 4 weeks post-treatment. We identified time concordant gene expression-derived events preceding adverse histopathology, which serves as surrogate readout for Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI). We find known mechanisms in DILI to be time-concordant, and show further that significance, frequency and log fold change (logFC) of differential expression are metrics which can additionally prioritize events although not necessary to be mechanistically relevant. Moreover, we used the temporal order of transcription factor (TF) expression and regulon activity to identify transcriptionally regulated TFs and subsequently combined this with prior knowledge on functional interactions to derive detailed gene-regulatory mechanisms, such as reduced Hnf4a activity leading to decreased expression and activity of Cebpa. At the same time, also potentially novel events are identified such as Sox13 which is highly significantly time-concordant and shows sustained activation over time. Overall, we demonstrate how time-resolved transcriptomics can derive and support mechanistic hypotheses by quantifying time concordance and how this can be combined with prior causal knowledge, with the aim of both understanding mechanisms of toxicity, as well as potential applications to the AOP framework. We make our results available in the form of a Shiny app (https://anikaliu.shinyapps.io/dili_cascades), which allows users to query events of interest in more detail.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Motor response vigour and visual fixation patterns reflect subjective valuation during intertemporal choice</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elke Smith, Jan Peters</p>

Value-based decision-making is of central interest in cognitive neuroscience and psychology, as well as in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders characterised by decision-making impairments. Studies examining (neuro-)computational mechanisms underlying choice behaviour typically focus on participants’ decisions. However, there is increasing evidence that option valuation might also be reflected in motor response vigour and eye movements, implicit measures of subjective utility. To examine motor response vigour and visual fixation correlates of option valuation in intertemporal choice, we set up a task where the participants selected an option by pressing a grip force transducer, simultaneously tracking fixation shifts between options. As outlined in our preregistration (https://osf.io/k6jct), we used hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation to model the choices assuming hyperbolic discounting, compared variants of the softmax and drift diffusion model, and assessed the relationship between response vigour and the estimated model parameters. The behavioural data were best explained by a drift diffusion model specifying a non-linear scaling of the drift rate by the subjective value differences. Replicating previous findings, we found a magnitude effect for temporal discounting, such that higher rewards were discounted less. This magnitude effect was further reflected in motor response vigour, such that stronger forces were exerted in the <i>high</i> vs. the <i>low</i> magnitude condition. Bayesian hierarchical linear regression further revealed higher grip forces, faster response times and a lower number of fixation shifts for trials with higher subjective value differences. An exploratory analysis revealed that subjective value sums across options showed an even more pronounced association with trial-wise grip force amplitudes. Our data suggest that subjective utility or implicit valuation is reflected in motor response vigour and visual fixation patterns during intertemporal choice. Taking into account response vigour might thus provide deeper insight into decision-making, reward valuation and maladaptive changes in these processes, e.g. in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The polyol pathway is an evolutionarily conserved system for sensing glucose uptake</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hiroko Sano, Akira Nakamura, Mariko Yamane, Hitoshi Niwa, Takashi Nishimura, Kimi Araki, Kazumasa Takemoto, Kei-ichiro Ishiguro, Hiroki Aoki, Yuzuru Kato, Masayasu Kojima</p>

Cells must adjust the expression levels of metabolic enzymes in response to fluctuating nutrient supply. For glucose, such metabolic remodeling is highly dependent on a master transcription factor ChREBP/MondoA. However, it remains elusive how glucose fluctuations are sensed by ChREBP/MondoA despite the stability of major glycolytic pathways. Here, we show that in both flies and mice, ChREBP/MondoA activation in response to glucose ingestion involves an evolutionarily conserved glucose-metabolizing pathway: the polyol pathway. The polyol pathway converts glucose to fructose via sorbitol. It has been believed that this pathway is almost silent, and its activation in hyperglycemic conditions has deleterious effects on human health. We show that the polyol pathway regulates the glucose-responsive nuclear translocation of Mondo, a <i>Drosophila</i> homologue of ChREBP/MondoA, which directs gene expression for organismal growth and metabolism. Likewise, inhibition of the polyol pathway in mice impairs ChREBP’s nuclear localization and reduces glucose tolerance. We propose that the polyol pathway is an evolutionarily conserved sensing system for glucose uptake that allows metabolic remodeling.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Does brain activity cause consciousness? A thought experiment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Albert Gidon, Jaan Aru, Matthew Evan Larkum</p>

Rapid advances in neuroscience have provided remarkable breakthroughs in understanding the brain on many fronts. Although promising, the role of these advancements in solving the problem of consciousness is still unclear. Based on technologies conceivably within the grasp of modern neuroscience, we discuss a thought experiment in which neural activity, in the form of action potentials, is initially recorded from all the neurons in a participant’s brain during a conscious experience and then played back into the same neurons. We consider whether this artificial replay can reconstitute a conscious experience. The possible outcomes of this experiment unravel hidden costs and pitfalls in understanding consciousness from the neurosciences’ perspective and challenge the conventional wisdom that causally links action potentials and consciousness.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Online academic satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic in medical students: role of sleep, emotions, college adjustment, and digital skills [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, led to significant changes in university education, resulting in the new normal standard of virtual teaching in many undergraduate medical schools worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to determine the factors related to academic satisfaction with virtual teaching in medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional-analytical study was conducted on medical students at a private university in Peru, through self-reported questionnaires divided into sociodemographic data and variables of interest that could influence academic satisfaction during the pandemic. To evaluate possible factors related to academic satisfaction, stepwise regression models were performed for both sexes. Results: In total, data from 310 medical students, 117 males and 193 females, were analyzed. Academic satisfaction reached a score of 11.2 ± 2.9, which was similar in both sexes. The best regression model for males (AIC: 544.32; RMSE: 2.42; R2: 0.30) showed that adaptation to university life (favorable change) and depression (unfavorable change) explained 30% of changes in students' academic satisfaction. While in females (AIC: 907.59; RMSE: 2.49; R 2: 0.22) the model integrated favorable factors such as adjustment to college life and anxiety; while depression and poor sleep quality were unfavorable factors. Conclusion: Factors that contributed to academic satisfaction in medical students were determined in this study, which differed by gender. Thus, it is important to take into account the particularities of male and female medical students in order to improve their academic satisfaction during their university careers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Research data management for bioimaging: the 2021 NFDI4BIOIMAGE community survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Knowing the needs of the bioimaging community with respect to research data management (RDM) is essential for identifying measures that enable adoption of the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for microscopy and bioimage analysis data across disciplines. As an initiative within Germany's National Research Data Infrastructure, we conducted this community survey in summer 2021 to assess the state of the art of bioimaging RDM and the community needs. Methods An online survey was conducted with a mixed question-type design. We created a questionnaire tailored to relevant topics of the bioimaging community, including specific questions on bioimaging methods and bioimage analysis, as well as more general questions on RDM principles and tools. 203 survey entries were included in the analysis covering the perspectives from various life and biomedical science disciplines and from participants at different career levels. Results The results highlight the importance and value of bioimaging RDM and data sharing. However, the practical implementation of FAIR practices is impeded by technical hurdles, lack of knowledge, and insecurity about the legal aspects of data sharing. The survey participants request metadata guidelines and annotation tools and endorse the usage of image data management platforms. At present, OMERO (Open Microscopy Environment Remote Objects) is the best known and most widely used platform. Most respondents rely on image processing and analysis, which they regard as the most time-consuming step of the bioimage data workflow. While knowledge about and implementation of electronic lab notebooks and data management plans is limited, respondents acknowledge their potential value for data handling and publication. Conclusions The bioimaging community acknowledges and endorses the value of RDM and data sharing. Still, there is a need for information, guidance, and standardization to foster the adoption of FAIR data handling. This survey may help inspiring targeted measures to close this gap.

                Background: To determine the relationship between pharmaceutical advertising and the consumption of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines in users of the SUPERFAR drugstore in Barrios Altos-Cercado de Lima, 2022. Methods: The methodology used was a quantitative approach, non-experimental, cross-sectional, descriptive-correlational design. The sample consisted of 269 users, who were administered a questionnaire with 20 questions; the technique used was the survey. The results were obtained using SPSS Version 22 and Spearman's correlation statistical test with a significance level of 5%. Results: The correlation for the general hypothesis was determined with a P value of 0.000 and a Spearman's Rho value of r=0.729 indicating a strong and direct correlation between Variable 1 pharmaceutical advertising and Variable 2 consumption of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. For the pharmaceutical advertising message dimension, a P value of 0.000 was obtained, Spearman's Rho value of r=0.597 indicating a moderate and direct correlation, for the mass media dimension (P value is 0.000), Spearman's Rho value of r=0.525 indicating a moderate and direct correlation, for the pharmaceutical product promotion dimension (P value 0.000) Spearman's Rho value of r=0.637 showing a moderate and direct correlation and for the dimension of excessive consumption of medicines under the influence and responsibility of the pharmaceutical industry (P value 0.000) was obtained. Spearman's Rho value of r=0.670 indicating a moderate and direct correlation. Conclusion: The conclusion is that there is a significant relationship between the variables pharmaceutical advertising and drug consumption.

<p>This study shows for the first time that itch mediator gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) is expressed in both trigeminal ganglion (TG) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is expressed in both the dorsal horn of the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Sp5C) and spinal cord of primates, Japanese macaque monkeys, similar to rodents and Eulipotyphla.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and its receptor (GRPR) have been identified as itch mediators in the spinal and trigeminal somatosensory systems in rodents. In primates, there are few reports of GRP/GRPR expression or function in the spinal sensory system and virtually nothing is known in the trigeminal system. The aim of the present study was to characterize GRP and GRPR in the trigeminal and spinal somatosensory system of Japanese macaque monkeys (<i>Macaca fuscata</i>). cDNA encoding <i>GRP</i> was isolated from the macaque dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and exhibited an amino acid sequence that was highly conserved among mammals and especially in primates. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that GRP was expressed mainly in the small-sized trigeminal ganglion and DRG in adult macaque monkeys. Densely stained GRP-immunoreactive (ir) fibers were observed in superficial layers of the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Sp5C) and the spinal cord. In contrast, GRP-ir fibers were rarely observed in the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus and oral and interpolar divisions of the spinal trigeminal nucleus. cDNA cloning, in situ hybridization, and Western blot revealed substantial expression of <i>GRPR</i> mRNA and GRPR protein in the macaque spinal dorsal horn and Sp5C. Our Western ligand blot and ligand derivative stain for GRPR revealed that GRP directly bound in the macaque Sp5C and spinal dorsal horn as reported in rodents. Finally, GRP-ir fibers were also detected in the human spinal dorsal horn. The spinal and trigeminal itch neural circuits labeled with GRP and GRPR appear to function also in primates.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Dynamic causal communication channels between neocortical areas</a></h4>

              
                How do brain regions influence each other? Javadzadeh and Hofer use a causal approach to study cortical interactions. They find that communication subspaces between areas—the channels by which they interact—are not static over time but re-organize rapidly over timescales as short as tens of milliseconds.

                TRP proteins are a large family of cation-selective channels, surpassed in variety only by voltage-gated potassium channels. Detailed molecular mechanisms governing how membrane voltage, ligand binding, or temperature can induce conformational changes promoting the open state in TRP channels are still a matter of debate. Aiming to unveil distinctive structural features common to the transmembrane domains within the TRP family, we performed phylogenetic reconstruction, sequence statistics, and structural analysis over a large set of TRP channel genes. Here we report an exceptionally conserved set of residues. This fingerprint is composed of twelve residues localized at equivalent three-dimensional positions in TRP channels from the different subtypes. Moreover, these amino acids are arranged in three groups, connected by a set of aromatics located at the core of the transmembrane structure. We hypothesize that differences in the connectivity between these different groups of residues harbors the apparent differences in coupling strategies used by TRP subgroups.

                The vacuole has a space-filling function, allowing a particularly rapid plant cell expansion with very little increase in cytosolic content (Löfke et al., 2015; Scheuring et al., 2016; Dünser et al., 2019). Despite its importance for cell size determination in plants, very little is known about the mechanisms that define vacuolar size. Here, we show that the cellular and vacuolar size expansions are coordinated. By developing a pharmacological tool, we enabled the investigation of membrane delivery to the vacuole during cellular expansion. Our data reveal that endocytic membrane sorting from the plasma membrane to the vacuole is enhanced in the course of rapid root cell expansion. While this ‘compromise’ mechanism may theoretically at first decelerate cell surface enlargements, it fuels vacuolar expansion and, thereby, ensures the coordinated augmentation of vacuolar occupancy in dynamically expanding plant cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ancestral reconstruction of duplicated signaling proteins reveals the evolution of signaling specificity</a></h4>

              
                Gene duplication is crucial to generating novel signaling pathways during evolution. However, it remains unclear how the redundant proteins produced by gene duplication ultimately acquire new interaction specificities to establish insulated paralogous signaling pathways. Here, we used ancestral sequence reconstruction to resurrect and characterize a bacterial two-component signaling system that duplicated in a-proteobacteria. We determined the interaction specificities of the signaling proteins that existed before and immediately after this duplication event and then identified key mutations responsible for establishing specificity in the two systems. Just three mutations, in only two of the four interacting proteins, were sufficient to establish specificity of the extant systems. Some of these mutations weakened interactions between paralogous systems to limit crosstalk. However, others strengthened interactions within a system, indicating that the ancestral interaction, although functional, had the potential to be strengthened. Our work suggests that protein-protein interactions with such latent potential may be highly amenable to duplication and divergence.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tyrosine phosphorylation tunes chemical and thermal sensitivity of TRPV2 ion channel</a></h4>

              
                Transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) is a multimodal ion channel implicated in diverse physiopathological processes. Its important involvement in immune responses has been suggested such as in the macrophages' phagocytosis process. However, the endogenous signaling cascades controlling the gating of TRPV2 remain to be understood. Here, we report that enhancing tyrosine phosphorylation remarkably alters the chemical and thermal sensitivities of TRPV2 endogenously expressed in rat bone marrow-derived macrophages. We identify that the protein tyrosine kinase JAK1 mediates TRPV2 phosphorylation at the molecular sites Tyr(335), Tyr(471), and Tyr(525). JAK1 phosphorylation is required for maintaining TRPV2 activity and the phagocytic ability of macrophages. We further show that TRPV2 phosphorylation is dynamically balanced by protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1). PTPN1 inhibition increases TRPV2 phosphorylation, further reducing the activation temperature threshold. Our data thus unveil an intrinsic mechanism where the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation dynamic balance sets the basal chemical and thermal sensitivity of TRPV2. Targeting this pathway will aid therapeutic interventions in physiopathological contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid presynaptic maturation in naturally regenerating axons</a></h4>

              
                Successful neuronal regeneration requires the re-establishment of synaptic connectivity. Crucial to this process is the reconstitution of presynaptic machinery responsible for controlling neurotransmitter release. In the mammalian adult CNS post-injury regeneration is usually only possible after extensive experimental intervention, and it is unknown how presynaptic function is re-established, let alone how it might be optimised to promote functional recovery. Here we addressed these questions by studying presynaptic maturation during a regenerative process that occurs entirely naturally. After toxin-induced injury, olfactory sensory neurons in the adult mouse olfactory epithelium can regenerate fully, sending axons to the brain to re-establish synaptic contact with postsynaptic partners in the olfactory bulb. Using electrophysiological recordings in acute slices, we found that after initial re-contact, functional connectivity in this system was rapidly established. Moreover, re-connecting presynaptic terminals had almost mature functional properties, including high release probability and a strong capacity for presynaptic inhibition. Release probability then matured quickly, rendering re-established terminals functionally indistinguishable from controls just one week after initial contact. These data show that successful synaptic regeneration in the adult mammalian brain is not quite a "plug-and-play" process; instead, almost-mature presynaptic terminals undergo a rapid phase of functional maturation to re-integrate into established target networks.

                Objective: Functional connectivity networks explain the different brain states during diverse motor, cognitive, and sensory functions. Extracting spatial network configurations and their temporal evolution is crucial for understanding the brain function during diverse behavioral tasks. Approach: In this study, we introduce the use of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extract the dynamics of brain networks. We compared DMD with principal component analysis (PCA) using real magnetoencephalography (MEG) data during motor and memory tasks. Main Results: The framework generates dominant spatial brain networks and their time dynamics during simple tasks, such as button press and left-hand movement, as well as more complex tasks, such as picture naming and memory tasks. Our findings show that the DMD-based approach provides a better temporal resolution than the PCA-based approach. Significance: We believe that DMD has a very high potential for deciphering the spatiotemporal dynamics of electrophysiological brain network states during tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Updating contextual sensory expectations for adaptive behaviour</a></h4>

              
                The brain has the extraordinary capacity to construct predictive models of the environment by internalizing statistical regularities in the sensory inputs. The resulting sensory expectations shape how we perceive and react to the world; at the neural level, this relates to decreased neural responses to expected than unexpected stimuli (expectation suppression). Crucially, expectations may need revision as context changes. However, existing research has often neglected this issue. Further, it is unclear whether contextual revisions apply selectively to expectations relevant to the task at hand, hence serving adaptive behaviour. The present fMRI study examined how contextual visual expectations spread throughout the cortical hierarchy as participants update their beliefs. We created a volatile environment with two state spaces presented over separate contexts and controlled by an independent contextualizing signal. Participants attended a training session before scanning to learn contextual temporal associations among pairs of object images. The fMRI experiment then tested for the emergence of contextual expectation suppression in two separate tasks, respectively with task-relevant and task-irrelevant expectations. Behavioural and neural effects of contextual expectation emerged progressively across the cortical hierarchy as participants attuned themselves to the context: expectation suppression appeared first in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus and posterior parietal cortex, followed by the ventral visual stream, up to early visual cortex. This applied selectively to task-relevant expectations. Taken together, the present results suggest that an insular and frontoparietal executive control network may guide the flexible deployment of contextual sensory expectations for adaptive behaviour in our complex and dynamic world.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetic and chemical disruption of Amyloid Precursor Protein processing impairs zebrafish sleep maintenance</a></h4>

              
                Sleep-wake disturbances are among the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and contribute to disease severity. Since a major driver of AD-- the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) in the brain-- is modulated by sleep, a "vicious" feedforward cycle has been proposed in which A{beta} buildup disrupts sleep, leading to more A{beta} secretion and further worsening of sleep and AD. Consistent with this idea, mouse models of AD develop early sleep phenotypes, and sleep is acutely modulated by exogenous A{beta}. However, these overexpression paradigms leave unclear whether endogenous A{beta} signaling contributes to sleep regulation. To tackle this question, we generated loss of function mutations in the zebrafish orthologs of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and monitored larval sleep behavior. Larvae with mutations in appa had reduced waking activity levels but normal sleep patterns, while larvae that lacked appb had reduced sleep due to an inability to maintain sleep bout durations. In addition, larvae exposed to the {gamma}-secretase inhibitor DAPT, which inhibits A{beta} production from APP, also have shorter sleep bouts at night. Although {gamma}-secretase inhibition impacts the proteolytic cleavage of many proteins, appb mutants were insensitive to the sleep bout shortening effects of DAPT, suggesting that loss of {gamma}-secretase dependent proteolytic cleavage products of Appb are responsible for the reduced sleep maintenance phenotypes. These results are consistent with a model in which endogenous A{beta} directly modulates sleep in zebrafish and supports the idea that sleep disturbances may be a useful early-onset biomarker for AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatiotemporal bias of the human gaze toward hierarchical visual features during natural scene viewing</a></h4>

              
                The human gaze is directed at various locations from moment to moment in acquiring information necessary to recognize the external environment at the fine resolution of foveal vision. Previous studies showed that the human gaze is biased to particular locations in the visual field at a particular timing, but it remains unclear what visual features produce such spatiotemporal bias. In this study, we used a deep convolutional neural network model to extract hierarchical visual features from natural scene images and evaluated how much the human gaze is attracted to the visual features in space and time. Eye movement measurement and visual feature analysis using the deep convolutional neural network model showed that the gaze was strongly attracted to spatial locations containing higher-order visual features than lower-order visual features and conventional saliency. Analysis of the gaze time course revealed that the bias to higher-order visual features was prominent within a short period after the beginning of observation of the natural scene images. These results demonstrate that higher-order visual features are a strong gaze attractor in both space and time, suggesting that the human visual system uses foveal vision resources to extract information from higher-order visual features with higher spatiotemporal priority.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modeling the Diverse Effects of Divisive Normalization on Noise Correlations</a></h4>

              
                Divisive normalization, a prominent model of interactions between neurons, plays a key role in influential theories of neural coding. Testing the mechanistic basis of those theories requires understanding the relationship between normalization and the statistics of neural activity, particularly noise correlations which provide strong constrains on circuit models. Yet the relation between normalization and correlations remains unclear, because models of covariability typically ignore normalization despite empirical evidence suggesting it contributes to stimulus and state modulations of covariability. We propose a pairwise stochastic divisive normalization model that accounts for the effects of normalization and other factors on covariability, and accurately fits Ca2+ imaging data from mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We show that normalization modulates noise correlations in qualitatively different ways depending on whether normalization is shared between neurons, and we outline the data regime in which the corresponding model parameter is identifiable. Our analysis provides the first quantitative evidence that similarly tuned neurons in mouse V1 share their normalization signals, and explains our observation that stronger normalization decorrelates those pairs, particularly at low stimulus contrast. Our model could enable quantifying the role of normalization on information transmission and representation, and mapping the parameters of normalization onto circuit and cellular mechanisms.

                Recent theories on the neural correlates of face identification stressed the importance of the available identity-specific semantic and affective information. However, whether such information is essential for the emergence of neural signal of familiarity has not yet been studied in detail. Here, we explored the shared representation of face familiarity between perceptually and personally familiarized identities. We applied a cross-experiment multivariate pattern classification analysis (MVPA), to test if EEG patterns for passive viewing of personally familiar and unfamiliar faces are useful in decoding familiarity in a matching task where familiarity was attained thorough a short perceptual task. Importantly, no additional semantic, contextual, or affective information was provided for the familiarized identities during perceptual familiarization. Although the two datasets originate from different sets of participants who were engaged in two different tasks, familiarity was still decodable in the sorted, same identity matching trials. This finding indicates that the visual processing of the faces of personally familiar and purely perceptually familiarized identities involve similar mechanisms, leading to cross-classifiable neural patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Strategies of developmental vestibular plasticity after unilateral embryonic ear removal in Xenopus laevis</a></h4>

              
                Appropriate gaze control mechanisms rely on bilateral mirror-symmetric vestibular endorgans, central circuits, and extraocular motor effectors. Embryonic removal of one inner ear prior to the formation of these structures was used to evaluate the extent to which animals can develop appropriate motor outputs in the presence of only a singular inner ear. Near-congenital one-eared tadpoles subjected to separate or combinatorial visuo-vestibular motion stimulation exhibited vestibular-ocular reflexes, though smaller in gain compared to controls, whereas isolated visuo-motor responses remained largely unaltered. Surprisingly, direction-specific responses in one-eared tadpoles revealed a spectrum of vestibulo-ocular reflex performance, where in many cases rather robust responses were observed during head motion towards the missing ear. Rotation toward the remaining ear elicited eye movements which were often severely attenuated. This suggests that embryonically generated one-eared animals develop bidirectional vestibular signal detection and downstream processing capacities that allow activation of robust compensatory eye movements. However, this capability seems to occur at the expense of performance of vestibular reflexes during motion in the canonical activation direction of the singular ear. Consequently, the development of central vestibulo-motor circuits in one-eared animals likely relies on strategies in which the outcome for gaze stabilization is driven by balanced homeostatic levels and individual temporal tuning of abducens motoneuron activity. Despite the lack of bilateral symmetric vestibular afferent input, the developing central nervous system is capable of creating a framework for symmetric sensorimotor transformations.

                Early adversity can change educational, cognitive, and mental health outcomes. However, the neural processes through which early adversity exerts these effects remain largely unknown. We used generative network modelling of the mouse connectome to test whether unpredictable postnatal stress shifts the constraints that govern the formation of the structural connectome. A model that trades off the wiring cost of long-distance connections with topological homophily (i.e. links between regions with shared neighbours) generated simulations that replicate the organisation of the rodent connectome. The imposition of early life adversity significantly shifted the best-performing parameter combinations toward zero, heightening the stochastic nature of the generative process. Put simply, unpredictable postnatal stress changes the economic constraints that shape network formation, introducing greater randomness into the structural development of the brain. While this change may constrain the development of cognitive abilities, it could also reflect an adaptive mechanism. In other words, neural development could harness heightened stochasticity to make networks more robust to perturbation, thereby facilitating effective responses to future threats and challenges.

                Despite their phylogenetic differences and distinct pallial structures, mammals and birds share many features of sleep structure, most prominently, the existence of distinct stages of rapid eye movement (REM) and slow wave sleep (SWS). However, the structure of sleep does not remain constant during lifetime, but undergoes radical changes during development. Our current understanding of these age-related variations in neural signature of sleep is limited to studies in a small number of mammalian species. How does the neural signature of sleep evolve during brain development in an avian brain? To answer this, we recorded multi-channel EEG from developing juvenile and adult zebra finches for several nights. We compared the structure of sleep in adults and juveniles using the ratio of slow oscillations to gamma oscillations ("depth of sleep", DOS). We observed a significantly larger DOS, as well as less-frequent state transitions in juveniles compared to adults. Furthermore, multichannel EEG revealed local slow oscillations, in addition to global (wide-spread) slow waves. The occurrence of these local waves was correlated with DOS and was higher in frontal sites. In addition, we observed that the functional connectivity increased rapidly during development and was significantly higher in adults than in juveniles. Additionally, a graph theory analysis of highly-correlated networks revealed numerous small networks in juveniles compared to adults, underscoring the lower connectivity observed in juveniles. Overall, our results reveal significant changes in the neural signature of sleep during development in an avian brain that are remarkably similar to age-dependent changes that occur in mammals.

                Monosynaptically restricted rabies viruses have been used for more than a decade for synaptic connectivity tracing. However, the verisimilitude of quantitative conclusions drawn from these experiments is largely unknown. The primary reason is the simple metrics commonly used, which generally disregard the effect of starter cell numbers. Here we present an experimental dataset with a broad range of starter cell numbers and explore their relationship with the number of input cells across the brain using descriptive statistics and modelling. We show that starter cell numbers strongly affect input fraction and convergence index measures, making quantitative comparisons unreliable. Furthermore, we suggest a principled way to analyse rabies derived connectivity data by taking advantage of the starter vs input cell relationship that we describe and validate across independent datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Socio-economic disadvantage is associated with alterations in brain wiring economy</a></h4>

              
                The quality of a child's social and physical environment is a key influence on brain development, educational attainment and mental wellbeing. However, there still remains a mechanistic gap in our understanding of how environmental influences converge on changes in the brain's developmental trajectory. In a sample of 145 children with structural diffusion tensor imaging data, we used generative network modelling to simulate the emergence of whole brain network organisation. We then applied data-driven clustering to stratify the sample according to socio-economic disadvantage, with one of the resulting clusters containing mostly children living below the poverty line. A formal comparison of the simulated networks from the generative model revealed that the computational principles governing network formation were subtly different for children experiencing socio-economic disadvantage, and that this resulted in significantly altered developmental timing of network modularity emergence. Children in the low socio-economic status (SES) group had a significantly slower time to peak modularity, relative to the higher SES group (t(69) = 3.02, P = 3.50 x 10-4, d = 0.491). In a subsequent simulation we showed that the alteration in generative properties increases the variability in wiring probabilities during network formation (KS test: D = 0.012, P < 0.001). One possibility is that multiple environmental influences such as stress, diet and environmental stimulation impact both the systematic coordination of neuronal activity and biological resource constraints, converging on a shift in the economic conditions under which networks form. Alternatively, it is possible that this stochasticity reflects an adaptive mechanism that creates 'resilient' networks better suited to unpredictable environments.

                The regularities of the world render an intricate interplay between past and present. Even across independent trials, current-trial perception can be automatically shifted by preceding trials, namely the 'serial bias'. Meanwhile, the neural implementation of the spontaneous shift of present by past that operates on multiple features remains unknown. In two auditory categorization experiments with human electrophysiology recordings, we demonstrate that serial bias arises from the co-occurrence of past-trial neural reactivation and the neural encoding of current-trial features. The meeting of past and present shifts the neural representation of current-trial features and modulates serial bias behavior. Critically, past-trial features (i.e., pitch, category, motor response) that constitute an 'event-file' keep their respective identities in working memory and are only reactivated by the corresponding features in the current trial, giving rise to dissociated feature-specific serial biases. This 'event-file' reactivation might constitute a fundamental mechanism for adaptive past-to-present generalizations over multiple features.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) aggregates. Central to disease progression is the gradual spread of pathological alpha-syn. alpha-syn aggregation is closely linked to progressive neuron loss. As such, clearance of alpha-syn aggregates may slow the progression of PD and lead to less severe symptoms. Evidence that non-neuronal cells play a role in PD and other synucleinopathies such as Lewy body dementia and multiple system atrophy are increasing. Our previous work has shown that pericytes - vascular mural cells that regulate the blood-brain barrier - contain alpha-syn aggregates in human PD brains. Here, we demonstrate that pericytes efficiently internalise fibrillar alpha-syn irrespective of being in a monoculture or mixed neuronal cell culture. Pericytes efficiently break down alpha-syn aggregates in vitro, with clear differences in the number of alpha-syn aggregates/cell and average aggregate size when comparing five pure alpha-syn strains (Fibrils, Ribbons, fibrils65, fibrils91 and fibrils110). Furthermore, pericytes derived from PD brains have a less uniform response than those derived from control brains. Our results highlight the vital role brain vasculature may play in reducing alpha-syn burden in PD.

                N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays diverse roles in the regulation of mRNA metabolism. In the mammalian brain it has been linked to developmental processes and memory function. However, the precise role of m6A in the context synaptic plasticity and especially during impaired cognition are not fully understood. Here, we describe the mouse and human brain m6A epi-transcriptome in a tissue-specific manner. We furthermore show that m6A levels undergo a massive decrease across mouse brain regions as a consequence of aging. In addition, Alzheimer's disease in humans correlates with decreased N6-methylation in a similar population of transcripts that are linked to synaptic function and localized to synapses, such as the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). We furthermore show that reduced m6A levels impair synaptic protein-synthesis of CAMKII. Our results suggest that m6A-RNA-methylation is an important mechanism to control synaptic protein synthesis which is affected early in cognitive diseases.

                It is known that endocytosis of synaptic vesicles, and docking of these vesicles to their release sites, are regulated in a similar manner, but it has remained unclear whether the two processes are linked together mechanistically. To address this issue, we studied vesicular release during repeated trains of presynaptic action potentials. Synaptic responses decreased when the inter-train interval was shortened, indicating a gradual exhaustion of the recycling pool of vesicles, with a resting capacity of about 180 vesicles per active zone. This effect was partially counteracted by activation of a rapid recycling pathway that depended on the activation of myosin light chain kinase and that had a capacity of 200 vesicles per active zone. Vesicles arising from the rapid recycling route were preferentially docked in comparison with vesicles coming from an upstream pool, demonstrating a differential sorting of vesicles inside the readily releasable pool depending on their origin.

                Purpose: The neurometabolic timecourse of healthy aging is not well-established, in part due to diversity of quantification methodology. In this study, a large structured cross-sectional cohort of male and female subjects throughout adulthood was recruited to investigate neurometabolic changes as a function of age, using consensus-recommended magnetic resonance spectroscopy quantification methods. Methods: 102 healthy volunteers, with approximately equal numbers of male and female participants in each decade of age from the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s, were recruited with IRB approval. MR spectroscopic data were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner. Metabolite spectra were acquired using PRESS localization (TE = 30 ms; 96 transients) in the centrum semiovale (CSO) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Water-suppressed spectra were modeled using the Osprey algorithm, employing a basis set of 18 simulated metabolite basis functions and a cohort-mean measured macromolecular spectrum. Pearson correlations were conducted to assess relationships between metabolite concentrations and age for each voxel; paired t-tests were run to determine whether metabolite concentrations differed between the PCC and CSO. Results: Two datasets were excluded (1 ethanol; 1 unacceptably large lipid signal). Statistically significant age-by-metabolite correlations were seen for tCr (R2=0.36; p<0.001), tCho (R2=0.11; p<0.001), sI (R2=0.11; p=0.004), and mI (R2=0.10; p<0.001) in the CSO, and tCr (R2=0.15; p<0.001), tCho (R2=0.11; p<0.001), and GABA (R2=0.11; p=0.003) in the PCC. No significant correlations were seen between tNAA, NAA, GSH, Glx or Glu and age in either region (all p>0.25). Levels of sI were significantly higher in the PCC in female subjects (p<0.001) than in male subjects. There was a significant positive correlation between linewidth and age. Conclusion: The results indicated age correlations for tCho, tCr, sI, and mI in CSO and for tCr, tCho and GABA in PCC, while no age-related changes were found for NAA, tNAA, GSH, Glu or Glx. Our results provide a normative foundation for future work investigating the neurometabolic time course of healthy aging using MRS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical activity during naturalistic music listening reflects short-range predictions based on long-term experience</a></h4>

              
                Expectations shape our experience of music. However, the internal model upon which listeners form melodic expectations is still debated. Do expectations stem from Gestalt-like principles or statistical learning? If the latter, does long-term experience play an important role, or are short-term regularities sufficient? And finally, what length of context informs contextual expectations? To answer these questions, we presented human listeners with diverse naturalistic compositions from Western classical music, while recording neural activity using MEG. We quantified note-level melodic surprise and uncertainty using various computational models of music, including a state-of-the-art transformer neural network. A time-resolved regression analysis revealed that neural activity over fronto-temporal areas tracked melodic surprise particularly around 200 ms and 300-500 ms after note onset. This neural surprise response was dissociated from sensory-acoustic and adaptation effects. Neural surprise was best predicted by computational models that incorporated long-term statistical learning - rather than by simple, Gestalt-like principles. Yet, intriguingly, the surprise reflected primarily short-range musical contexts of less than ten notes. We present a full replication of our novel MEG results in an openly available EEG dataset. Together, these results elucidate the internal model that shapes melodic predictions during naturalistic music listening.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct patterns of cortical manifold expansion and contraction underlie human sensorimotor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Sensorimotor learning is a dynamic, systems-level process that involves the combined action of multiple neural systems distributed across the brain. Although we understand a great deal about the specialized cortical systems that support specific components of action (such as reaching), we know less about how cortical systems function in a coordinated manner to facilitate adaptive behaviour. To address this gap in knowledge, our study measured human brain activity using functional MRI (fMRI) while participants performed a classic sensorimotor adaptation task, and used a manifold learning approach to describe how behavioural changes during adaptation relate to changes in the landscape of cortical activity. During early adaptation, we found that areas in parietal and premotor cortex exhibited significant contraction along the cortical manifold, which was associated with their increased covariance with regions in higher-order association cortex, including both the default mode and fronto-parietal networks. By contrast, during late adaptation, when visuomotor errors had been largely reduced, we observed a significant expansion of visual cortex along the cortical manifold, which was associated with its reduced covariance with association cortex and its increased intraconnectivity. Lastly, we found that individuals who learned more rapidly exhibited greater covariance between regions in the sensorimotor and association cortices during early adaptation. Together, these findings are consistent with a view that sensorimotor adaptation depends on changes in the integration and segregation of neural activity across more specialized regions of unimodal cortex with regions in association cortex implicated in higher-order processes. More generally, they lend support to an emerging line of evidence implicating regions of the default mode network in task-based performance.

	<p>Background: Vessel perforation during stent mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is a rare and disastrous complication. A routine rescue strategy includes balloon occlusion for tamponade, procedure suspension, and lowering or normalizing blood pressure. However, this complication is still associated with poor outcome and high mortality. Objective: We present our experience with intra-arterial injection of thrombin in the treatment of vessel perforation secondary to microcatheter/microwire perforation, which prevents further deterioration in clinical outcomes. Methods: Cases with intraprocedural vessel perforation during mechanical thrombectomy were included in the final analysis. Clinical data, procedural details, and radiographic and clinical outcomes were collected. Results: Four patients with intraprocedural vessel perforation were included. Intraprocedural perforations occurred at the distal middle cerebral artery in two cases: the A2 segment in one case and the internal carotid artery terminus in one case. The etiology of four cases was intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS). The ruptured vessels were effectively occluded in all cases. Endovascular therapy was continued in three cases, and mTICI &amp;amp;ge; 2b recanalization was achieved in all cases. The culprit artery was kept patent on CTA for 72 h post-operation. No active bleeding was detected on follow-up CT post-operation. During the 90-day follow-up period, one patient died, modified Rankle Scare (mRS) 3 was observed in two patients, and mRS 4 was observed in one patient. Conclusions: The key benefit of this method is occluding the ruptured vessel without affecting the following MT. We propose that intra-arterial injection of prothrombin may be simple yet effective in managing vessel perforation complications during MT.</p>

	<p>Pain neuroscience education (PNE), a modern educational therapy, has been reported to be effective in pain control by reducing fear of movement. This study investigated the effects of additional PNE on a physical therapy rehabilitation protocol (PTRP) following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). In this single-blind, randomized controlled trial, 34 patients who had undergone ARCR were randomly allocated (1:1) into two groups: PNE (PTRP plus PNE) and PTRP. PTRP was performed five times a week, for four weeks, 115 min per session (physical agents, manual therapy, and exercises), and PNE was performed twice at the beginning (face-to-face PNE) and end (non-face-to-face) of the PTRP. The outcome measures were measured four times for pain intensity, pain cognition, and shoulder function; two times for a range of motion; and once for satisfaction. No significant difference in pain intensity was observed between the groups. However, in pain cognition, the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia avoidance showed a significant interaction between time and group, and PNE showed a higher effect size than PTRP in the post-test and follow-up in several variables. In conclusion, the significant improvement in avoidance in postoperative rehabilitation suggests that there is a partially positive benefit in terms of pain, range of motion, and shoulder function in ARCR patients.</p>

	<p>This paper aims to collect a compendium of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exploring the effects of cognitively engaging physical activity (PA) interventions (basketball and floorball) on various domain-specific executive functions (EFs) in children aged 4 to 12. Following the PRISMA principle, 11 articles (total sample size: 2053) were analyzed for effect size and moderating impact with Stata 13.0 software. Overall EFs (SMD = 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.32, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), updating (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.30, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and shifting (SMD=0.32, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.61, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) were enhanced by cognitively engaging PA interventions. Age and BMI were found to have no effect on overall EFs performance in Meta regression. Overall EFs performance was improved by interventions with a session length (&amp;amp;ge;35 min) (SMD = 0.30, 95 % CI 0.10 to 0.49, p = 0.033).The review suggests that despite the moderate effect sizes, cognitively engaging PA may be an effective approach to improving EFs in children aged 4 to 12, especially updating and shifting.</p>

	<p>Background: Glioma is one of the most common malignant tumors of the central nervous system. Immune infiltration of tumor microenvironment was associated with overall survival in low grade glioma (LGG). However, effects of Tyrosine phosphatase receptor type N (PTPRN) on the progress of LGG and its correlation with tumor infiltration are unclear. Methods: Here, datasets of LGG were from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and normal samples were from GTEx dataset. Gepia website and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) Database were used to analyze the mRNA and protein expression of PTPRN. We evaluated the influence of PTPRN on survival of LGG patients. MethSurv was used to explore the expression and prognostic patterns of single CpG methylation of PTPRN gene in LGG. The correlations between the clinical information and PTPRN expression were analyzed using logistic regression and Multivariate Cox regression. We also explored the correlation between PTPRN expression and cancer immune infiltration by TIMER. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was formed using TCGA RNA-seq datasets. Results: PTPRN mRNA and protein expression decreased in LGG compared to normal brain tissue in TCGA and HPA database. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high expression level of PTPRN correlated with a good overall survival (OS) of patients with LGG. The Multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that PTPRN expression and other clinical-pathological factors (age, WHO grade, IDH status, and primary therapy outcome) significantly correlated with OS of LGG patients. The DNA methylation pattern of PTPRN with significant prognostic value were confirmed, including cg00672332, cg06971096, cg01382864, cg03970036, cg10140638, cg16166796, cg03545227, and cg25569248. Interestingly, PTPRN expression level significantly negatively correlated with infiltrating level of B cell, CD4+ T cells, Macrophages, Neutrophils, and DCs in LGG. Finally, GSEA showed that signaling pathways, mainly associated with tumor microenvironment and immune cells, were significantly enriched in PTPRN high expression. Conclusion: PTPRN is a potential biomarker and correlates with tumor immune infiltration in LGG.</p>

	<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a novel technique to stimulate the human brain through the scalp. Over the years, identifying the optimal brain region and stimulation parameters has been a subject of debate in the literature on therapeutic uses of repetitive TMS (rTMS). Nevertheless, the primary motor cortex (M1) has been a conventional target for rTMS to treat motor symptoms, such as hemiplegia and spasticity, as it controls the voluntary movement of the body. However, with an expanding knowledge base of the M1 cortical and subcortical connections, M1-rTMS has shown a therapeutic efficacy that goes beyond the conventional motor rehabilitation to involve pain, headache, fatigue, dysphagia, speech and voice impairments, sleep disorders, cognitive dysfunction, disorders of consciousness, anxiety, depression, and bladder dysfunction. In this review, we summarize the latest evidence on using M1-rTMS to treat non-motor symptoms of diverse etiologies and discuss the potential mechanistic rationale behind the management of each of these symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Comparing Surrogates to Evaluate Precisely Timed Higher-Order Spike Correlations</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The generation of surrogate data, i.e., the modification of data to destroy a certain feature, can be considered as the implementation of a null-hypothesis whenever an analytical approach is not feasible. Thus, surrogate data generation has been extensively used to assess the significance of spike correlations in parallel spike trains. In this context, one of the main challenges is to properly construct the desired null-hypothesis distribution and to avoid altering the single spike train statistics. A classical surrogate technique is uniform dithering (UD), which displaces spikes locally and uniformly distributed, to destroy temporal properties on a fine timescale while keeping them on a coarser one. Here, we compare UD against five similar surrogate techniques in the context of the detection of significant spatiotemporal spike patterns. We evaluate the surrogates for their performance, first on spike trains based on point process models with constant firing rate, and second on modeled nonstationary artificial data to assess the potential detection of false positive (FP) patterns in a more complex and realistic setting. We determine which statistical features of the spike trains are modified and to which extent. Moreover, we find that UD fails as an appropriate surrogate because it leads to a loss of spikes in the context of binning and clipping, and thus to a large number of FP patterns. The other surrogates achieve a better performance in detecting precisely timed higher-order correlations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Analysis of emergent patterns in crossing flows of pedestrians reveals an invariant of ‘stripe’ formation in human data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pratik Mullick, Sylvain Fontaine, Cécile Appert-Rolland, Anne-Hélène Olivier, William H. Warren, Julien Pettré</p>

When two streams of pedestrians cross at an angle, striped patterns spontaneously emerge as a result of local pedestrian interactions. This clear case of self-organized pattern formation remains to be elucidated. In counterflows, with a crossing angle of 180°, alternating <i>lanes</i> of traffic are commonly observed moving in opposite directions, whereas in crossing flows at an angle of 90°, diagonal <i>stripes</i> have been reported. Naka (1977) hypothesized that stripe orientation is perpendicular to the bisector of the crossing angle. However, studies of crossing flows at acute and obtuse angles remain underdeveloped. We tested the bisector hypothesis in experiments on small groups (18-19 participants each) crossing at seven angles (30° intervals), and analyzed the geometric properties of stripes. We present two novel computational methods for analyzing striped patterns in pedestrian data: (i) an edge-cutting algorithm, which detects the dynamic formation of stripes and allows us to measure local properties of individual stripes; and (ii) a pattern-matching technique, based on the Gabor function, which allows us to estimate global properties (orientation and wavelength) of the striped pattern at a time <i>T</i>. We find an invariant property: stripes in the two groups are parallel and perpendicular to the bisector at all crossing angles. In contrast, other properties depend on the crossing angle: stripe spacing (wavelength), stripe size (number of pedestrians per stripe), and crossing time all decrease as the crossing angle increases from 30° to 180°, whereas the number of stripes increases with crossing angle. We also observe that the width of individual stripes is dynamically squeezed as the two groups cross each other. The findings thus support the bisector hypothesis at a wide range of crossing angles, although the theoretical reasons for this invariant remain unclear. The present results provide empirical constraints on theoretical studies and computational models of crossing flows.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Contextual cues are not unique for motor learning: Task-dependant switching of feedback controllers</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Justinas Česonis, David W. Franklin</p>

The separation of distinct motor memories by contextual cues is a well known and well studied phenomenon of feedforward human motor control. However, there is no clear evidence of such context-induced separation in feedback control. Here we test both experimentally and computationally if context-dependent switching of feedback controllers is possible in the human motor system. Specifically, we probe visuomotor feedback responses of our human participants in two different tasks—stop and hit—and under two different schedules. The first, blocked schedule, is used to measure the behaviour of stop and hit controllers in isolation, showing that it can only be described by two independent controllers with two different sets of control gains. The second, mixed schedule, is then used to compare how such behaviour evolves when participants regularly switch from one task to the other. Our results support our hypothesis that there is contextual switching of feedback controllers, further extending the accumulating evidence of shared features between feedforward and feedback control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inference and dynamic simulation of malaria using a simple climate-driven entomological model of malaria transmission</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Israel Ukawuba, Jeffrey Shaman</p>

Given the crucial role of climate in malaria transmission, many mechanistic models of malaria represent vector biology and the parasite lifecycle as functions of climate variables in order to accurately capture malaria transmission dynamics. Lower dimension mechanistic models that utilize implicit vector dynamics have relied on indirect climate modulation of transmission processes, which compromises investigation of the ecological role played by climate in malaria transmission. In this study, we develop an implicit process-based malaria model with direct climate-mediated modulation of transmission pressure borne through the Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR). The EIR, a measure of the number of infectious bites per person per unit time, includes the effects of vector dynamics, resulting from mosquito development, survivorship, feeding activity and parasite development, all of which are moderated by climate. We combine this EIR-model framework, which is driven by rainfall and temperature, with Bayesian inference methods, and evaluate the model’s ability to simulate local transmission across 42 regions in Rwanda over four years. Our findings indicate that the biologically-motivated, EIR-model framework is capable of accurately simulating seasonal malaria dynamics and capturing of some of the inter-annual variation in malaria incidence. However, the model unsurprisingly failed to reproduce large declines in malaria transmission during 2018 and 2019 due to elevated anti-malaria measures, which were not accounted for in the model structure. The climate-driven transmission model also captured regional variation in malaria incidence across Rwanda’s diverse climate, while identifying key entomological and epidemiological parameters important to seasonal malaria dynamics. In general, this new model construct advances the capabilities of implicitly-forced lower dimension dynamical malaria models by leveraging climate drivers of malaria ecology and transmission.

                <p>by Melanie Duc Bo Massey, Suchinta Arif, Shanukie Embuldeniya, Karma Nanglu, Joseph Bielawski</p>

Undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds (e.g., Black, Indigenous, and people of color [BIPOC], members of the Deaf community, people with disabilities, members of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community, from low-income backgrounds, or underrepresented genders) continue to face exclusion and marginalization in higher education. In this piece, authored and edited by a diverse group of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) scholars, we present 10 simple rules for succeeding as an underrepresented STEM undergraduate student, illuminating the “hidden curriculum” of STEM specifically as it relates to the underrepresented undergraduate experience. Our rules begin by encouraging students to embrace their own distinct identities and scientific voices and explain how students can overcome challenges unique to underrepresented students throughout their undergraduate degrees. These rules are derived from a combination of our own experiences navigating our undergraduate STEM degrees and the growing body of literature on improving success for underrepresented students.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The lexical categorization model: A computational model of left ventral occipito-temporal cortex activation in visual word recognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Benjamin Gagl, Fabio Richlan, Philipp Ludersdorfer, Jona Sassenhagen, Susanne Eisenhauer, Klara Gregorova, Christian J. Fiebach</p>

To characterize the functional role of the left-ventral occipito-temporal cortex (lvOT) during reading in a quantitatively explicit and testable manner, we propose the <i>lexical categorization model</i> (LCM). The LCM assumes that lvOT optimizes linguistic processing by allowing fast meaning access when words are familiar and filtering out orthographic strings without meaning. The LCM successfully simulates benchmark results from functional brain imaging described in the literature. In a second evaluation, we empirically demonstrate that quantitative LCM simulations predict lvOT activation better than alternative models across three functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. We found that word-likeness, assumed as input into a lexical categorization process, is represented posteriorly to lvOT, whereas a dichotomous word/non-word output of the LCM could be localized to the downstream frontal brain regions. Finally, training the process of lexical categorization resulted in more efficient reading. In sum, we propose that word recognition in the ventral visual stream involves word-likeness extraction followed by lexical categorization before one can access word meaning.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The Aedes aegypti siRNA pathway mediates broad-spectrum defense against human pathogenic viruses and modulates antibacterial and antifungal defenses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuemei Dong, Shengzhang Dong, Nahid Borhani Dizaji, Natalie Rutkowski, Tyler Pohlenz, Kevin Myles, George Dimopoulos</p>

The mosquito’s innate immune system defends against a variety of pathogens, and the conserved siRNA pathway plays a central role in the control of viral infections. Here, we show that transgenic overexpression of Dicer2 (<i>Dcr2</i>) or <i>R2d2</i> resulted in an accumulation of 21-nucleotide viral sequences that was accompanied by a significant suppression of dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) replication, thus indicating the broad-spectrum antiviral response mediated by the siRNA pathway that can be applied for the development of novel arbovirus control strategies. Interestingly, overexpression of <i>Dcr2</i> or <i>R2d2</i> regulated the mRNA abundance of a variety of antimicrobial immune genes, pointing to additional functions of DCR2 and R2D2 as well as cross-talk between the siRNA pathway and other immune pathways. Accordingly, transgenic overexpression of <i>Dcr2</i> or <i>R2d2</i> resulted in a lesser proliferation of the midgut microbiota and increased resistance to bacterial and fungal infections.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A lifecourse mendelian randomization study highlights the long-term influence of childhood body size on later life heart structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Katie O’Nunain, Chloe Park, Helena Urquijo, Genevieve M. Leyden, Alun D. Hughes, George Davey Smith, Tom G. Richardson</p>

Children with obesity typically have larger left ventricular heart dimensions during adulthood. However, whether this is due to a persistent effect of adiposity extending into adulthood is challenging to disentangle due to confounding factors throughout the lifecourse. We conducted a multivariable mendelian randomization (MR) study to separate the independent effects of childhood and adult body size on 4 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of heart structure and function in the UK Biobank (UKB) study. Strong evidence of a genetically predicted effect of childhood body size on all measures of adulthood heart structure was identified, which remained robust upon accounting for adult body size using a multivariable MR framework (e.g., left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), Beta = 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23 to 0.43, <i>P</i> = 4.6 × 10<sup>−10</sup>). Sensitivity analyses did not suggest that other lifecourse measures of body composition were responsible for these effects. Conversely, evidence of a genetically predicted effect of childhood body size on various other MRI-based measures, such as fat percentage in the liver (Beta = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.23, <i>P</i> = 0.002) and pancreas (Beta = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.33, <i>P</i> = 3.9 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), attenuated upon accounting for adult body size. Our findings suggest that childhood body size has a long-term (and potentially immutable) influence on heart structure in later life. In contrast, effects of childhood body size on other measures of adulthood organ size and fat percentage evaluated in this study are likely explained by the long-term consequence of remaining overweight throughout the lifecourse.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hyperoside: a review of pharmacological effects [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Hyperoside, also known as quercetin-3-O-β-D-galactopyranoside, belongs to the class of flavonol glycosides. Its aglycon is quercetin, and the sugar base is galactopyranoside. It is made of quercetin. The O atom at the 3rd position of the element is connected to the sugar group by a β-glycosidic bond. Hyperoside, which is widely present in the planted objects, such as the fruits and whole plants of Hypericaceae, Rosaceae, Campanulaceae, Lamiaceae, and Berberis spp., has received extensive attention due to its anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-tumor, and other disease activities, as well as its protective effects on the cardiovascular system, nervous system, digestive system and immune system. While glycosides are a commonly researched topic, there are very few studies on the metabolic pathways, and its overuse and adverse reactions are rarely reported. This article provides a comprehensive review of the pharmacological research results of hyperoside, and a new perspective on the limitations of the existing research on metabolic pathways and toxicology. It provides new ideas for further research and clinical application of hyperoside.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A quantitative study exploring the acceptance of the eHealth model for mental wellness among digital workers [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: eHealth makes use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to improve health. In the digital age, the use of eHealth applications and other health-related applications has gained popularity, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the pandemic, many uncertainties have arisen, causing stress and affecting the mental health of many skilled workers in the digital industry, particularly in the ICT, computing, and creative media industries. eHealth applications have the potential to benefit people's health. As a prerequisite for effective implementation of eHealth for mental wellness (EHMW), this paper examines the acceptance of EHMW among digital workers in Malaysia.  The objectives of this research are two-fold: 1) To explore the acceptance of EHMW among digital workers in a local Premier Digital Tech Institution (PDTI), and 2) To explore how these talents' demographic profiles, mental health literacy and workplace wellness influence their acceptance of EHMW.   Methods: This research surveyed 41 digital workers who played vital roles in providing digital skills at a tertiary education level.    Results: Most respondents agreed that eHealth was appropriate for managing mental wellness. Among the three eHealth domains for managing mental wellness, the acceptance level is the highest for the application domain of "interacting for health", with male respondents more likely to accept the use of EHMW.  Conclusions: This small-scale survey could not fully examine the acceptance of eHealth and its usage patterns for mental wellness among digital workers in Malaysia. Future research will target more digital workers in Malaysia. This research addresses the research gap on the eHealth perspectives of digital workers on their acceptance, and the potential influence of demographic profiles, mental health literacy, and workplace wellness on EHMW's acceptance of digital health tools/platforms to promote their mental wellness.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Hyperemesis gravidarum, high transaminases level and prolonged prothrombin time: is it an acute liver injury? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in the first trimester of pregnancy. It is considered a benign condition, but severe complications, fortunately rare, have been reported. Frequently, this condition is associated with a perturbed liver function tests, which remains without severe consequences. The clinical presentation may be suggestive of an acute liver injury (ALI), especially as the end of the first trimester approaches, pregnancy specific and non-specific liver diseases should be considered. Case: A 28-year-old primigravida, 14-week pregnant woman affected by hyperemesis gravidarum, developed high transaminases level and spontaneously low prothrombin time (PT) ratio. An ALI was suspected as transaminases were very high and our patient was at the end of the first trimester. An exhaustive etiological work-up was negative. In the second line, the factor V assay was conducted, which showed a normal activity, and the vitamin K level was low. We therefore concluded that it was hyperhemesis gravidarum complicated by fluid and electrolyte disorders and vitamin K deficiency. She had parenteral rehydration and a proton pump inhibitor. She received intravenous vitamin K 10 mg daily for three days. The outcome was excellent without any maternal or fetal impact. Conclusion: Hyperhemesis gravidarum is a common condition in the first trimester of pregnancy that usually has a favourable outcome. However, it is important to be attentive to possible complications, including vitamin K deficiency with its maternal and fetal consequences.  On the other hand, in case of major disturbance of the liver function tests, we should not overlook acute liver injury and should not hesitate to initiate an adequate etilogical investigation.

                Gene symbols are recognizable identifiers for gene names but are unstable and error-prone due to aliasing, manual entry, and unintentional conversion by spreadsheets to date format. Official gene symbol resources such as HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) for human genes and the Mouse Genome Informatics project (MGI) for mouse genes provide authoritative sources of valid, aliased, and outdated symbols, but lack a programmatic interface and correction of symbols converted by spreadsheets. We present HGNChelper, an R package that identifies known aliases and outdated gene symbols based on the HGNC human and MGI mouse gene symbol databases, in addition to common mislabeling introduced by spreadsheets, and provides corrections where possible. HGNChelper identified invalid gene symbols in the most recent Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB 7.0) and in platform annotation files of the Gene Expression Omnibus, with prevalence ranging from ~3% in recent platforms to 30-40% in the earliest platforms from 2002-03. HGNChelper is installable from CRAN.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Space environment provides many challenges to pilots, astronauts, and space scientists, which are constantly subjected to unique conditions, including microgravity, radiations, hypoxic condition, absence of the day and night cycle, etc. These stressful stimuli have the potential to affect many human physiological systems, triggering physical and biological adaptive changes to re-establish the homeostatic state. A particular concern regards the risks for the effects of spaceflight on the central nervous system (CNS), as several lines of evidence reported a great impact on neuroplasticity, cognitive functions, neurovestibular system, short-term memory, cephalic fluid shift, reduction in motor function, and psychological disturbances, especially during long-term missions. Aside these potential detrimental effects, the other side of the coin reflects the potential benefit of applicating space-related conditions on Earth-based life sciences, as cancer research. Here, we focused on examining the effect of real and simulated microgravity on CNS functions, both in humans and in cellular models, browsing the different techniques to experience or mime microgravity on-ground. Increasing evidence demonstrate that cancer cells, and brain cancer cells in particular, are negatively affected by microgravity, in terms of alteration in cell morphology, proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis, representing an advancing novel side of space-based investigations. Overall, deeper understandings about the mechanisms by which space environment influences CNS and tumor biology may be promisingly translated into many clinical fields, ranging from aerospace medicine to neuroscience and oncology, representing an enormous pool of knowledge for the implementation of countermeasures and therapeutic applications.</p>

     alt="Effects of 4-month running exercise on the spatial learning ability and white matter volume and microvessels of middle-aged female and male rats"/>
<p>A comprehensive analysis of the effects of 4 months treadmill running on spatial learning ability, white matter volume and the microvessels in the white matter in middle-aged rats revealed actual benefits of exercise at the brain aging of middle-aged female and male rats. This report showed that there were sex differences in the protective effects of the 4-month exercise protocol on spatial learning and white matter volume. 4 months of exercise can protect the microvessels in the white matter of middle-aged rats.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Age-related degeneration of microvessels is known to occur in white matter, and exercise training can enhance brain function and promote cerebral blood flow. However, the effects of exercise training on microvessels in aged white matter are unknown. Forty-one middle-aged male and female Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into a sedentary group and an exercised group. The rats in the exercised group were made to run on treadmills for 4 months. The spatial learning capacities of all groups were then assessed with the Morris water maze. White matter and its microvessels were investigated using immunohistological techniques and stereological methods. In the exercised group, females but not males, showed improved performance over time in the Morris water maze. In females but not males, the exercised rats showed significantly increased white matter volume compared with that of sedentary rats. The total length of microvessels in the white matter in the exercised group was significantly increased compared with that in the sedentary group in both males and females, but the total volume and total surface area of microvessels in the white matter did not differ significantly between the sedentary and exercised rats. Regular treadmill exercise had protective effects on spatial learning capacity, white matter volume, and the total length of microvessels in the white matter in middle-aged female rats and on the total length of microvessels in the white matter in middle-aged male rats. The results obtained might increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which exercise delays brain aging.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Neural consequences of chronic sleep disruption</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies in both humans and animal models call into question the completeness of recovery after chronic sleep disruption. Studies in humans have identified cognitive domains particularly vulnerable to delayed or incomplete recovery after chronic sleep disruption, including sustained vigilance and episodic memory. These findings, in turn, provide a focus for animal model studies to critically test the lasting impact of sleep loss on the brain. Here, we summarize the human response to sleep disruption and then discuss recent findings in animal models examining recovery responses in circuits pertinent to vigilance and memory.
