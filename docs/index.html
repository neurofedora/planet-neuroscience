              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09128">A UDP Packet Format Establishing Adress Event Representation Communication Between Remote Neuromorphic and Biological Setups</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.09128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of brain-machine interfaces, biohybrids offer an interesting new perspective, as in them, the technological side acts like a closed-loop extension or real counterpart of biological tissue, instead of the usual open loop approaches in tranditional BMI. To achieve a credible counterpart to biological tissue, biohybrids usually employ one or several neuromorphic components as the hardware half of the biohybrid. However, advanced neuromorphic circuit such as memristor crossbars usually operate best in a dedicated lab with corresponding support equipment. The same is true for biological tissue, which makes co-locating all of the parts of a biohybrid in the same lab challenging. Here, we present as solution to this co-location issue a simple method to connect biohybrids via the internet by a custom UDP packet format. We show that the characteristics achieved with our solution (jitter, delay, packet loss, packet reordering) on a standard internet connection are compatible with various biohybrid processing paradigms, and we present a short three-ways experiment as proof-of-concept. The described UDP format has been employed to link biohybrids and neuromorphic circuits in four different EC-funded projects.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09296">Causal Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity Prevents Assembly Fusion in Recurrent Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.09296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The organization of neurons into functionally related assemblies is a fundamental feature of cortical networks, yet our understanding of how these assemblies maintain distinct identities while sharing members remains limited. Here we analyze how spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) shapes the formation and stability of overlapping neuronal assemblies in recurrently coupled networks of spiking neuron models. Using numerical simulations and an associated mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the temporal structure of the STDP rule, specifically its degree of causality, critically determines whether assemblies that share neurons maintain segregation or merge together after training is completed. We find that causal STDP rules, where potentiation/depression occurs strictly when presynaptic spikes precede/proceed postsynaptic spikes, allow assemblies to remain distinct even with substantial overlap in membership. This stability arises because causal STDP effectively cancels the symmetric correlations introduced by common inputs from shared neurons. In contrast, acausal STDP rules lead to assembly fusion when overlap exceeds a critical threshold, due to unchecked growth of common input correlations. Our results provide theoretical insight into how spike-timing-dependent learning rules can support distributed representation where individual neurons participate in multiple assemblies while maintaining functional specificity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09684">Data mining the functional architecture of the brain's circuitry</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.09684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain is a highly complex organ consisting of a myriad of subsystems that flexibly interact and adapt over time and context to enable perception, cognition, and behavior. Understanding the multi-scale nature of the brain, i.e., how circuit- and moleclular-level interactions build up the fundamental components of brain function, holds incredible potential for developing interventions for neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, as well as open new understanding into our very nature. Historically technological limitations have forced systems neuroscience to be local in anatomy (localized, small neural populations in single brain areas), in behavior (studying single tasks), in time (focusing on specific stages of learning or development), and in modality (focusing on imaging single biological quantities). New developments in neural recording technology and behavioral monitoring now provide the data needed to break free of local neuroscience to global neuroscience: i.e., understanding how the brain's many subsystem interact, adapt, and change across the multitude of behaviors animals and humans must perform to thrive. Specifically, while we have much knowledge of the anatomical architecture of the brain (i.e., the hardware), we finally are approaching the data needed to find the functional architecture and discover the fundamental properties of the software that runs on the hardware. We must take this opportunity to bridge between the vast amounts of data to discover this functional architecture which will face numerous challenges from low-level data alignment up to high level questions of interpretable mathematical models of behavior that can synthesize the myriad of datasets together.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16678">A unified model for the origins of spongiform degeneration and other neuropathological features in prion diseases</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.16678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decades after their initial observation in prion-infected brain tissues, the identities of virus-like dense particles, varicose tubules, and oval bodies containing parallel bands and fibrils have remained elusive. Our recent work revealed that a phenotype of dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), most notable for the perinuclear space (PNS), contributes to spongiform degeneration. To assess the significance of this phenotype for the etiology of prion diseases, we explored whether it can be functionally linked to other neuropathological hallmarks observed in these diseases, as this would indicate it to be a central event. Having surveyed the neuropathological record and other distant literature niches, we propose a model in which pathogenic forms of the prion protein poison raft domains, including essential Na+, K+-ATPases (NKAs) embedded within them, thereby triggering an ER-centered cellular rescue program coordinated by the unfolded protein response (UPR). The execution of this program stalls general protein synthesis, causing the deterioration of synaptic spines. As the disease progresses, cells selectively increase sterol biosynthesis, along with ribosome and ER biogenesis. These adaptive rescue attempts cause morphological changes to the ER which manifest as ER dilation or ER hypertrophy in a manner that is influenced by Ca2+ influx into the cell. The nuclear-to-cytoplasmic transport of mRNAs and tRNAs interrupts in late stage disease, thereby depriving ribosomes of supplies and inducing them to aggregate into a paracrystalline form. In support of this model, we share previously reported data, whose features are consistent with the interpretation that 1) the phenotype of ER dilation is observed in major prion diseases, 2) varicose tubules and oval bodies represent ER hypertrophy, and 3) virus-like dense particles are paracrystalline aggregates of inactive ribosomes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03840">Flexible task abstractions emerge in linear networks with fast and bounded units</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.03840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Animals survive in dynamic environments changing at arbitrary timescales, but such data distribution shifts are a challenge to neural networks. To adapt to change, neural systems may change a large number of parameters, which is a slow process involving forgetting past information. In contrast, animals leverage distribution changes to segment their stream of experience into tasks and associate them with internal task abstracts. Animals can then respond flexibly by selecting the appropriate task abstraction. However, how such flexible task abstractions may arise in neural systems remains unknown. Here, we analyze a linear gated network where the weights and gates are jointly optimized via gradient descent, but with neuron-like constraints on the gates including a faster timescale, nonnegativity, and bounded activity. We observe that the weights self-organize into modules specialized for tasks or sub-tasks encountered, while the gates layer forms unique representations that switch the appropriate weight modules (task abstractions). We analytically reduce the learning dynamics to an effective eigenspace, revealing a virtuous cycle: fast adapting gates drive weight specialization by protecting previous knowledge, while weight specialization in turn increases the update rate of the gating layer. Task switching in the gating layer accelerates as a function of curriculum block size and task training, mirroring key findings in cognitive neuroscience. We show that the discovered task abstractions support generalization through both task and subtask composition, and we extend our findings to a non-linear network switching between two tasks. Overall, our work offers a theory of cognitive flexibility in animals as arising from joint gradient descent on synaptic and neural gating in a neural network architecture.

                arXiv:2501.09514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the literature on runtime analyses of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), researchers have recently explored univariate EDAs for multi-valued decision variables. Particularly, Jedidia et al. gave the first runtime analysis of the multi-valued UMDA on the r-valued LeadingOnes (r-LeadingOnes) functions and Adak et al. gave the first runtime analysis of the multi-valued cGA (r-cGA) on the r-valued OneMax function. We utilize their framework to conduct an analysis of the multi-valued cGA on the r-valued LeadingOnes function. Even for the binary case, a runtime analysis of the classical cGA on LeadingOnes was not yet available. In this work, we show that the runtime of the r-cGA on r-LeadingOnes is O(n^2r^2 log^3 n log^2 r) with high probability.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09716">Intelligent OLSR Routing Protocol Optimization for VANETs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.09716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in wireless technologies have given rise to the emergence of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). In such networks, the limited coverage of WiFi and the high mobility of the nodes generate frequent topology changes and network fragmentations. For these reasons, and taking into account that there is no central manager entity, routing packets through the network is a challenging task. Therefore, offering an efficient routing strategy is crucial to the deployment of VANETs. This paper deals with the optimal parameter setting of the optimized link state routing (OLSR), which is a well-known mobile ad hoc network routing protocol, by defining an optimization problem. This way, a series of representative metaheuristic algorithms (particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing) are studied in this paper to find automatically optimal configurations of this routing protocol. In addition, a set of realistic VANET scenarios (based in the city of M\'alaga) have been defined to accurately evaluate the performance of the network under our automatic OLSR. In the experiments, our tuned OLSR configurations result in better quality of service (QoS) than the standard request for comments (RFC 3626), as well as several human experts, making it amenable for utilization in VANET configurations.

Abstract: Designing efficient quantum circuits that leverage quantum advantage compared to classical computing has become increasingly critical. Genetic algorithms have shown potential in generating such circuits through artificial evolution. However, integrating quantum advantage into the fitness function of these algorithms remains unexplored. In this paper, we aim to enhance the efficiency of quantum circuit design by proposing two novel approaches for incorporating quantum advantage metrics into the fitness function of genetic algorithms.1 We evaluate our approaches based on the Bernstein-Vazirani Problem and the Unstructured Database Search Problem as test cases. The results demonstrate that our approaches not only improve the convergence speed of the genetic algorithm but also produce circuits comparable to expert-designed solutions. Our findings suggest that automated quantum circuit design using genetic algorithms that incorporate a measure of quantum advantage is a promising approach to accelerating the development of quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), a technique that records electrical activity from the scalp using electrodes, plays a vital role in affective computing. However, fully utilizing the multi-domain characteristics of EEG signals remains a significant challenge. Traditional single-perspective analyses often fail to capture the complex interplay of temporal, frequency, and spatial dimensions in EEG data. To address this, we introduce a multi-view graph transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations that integrates information across three domains: temporal dynamics from continuous series, frequency features extracted from frequency bands, and inter-channel relationships captured through several spatial encodings. This comprehensive approach allows model to capture the nuanced properties inherent in EEG signals, enhancing its flexibility and representational power. Evaluation on publicly available datasets demonstrates that MVGT surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance. The results highlight its ability to extract multi-domain information and effectively model inter-channel relationships, showcasing its potential for EEG-based emotion recognition tasks.

	<p>Background: Perinatal brain injury is a leading cause of developmental disabilities, including cerebral palsy. However, further work is needed to understand early brain development in the presence of brain injury. In this case report, we examine the longitudinal neuromotor development of a term infant following a significant loss of right-hemispheric brain tissue due to a unilateral ischemic stroke. Our analysis focuses on the integrity and development of the corticospinal tract (CST) from the lesioned hemisphere. This case provides a unique opportunity to evaluate CST development after loss of the majority of the motor cortex. Methods: Evaluations were conducted when the infant was 4 (Visit-1), 18 (Visit 2), and 25 (Visit 3) months old. Assessments included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize the lesion and quantify CST structural integrity, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) to evaluate CST functional circuitry, and neuromotor assessments. Results: At Visit 1, bilateral CSTs were identified through diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) despite an estimated loss of 92.7% (7.3% retained) of age-typical motor cortex from the right hemisphere. Both hemispheres exhibited bilateral motor-evoked potential in response to stimulation with spTMS, which remained when reassessed at Visits 2 and 3. Longitudinal MRI showed distinct developmental trajectories of CST integrity in each hemisphere, with the lesioned hemisphere exhibiting initial increases in integrity between Visits 1 and 2 followed by a decrease in integrity between Visits 2 and 3. The non-lesioned hemisphere showed increased integrity from Visit 1 to Visit 2, which remained stable at Visit 3. Motor assessments at all visits indicated a high risk of cerebral palsy. Conclusions: This report highlights the utility of MRI and spTMS in studying neuromotor development. The findings reveal preserved functional bilateral CST circuitry despite majority loss of the right-hemispheric motor cortex as well as distinct developmental trajectories in CST integrity between hemispheres. These results underscore the potential for neural plasticity after perinatal brain injury. Clinical Trials Registration: NCT05013736.</p>

	<p>The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has been developed and edited by the World Health Organisation and represents the global standard for recording health information and causes of death. The ICD-11 is the eleventh revision and came into effect on 1 January 2022. Perceptual disturbances refer to abnormalities in the way sensory information is interpreted by the brain, leading to distortions in the perception of reality. These can manifest as distorted perceptions or as phantom perceptions and can occur in all sensory modalities as visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory tactile, vestibular, proprioceptory or interoceptory disturbances. There are similar brain mechanisms involved in the generation of these analogous perceptual disturbances and disorders, and they are treated with similar approaches. Perceptual disturbances are highly prevalent, with large variations across the different sensory modalities. They can be associated with significant suffering and cause a high socioeconomic burden. Perceptual disturbances can be symptoms of another disease or disease entities on their own. In the context of pain, this is reflected by the distinction between secondary pain (pain as a symptom of another underlying condition) and primary pain (a disease in its own right, rather than being a symptom of another underlying condition) in the ICD-11. Such a clear distinction is not found in an entirely consistent way across the various sensory modalities. By using the example of auditory phantom perceptions, we propose a framework for the classification of sensory disorders in alignment with the classification of pain in the ICD-11. The descriptions of the sensory disturbances should include (1) a causal aspect (primary versus secondary), (2) a temporal aspect (acute vs. chronic and persistent vs. intermittent), (3) a cognitive, emotional and autonomic interpretation aspect (=suffering) and (4) a social aspect (=disability). If the latter two aspects are present, we propose that the sensory disturbance is called a sensory disorder.</p>

                <p>Short-term motor adaptation to novel movement dynamics has been shown to involve at least two concurrent learning processes: a slow process that responds weakly to error but retains information well and a fast process that responds strongly to error but has poor retention. This modeling framework can explain several properties of motion-dependent motor adaptation (e.g., 24&nbsp;h retention). An important assumption of this computational framework is that learning is only based on the experienced movement error, and the effect of noise (either internally generated or externally applied) is not considered. We examined the respective error sensitivity by quantifying adaptation in three subject groups distinguished by the noise added to the motion-dependent perturbation. We assessed the feedforward adaptive changes in motor output and examined the adaptation rate, retention, and decay of learning. Applying a two-state modeling framework showed that the applied noise during training mainly affected the fast learning process, with the slow process largely unaffected; participants in the higher noise groups demonstrated a reduced force profile following training, but the decay rate across groups was similar, suggesting that the slow process was unimpaired across conditions. Collectively, our results provide evidence that noise significantly decreases motor adaptation, but this reduction may be due to its influence over specific learning mechanisms. Importantly, this may have implications for how the motor system compensates for random fluctuations, especially when affected by brain disorders that result in movement tremor (e.g., essential tremor).</p>

                <p>Epilepsy, a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, significantly impacts patient quality of life. Current classification methods focus primarily on clinical observations and electroencephalography (EEG) analysis, often overlooking the underlying dynamics driving seizures. This study uses surface EEG data to identify seizure transitions using a dynamical systems&ndash;based framework&mdash;the taxonomy of seizure dynamotypes&mdash;previously examined only in invasive data. We applied principal component and independent component (IC) analysis to surface EEG recordings from 1,177 seizures in 158 patients with focal epilepsy, decomposing the signals into ICs. The ICs were visually labeled for clear seizure transitions and bifurcation morphologies (BifMs), which were then examined using Bayesian multilevel modeling in the context of clinical factors. Our analysis reveals that certain onset bifurcations (saddle node on invariant circle and supercritical Hopf) are more prevalent during wakefulness compared with their reduced rate during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, particularly NREM3. We discuss the possible implications of our results in the context of modeling approaches and suggest additional avenues to continue this exploration. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of automating this classification process using machine learning, achieving high performance in identifying seizure-related ICs and classifying interspike interval changes. Our findings suggest that the noise in surface EEG may obscure certain BifMs, and we suggest technical improvements that could enhance detection accuracy. Expanding the dataset and incorporating long-term biological rhythms, such as circadian and multiday cycles, may provide a more comprehensive understanding of seizure dynamics and improve clinical decision-making.</p>

                Background Studies assessing sub-maximal aerobic capacity in non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate sub-maximal aerobic capacity in CHB patients compared to apparently healthy participants (control-group). Methods A 6-min walk test was performed. The 6-min walk distance (6MWD) was recorded, along with heart-rate, oxygen hemoglobin saturation (SpO2), blood pressure, and dyspnea ( ie ; visual analogue scale) at rest (Rest) and at the end (End) of the test. Additionally, 6-min walk work (6MWW), “6MWD × body mass index (BMI), “6MWD × SpO2End”, and “estimated cardiorespiratory and muscular chain age” were calculated. Signs of physical intolerance were determined including abnormal 6MWD ( ie ; 6MWD < lower limit of normal), chronotropic insufficiency ( ie ; heart-rateEnd < 60% of maximal predicted heart-rate), high dyspnea ( ie ; dyspneaEnd > 5), and desaturation ( ie ; drop in SpO2 > 5 points). Results Compared to the control-group (n=28), the CHB-group (n=26) exhibited significantly lower 6MWD by 61 meters (13%), lower 6MWW by 5266 m.kg, lower “6MWD × BMI” by 1498 m.kg/m2, lower “6MWD × SpO2End” by 5650%, and lower heart-rateEnd by 26 bpm (12% predicted). The CHB-group included higher percentages of participants with chronotropic insufficiency (23.08% vs. 3.57% in the CG) and abnormal 6MWD (34.61% vs. 3.57% in the CG). CHB accelerated the aging of the “cardiorespiratory and muscular chain” by 11 years. Conclusion Non-cirrhotic CHB may contribute to reduced submaximal aerobic capacity and acceleration of “cardiorespiratory and muscular chain” aging. A regular physical activity program could be a valuable intervention to mitigate these effects.

Methods A structured questionnaire was distributed online to 393 participants aware of ESG practices, targeting Generation Z consumers. The survey assessed demographics, ESG awareness, brand image, WOM, and purchasing decisions using a Likert scale across five constructs: ESG Practices, Corporate Image, WOM, Trust, and Purchase Intention. Data were analyzed with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in IBM AMOS, following a two-step process: Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) for validation and path analysis for hypothesis testing. Results The findings indicate that ESG practices significantly enhance corporate image and positive WOM, which, in turn, foster consumer trust. Corporate image has a substantial impact on consumer trust (p < .001), while WOM also contributes to trust (p < .001). Trust was found to be a strong predictor of purchase intention, demonstrating the mediating role of corporate image and WOM between ESG practices and purchasing behavior. Conclusions ESG practices are critical in shaping consumer perceptions and fostering loyalty in the fashion sector. By building a trustworthy corporate image and encouraging positive WOM, fashion brands can effectively influence consumer purchasing decisions. This study highlights the competitive advantage of implementing ESG practices, particularly in appealing to Generation Z consumers who value sustainability and ethical business practices.

<p>Anxiety, but not depression scores, were significantly related to neural stress responses in a striato-limbic cluster. Moreover, relative to women, men showed stronger associations between anxiety scores and activity in striatal and temporal clusters. Baseline neural stress responses could not predict the anxiety trajectory during a particular stress phase.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Anxiety and depression disorders show high prevalence rates, and stress is a significant risk factor for both. However, studies investigating the interplay between anxiety, depression, and stress regulation in the brain are scarce. The present manuscript included 124 law students from the LawSTRESS project. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and psychosocial stress was induced with the imaging stress paradigm Scan<i>STRESS</i>. Anxiety, but not depression scores, were significantly related to neural stress responses in a striato-limbic cluster. Moreover, relative to women, men showed stronger associations between anxiety scores and activation in striatal and temporal clusters. A bifactor model of the HADS suggested a general factor characterized by tension, nervousness, and cheerlessness, which was associated with activation changes in a similar but more circumscribed cluster than anxiety. In the LawSTRESS project, the HADS was assessed at five sampling points (1 year, 3 months, 1 week prior exam, 1 week, and 1 month thereafter), and thus an exploratory trajectory analysis could be performed. It confirmed the relationship between anxiety scores and striatal stress responses at baseline but revealed no predictive value of the neural measure across the sampling points. Our results suggest that—in healthy young participants—neural acute psychosocial stress responses in striato-limbic structures are associated with anxiety, supporting the assumption that these regions are related to individual differences in vulnerability to stress-related disorders. A correlation with depression scores could not be found, and possible explanations are discussed.</p>

The rapid advance of large-scale atlas-level single cell RNA sequences and single-cell chromatin accessibility data provide extraordinary avenues to broad and deep insight into complex biological mechanism. Leveraging the datasets and transfering labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq will empower the exploration of single-cell omics data. However, the current label transfer methods have limited performance, largely due to the lower capable of preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets. Here, we present a robust deep transfer model based graph convolutional network, scTGCN, which achieves versatile performance in preserving biological variation, while achieving integration hundreds of thousands cells in minutes with low memory consumption. We show that scTGCN is powerful to the integration of mouse atlas data and multimodal data generated from APSA-seq and CITE-seq. Thus, scTGCN shows high label transfer accuracy and effectively knowledge transfer across different modalities.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002964">Spontaneous slow cortical potentials and brain oscillations independently influence conscious visual perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lua Koenig, Biyu J. He</p>

Perceptual awareness results from an intricate interaction between external sensory input and the brain’s spontaneous activity. Pre-stimulus ongoing activity influencing conscious perception includes both brain oscillations in the alpha (7 to 14 Hz) and beta (14 to 30 Hz) frequency ranges and aperiodic activity in the slow cortical potential (SCP, <5 Hz) range. However, whether brain oscillations and SCPs independently influence conscious perception or do so through shared mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we addressed this question in 2 independent magnetoencephalography (MEG) data sets involving near-threshold visual perception tasks in humans using low-level (Gabor patches) and high-level (objects, faces, houses, animals) stimuli, respectively. We found that oscillatory power and large-scale SCP activity influence conscious perception through independent mechanisms that do not have shared variance. In addition, through mediation analysis, we show that pre-stimulus oscillatory power and SCP activity have different relations to pupil size—an index of arousal—in their influences on conscious perception. Together, these findings suggest that oscillatory power and SCPs independently contribute to perceptual awareness, with distinct relations to pupil-linked arousal.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-96/v1?src=rss">A discrete choice experiment to elicit preferences for a chronic disease screening programme in Queensland, Australia: designing the choice sets for the final survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Chronic diseases are a significant health concern in Australia. Understanding community preferences for health screening services is vital for enhancing service delivery. We conducted a study to determine community preferences for health screening services for chronic diseases in Australia using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). This paper aims to present the development of the final DCE design using priors estimated from a survey. Methods A DCE was conducted in Australia. An online survey was administered to a general Australian population over 18. The final attribute list of five attributes with three levels each was designed. A D-efficient design with 30 pair-wise choice tasks was developed using a fractional factorial design. A pre-test was conducted to assess comprehension and understanding of the online DCE survey. The pilot survey aimed to compute priors (i.e. coefficients) associated with attributes. A multinomial logit model was used to analyse the pilot DCE data. Results The survey included 30 choice tasks in three blocks, with 119 participants responding. The best DCE design was selected based on D-error, with a lower D-error indicating the most efficient design. The pilot survey results indicated a strong preference for highly accurate screening tests, with coefficients for 85% and 95% accuracy being positive. Coefficients estimated from the pilot survey were used as priors to design the DCE choice tasks for the main survey. The final DCE design showed a notable improvement in the attribute level overlap compared to the design used for the pilot survey. Conclusions A rigorous approach was taken to develop a DCE survey that could effectively determine the preferences of the community for health screening services. The resulting DCE design consisted of 30 choice tasks presented in pairs and was deemed efficient enough to gather comprehensive information in the final survey.

                Background This study investigates the impact of the 2008 constitutional change on Ecuadorians´ life satisfaction (developing country), based on the Sumak-Kawsay or “The good way of living” philosophy, with a particular focus on caring of people and mingas (community participation). Methods Through a repeated cross-sectional analysis of national survey data, this study compares the periods before (2007) and after (2014) the implementation of the 2008 constitution to examine how caring behaviors and mingas (community work) influence life satisfaction, using an ordinal logistic regression model to assess the role of this reform in shaping these effects. Results The findings reveal significant improvements in life satisfaction following the 2008’ reform, especially in the Eastern region, where community activities are prevalent, and poverty is most concentrated. These activities, including mingas, showed a positive association with an increase in life satisfaction, underscoring the role of public policies in improving public well-being. Conclusion This approach offers innovative empirical evidence on how social public policies that promote prosocial behaviors, such as solidarity and community participation, can create an environment encouraging to greater life satisfaction, particularly in less developed regions. It also underscores how social investment aimed at improving wealth distribution can positively influence collaborative behaviors.

                Somatostatin-expressing (SST) neurons are a major class of electrophysiologically and morphologically distinct inhibitory cells in the mammalian neocortex. Transcriptomic data suggest that this class can be divided into multiple subtypes that are correlated with morpho-electric properties. At the same time, availability of transgenic tools to identify and record from SST neurons in awake, behaving mice has stimulated insights about their response properties and computational function. Neocortical SST neurons are regulated by sleep and arousal, attention, and novelty detection, and show marked response plasticity during learning. Recent studies suggest that subtype-specific analysis of SST neurons may be critical for understanding their complex roles in cortical function. In this review, we discuss and synthesize recent advances in understanding the diversity, circuit integration, and functional properties of this important group of GABAergic neurons.

                Injection of YopJ by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis triggers RIPK1-dependent caspase-8 and GSDMD activation in murine macrophages; however, how macrophages defend against Yersinia when caspase-8 or YopJ activity is absent remains unclear. Here, Chan et al. demonstrate that Yersinia invades macrophage cytosol when caspase-8 is inactive and activates the non-canonical inflammasome.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101943">Outer hair cells stir cochlear fluids</a></h4>

              
                We hypothesized that active outer hair cells drive cochlear fluid circulation. The hypothesis was tested by delivering the neurotoxin, kainic acid, to the intact round window of young gerbil cochleae while monitoring auditory responses in the cochlear nucleus. Sounds presented at a modest level significantly expedited kainic acid delivery. When outer-hair-cell motility was suppressed by salicylate, the facilitation effect was compromised. A low-frequency tone was more effective than broadband noise, especially for drug delivery to apical locations. Computational model simulations provided the physical basis for our observation, which incorporated solute diffusion, fluid advection, fluid–structure interaction, and outer-hair-cell motility. Active outer hair cells deformed the organ of Corti like a peristaltic tube to generate apically streaming flows along the tunnel of Corti and basally streaming flows along the scala tympani. Our measurements and simulations coherently suggest that active outer hair cells in the tail region of cochlear traveling waves drive cochlear fluid circulation.

                Circulating sexual stages of <i>Plasmodium falciparum (Pf</i>) can be transmitted from humans to mosquitoes, thereby furthering the spread of malaria in the population. It is well established that antibodies can efficiently block parasite transmission. In search for naturally acquired antibodies targets on sexual stages, we established an efficient method for target-agnostic single B cell activation followed by high-throughput selection of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) reactive to sexual stages of <i>Pf</i> in the form of gametes and gametocyte extracts. We isolated mAbs reactive against a range of <i>Pf</i> proteins including well-established targets Pfs48/45 and Pfs230. One mAb, B1E11K, was cross-reactive to various proteins containing glutamate-rich repetitive elements expressed at different stages of the parasite life cycle. A crystal structure of two B1E11K Fab domains in complex with its main antigen, RESA, expressed on asexual blood stages, showed binding of B1E11K to a repeating epitope motif in a head-to-head conformation engaging in affinity-matured homotypic interactions. Thus, this mode of recognition of <i>Pf</i> proteins, previously described only for Pf circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP), extends to other repeats expressed across various stages. The findings augment our understanding of immune-pathogen interactions to repeating elements of the <i>Plasmodium</i> parasite proteome and underscore the potential of the novel mAb identification method used to provide new insights into the natural humoral immune response against <i>Pf</i>.

                Viral adhesion to host cells is a critical step in infection for many viruses, including monkeypox virus (MPXV). In MPXV, the H3 protein mediates viral adhesion through its interaction with heparan sulfate (HS), yet the structural details of this interaction have remained elusive. Using AI-based structural prediction tools and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified a novel, positively charged α-helical domain in H3 that is essential for HS binding. This conserved domain, found across <i>orthopoxviruses</i>, was experimentally validated and shown to be critical for viral adhesion, making it an ideal target for antiviral drug development. Targeting this domain, we designed a protein inhibitor, which disrupted the H3-HS interaction, inhibited viral infection in vitro and viral replication in vivo, offering a promising antiviral candidate. Our findings reveal a novel therapeutic target of MPXV, demonstrating the potential of combination of AI-driven methods and MD simulations to accelerate antiviral drug discovery.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100922">Early and delayed STAT1-dependent responses drive local trained immunity of macrophages in the spleen</a></h4>

              
                Trained immunity (TI) is the process wherein innate immune cells gain functional memory upon exposure to specific ligands or pathogens, leading to augmented inflammatory responses and pathogen clearance upon secondary exposure. While the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and reprogramming of bone marrow (BM) progenitors are well-established mechanisms underpinning durable TI protection, remodeling of the cellular architecture within the tissue during TI remains underexplored. Here, we study the effects of peritoneal Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) administration to find TI-mediated protection in the spleen against a subsequent heterologous infection by the Gram-negative pathogen <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (<i>S</i>.Tm). Utilizing single cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry, we discerned STAT1-regulated genes in TI-associated resident and recruited splenic myeloid populations. The temporal dynamics of TI were further elucidated, revealing both early and delayed myeloid subsets with time-dependent, cell-type-specific STAT1 signatures. Using lineage tracing, we find that tissue-resident red pulp macrophages (RPM), initially depleted by BCG exposure, are restored from both tissue-trained, self-renewing macrophages and from bone marrow-derived progenitors, fostering long lasting local defense. Early inhibition of STAT1 activation, using specific JAK-STAT inhibitors, reduces both RPM loss and recruitment of trained monocytes. Our study suggests a temporal window soon after BCG vaccination, in which STAT1-dependent activation of long-lived resident cells in the tissue mediates localized protection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100060">Crispant analysis in zebrafish as a tool for rapid functional screening of disease-causing genes for bone fragility</a></h4>

              
                Heritable fragile bone disorders (FBDs), ranging from multifactorial to rare monogenic conditions, are characterized by an elevated fracture risk. Validating causative genes and understanding their mechanisms remain challenging. We assessed a semi-high throughput zebrafish screening platform for rapid in vivo functional testing of candidate FBD genes. Six genes linked to severe recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and four associated with bone mineral density (BMD) from genome-wide association studies were analyzed. Using CRISPR/Cas9-based crispant screening in F0 mosaic founder zebrafish, Next-generation sequencing confirmed high indel efficiency (mean 88%), mimicking stable knock-out models. Skeletal phenotyping at 7, 14, and 90 days post-fertilization (dpf) using microscopy, Alizarin Red S staining, and microCT was performed. Larval crispants showed variable osteoblast and mineralization phenotypes, while adult crispants displayed consistent skeletal defects, including malformed neural and haemal arches, vertebral fractures and fusions, and altered bone volume and density. In addition, aldh7a1 and mbtps2 crispants experienced increased mortality due to severe skeletal deformities. RT-qPCR revealed differential expression of osteogenic markers bglap and col1a1a, highlighting their biomarker potential. Our results establish zebrafish crispant screening as a robust tool for FBD gene validation, combining skeletal and molecular analyses across developmental stages to uncover novel insights into gene functions in bone biology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101701">Exploration of the metabolomic mechanisms of postmenopausal hypertension induced by low estrogen state</a></h4>

              
                Estrogen significantly impacts women’s health, and postmenopausal hypertension is a common issue characterized by blood pressure fluctuations. Current control strategies for this condition are limited in efficacy, necessitating further research into the underlying mechanisms. Although metabolomics has been applied to study various diseases, its use in understanding postmenopausal hypertension is scarce. Therefore, an ovariectomized rat model was used to simulate postmenopausal conditions. Estrogen levels, blood pressure, and aortic tissue metabolomics were analyzed. Animal models were divided into Sham, OVX, and OVX +E groups. Serum estrogen levels, blood pressure measurements, and aortic tissue metabolomics analyses were performed using radioimmunoassay, UHPLC-Q-TOF, and bioinformatics techniques. Based on the above research content, we successfully established a correlation between low estrogen levels and postmenopausal hypertension in rats. Notable differences in blood pressure parameters and aortic tissue metabolites were observed across the experimental groups. Specifically, metabolites that were differentially expressed, particularly L-alpha-aminobutyric acid (L-AABA), showed potential as a biomarker for postmenopausal hypertension, potentially exerting a protective function through macrophage activation and vascular remodeling. Enrichment analysis revealed alterations in sugar metabolism pathways, such as the Warburg effect and glycolysis, indicating their involvement in postmenopausal hypertension. Overall, this current research provides insights into the metabolic changes associated with postmenopausal hypertension, highlighting the role of L-AABA and sugar metabolism reprogramming in aortic tissue. The findings suggest a potential link between low estrogen levels, macrophage function, and vascular remodeling in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal hypertension. Further investigations are needed to validate these findings and explore their clinical implications for postmenopausal women.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99696">Encoding of cerebellar dentate neuron activity during visual attention in rhesus macaques</a></h4>

              
                The role of cerebellum in controlling eye movements is well established, but its contribution to more complex forms of visual behavior has remained elusive. To study cerebellar activity during visual attention we recorded extracellular activity of dentate nucleus (DN) neurons in two non-human primates (NHPs). NHPs were trained to read the direction indicated by a peripheral visual stimulus while maintaining fixation at the center, and report the direction of the cue by performing a saccadic eye movement into the same direction following a delay. We found that single-unit DN neurons modulated spiking activity over the entire time course of the task, and that their activity often bridged temporally separated intra-trial events, yet in a heterogeneous manner. To better understand the heterogeneous relationship between task structure, behavioral performance, and neural dynamics, we constructed a behavioral, an encoding, and a decoding model. Both NHPs showed different behavioral strategies, which influenced the performance. Activity of the DN neurons reflected the unique strategies, with the direction of the visual stimulus frequently being encoded long before an upcoming saccade. Moreover, the latency of the ramping activity of DN neurons following presentation of the visual stimulus was shorter in the better performing NHP. Labeling with the retrograde tracer Cholera Toxin B in the recording location in the DN indicated that these neurons predominantly receive inputs from Purkinje cells in the D1 and D2 zones of the lateral cerebellum as well as neurons of the principal olive and medial pons, all regions known to connect with neurons in the prefrontal cortex contributing to planning of saccades. Together, our results highlight that DN neurons can dynamically modulate their activity during a visual attention task, comprising not only sensorimotor but also cognitive attentional components.

">Microglia regulate nucleus accumbens synaptic development and circuit function underlying threat avoidance behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS and modulate synaptic connectivity and function in the developing brain1-3. While microglia have well-established roles in synapse pruning4,5, only a few studies have identified roles for microglia in synapse formation6-8. These studies focused on the cortex and primary sensory circuits during restricted developmental time periods, leaving substantial gaps in our understanding of the early developmental functions of microglia. Here we investigated how the absence of microglia impacts synaptic development in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region critical for emotional regulation and motivated behaviors and where dysfunction is implicated in psychiatric disorders that arise early in life9-11. Using a genetically modified mouse that lacks microglia (Csf1r{Delta}FIRE/{Delta}FIRE)12, we found blunted excitatory synapse formation in the NAc. This effect was most prominent during the second and third postnatal weeks, when we previously found microglia to be overproduced13, and was accompanied by an increase in presynaptic release probability and alterations in postsynaptic kinetics. Tissue-level NAc proteomics confirmed that microglial absence impacted numerous proteins involved in synapse structure, trans-synaptic signaling, and pre-synaptic function. However, microglial absence did not perturb levels of astrocyte-derived cues and adhesive proteins that promote synaptogenesis, suggesting that reduced synapse number may be caused by absence of a microglial-derived synaptogenic cue. Although observed electrophysiological synaptic changes were largely normalized by adulthood, we identified lasting effects of microglial absence on threat avoidance behavior, and these behavioral effects were directly associated with alterations of NAc neuronal activity. Together, these results indicate a critical role for microglia in regulating the synaptic landscape of the developing NAc and in establishing functional circuits underlying adult behavioral repertoires.

">The medial prefrontal cortex encodes procedural rules as sequential neuronal activity dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in procedural rule learning; however, the specific neuronal mechanism through which it represents rules is unknown. We hypothesized that sequential neuronal activities in the prefrontal cortex encode these rules. To investigate this, we recorded neuronal activities in the medial prefrontal cortex of mice during rule learning using Ca2+ imaging. We utilized a method based on convolutional negative matrix factorization, iSeq, to automatically detect temporal neuronal sequences in the recorded data. As rule learning advanced, these neuronal sequences began to encode critical information for rule execution. In mice that had mastered the rule, the dynamics of neuronal sequences could predict success and failure of reward acquisition. Furthermore, the composition of cell populations within the neuronal sequences was rearranged throughout the learning process. These findings suggest that as animals learn a rule, the medial prefrontal cortex continually updates its neuronal sequences to assign significance to behavioral actions crucial for reward acquisition.

">Category-biased patches encircle core domain-general regions in the human lateral prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The fine-grained functional organization of the human lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) remains poorly understood. Previous fMRI studies delineated focal domain-general, or multiple-demand (MD), PFC areas that co-activate during diverse cognitively demanding tasks. While there is some evidence for category-selective (face and scene) patches, in human and non-human primate PFC, these have not been systematically assessed. Recent precision fMRI studies have also revealed sensory-biased PFC patches adjacent to MD regions. To investigate if this topographic arrangement extends to other domains, we analysed two independent fMRI datasets (n=449 and n=37) utilizing the high-resolution multimodal MRI approaches of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Both datasets included cognitive control tasks and stimuli spanning different categories: faces, places, tools and body parts. Contrasting each stimulus category against the remaining ones revealed focal interdigitated patches of activity located adjacent to core MD regions. The results were robust, replicating across different executive tasks, experimental designs (block and event-related) and at the single subject level. Our results paint a refined view of the fine-grained functional organization of the PFC, revealing a recurring motif of interdigitated domain-specific and domain-general circuits. This organization offers new constraints for models of cognitive control, cortical specialization and development.

">Technical and biological sources of noise confound multiplexed enhancer AAV screening</a></h4>

              
                Cis-acting regulatory enhancer elements are valuable tools for gaining cell type-specific genetic access. Leveraging large chromatin accessibility atlases, putative enhancer sequences can be identified and deployed in adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery platforms. However, a significant bottleneck in enhancer AAV discovery is charting their detailed expression patterns in vivo, a process that currently requires gold-standard one-by-one testing. Here we present a barcoded multiplex strategy for screening enhancer AAVs at cell type resolution using single cell RNA sequencing and taxonomy mapping. We executed a proof-of-concept study using a small pool of validated enhancer AAVs expressing in a variety of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types across the mouse brain. Unexpectedly, we encountered substantial technical and biological noise including chimeric packaging products, necessitating development of novel techniques to accurately deconvolve enhancer expression patterns. These results underscore the need for improved methods to mitigate noise and highlight the complexity of enhancer AAV biology in vivo.

                Today, 40 Hz flickering full-field visual stimulation is used to entrain neuronal oscillations for a variety of therapeutic purposes. We here propose spatially organized sequential visual flickering stimulation as a newer tool to entrain the visual system. We show that sequential visual flickering can evoke increased power in high frequencies (100 to 190 Hz) in the visual cortex of mice. Consequently, sequential sensory stimulation should be regarded as a putative new way leading to power increases in high frequency domains.

">Preclinical Evaluation of P4B-2412 as Phosphodiesterase 4B Radioligand for Positron Emission Tomography Imaging</a></h4>

              
                Phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) plays a critical role in cAMP hydrolysis and is highly expressed in brain regions associated with neuroinflammation and central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Selective PDE4B radioligands hold significant potential for elucidating disease mechanisms, such as those in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, and enabling target occupancy measurements. In this study, we developed [18F]P4B-2412, a novel PDE4B-selective radioligand, and evaluated its utility for positron emission tomography imaging (PET). [18F]P4B-2412 was synthesized in high radiochemical yield (27.2%), excellent radiochemical purity (99%), and favorable molar activity (66.2 +/- 2.5 GBq/mol. In vitro autoradiography and dynamic PET imaging demonstrated high specificity for PDE4B in rodent brain regions, with blocking studies confirming negligible interaction with PDE4D. [18F]P4B-2412 also exhibited robust in vitro and in vivo metabolic stability. These results establish [18F]P4B-2412 as a promising PET imaging agent for visualizing PDE4B activity, offering a valuable tool for investigating neuroinflammation and advancing CNS drug development.

">Thalamic involvement defines distinct slow-wave subtypes in NREM sleep</a></h4>

              
                Slow waves (0.5-4 Hz) are a key feature of non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, traditionally believed to arise from neocortical circuits. However, growing evidence suggests that subcortical structures, particularly the thalamus, may play a crucial role in initiating and synchronizing slow waves. We tested the hypothesis that slow waves may arise from distinct cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical mechanisms using simultaneous EEG-fMRI in healthy adults. Spatial mapping based on thalamic fMRI responses revealed two slow-wave associated clusters. Cluster-1 C1, characterized by an early thalamic fMRI-signal increase, corresponded to large, efficiently synchronized waves associated with sleep spindles and with markers of higher arousal and autonomic activation. Cluster-2 C2, marked by an initial negative fMRI response, corresponded to smaller slow waves potentially resulting from cortico-cortical synchronization. These waves tended to more often occur during low-fragility phases of NREM sleep. These findings highlight distinct slow-wave subtypes with different thalamic involvement and, potentially, synchronization mechanisms.

">Individualized Alpha-tACS for Modulating Pain Perception and Neural Oscillations: A Sham-Controlled Study in Healthy Participants</a></h4>

              
                Pain encompasses sensory, affective, and cognitive dimensions, with neural oscillations increasingly recognized as key mechanisms in their integration. However, the underlying processes remain inadequately understood. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) offers a promising tool for modulating these oscillations, yet the widespread reliance on 'one-size-fits-all' tACS protocols with fixed frequencies has led to limited and contradictory findings on its efficacy in pain treatment. In this study, we employed individualized tACS at individual peak alpha frequency (IAF) over the primary motor cortex (M1) contralateral to the dominant arm of 38 healthy participants, in a within-subject, sham-controlled design, to investigate its effects on pain perception and neural oscillations. Sustained and periodic 0.2 Hz thermonociceptive stimuli were applied to the dominant forearm before and after tACS. We measured participants pain perception and heat pain thresholds (HPT) before and after tACS stimulation. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) measurements were used to measure neural activity during thermonociceptive stimuli. To calculate IAF, we used a discriminative approach based on independent component analysis (ICA) to separate sensorimotor related IAF (SM-IAF). The results revealed an overall increase in pain perception and a decrease in HPT in both sham and active conditions, with no significant interactions between conditions. However, a trend toward reduced sensitization post-tACS was observed. Exploratory analyses indicated a significant tACS effect on HPT in women. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between SM-IAF and HPT. These findings provide a novel perspective on advancing individualized neuromodulation approaches for pain and neurobiological disorders.

">Calcineurin-mediated regulation of GAP-43 is essential for neurite and synapse formation and protects against α-synuclein-induced degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Rise in calcium (Ca2+) and hyperactivation of Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin are two key determinants of -synuclein (-syn) pathobiology implicated in synucleinopathies such as Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Parkinson's Disease. Calcineurin activity can be inhibited with FK506, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compound. Our previous work demonstrated a protective effect of sub-saturating doses of FK506 against -syn pathology in a rat model of -syn neurodegeneration. This neuroprotection was associated with the phosphorylation of GAP-43. In this study, we present evidence that phosphorylation of GAP-43 regulated by calcineurin is a critical determinant for neurite branching and synapse formation. Phosphorylation of GAP-43 promotes neurite branching and synapse formation whereas dephosphorylation prevents it. Therefore, our findings provide a novel way in which GAP-43 activity can be regulated by calcineurin and provide the mechanistic basis for neuroprotection for FK506 effects in neurons experiencing -syn proteotoxic stress.

">Validation of Structure Tensor Analysis for Orientation Estimation in Brain Tissue Microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Accurate localization of white matter pathways using diffusion MRI is critical to investigating brain connectivity, but the accuracy of current methods is not thoroughly understood. A fruitful approach to validating accuracy is to consider microscopy data that have been co-registered with MRI of post mortem samples. In this setting, structure tensor analysis is a standard approach to computing local orientations for validation. However, structure tensor analysis itself has not been well-validated and is subject to uncertainty in its angular resolution, and selectivity to specific spatial scales. In this work, we conducted a simulation study to investigate the accuracy of using structure tensors to estimate the orientations of fibers arranged in configurations with and without crossings. We examined a range of simulated conditions, with a focus on investigating the method's behavior on images with anisotropic resolution, which is particularly common in microscopy data acquisition. We also analyzed 2D and 3D optical microscopy data. Our results show that parameter choice in structure tensor analysis has relatively little effect on accuracy for estimating single orientations, although accuracy decreases with anisotropy. On the other hand, when estimating the orientations of crossing fibers, the choice of parameters becomes critical, and poor choices result in orientation estimates that are essentially random. This work provides a set of recommendations for researchers seeking to apply structure tensor analysis effectively in the study of axonal orientations in brain imaging data and quantifies the method's limitations, particularly in the case of anisotropic data.

">Backward alpha oscillations shape perceptual bias under probabilistic cues</a></h4>

              
                Predictive coding theory suggests that prior knowledge is crucial for optimizing human decision-making, with recent studies emphasizing the role of alpha-band oscillations in this process. Here, we employed a traveling waves approach to investigate how alpha oscillations integrate prior expectations during a perceptual decision-making task. Our findings demonstrated that expectation-based knowledge triggers the propagation of alpha traveling waves from frontal to occipital areas, with this increase associated with enhanced modulation of brain regions involved in stimulus processing and directly linked to prior-driven bias at the behavioral level. Moreover, participants who relied more on prior expectations exhibited stronger top-down signaling, whereas those who focused on sensory input showed a contrasting forward signaling pattern. These results highlight the role of alpha-band traveling waves in predictive mechanisms, suggesting that rhythmic interactions across brain regions facilitate this process and contribute to inter-individual differences in its implementation.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive impairments in episodic and spatial memory, as well as circuit and network-level dysfunction. While functional impairments in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus (HPC) have been observed in patients and rodent models of AD, it remains unclear how communication between these regions breaks down in disease, and what specific physiological changes are associated with the onset of memory impairment. We used silicon probes to simultaneously record neural activity in MEC and hippocampus before or after the onset of spatial memory impairment in the 3xTg mouse model of AD pathology. We found that reduced hippocampal theta power, reduced MEC-CA1 theta coherence, and altered phase locking of MEC and hippocampal neurons all coincided with the emergence of spatial memory impairment in 3xTg mice. Together, these findings indicate that disrupted temporal coordination of neural activity in the MEC-hippocampal system parallels the emergence of memory impairment in a model of AD pathology.

">Effects of age in the strategic control of recollected content as reflected by modulation of scene reinstatement</a></h4>

              
                A previous study employing fMRI measures of retrieval-related cortical reinstatement reported that young, but not older, adults employ retrieval gating to attenuate aspects of an episodic memory that are irrelevant to the retrieval goal. We examined whether the weak memories of the older adults in that study rendered goal-irrelevant memories insufficiently intrusive to motivate retrieval gating. Young and older participants studied words superimposed on rural or urban scenes, or on pixelated backgrounds. To strengthen memory for background information, word-image pairs were studied twice, initially centrally, and then in one of three locations. During scanning, one retrieval test probed memory for the test words studied backgrounds and another test assessed memory for their location. Background memory performance was markedly higher than in the prior study. Retrieval gating was examined in two scene-selective regions of interest, the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and the medial place area (MPA). In the background task, robust retrieval-related scene reinstatement effects were identified in both age groups. These effects were attenuated (gated) in the location task in the young age group only, replicating the prior finding. The results did not differ when the two groups were sub-sampled to match strength of scene reinstatement when scene information was goal relevant. The findings indicate that older adults failure to gate goal-irrelevant scene information does not reflect age differences in memory strength and may instead reflect an age-related decline in top-down inhibitory control.

">Uncertainty during visual search: Insights from a computational model and behavioral experiment in natural stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Visual search, driven by bottom-up and top-down processes, offers a unique framework for investigating decision-making. This study examines the awareness of the individuals to their own visual search by combining computational modeling with behavioral experiments. Fifty-seven participants performed a classical visual search task in which the goal was to find an object in a natural scene. Crucially, in some trials, the search was interrupted by clearing the screen before the gaze reached the target object. Participants had to report their best guess of the location of the target and the uncertainty on their response. We show that a modified version of the Entropy-Limit Minimization (ELM) model captures scanpaths and perceived target locations, while also revealing that uncertainty is influenced by scanpath length, the distance between the perceived and true target location, and the entropy of decision maps. These findings highlight the capacity of the model to reflect cognitive processes underlying response selection and uncertainty judgment.

">VeCell: A Fiji Plugin to unveil the spatio-temporal dynamics of macroglial cell development and proximity to blood vessels</a></h4>

              
                Cortical development results from the proliferation, differentiation, migration and maturation of many cell types. While neuronal development has been extensively studied, the mechanisms regulating the development and maturation of macroglial cells (oligodendrocytes and astrocytes) are still largely to be determined. Here we present VeCell, a Fiji plugin designed to analyse the development of macroglial cells. Using immunolabeling for two transcription factors, Sox9 (specific to macroglial progenitors and astrocytes) and Sox10 (specific to oligodendrocyte lineage), we determined their density, distribution within and across cortical layers and distance to the blood vessels from postnatal day (P) 5 and P60 in the somatosensory cortex. We found that Sox9+ cells are evenly distributed in the cortex with regular intercellular distances and comparable densities between the upper and lower parts of the cortex. In contrast, Sox10+ cells are predominantly concentrated in the lower cortical layers, and exhibited a more random distribution with variable distances between cells. Finally, while confirming the increased density and branching of the vascular network after P5, we also showed that macroglial cells are closer to blood vessels from P15 onward. In summary, VeCell provides a valuable tool for analyzing the development and spatial organization of macroglial cells. Our findings in the cortex reveal distinct patterns of distribution and proximity to the vasculature for macroglial cells during postnatal development. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of glial maturation and highlight the dynamic interplay between macroglial cells and the vascular network, offering new avenues for future research into brain development and function.

">Plectin Regulates Focal Adhesion Dynamics and Cytoskeletal Organization in Mouse Astrocytes: Implications for Reactive Astrogliosis</a></h4>

              
                Reactive astrogliosis, a hallmark of central nervous system pathologies, involves cellular responses, including morphological remodelling and upregulation of intermediate filaments such as vimentin. These changes are driven by cytoskeletal dynamics and are mediated by focal adhesions (FAs). Our study identifies plectin, a versatile cytoskeletal linker protein, as a critical modulator of FA-associated processes in mouse astrocytes. We demonstrate that plectin localizes to astrocyte FAs, where it regulates their number, maturation, turnover, and the mobility of FA components. Plectin also polarizes within FAs, depending on their maturation state, and controls the recruitment of key cytoskeletal elements particularly vimentin. In plectin-deficient astrocytes, the vimentin network exhibits impaired connectivity, accompanied by altered viscoelastic properties of the cells. In a model of reactive astrocytes FA number and size were elevated along with the expression of plectin, highlighting involvement of plectin in pathological conditions.

">Persistent large-scale changes in alternative splicing in prefrontal cortical neuron types following psychedelic exposure</a></h4>

              
                Psychedelics engage the serotonergic system as potent neuromodulators, increasing neuroplasticity in humans and rodents. Persistent changes in cognitive flexibility, emotional regulation, and social cognition are thought to underlie the therapeutic effects of psychedelics. However, the underlying molecular and cellular basis of psychedelic-induced plasticity remains unclear. Here, we identify persistent, cell type-specific alternative splicing changes in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) induced by a single dose of psychedelics. Combining deep RiboTag sequencing and bioinformatics, we find that a single dose of psychedelics modestly alters gene expression while dramatically shifting patterns of alternative splicing lasting at least a month. We connect our functional enrichment and alternative splicing analysis with changes in the extracellular matrix, synaptic physiology, and intrinsic physiology in parvalbumin interneurons days to a week after psychedelic treatment. Our dataset is an essential resource for understanding the persistent, cell type-specific effects of psychedelics on cortical cell types and functions.

">In vivo Morphological Dynamics of Single Laser-Axotomized Corneal Nerve Fibers in Sarm1-Null Adult Mice</a></h4>

              
                Axonal regeneration represents a pivotal aspect of the adult peripheral nervous system (PNS). When an injury occurs, peripheral axons are able to regenerate and reestablish connections with their original targets. Although several precision techniques for severing axons in various non-mammalian model organisms have allowed to study the dynamics of regeneration after injury, similar axonal injury models have yet to be fully developed in mammals. In this study, we introduced a novel experimental method for laser-induced axotomy of single corneal sensory subbasal nerve fibers. This method enables the in vivo monitoring and quantification of axonal degeneration and regeneration morphological dynamics in adult mice. Results revealed that the degeneration of the distal stump of the subbasal fiber was delayed in mice lacking the protein SARM1, which promotes degenerative process after injury. Meanwhile, the proximal stump maintained the regenerative dynamics of the subbasal fiber, but regeneration of its nerve terminals was impaired. The present study introduces a valuable model for the in vivo study of the morphological plasticity dynamics of peripheral axons after injury in genetically tractable adult mammals.

">Human and Rodent Seizures Demonstrate a Dynamic Interplay with Spreading Depolarizations</a></h4>

              
                Seizure termination has been linked to spreading depolarizations (SDs) in experimental epilepsy models, and SDs have recently been suggested to protect against seizures. The precise mechanism, however, remains unclear. Additionally, the co-occurrence of SDs with human seizures remains debated. In this study, we found that SDs are a prominent feature following ictal events in both human clinical recordings (n=20 seizures from 7 epilepsy patients) using direct-current amplifiers and in the 0 Mg2+ model of ictogenesis from rodent brain slices (n=17). Approximately one-third of rodent seizure-like events (SLEs) were associated with SDs, while all human seizures analyzed had associated infraslow shifts, a hallmark of SDs. SDs were more prominent in the lateral frontal, medial frontal, and lateral temporal lobes, as well as the insular cortex in human patients, but were observed in all recorded brain regions. In rodents, SDs clustered toward the end of ictal events, resulting in significantly shorter SLEs (SLE without SD: 32.60 {+/-} 5.31 s; SLE with SD: 16.03 {+/-} 4.45 s) and delayed onset of subsequent SLEs. These SDs also caused significant AC band silencing compared to SLEs without SDs. Interestingly, SLEs with SDs displayed significantly more low gamma activity during ictal events. Using ion-selective microelectrodes, we found no significant correlation between extracellular [K+] levels and SLEs ending in SDs, questioning the role of [K+]o in SD induction during seizures. We observed more heterogeneity in human seizures than in rodent SLEs, with some human seizures showing SD-associated termination and others demonstrating SDs in the middle of ictal events; such intra-seizure SDs were never observed in our rodent model. The human data, collected from patients with intractable epilepsy, demonstrate clear SD propagation during seizures and show that SDs appear and propagate, in multiple brain regions simultaneously with ictal events. Collectively, these results indicate that SDs are a hallmark of ictal activity and may contribute to seizure termination in both experimental and clinical settings. Furthermore, these findings provide unique insight into the neuronal dynamics that promote SD induction by showing that increased low gamma activity during SLEs is more predictive of SD induction than extracellular [K+] levels. We also add further support for the hypothesis that SDs are both anti-seizure and anti-ictogenic as they not only limit and delay subsequent ictal activity but also reduce the duration of SLEs. Taken together, these findings provide rationale for further exploration of SDs as a means to prematurely terminate life-threatening seizures.

">The quantitative spatiotemporal relationship of whole brain activity of human brains revealed by fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Human brain consists of many functional systems from the essential sensory, motor, attention and memory systems to higher order cognitive functions such as reasoning and language. Performing even a simple task may evoke multiple systems and cognitive functions, resulting in a whole brain activity across the entire brain. Despite the importance of studying task-evoked brain activated networks, investigating this whole brain activity may be crucial for understanding the neural bases of individual behavioral and clinical traits. BOLD-fMRI measures the four-dimensional (3 spatial and 1 temporal) neural activity across the entire brain at large-scale systems level. All local activities across the entire brain constitute the whole brain activity and each local activity is a part of that whole brain activity. Unlike a local activity that is characterized by its temporal neural activity, the whole brain activity is characterized by its spatial variation across the entire brain. We present a novel data-driven method to analyze the whole brain activity when performing tasks. The method enabled us to analyze the whole brain activity for each task trial and each individual subject with no requirement of a priori knowledge of task-evoked BOLD response. Our study revealed a quantitative spatiotemporal relationship of the whole brain activity with the local activities. The whole brain activity demonstrated a remarkable dynamic activity that varied from trial to trial when performing the same task repeatedly, showing the importance of analyzing the whole brain activity for investigating the neural bases of personal traits.

">A preparatory cranial potential for saccadic eye movements in macaque monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Response preparation is accomplished by gradual accumulation in neural activity until a threshold is reached. In humans, such a preparatory signal, referred to as the lateralized readiness potential, can be observed in the EEG over sensorimotor cortical areas before execution of a voluntary movement. Although well-described for manual movements, less is known about preparatory EEG potentials for saccadic eye movements in humans and nonhuman primates. Hence, we describe a lateralized readiness potential over the frontolateral cortex in macaque monkeys. Homologous to humans, we observed lateralized electrical potentials ramping before the execution of both rewarded and non-rewarded contralateral saccades. This potential parallels the neural spiking of saccadic movement neurons in the frontal eye field, suggesting that it may offer a non-invasive correlate of intracortical spiking activity. However, unlike neural spiking in the frontal eye field, polarization in frontolateral channels did not distinguish between saccade generation and inhibition. These findings provide new insights into non-invasive electrophysiological signatures of saccadic preparation in nonhuman primates, highlighting the potential of EEG measures to bridge invasive neural recordings and non-invasive studies of eye movement control in humans.

">Isometric handgrip contraction increases tibialis anterior intrinsic motoneuron excitability in a dose-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Persistent inward currents (PICs) contribution to motoneuron firing in the lower limb typically increase after a remote handgrip contraction, believed to result from diffuse increases of serotonergic input on the spinal cord. We investigated whether handgrip contraction intensity, duration, and/or impulse would affect tibialis anterior estimates of PICs. High-density electromyograms were recorded from the tibialis anterior of 21 participants (18-40 years) during 20% dorsiflexion before and after four handgrip conditions: i) 80%15s, 80% of their maximal handgrip strength sustained for 15s; ii) 40%15s, 40% sustained for 15s; iii) 40%30s, 40% sustained for 30s; and iv) Control (no handgrip). PICs contribution to motoneuron firing was estimated with the delta frequency ({Delta}F) using the paired motor unit analysis. The brace height, normalised as a percentage of a right triangle (%rTri), was used to quantify the effects of PICs on the non-linearity of firing patterns, representing the neuromodulatory drive (regulation of neural activity via neurotransmitter actions) onto the motoneurons. {Delta}F increased by 0.30 peaks per second (pps; 95%CI 0.11-0.49, d=0.37) after 40%30s and by 0.20 pps (0.04-0.36, d=0.24) after 80%15s but remained unchanged after 40%15s and Control. Similarly, brace height increased by 2.39 %rTri (0.55-4.23, d=0.25) after 40%30s and by 2.74 %rTri (1.14-4.34, d=0.28) after 80%15s; remaining unchanged after 40%15s and Control. The increase in PICs contribution to motoneuron firing induced by a remote handgrip contraction is impulse-dependent rather than intensity or duration. The parallel increases in {Delta}F and brace height suggest augmented neuromodulatory input onto the spinal cord.

                Thrombolysis with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) remains the only pharmacological treatment for the acute phase of ischemic stroke. In this study, we hypothesize that endothelial tPA plays a key role in modulating the microglial response and maintaining blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity after stroke. Using a mouse model with conditional deletion for endothelial tPA (VeCadCre-tPAFlox) combined with a thrombotic stroke model and high-resolution imaging, we investigated the effects of endothelial tPA on vascular inflammation and microglia activation during the acute phase of stroke. Our results demonstrate that microglia-vessel contacts increase post-stroke. Notably, endothelial tPA deletion reduces vascular VCAM1 expression associated with decreased microglial activation and fewer microglia-vessel contacts. Following stroke, endothelial tPA deletion is associated with increased BBB permeability and heightened risk of haemorrhagic transformation. Collectively, these findings indicate that endothelial tPA mediates microglial recruitment to blood vessels, thereby exerting a protective effect on BBB integrity following ischemic stroke.

">Experience-dependent reorganization of inhibitory neuron synaptic connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Organisms continually tune their perceptual systems to the features they encounter in their environment. We have studied how ongoing experience reorganizes the synaptic connectivity of neurons in the olfactory (piriform) cortex of the mouse. We developed an approach to measure synaptic connectivity in vivo, training a deep convolutional network to reliably identify monosynaptic connections from the spike-time cross-correlograms of 4.4 million single-unit pairs. This revealed that excitatory piriform neurons with similar odor tuning are more likely to be connected. We asked whether experience enhances this like-to-like connectivity but found that it was unaffected by odor exposure. Experience did, however, alter the logic of interneuron connectivity. Following repeated encounters with a set of odorants, inhibitory neurons that responded differentially to these stimuli exhibited a high degree of both incoming and outgoing synaptic connections within the cortical network. This reorganization depended only on the odor tuning of the inhibitory interneuron and not on the tuning of its pre- or postsynaptic partners. A computational model of this reorganized connectivity predicts that it increases the dimensionality of the entire network's responses to familiar stimuli, thereby enhancing their discriminability. We confirmed that this network-level property is present in physiological measurements, which showed increased dimensionality and separability of the evoked responses to familiar versus novel odorants. Thus, a simple, non-Hebbian reorganization of interneuron connectivity may selectively enhance an organism's discrimination of the features of its environment.

">An integrated anatomical, functional and evolutionary view of the Drosophila olfactory system</a></h4>

              
                The Drosophila melanogaster olfactory system is one of the most intensively studied parts of the nervous system in any animal. Composed of ~60 independent olfactory neuron classes, with several associated hygrosensory and thermosensory pathways, it has been subject to diverse types of experimental analyses. However, synthesizing the available data is limited by the incompleteness and inconsistent nomenclature found in the literature. In this work, we first 'complete' the peripheral sensory map through the identification of a previously uncharacterized antennal sensory neuron population expressing Or46aB, and the definition of an exceptional 'hybrid' olfactory neuron class comprising functional Or and Ir receptors. Second, we survey developmental, anatomical, connectomic, functional and evolutionary studies to generate an integrated dataset of these sensory neuron pathways -- and associated visualizations -- creating an unprecedented comprehensive resource. Third, we illustrate the utility of the dataset to reveal relationships between different organizational properties of this sensory system, and the new questions these stimulate. These examples emphasize the power of this resource to promote further understanding of the construction, function and evolution of these neural circuits.

">Enhanced proconvulsant sensitivity, not spontaneous rapid swimming activity, is a robust correlate of scn1lab loss-of-function in stable mutant and F0 crispant hypopigmented zebrafish expressing GCaMP6s</a></h4>

              
                Zebrafish models of genetic epilepsy benefit from the ability to assess disease-relevant knock-out alleles with numerous tools, including genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) and hypopigmentation alleles to improve visualization. However, there may be unintended effects of these manipulations on the phenotypes under investigation. There is also debate regarding the use of stable loss-of-function (LoF) alleles in zebrafish, due to genetic compensation (GC). In the present study, we applied a method for combined movement and calcium fluorescence profiling to the study of a zebrafish model of SCN1A, the main gene associated with Dravet syndrome, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel alpha1 subunit (Nav1.1). We evaluated for spontaneous and proconvulsant-induced seizure-like activity associated with scn1lab LoF mutations in larval zebrafish expressing a neuronally-driven GECI (elavl3:GCaMP6s) and a nacre mutation causing a common pigmentation defect. In parallel studies of stable scn1labs552 mutants and F0 crispant larvae generated using a CRISPR/Cas9 multi-sgRNA approach, we find that neither stable nor acute F0 larvae recapitulate the previously reported seizure-like rapid swimming phenotype nor does either group show spontaneous calcium events meeting criteria for seizure-like activity based on a logistic classifier trained on movement and fluorescence features of proconvulsant-induced seizures. This constitutes two independent lines of evidence for a suppressive effect against the scn1lab phenotype, possibly due to the GCaMP6s-derived genetic background (AB) or nacre hypopigmentation. In response to the proconvulsant pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), we see evidence of a separate suppressive effect affecting all conspecific larvae derived from the stable scn1labs552 line, independent of genotype, possibly related to a maternal effect of scn1lab LoF in mutant parents or the residual TL background. Nonetheless, both stable and F0 crispant fish show enhanced sensitivity to PTZ relative to conspecific larvae, suggesting that proconvulsant sensitivity provides a more robust readout of scn1lab LoF under our experimental conditions. Our study underscores the unexpected challenges associated with the combination of common zebrafish tools with disease alleles in the phenotyping of zebrafish models of genetic epilepsy. Our work further highlights the advantages of using F0 crispants and the evaluation of proconvulsant sensitivity as complementary approaches that faithfully reflect the shared gene-specific pathophysiology underlying spontaneous seizures in stable mutant lines. Future work to understand the molecular mechanisms by which scn1lab-related seizures and PTZ-related hyperexcitability are suppressed under these conditions may shed light on factors contributing to variability in preclinical models of epilepsy more generally and may identify genetic modifiers relevant to Dravet syndrome.

">Behavior decoding delineates seizure microfeatures and associated sudden death risks in mice</a></h4>

              
                Behavior and motor manifestations are distinctive yet often overlooked features of epileptic seizures. Seizures can result in transient disruptions in motor control, often organized into specific behavioral patterns that can inform seizure types, onset zones, and outcomes. However, refined analysis of behaviors in epilepsy remains challenging in both clinical and preclinical settings. Current manual video inspection approaches are subjective, time-consuming, and often focus on gross and ambiguous descriptions of seizure behaviors, overlooking much of the intricate behavioral dynamics and action kinematics. Here, we utilized two machine learning-aided tools, DeepLabCut (DLC) and Behavior Segmentation of Open Field in DLC (B-SOiD), to decode previously underexplored behavior and action domains of epilepsy. We identified 63 interpretable behavior groups during seizures in a population of 32 genetically diverse mouse strains. Analysis of these behavior groups demonstrates significant differential behavior expression and complexity that can delineate distinct seizure states, unravel intrinsic seizure progression over time, and inform mouse strain backgrounds and genotypes. We also identified seizure behavior patterns and action/subaction kinematics that determine the risks of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). These findings underscore the significant potential for translation into inpatient settings for video analysis in epilepsy monitoring units and outpatient settings via home surveillance devices and smartphones.

">Linalool and trans-nerolidol prevent pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures in adult zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Ethnopharmacological relevance: linalool (LIN) and trans-nerolidol (NER) are terpene alcohols found in high concentrations in plant-derived essential oils used as a traditional treatment in many cultures. Several studies evaluating the effects of these essential oils and their isolated compounds have shown antiseizure, sedative, neuroprotective, and antioxidant properties in acute seizure models both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of acute exposure to LIN or NER on a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure model in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). Methods: 240 adult wild-type zebrafish were randomly allocated to the experimental groups: control (dechlorinated water), 1% DMSO (vehicle), diazepam (50 M DZP), and LIN or NER (4, 40 and 400 M). Animals were exposed to the treatment solution (400 mL) for 10 minutes, taken to a washout beaker (dechlorinated water, 400 mL) for 5 minutes, and recorded in the test apparatus containing 10 mM PTZ for 20 minutes. Experienced researchers conducted a blinded analysis of behavioral seizure phenotypes using BORIS software. Additionally, locomotor activity was evaluated through ANY-Maze tracking software, ensuring precise and unbiased assessment of movement behaviors. Results: the highest concentration of LIN (400 M) and NER (40 and 400 M) increased the latency to reach clonic and tonic-like seizure stages while decreasing the seizure intensity. Interestingly, NER has shown a larger effect size than the positive control group DZP, and at a concentration of 40 M, increased locomotor behavior. Conclusion: our findings show the antiseizure properties of LIN and NER in zebrafish acutely exposed to PTZ, delaying the time to reach the highest seizure stages and decreasing seizure intensity. These results are consistent with previous experiments conducted in mice and amplify the external validity of these compounds, highlighting their potential as antiseizure remedy candidates.

">Self-organization of high-dimensional geometry of neural activity in culture</a></h4>

              
                A vast number of neurons exhibit high-dimensional coordination for brain computation, both in processing sensory input and in generating spontaneous activity without external stimuli. Recent advancements in large-scale recordings have revealed that this high-dimensional population activity exhibits a scale-free structure, characterized by power law and distinct spatial patterns in principal components (PCs). However, the mechanisms underlying the formation of this high-dimensional neural coordination remain poorly understood. Specifically, it is unclear whether the characteristic high-dimensional structure of population activity emerges through self-organization or is shaped by the learning of sensory stimuli in animals. To address this question and clearly differentiate between these two possibilities, we investigated large-scale neural activity in dissociated neuronal culture using high-density multi-electrode arrays. Our findings demonstrate that the high-dimensional structure of neural activity self-organizes during network development in the absence of explicit sensory stimuli provided to animals. As the cultures mature, the PC variance exhibits a power-law decay, and the spatial structures of PCs transition from global to localized patterns, driven by the temporal correlations of neural activity. Furthermore, we observed an unexpected co-occurrence between the power-law decay in PCA and neuronal avalanches, suggesting a link between self-organized criticality and high-dimensional activity. Using a recurrent neural network model, we show that both phenomena can arise from biologically plausible heavy-tailed synaptic connectivity. By highlighting a developmental origin of the high-dimensional structure of neural activity, these findings deepen our understanding of how coordinated neural computations are achieved in the brain.

">Stress-activated neuronal ensemble in the supramammillary nucleus stores anxiety but not memory</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety is a very common negative emotional status induced by stress. However, its underlying neural mechanism is still largely unknown. Here, we found a hypothalamic section named the supramammillary nucleus (SuM), which is taking control of anxiety. We then characterized a small ensemble of stress-activated neurons and recruited encoding anxiety. These stress-activated neurons specifically respond to stress, and its activation robustly increases the anxiety-like behavior of mice without significantly influencing fear memory. We then found that the ventral subiculum -SuM but not the dorsal subiculum -SuM projection encodes anxiety and would exhibit an anti-anxiety effect by its inhibition. Our findings extend the understanding of the function of the neuronal engram cells and bring new insights into the studies on emotion especially anxiety.

	<p>Background: The integration of digital health technologies has transformed mental healthcare, particularly for young adults with First-Episode Psychosis (FEP). Digital interventions, such as telepsychiatry and mobile applications, address barriers like social stigma, restricted access to services, and the urgency of timely care. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed and APA PsycINFO. Included studies focused on randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and open studies of digital interventions for FEP rehabilitation. Exclusion criteria included meta-analyses, reviews, and irrelevant studies. Results: Smartphone applications like Horyzons-Canada facilitated peer support and symptom management, while tools such as My Journey 3 emphasized the need for better user engagement. Digital innovations, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and telepsychiatry, demonstrated improvements in recovery and treatment adherence. Discussion: Digital interventions significantly enhance the accessibility and quality of FEP care, supporting functional recovery and patient engagement. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies, user engagement strategies, and advanced analytics to develop personalized, scalable solutions.</p>

	<p>Advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are transforming the study of movement disorders by providing valuable insights into disease mechanisms. This narrative review presents a comprehensive overview of their applications in this field, offering an updated perspective on their potential for early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and therapeutic evaluation. Emerging MRI modalities such as neuromelanin-sensitive imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, and relaxometry provide sensitive biomarkers that can detect early microstructural degeneration, iron deposition, and connectivity disruptions in key regions like the substantia nigra. These techniques enable earlier and more accurate differentiation of movement disorders, including Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration, Lewy body and frontotemporal dementia, Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, and dystonia. Furthermore, MRI provides objective metrics for tracking disease progression and assessing therapeutic efficacy, making it an indispensable tool in clinical trials. Despite these advances, the absence of standardized protocols limits their integration into routine clinical practice. Addressing this gap and incorporating these techniques more systematically could bring the field closer to leveraging advanced MRI for personalized treatment strategies, ultimately improving outcomes for individuals with movement disorders.</p>

Despite the well-known benefits of physical activity in reducing mental stress and improving physical and mental well-being, the literature lacks effective interventions and standardized protocols for this population. This study aims to investigate the state of the art in literature regarding the correlation between the use of physical activity as a means of prevention and intervention and the effects on university students&amp;amp;rsquo; stress and mental well-being. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the PRISMA protocol for scoping reviews, targeting university population with specific terms. Results: The review analyzed 61 articles and identified a consistent positive correlation between physical activity and stress reduction. Interventions included yoga, tai chi, aerobic exercise and moderate- or high-intensity exercise. A lack of standardized protocols were also evident. Conclusions: Physical activity is an effective means for managing stress and improving mental well-being among university students. An integrated approach combining different forms of exercise and strategies to regulate emotions could provide very effective effects on the mental well-being of students. Universities should propose physical activity programs in several forms to enable students to choose the most appropriate one and keep them active.</p>

	<p>Introduction: The cerebellum is a common lesion site in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Physiologic and anatomic studies have identified a topographic organization of the cerebellum including functionally distinct motor and cognitive areas. In this study, a recent parcellation algorithm was applied to a sample of PwMS and healthy controls to examine the relationships among specific cerebellar regions, fall status, and common clinical measures of motor and cognitive functions. Methods: Thirty-one PwMS and twenty-nine age- and sex-matched controls underwent an MRI scan and motor and cognitive testing. The parcellation algorithm was applied to all images and divided the cerebellum into 28 regions. Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U tests were used to compare cerebellar volumes among PwMS and controls, and MS fallers and MS non-fallers. Relationships between cerebellar volumes and motor and cognitive function were evaluated using Spearman correlations. Results: PwMS performed significantly worse on functional measures compared to controls. We found significant differences in volumetric measures between PwMS and controls in the corpus medullare, lobules I&amp;amp;ndash;III, and lobule V. Volumetric differences seen between the PwMS and controls were primarily driven by the MS fallers. Finally, functional performance on motor and cognitive tasks was associated with cerebellar volumes. Conclusions: Using the parcellation tool, our results showed that the volumes of motor and cognitive lobules impact both motor and cognitive performance, and that functional performance and cerebellar volumes distinguishes the MS fallers from non-fallers. Future studies should explore the potential of cerebellar imaging to predict falls in PwMS.</p>

	<p>Background: The molecular biology of Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (HD) has grown substantially, with pathological considerations extending to genetic modifiers, epigenetic changes, transcriptomics, the proteome, and the metabolome. The metabolome and proteome are especially intriguing in that they most directly reflect the functional state of the cellular environment, which may involve some combination of pathology as well as compensation. Methods: We assessed CSF proteomics from eight participants by their functional severity (TFC range 3&amp;amp;ndash;13), with 47 proteins having a minimum r-value of 0.7 and nominal p-values &amp;amp;lt; 0.05. Results: Our exploratory data reveal correlations between progression and several processes including inflammation, ECM homeostasis and NAD+ metabolism. Conclusions: Consistently identified targets that correlate with phenotype or progression may have value, if validated, as enrichment tools in clinical trials and potentially as markers of therapeutic response.</p>

	<p>Backgrounds: Virtual reality (VR) has become a transformative technology with applications in gaming, education, healthcare, and psychotherapy. The subjective experiences in VR vary based on the virtual environment&amp;amp;rsquo;s characteristics, and electroencephalography (EEG) is instrumental in assessing these differences. By analyzing EEG signals, researchers can explore the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive and emotional responses to VR stimuli. However, distinguishing EEG signals recorded by two-dimensional (2D) versus three-dimensional (3D) VR environments remains underexplored. Current research primarily utilizes power spectral density (PSD) features to differentiate between 2D and 3D VR conditions, but the potential of other feature parameters for enhanced discrimination is unclear. Additionally, the use of machine learning techniques to classify EEG signals from 2D and 3D VR using alternative features has not been thoroughly investigated, highlighting the need for further research to identify robust EEG features and effective classification methods. Methods: This study recorded EEG signals from participants exposed to 2D and 3D VR video stimuli to investigate the neural differences between these conditions. Key features extracted from the EEG data included PSD and common spatial patterns (CSPs), which capture frequency-domain and spatial-domain information, respectively. To evaluate classification performance, several classical machine learning algorithms were employed: ssupport vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), naive Bayes, decision Tree, AdaBoost, and a voting classifier. The study systematically compared the classification performance of PSD and CSP features across these algorithms, providing a comprehensive analysis of their effectiveness in distinguishing EEG signals in response to 2D and 3D VR stimuli. Results: The study demonstrated that machine learning algorithms can effectively classify EEG signals recorded during watching 2D and 3D VR videos. CSP features outperformed PSD in classification accuracy, indicating their superior ability to capture EEG signals differences between the VR conditions. Among the machine learning algorithms, the Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy at 95.02%, followed by KNN with 93.16% and SVM with 91.39%. The combination of CSP features with RF, KNN, and SVM consistently showed superior performance compared to other feature-algorithm combinations, underscoring the effectiveness of CSP and these algorithms in distinguishing EEG responses to different VR experiences. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that EEG signals recorded during watching 2D and 3D VR videos can be effectively classified using machine learning algorithms with extracted feature parameters. The findings highlight the superiority of CSP features over PSD in distinguishing EEG signals under different VR conditions, emphasizing CSP&amp;amp;rsquo;s value in VR-induced EEG analysis. These results expand the application of feature-based machine learning methods in EEG studies and provide a foundation for future research into the brain cortical activity of VR experiences, supporting the broader use of machine learning in EEG-based analyses.</p>

                <p>Fragile X autosomal homolog 1 (FXR1), a member of the fragile X messenger riboprotein 1 family, has been linked to psychiatric disorders including autism and schizophrenia. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons play critical roles in cortical processing and have been implicated in FXR1-linked mental illnesses. Targeted deletion of FXR1 from PV interneurons in mice has been shown to alter cortical excitability and elicit schizophrenia-like behavior. This indicates that FXR1 regulates behaviorally relevant electrophysiological functions in PV interneurons. We therefore expressed a genetically encoded hybrid voltage sensor in PV interneurons and used voltage imaging in slices of mouse somatosensory cortex to assess the impact of targeted FXR1 deletion. These experiments showed that PV interneurons lacking FXR1 had excitatory synaptic potentials with larger amplitudes and shorter latencies compared with wild type. Synaptic potential rise-times, decay-times, and half-widths were also impacted to degrees that varied between cortical layer and synaptic input. Thus, FXR1 modulates the responsiveness of PV interneurons to excitatory synaptic inputs. This will enable FXR1 to control cortical processing in subtle ways, with the potential to influence behavior and contribute to psychiatric dysfunction.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/1/ENEURO.0466-24.2024?rss=1">Microglia Morphology in the Developing Primate Amygdala and Effects of Early Life Stress</a></h4>

              
                <p>A unique pool of immature glutamatergic neurons in the primate amygdala, known as the paralaminar nucleus (PL), are maturing between infancy and adolescence. The PL is a potential substrate for the steep growth curve of amygdala volume during this developmental period. A microglial component is also embedded among the PL neurons and likely supports local neuronal maturation and emerging synaptogenesis. Microglia may alter neuronal growth following environmental perturbations such as stress. Using multiple measures in rhesus macaques, we found that microglia in the infant primate PL had relatively large somas and a small arbor size. In contrast, microglia in the adolescent PL had a smaller soma and a larger dendritic arbor. We then examined microglial morphology in the PL after a novel maternal separation protocol, to examine the effects of early life stress. After maternal separation, the microglia had increased soma size, arbor size, and complexity. Surprisingly, strong effects were seen not only in the infant PL, but also in the adolescent PL from subjects who had experienced the separation many years earlier. We conclude that under normal maternal-rearing conditions, PL microglia morphology tracks PL neuronal growth, progressing to a more "mature" phenotype by adolescence. Maternal separation has long-lasting effects on microglia, altering their normal developmental trajectory, and resulting in a "hyper-ramified" phenotype that persists for years. We speculate that these changes have consequences for neuronal development in young primates.</p>

                <p>The human medial parietal cortex (MPC) is recruited during multiple cognitive processes. Previously, we demonstrated regions specific to recall of people or places and proposed that the functional organization of MPC mirrors the category selectivity defining the medial&ndash;lateral axis of the ventral&ndash;temporal cortex (VTC). However, prior work considered recall of people and places only, and VTC also shows object selectivity sandwiched between face- and scene-selective regions. Here, we tested a strong prediction of our proposal: like VTC, MPC should show a region specifically recruited during object recall, and its relative cortical position should mirror the one of VTC. While responses during people and place recall showed a striking replication of prior findings, we did not observe any evidence for object-recall effects within MPC, which differentiates it from the spatial organization in VTC. Importantly, beyond MPC, robust recall effects were observed for people, places, and objects on the lateral surface of the brain. Place-recall effects were present in the angular gyrus, frontal eye fields, and peripheral portions of the early visual cortex, whereas people recall selectively drove response in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus. Object-recall effects were largely restricted to a region posterior to the left somatosensory cortex, in the vicinity of the supramarginal gyrus. Taken together, these data demonstrate that while there are distributed regions active during recall of people, places, and objects, the functional organization of MPC does not mirror the medial&ndash;lateral axis of VTC but reflects only the most salient features of that axis&mdash;namely, representations of people and places.</p>

                Background Gliomas, particularly glioblastomas, have grim prognoses, necessitating early diagnostic and prognostic indicators. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), influential in cancer research, show potential as glioma biomarkers. This systematic review aimed to examine the efficacy of miRNAs in the diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade glioma. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies published from 2013 to 2023. The eligibility criteria included high-grade glioma, histopathological confirmation, miRNA samples from cerebrospinal fluid or plasma, and relevant outcome data. Studies were excluded if they were experimental or reviews and not in English. Results Of the 1120 initial results, 8 studies involving 660 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Several studies have assessed miRNA expression and its association with diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade gliomas. Overexpression of miR-221, miR-222, miR-210, miR-21, miR-125b, and miR-223 and under-expression of miR-15b and miR-124-3p showed significant potential in differentiating high-grade glioma patients from controls. Additionally, miRNAs are associated with distinct tumorigenic pathways. Conclusion Elevated or depressed expression levels of specific circulating miRNAs hold significant promise as noninvasive biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade glioma. These miRNAs offer valuable insights into disease progression and patient outcome. Further validation through extensive clinical trials and in-depth mechanistic studies is essential to realize their full clinical utility.

                Abstract* Currently, machine learning applications in marketing allow to optimize strategies, personalize experiences and improve decision making. However, there are still several research gaps, so the objective is to examine the research trends in the use of machine learning in marketing. A bibliometric analysis is proposed to assess the current scientific activity, following the parameters established by PRISMA-2020. Machine learning applications in marketing have experienced steady growth and increased attention in the academic community. Key references, such as Miklosik and Evans, and prominent journals, such as IEEE Access and Journal of Business Research, have been identified. A thematic evolution towards big data and digital marketing is observed, and thematic clusters such as “digital marketing”, “interpretation”, “prediction”, and “healthcare" stand out. These findings demonstrate the continued importance and research potential of this evolving field.

                Background This article introduces the fuzzy LiuB-subalgebra (LBS) of LiuB-algebra (LBA), a concept previously undefined in the context of BCL-algebras (other than BCL+-algebras). Additionally, we explore the use of a new notion of Pythagorean fuzzy sets within LiuB-subalgebras of LiuB-algebra.

Results The paper introduces a new concept—the Pythagorean fuzzy LiuB-subalgebra of LiuB-algebra—and provides theorems and properties associated with this structure. These findings demonstrate how these fuzzy subalgebras can be defined and explored within the broader framework of LiuB-algebra. Conclusions This work contributes to the theory of LiuB-algebras by presenting the Pythagorean fuzzy LiuB-subalgebra, along with its key properties and characteristics. The study provides new insights into the relationships between fuzzy sets and LiuB-algebras, opening up further avenues for research in this area.

                Background Conventional fish feed based on fish meal, meat, and soy cake presents procurement difficulties and high costs, affecting the profitability and sustainability of the aquaculture industry. Objective To evaluate the effect of hydrolyzed red worm (HRW- Eisenia foétida) in red tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) diet on production parameters. Methods The study was conducted at the aquaculture farm of the Politécnico Colombiano Jaime Isaza Cadavid (PCJIC) at 780 m.a.s.l.,with an average temperature of 28 °C. Ninety red tilapia fingerlings, averaging 7,5±0,5 g, were distributed in nine aquariums containing 75 liters of water. Fish underwentweight and size measurements at the beginning and end of the trial. They were fed experimental diets to apparent satiation three times daily. Water quality parameters and productive rates of growth and nutrient utilization were measured. The experimental design included three treatments with three replicates each: T1 (control diet, 0% hydrolysate inclusion), T2 (10% hydrolysate inclusion), and T3 (20% hydrolysate inclusion). ANOVA (p<0,05) was applied to growth and nutrient utilization variables, with mean comparisons using α<0,05 in SPSS version 25. Results Significant differences (p<0,04) were found between the control diet T1 (0% inclusion) and T2 (10% inclusion) in favor of weight gain (31,87 g). There were no statistical differences in size increase (p<0,217). As HRWinclusion increased, feed consumption decreased, likely due to higher hydrolyzed protein availability. Feed conversion rates showed significant differences (p<0,001) between T2 and T3 compared to T1, indicating better assimilation of the hydrolyzed protein. T2 and T3 also showed better protein and energy efficiency (p<0,001), demonstrating the hydrolyzed protein’s nutritional quality and assimilation. Diet cost decreased with higher hydrolyzed inclusion (p<0,034). Conclusion Inclusion 10% and 20% hydrolyzed red worms significantly improved production parameters and reduced costs, making it a viable alternative for feeding red tilapia for small and medium-scale producers.

                Background Owing to its combination of speed, tactics, and accuracy, table tennis is becoming a sport exercise that is suitable for older adults. Casual play is fun and relaxing, and more serious table tennis might further develop skills through focused practice. Methods A randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to determine how the practice of competition compared to leisure playing affects the Quality of life (QoL) of people aged 40-70. Selecting subjects at random, one group of subjects undertook a structured competitive regimen, whereas the other group was given time to play recreationally without any structured competition. QoL was measured before and after the intervention using the WHOQOL-BREF, which measures physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains. Data were analyzed using paired and independent t-test. Results The group that received structured competition reported a marked improvement in their QoL indicators, especially in physical health (p < 0.001), psychological health (p < 0.001), and social relationships (p = 0.001), when compared to the control group, which showed few improvements. No significant differences were observed in the environmental domains in either group. Conclusions Regular competitive table tennis practice improves physical condition, emotions, and social relationships, which leads to a higher QoL in older adults. Thus, these results emphasize the utility of competitive sports in the maintenance of active and healthy aging.

                Background Structuring data analysis projects, that is, defining the layout of files and folders needed to analyze data using existing tools and novel code, largely follows personal preferences. Open Science calls for more accessible, transparent and understandable research. We believe that Open Science principles can be applied to the way data analysis projects are structured. Methods We examine the structure of several data analysis project templates by analyzing project template repositories present in GitHub. Through visualization of the resulting consensus structure, we draw observations regarding how the ecosystem of project structures is shaped, and what salient characteristics it has. Results Project templates show little overlap, but many distinct practices can be highlighted. We take them into account with the wider Open Science philosophy to draw a few fundamental Design Principles to guide researchers when designing a project space. We present Kerblam!, a project management tool that can work with such a project structure to expedite data handling, execute workflow managers, and share the resulting workflow and analysis outputs with others. Conclusions We hope that, by following these principles and using Kerblam!, the landscape of data analysis projects can become more transparent, understandable, and ultimately useful to the wider community.

                The common, or spectacled, caiman Caiman crocodilus is an abundant, widely distributed Neotropical crocodilian exhibiting notable morphological and molecular diversification. As the type species for the Caimaninae subfamily - the sister taxa for the subfamily to which members of the genus Alligator belong - C. crocodilus occupies a key position in our understanding of crocodilian and archosaur genetics and evolution. The species also accounts by far for the largest share of crocodilian hides on the global market, with the C. crocodilus hide trade alone valued at about US$86.5 million per year. Thus, the genome sequence of C. crocodilus can potentially be of considerable use for both basic and applied research. We obtained 239,911,946 paired-end reads comprising approximately 72 G bases using Illumina TM sequencing of tissue sampled from a single Caiman crocodilus individual. These reads were de-novo assembled and progressively aligned against the genomes of increasingly related crocodilians; liftoff was used to annotate the draft C. crocodilus genome assembly based on an Alligator mississipiensis (a confamilial species) annotation. The draft C. crocodilus genome assembly and sequences reads have been deposited with the National Center for Biotechnology Information with accession numbers JAGPOW000000000.1 for the assembly, and SRR22317059 for the sequence read archives under Bioproject PRJNA716363.

                Background We present q2-boots, a QIIME 2 plugin that facilitates bootstrapped and rarefaction-based microbiome diversity analysis. This plugin provides eight new actions that allow users to apply any of thirty different alpha diversity metrics and twenty-two beta diversity metrics to bootstrapped or rarefied feature tables, using a single QIIME 2 Pipeline command, or more granular QIIME 2 Action commands. Results Given a feature table, an even sampling depth, and the number of iterations to perform (n), the command qiime boots core-metrics will resample the feature table n times and compute alpha and beta diversity metrics on each resampled table. The results will be integrated in summary data artifacts that are identical in structure and type to results that would be generated by applying diversity metrics to a single table. This enables all the same downstream analytic tools to be applied to these tables and ensures that all collected data is considered when computing microbiome diversity metrics. Conclusions A challenge of this work was deciding how to integrate distance matrices that were computed on n resampled feature tables, as a simple average of pairwise distances (median or mean) does not account for the structure of distance matrices. q2-boots provides three options, and we show here that the results of these approaches are highly correlated. q2-boots is free and open source. Source code can be found at https://github.com/caporaso-lab/q2-boots; installation instructions and a tutorial can be found in the project’s documentation at https://q2-boots.readthedocs.io.

                The emergence of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens poses a significant threat to aquaculture and public health. This study presents the characterization of a novel bacteriophage, designated as Ursula, specifically targeting Citrobacter, a prominent pathogen affecting fish populations. We isolated Ursula from aquatic environments during a search for novel phages active against fish pathogens, and conducted a comprehensive analysis of its morphological, genomic, and lytic properties. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that Ursula has a myovirus morphology, being a rather large T4-like phage. Genomic sequencing identified a double-stranded linear DNA genome of approximately 183 kb, containing unique genes associated with lytic activity and host recognition. This phage is related to other T4-like Citrobacter phages, being a new species.

                <p>by Ankita Chavan, Lena Skrutl, Federico Uliana, Melanie Pfister, Franziska Brändle, Laszlo Tirian, Delora Baptista, Dominik Handler, David Burke, Anna Sintsova, Pedro Beltrao, Julius Brennecke, Madhav Jagannathan</p>

Noncoding satellite DNA repeats are abundant at the pericentromeric heterochromatin of eukaryotic chromosomes. During interphase, sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins cluster these repeats from multiple chromosomes into nuclear foci known as chromocenters. Despite the pivotal role of chromocenters in cellular processes like genome encapsulation and gene repression, the associated proteins remain incompletely characterized. Here, we use 2 satellite DNA-binding proteins, D1 and Prod, as baits to characterize the chromocenter-associated proteome in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos, ovaries, and testes through quantitative mass spectrometry. We identify D1- and Prod-associated proteins, including known heterochromatin proteins as well as proteins previously unlinked to satellite DNA or chromocenters, thereby laying the foundation for a comprehensive understanding of cellular functions enabled by satellite DNA repeats and their associated proteins. Interestingly, we find that multiple components of the transposon-silencing piRNA pathway are associated with D1 and Prod in embryos. Using genetics, transcriptomics, and small RNA profiling, we show that flies lacking D1 during embryogenesis exhibit transposon expression and gonadal atrophy as adults. We further demonstrate that this gonadal atrophy can be rescued by mutating the checkpoint kinase, <i>Chk2</i>, which mediates germ cell arrest in response to transposon mobilization. Thus, we reveal that a satellite DNA-binding protein functions during embryogenesis to silence transposons, in a manner that is heritable across later stages of development.

                Background The identification of an individual after mass calamities poses challenges to experts when bones are fragmented. Dense bones, such as the maxilla, surpass this challenge and remain intact with sinuses even after incineration, thereby making the sinuses an ideal and reliable forensic science tool. No-ninvasive imaging techniques, such as Computed Tomography (CT), can be used to evaluate such cases and help detect fractures and further locate foreign bodies. This study aimed to estimate the dimensions and volumes of the frontal (FS), maxillary (MS), and sphenoidal air sinuses (SS) on CT scans and investigate age- and sex-related differences. Methods CT scans of the paranasal sinuses were acquired from 158 patients ranging in age from 19 to 73 years, and written consent was obtained from all participants. This study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee (ethical clearance number IEC 064/2010). All parameters were statistically analyzed using SPSS 20 version and the significance level was set at p<0.05. Results The bilateral anteroposterior length and height of the FS were significantly larger in men than females (p<0.05). The overall dimensions of the MS and SS were substantially greater in males than females (P <0.05). Likewise, the overall volumes of the fFS, MS, and SS were significantly greater in males than females (p<0.05). However, no significant age-related correlation was observed in the dimensions and volumes of the sinuses. Conclusion The results of this study showed that imaging could be a reliable instrument for personal identification in forensic anthropology. Countries that do not allow autopsies may implement this method to clarify the cause of death.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-84/v1?src=rss">The influence of anxiety-related emotional disorders and self-esteem on obesity among Chinese children [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Anxiety and obesity can have negative impacts on the health of children. Understanding the relationship between obesity and mental disorders in children and adolescents will help develop effective prevention and intervention strategies. This research investigates the impact of anxiety-related emotional disorders and self-esteem on obesity among Chinese children aged 6-12 in Anhui Province. Methods Utilizing a non-experimental, cross-sectional study design, data were from 136 participants collected through standardized instrument measures from Chinese children: the “Chinese screening for overweight and obesity among school-age children and adolescents” in the “Health Industry Standards of the People’s Republic of China” as the standard for identifying obesity, the Screen for Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) for assessing anxiety disorder, and the Children’s Self-Esteem Scale (CSES) for evaluating self-esteem. Statistical analysis, including descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation analysis, and multiple regression analyses was performed using SPSS version 26 to determine the predictive relationships between the variables. Results The analysis revealed that anxiety-related emotional disorders and self-esteem contribute significantly to the prediction of obesity among Chinese children, accounting for a 13.7% variance. The study highlights the critical roles of anxiety-related emotional disorders and self-esteem in determining children’s obesity. It suggests that underscores the necessity for comprehensive interventions that address both physical and mental health aspects to combat childhood obesity effectively. The study concludes that addressing anxiety and self-esteem is essential for developing effective strategies to reduce obesity rates among Chinese children, meeting the research objectives, and contributing to the development of holistic health programs for children’s well-being.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-346/v3?src=rss">CYP2C19 polymorphism and coronary in-stent restenosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [version 3; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background In-stent restenosis (ISR) remains a major drawback in coronary stenting. The association between the CYP2C19 loss of function (LOF) gene and the prevalence of ISR after coronary stenting remains controversial. Previous studies have produced conflicting results and have been limited by their small population sizes. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the association between the presence of the CYP2C19 LOF gene and the prevalence of ISR. Methods A systematic online database search was performed until April 2021. The primary outcome was ISR and assessed using OR with 95% CI. Quality of the study was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. I2 was applied to examine heterogeneities among the studies. Results A total of 284 patients (four non-randomized controlled trial studies) were included in this study. Two hundred and six patients had wild-type genotypes, while 78 patients had the LOF genotype. Among the 78 patients with the LOF gene, 38 patients had an ISR. Meanwhile, of the 206 patients with a wild-type gene, 69 patients had an ISR. LOF gene was associated with a higher risk of ISR (OR 95% CI = 2.71 [1.42–5.16], P = 0.003). However, study-specific variability should be considered when applying these findings clinically. Conclusions Patients with LOF genes, regardless of the allele variation, treated with clopidogrel, had a higher likelihood of ISR after coronary stenting.

                Rhythmic neural activity is considered essential for adaptively modulating responses in the visual system. In this opinion article we posit that visual brain rhythms also serve a key function in the representation and communication of visual contents. Collating a set of recent studies that used multivariate decoding methods on rhythmic brain signals, we highlight such rhythmic content representations in visual perception, imagery, and prediction. We argue that characterizing representations across frequency bands allows researchers to elegantly disentangle content transfer in feedforward and feedback directions. We further propose that alpha dynamics are central to content-specific feedback propagation in the visual system. We conclude that considering rhythmic content codes is pivotal for understanding information coding in vision and beyond.

                Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is associated with impaired development and function of AMs. Zhu et al. demonstrate that deletion of Men1 leads to spontaneous PAP through epigenetic inactivation of CSF2. Menin is a critical scaffold component needed for SETD2 to catalyze H3K36me3 reactions in AMs.

                Recall responses form the basis of vaccine-induced protection. Termote et al. use genetically modified mice to study the influence of affinity on B cells during boosting. The results indicate an affinity-based threshold for memory B cell entry to germinal centers (GCs). GC refueling promotes the maturation of naive and less mutated B cells.

                O’Shea et al. investigates how the transition between cone- and rod-mediated vision affects neural representations in central visual areas of the mouse. Whereas the thalamus inherits luminance-dependent functional properties from the retina, visual cortex exhibits a luminance-invariant code. The convergence of parallel afferent pathways can generate a luminance-invariant code.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94045">Leveraging mobility data to analyze persistent SARS-CoV-2 mutations and inform targeted genomic surveillance</a></h4>

              
                Given the rapid cross-country spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting difficulty in tracking lineage spread, we investigated the potential of combining mobile service data and fine-granular metadata (such as postal codes and genomic data) to advance integrated genomic surveillance of the pandemic in the federal state of Thuringia, Germany. We sequenced over 6500 SARS-CoV-2 Alpha genomes (B.1.1.7) across 7 months within Thuringia while collecting patients’ isolation dates and postal codes. Our dataset is complemented by over 66,000 publicly available German Alpha genomes and mobile service data for Thuringia. We identified the existence and spread of nine persistent mutation variants within the Alpha lineage, seven of which formed separate phylogenetic clusters with different spreading patterns in Thuringia. The remaining two are subclusters. Mobile service data can indicate these clusters’ spread and highlight a potential sampling bias, especially of low-prevalence variants. Thereby, mobile service data can be used either retrospectively to assess surveillance coverage and efficiency from already collected data or to actively guide part of a surveillance sampling process to districts where these variants are expected to emerge. The latter concept was successfully implemented as a proof-of-concept for a mobility-guided sampling strategy in response to the surveillance of Omicron sublineage BQ.1.1. The combination of mobile service data and SARS-CoV-2 surveillance by genome sequencing is a valuable tool for more targeted and responsive surveillance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95842">Endocytic recycling is central to circadian collagen fibrillogenesis and disrupted in fibrosis</a></h4>

              
                Collagen-I fibrillogenesis is crucial to health and development, where dysregulation is a hallmark of fibroproliferative diseases. Here, we show that collagen-I fibril assembly required a functional endocytic system that recycles collagen-I to assemble new fibrils. Endogenous collagen production was not required for fibrillogenesis if exogenous collagen was available, but the circadian-regulated vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) 33b and collagen-binding integrin α11 subunit were crucial to fibrillogenesis. Cells lacking VPS33B secrete soluble collagen-I protomers but were deficient in fibril formation, thus secretion and assembly are separately controlled. Overexpression of VPS33B led to loss of fibril rhythmicity and overabundance of fibrils, which was mediated through integrin α11β1. Endocytic recycling of collagen-I was enhanced in human fibroblasts isolated from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, where VPS33B and integrin α11 subunit were overexpressed at the fibrogenic front; this correlation between VPS33B, integrin α11 subunit, and abnormal collagen deposition was also observed in samples from patients with chronic skin wounds. In conclusion, our study showed that circadian-regulated endocytic recycling is central to homeostatic assembly of collagen fibrils and is disrupted in diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95411">3D genomic features across &gt;50 diverse cell types reveal insights into the genomic architecture of childhood obesity</a></h4>

              
                The prevalence of childhood obesity is increasing worldwide, along with the associated common comorbidities of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in later life. Motivated by evidence for a strong genetic component, our prior genome-wide association study (GWAS) efforts for childhood obesity revealed 19 independent signals for the trait; however, the mechanism of action of these loci remains to be elucidated. To molecularly characterize these childhood obesity loci, we sought to determine the underlying causal variants and the corresponding effector genes within diverse cellular contexts. Integrating childhood obesity GWAS summary statistics with our existing 3D genomic datasets for 57 human cell types, consisting of high-resolution promoter-focused Capture-C/Hi-C, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq, we applied stratified LD score regression and calculated the proportion of genome-wide SNP heritability attributable to cell type-specific features, revealing pancreatic alpha cell enrichment as the most statistically significant. Subsequent chromatin contact-based fine-mapping was carried out for genome-wide significant childhood obesity loci and their linkage disequilibrium proxies to implicate effector genes, yielded the most abundant number of candidate variants and target genes at the <i>BDNF</i>, <i>ADCY3</i>, <i>TMEM18,</i> and <i>FTO</i> loci in skeletal muscle myotubes and the pancreatic beta-cell line, EndoC-BH1. One novel implicated effector gene, <i>ALKAL2</i> – an inflammation-responsive gene in nerve nociceptors – was observed at the key <i>TMEM18</i> locus across multiple immune cell types. Interestingly, this observation was also supported through colocalization analysis using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) derived from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset, supporting an inflammatory and neurologic component to the pathogenesis of childhood obesity. Our comprehensive appraisal of 3D genomic datasets generated in a myriad of different cell types provides genomic insights into pediatric obesity pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96287">Complementary cognitive roles for D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs during interval timing</a></h4>

              
                The role of striatal pathways in cognitive processing is unclear. We studied dorsomedial striatal cognitive processing during interval timing, an elementary cognitive task that requires mice to estimate intervals of several seconds and involves working memory for temporal rules as well as attention to the passage of time. We harnessed optogenetic tagging to record from striatal D2-dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) in the indirect pathway and from D1-dopamine receptor-expressing MSNs (D1-MSNs) in the direct pathway. We found that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs exhibited distinct dynamics over temporal intervals as quantified by principal component analyses and trial-by-trial generalized linear models. MSN recordings helped construct and constrain a four-parameter drift-diffusion computational model in which MSN ensemble activity represented the accumulation of temporal evidence. This model predicted that disrupting either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs would increase interval timing response times and alter MSN firing. In line with this prediction, we found that optogenetic inhibition or pharmacological disruption of either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs increased interval timing response times. Pharmacologically disrupting D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs also changed MSN dynamics and degraded trial-by-trial temporal decoding. Together, our findings demonstrate that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs had opposing dynamics yet played complementary cognitive roles, implying that striatal direct and indirect pathways work together to shape temporal control of action. These data provide novel insight into basal ganglia cognitive operations beyond movement and have implications for human striatal diseases and therapies targeting striatal pathways.

	<p>Objectives: The aim of the present study was to examine the growth dynamics of the first sacral vertebra and its ossification center in the human fetus, based on their linear, planar, and volumetric parameters. Methods: The examinations were carried out on 54 human fetuses of both sexes (26 males and 28 females) aged 18&amp;amp;ndash;30 weeks of gestation, which had been preserved in 10% neutral formalin solution. Using CT, digital image analysis software, 3D reconstruction, and statistical methods, the size of the first sacral vertebra and its ossification center was evaluated. Results: The first sacral vertebra and its ossification center grew proportionately according to fetal weeks. Conclusions: The numerical data obtained from computed tomography and the growth patterns of the body of the first sacral vertebra and its ossification center may serve as age-specific normative intervals relevant for gynecologists, obstetricians, pediatricians, and radiologists during fetal ultrasound screening. Our findings on the growth of the body of the first sacral vertebra and its ossification center may be useful in daily clinical practice, particularly in ultrasonic monitoring of normal fetal growth and in screening for congenital defects and skeletal dysplasias.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Narration is a sensitive tool for the assessment of language in children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (HF-ASD) since mild language deficits beyond the sentential level are not always noticeable through the administration of standardized language tests targeting the lexical or sentential level. This study investigated the narrative ability of monolingual Greek-speaking HF-ASD children in comparison to that of their typically developing (TD) peers and explored the associations between narrative variables, ADHD symptomatology, and memory skills in the participants on the autistic spectrum. Methods: The participants were 39 children aged 7 to 12 years, 19 with HF-ASD and 20 age-matched, vocabulary-matched, and cognitively matched TD peers. Results: The two groups were similar in most microstructural and macrostructural variables but differed significantly in syntactic complexity (p = 0.024; d = 0.754) and subordination (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; d = &amp;amp;minus;1.576) indices, implying that the HF-ASD group presented syntactic delay in comparison to their TD peers. The HF-ASD participants showed significantly higher heterogeneity in the amount of information generated for the story&amp;amp;rsquo;s main character (p = 0.004; d = &amp;amp;minus;0.093) in comparison to their TD peers. Significant associations were observed between verbal and visual memory, complex syntactic structures, and Theory of Mind-related internal state terms. ADHD symptomatology was negatively correlated with the generation of simple and coordinated clauses. Finally, complex syntax and delayed vSTM were correlated with retelling total scores, indicating that language ability and verbal memory compensate for narrative competence in HF-ASD children. Conclusions: The findings highlight the impact that language skills, memory ability, and ADHD symptomatology have on narrative competence in children with HF-ASD, as well as the importance of narrative use for assessing the language skills in populations with mild language impairment.</p>

	<p>The significant correlation between ancient medicinal practices and brain function marks a revolutionary frontier in the field of neuroscience. Acupuncture, a traditional oriental medicine, can affect brain regions, such as the hypothalamus, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and hippocampus, and produces specific therapeutic effects, such as pain relief, suppression of hypertension, and alleviation of drug addiction. Among the brain regions, the hypothalamus, a small yet critical region in the brain, plays a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis by regulating a wide array of physiological processes, including stress responses, energy balance, and pain modulation. Emerging evidence suggests that acupuncture may exert its therapeutic effects by modulating the activity of the hypothalamus and its associated neural circuits, particularly in relation to pain, stress, and metabolic regulation. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive review of past and current research on the role of the hypothalamus in mediating the therapeutic effects of acupuncture.</p>

	<p>Background: Clinicians are challenged by the ambiguity and uncertainty in assessing level of consciousness in individuals with disorder of consciousness (DoC). There are numerous challenges to valid and reliable neurobehavioral assessment and classification of DoC due to multiple environmental and patient-related biases including behavioral fluctuation and confounding or co-occurring medical conditions. Addressing these biases could impact accuracy of assessment and is an important aspect of the DoC assessment process. Methods: A pre-assessment checklist was developed by a group of interdisciplinary DoC clinical experts and researchers based on the existing literature, current validated tools, and expert opinions. Once finalized, the checklist was electronically distributed to clinicians with a range of experience in neurobehavioral assessment with DoC. Respondents were asked to use the checklist prior to completing a neurobehavioral assessment. A survey was also provided to respondents to obtain feedback regarding checklist feasibility and utility in optimizing the behavioral assessments. Results: Thirty-three clinicians completed the survey after using the checklist. Over half of the respondents were a combination of physicians, neuropsychologists, and physical therapists. All respondents served the adult DoC population and 42% percent had over ten years of clinical experience. Eighty percent reported they found the format of the checklist useful and easy to use. All respondents reported the checklist was relevant to preparing for behavioral assessment in the DoC population. Eighty-four percent reported they would recommend the use of the tool to other clinicians. Conclusions: The use of a pre-assessment checklist was found to be feasible and efficacious in increasing interdisciplinary clinician&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to optimize the patient and environment in preparation for neurobehavioral assessment. Initial results of clinicians&amp;amp;rsquo; perception of the utility of a pre-assessment checklist were positive. However, further validation of the tool is needed with larger sample sizes to improve representation of clinical use across disciplines and care settings.</p>

                Background Disease-related malnutrition is common among hospitalised and recently discharged older adults. Consequences of malnutrition are physical limitations, negative health outcomes, decreased quality of life and increased healthcare costs. Dietetic care can counteract the effects of malnutrition by increasing protein and energy intake. The ProIntens study aims to evaluate the impact of an intensive dietetic care pathway on dietary protein intake and physical functioning in older adults during hospitalisation and after discharge. Process and economic evaluations will be performed. Methods The ProIntens study is a multicentre two-armed parallel individually randomised trial in five hospitals in the Amsterdam region. In total, 250 hospitalised older adults, aged ≥55 years and at risk of malnutrition will be randomised to receive regular care (control) or intensive dietetic care (intervention). The intervention consists of intensive personalised care which involves transmural guidance by trained dietitians, supportive materials on protein intake in a social context and a mobilization program during hospitalisation until three months after discharge. Controls will receive regular care. The primary outcome will be the between-groups difference in the mean change on the Short Physical Performance Battery three months after discharge. Secondary outcomes include dietary protein intake, body composition, physical activity, activities of daily living, quality of life and healthcare costs. Discussion The ProIntens trial will study the effects and costs of an intensive dietetic treatment on recovery outcomes in hospitalised older adults at risk of malnutrition. The intervention will result in practical tools for care professionals which aim to improve malnutrition treatment for older patients.

                Background The United Arab Emirates (UAE) construction industry has rapidly expanded, but construction work, by its nature, poses a high risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). These disorders significantly impact quality of life (QoL) and productivity and lead to disability and absenteeism. Aims and Objectives The study aims to determine the prevalence of WMSDs among UAE construction workers using the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) and assess their QoL using the Short-Form (SF-36) survey. Additionally, it aims to explore factors associated with WMSDs and QoL among construction workers in the United Arab Emirates. Methods This study is a cross-sectional, survey-based design conducted from July 2023 to May 2024 in the United Arab Emirates. The study included male construction workers aged 18-50 with at least 1 year of experience. Participants were recruited using a combination of convenience and purposive sampling methods. The data were collected via paper-based forms using the SF-36 and NMQ questionnaires. The study instruments were chosen after reviewing relevant literature to ensure minimal measurement bias. Statistical methods included descriptive statistics, tests for normality, and Pearson’s correlation test with a significance level of p <0.05. Results A total of 346 construction workers were accessed and the study found an 81.8% 12-month WMSD prevalence, most commonly affecting the lower back (44.8%), neck (45.1%), and shoulders (37.9%). Additionally, 70.5% reported pain-related limitations, and 63.6% experienced pain in the past week. SF-36 scores were lowest for role limitations due to physical health (30.33) and emotional problems (33.43), with an overall mean of 52.27 out of 100. Conclusion The study found a high prevalence of WMSD in construction workers and moderate quality of life scores. These findings highlight the urgent need to prioritize construction worker health through targeted interventions.

                Background Cardiovascular disease is rampant worldwide and has become the leading factor in increasing the global mortality rates. According to the World Heart Federation, death toll due to CVD has increased from 12.1 million in 1990 to around 19 million in 2019. Myocardial Infarction (MI) is a condition where the heart muscle dies due to reduced or inhibited flow of oxygenated blood. It has affected approximately 3 million people worldwide, with more than 1 million deaths in the United States annually. Such unusual proliferation in global death toll due to CVD can be reduced to a great extent by predicting the risk of CVD at an early stage. Method In this paper, several feature selection techniques including Variance-based, Mutual Information (MI), Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRMR), Boruta, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithms are used feature optimization. For class prediction, the Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Adaboost algorithms were implemented in their ordinary, One-vs-Rest (OVR) and One-vs-One (OVO) methods. Result The performance of Adaboost model has significantly improved by using feature selection techniques, that is, the accuracy of 74% (without any feature selection taking 5.3 seconds) is increased to 85% (with Boruta feature selection taking only 2.17 seconds training time) and 88% (with MRMR feature selection taking 1.6 seconds training time). Similarly, the DT-OVO model’s performance has improved from 84% (without any feature selection taking 1.48 seconds training time) to 86% (with Boruta feature selection taking 0.58 training time). For other models, the performance is maintained with reduced model training times. Conclusion This research paper prioritizes on feature selection in developing machine learning models for CVD prediction. This conclusion is justified by demonstrating the significant reduction in model training times for the 72 models generated while maintaining or even improving the model’s predictive performance.

                Melatonin, the “sleep hormone,” shows significant promise in dentistry owing to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. It is beneficial for treating periodontal disorders and aiding osseointegration of dental implants. Additionally, melatonin helps to manage dental anxiety, offering an alternative to traditional sedatives. Periodontal disease is orchestrated by bacterial plaques along with an exaggerated immune-inflammatory host response. Treatment of periodontitis not only involves the removal of plaque, but also aims to minimize the cytokine load and control the reactive oxygen species burden in the tissues, which would re-establish a healthy periodontium and a balanced bone metabolism. Melatonin is known to exert beneficial effects, such as regulation of circadian rhythm, bone remodeling, and antimicrobial effects. Recent studies have demonstrated the successful use of melatonin as an adjunct to mechanical debridement for the treatment of periodontal disease. Its various uses include systemic administration of melatonin after one-stage full-mouth Non-Surgical Periodontal Therapy in healthy subjects as well as patients. This article provides a summary of the various clinical applications of melatonin, describing its mechanism of action, uses, and potential avenues for future research in dentistry.

                Tracheobronchial endoluminal hamartochondroma (HC) is a rare benign tumor, most frequently diagnosed in individuals between the sixth and seventh decades of life. The clinical presentation is usually very noisy. Here, we report two interesting cases. The first patient is a 58-year-old man who was wrongly treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. HC was in the lower third of the trachea. The second patient is a 43-year-old man with a history of bronchiectasis and right lower lobectomy. HC was in the middle lobe bronchus. The resection via rigid bronchoscopy with diode laser was successful without any complications. Only one patient keeps a small stable tumor residue. The rigid bronchoscopy with laser-application in tracheobronchial endoluminal HC is safe and effective. Flexible bronchoscopy is important during the follow-up.

                <p>by Alexander G. Ginsberg, Scott F. Lempka, Bo Duan, Victoria Booth, Jennifer Crodelle</p>

Chronic pain is a wide-spread condition that is debilitating and expensive to manage, costing the United States alone around $600 billion in 2010. In a common symptom of chronic pain called allodynia, non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with highly variable presentations across individuals. While the specific mechanisms remain unclear, allodynia is hypothesized to be caused by the dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In this work, we analyze biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures that represent common motifs in neural circuits in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn. These circuits are hypothesized to be part of the neural pathways that mediate two different types of allodynia: static and dynamic. We use neural firing rate models to describe the activity of populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within each subcircuit. By accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions, we specify model parameters defining populations of subcircuits that yield typical behavior under normal conditions. Then, we implement a sensitivity analysis approach to identify the mechanisms most likely to cause allodynia-producing dysregulation of the subcircuit’s E-I signaling. We find that disruption of E-I balance generally occurs either due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling so that excitatory neurons are “released” from inhibitory control, or due to upregulation of excitatory neuron responses so that excitatory neurons “escape” their inhibitory control. Which of these mechanisms is most likely to occur, the subcircuit components involved in the mechanism, and the proportion of subcircuits exhibiting the mechanism can vary depending on the subcircuit structure. These results suggest specific hypotheses about diverse mechanisms that may be most likely responsible for allodynia, thus offering predictions for the high interindividual variability observed in allodynia and identifying targets for further experimental studies on the underlying mechanisms of this chronic pain symptom.

                <p>by Luis L. Fonseca, Lucas Böttcher, Borna Mehrad, Reinhard C. Laubenbacher</p>

This paper describes and validates an algorithm to solve optimal control problems for agent-based models (ABMs). For a given ABM and a given optimal control problem, the algorithm derives a surrogate model, typically lower-dimensional, in the form of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), solves the control problem for the surrogate model, and then transfers it back to the original ABM. It applies to quite general ABMs and offers several options for the ODE structure, depending on what information about the ABM is to be used. There is a broad range of applications for such an algorithm, since ABMs are used widely in the life sciences, such as ecology, epidemiology, and biomedicine and healthcare, areas where optimal control is an important purpose for modeling, such as for medical digital twin technology.

                <p>by Olivia L. Calvin, Matthew T. Erickson, Cody J. Walters, A. David Redish</p>

Worrying about perceived threats is a hallmark of multiple psychological disorders including anxiety. This concern about future events is particularly important when an individual is faced with an approach-avoidance conflict. Potential goals to approach are known to be represented in the dorsal hippocampus during theta cycles. Similarly, important information that is distant from the animal’s position is represented during hippocampal high-synchrony events (HSEs), which coincide with sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). It is likely that potential future threats may be similarly represented. We examined how threats and rewards were represented within the hippocampus during approach-avoidance conflicts in rats faced with a predator-like robot guarding a food reward. We found decoding of the pseudo-predator’s location during HSEs when hesitating in the nest and during theta prior to retreating as the rats approached the pseudo-predator. After the first attack, we observed new place fields appearing at the location of the robot (not the location the rat was when attacked). The anxiolytic diazepam reduced anxiety-like behavior and altered hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs), including reducing SWRs, suggesting that one potential mechanism of diazepam’s actions may be through altered representations of imagined threat. These results suggest that hippocampal representation of potential threats could be an important mechanism that underlies worry and a potential target for anxiolytics.

Pathogenic mutations that cause rhodopsin misfolding lead to a spectrum of currently untreatable blinding diseases collectively termed retinitis pigmentosa. Small molecules to correct rhodopsin misfolding are therefore urgently needed. In this study, we utilized virtual screening to search for drug-like molecules that bind to the orthosteric site of rod opsin and improve its folding and trafficking. We identified and validated the biological effects of 2 non-retinoid compounds with favorable pharmacological properties that cross the blood–retina barrier. These compounds reversibly bind to unliganded rod opsin, each with a K<sub>d</sub> comparable to 9-<i>cis</i>-retinal and improve opsin stability. By improving the internal protein structure network (PSN), these rod opsin ligands also enhanced the plasma membrane expression of total 36 of 123 tested clinical RP variants, including the most prevalent P23H variant. Importantly, these compounds protected retinas against light-induced degeneration in mice vulnerable to bright light injury and prolonged survival of photoreceptors in a retinitis pigmentosa mouse model for rod opsin misfolding.

                Background Deficits in sensorimotor gating have been reported in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as well as in ASD murine models. However, this behavior has not been examined in the neuronal subset-specific (NS)-Pten knockout (KO) model of ASD. NS-Pten KO mice exhibit hyperactivity of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway which is implicated in the onset of autistic deficits. This study investigates the potential relationship between PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and deficits in sensorimotor gating. Methods To assess sensorimotor gating in NS-Pten KO mice we utilized a three-day paradigm. On day 1 (habituation) the mice were administered 80 repetitions of a 120-dB startle stimulus. On day 2, prepulse inhibition was measured with 90 trials of the startle stimulus that was paired with a smaller (2, 7, or 12 dB) prepulse stimulus. Day 3 was assessed one week later, consisting of randomized startle trials and trials with no stimulus and was used to determine the startle response. Results No significant difference between NS-Pten KO or wildtype (WT) mice was found for habituation (p > 0.05). No significant differences were found between groups when assessing the percentage of prepulse inhibition at 2, 7, and 12 dB (p > 0.05). There was also no difference in startle response between groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion Our study found that the NS-Pten KO model does not display significant deficits in sensorimotor gating processes. The present findings help to elucidate the relationship between PI3K/AKT/mTOR hyperactivation and sensory reactivity.

                Background The topic of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in civil and commercial contexts presents a contemporary legal challenge aimed at fostering equitable solutions. Among ADR methods, mediation stands out for its ability to reduce time, costs, and litigation duration. This study explores the conceptual framework, essential conditions, and procedural aspects of mediation. It evaluates the sufficiency, regulation, and effectiveness of mediation principles in conflict resolution and risk mitigation. Methods This study is conducted through a comprehensive review of current literature on Alternative Dispute Resolution methods, with a particular focus on mediation as an alternative to dispute settlement. The study utilizes qualitative analysis techniques to examine the effectiveness of mediation principles and their application in resolving civil and commercial disputes. Comparative analyses are also conducted to extract useful insights from various legal systems and authorities. Results The study provides an analysis that illustrates the effectiveness of mediation in resolving disputes, emphasizing its potential benefits in terms of time and cost savings, as well as its srole in facilitating amicable resolutions. The results of this study shall contribute to the current body of knowledge on mediation and provide practical recommendations for its application in diverse legal contexts. Conclusion In conclusion, the study proposes strategies to enhance mediation practices, promote a culture of its adoption, and integrate it more closely into the judicial system. Additionally, it anticipates the future effectiveness of mediation in jurisdictions lacking comprehensive legislation, drawing from successful Western experiences to guide potential developments in Arab legal frameworks.

                Frankel et al. define a cell-intrinsic mechanism for the initiation of presynaptic assembly driven by the active zone scaffold protein SYD-1. Localized to the plasma membrane via interactions with PIP2, SYD-1 recruits the cell-adhesion molecule neurexin to nascent presynapses, initiating presynaptic stabilization and maturation.

                During NK cell activation, lytic granules (LGs) converge to the MTOC, enabling precision in cytotoxicity. Pedroza et al. demonstrate that GCC2 maintains convergence via tethering LGs to the Golgi. Absence of GCC2 leads to LG dispersion, non-directed degranulation, and bystander killing, and biallelic missense variants result in human NK cell deficiency.
