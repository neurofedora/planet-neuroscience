                Background Previous research has shown that popular names have become less popular over time. Simultaneously, accumulated evidence has indicated that names have become more diverse. However, the association between these two phenomena was unclear. This association should be revealed for a better understanding of names and naming practices. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between the popularity and diversity of names. Methods I analyzed the data provided in a previous study in the U.K., which included complete records of all live births between 1996 and 2016 (N = 12,985,140). Results I found that the correlations between diversity and popularity indicators were highly negative, showing that they are conceptually strongly related. This means that when diversity is high, popularity is low. Conclusions Based on this study, we can predict one indicator from the other indicator. Because raw data on names are generally difficult to collect, this prediction is useful for understanding names and naming practices.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07721">From empirical brain networks towards modeling music perception -- a perspective</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.07721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This perspective article investigates how auditory stimuli influence neural network dynamics using the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model and empirical brain connectivity data. Results show that synchronization is sensitive to both the frequency and amplitude of auditory input, with synchronization enhanced when input frequencies align with the system's intrinsic frequencies. Increased stimulus amplitude broadens the synchronization range governed by a delicate interplay involving the network's topology, the spatial location of the input, and the frequency characteristics of the cortical input signals. This perspective article also reveals that brain activity alternates between synchronized and desynchronized states, reflecting critical dynamics and phase transitions in neural networks. Notably, gamma-band synchronization is crucial for processing music, with coherence peaking in this frequency range. The findings emphasize the role of structural connectivity and network topology in modulating synchronization, providing insights into how music perception engages brain networks. This perspective article offers a computational framework for understanding neural mechanisms in music perception, with potential implications for cognitive neuroscience and music psychology.

                arXiv:2504.07824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visualizations are vital for communicating scientific results. Historically, neuroimaging figures have only depicted regions that surpass a given statistical threshold. This practice substantially biases interpretation of the results and subsequent meta-analyses, particularly towards non-reproducibility. Here we advocate for a "transparent thresholding" approach that not only highlights statistically significant regions but also includes subthreshold locations, which provide key experimental context. This balances the dual needs of distilling modeling results and enabling informed interpretations for modern neuroimaging. We present four examples that demonstrate the many benefits of transparent thresholding, including: removing ambiguity, decreasing hypersensitivity to non-physiological features, catching potential artifacts, improving cross-study comparisons, reducing non-reproducibility biases, and clarifying interpretations. We also demonstrate the many software packages that implement transparent thresholding, several of which were added or streamlined recently as part of this work. A point-counterpoint discussion addresses issues with thresholding raised in real conversations with researchers in the field. We hope that by showing how transparent thresholding can drastically improve the interpretation (and reproducibility) of neuroimaging findings, more researchers will adopt this method.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15174">A stochastic explanation for observed local-to-global foraging states in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2309.15174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abrupt changes in behavior can often be associated with changes in underlying behavioral states. When placed off food, the foraging behavior of C. elegans can be described as a change between an initial local-search behavior characterized by a high rate of reorientations, followed by a global-search behavior characterized by sparse reorientations. This is commonly observed in individual worms, but when numerous worms are characterized, only about half appear to exhibit this behavior. We propose an alternative model that predicts both abrupt and continuous changes to reorientation that does not rely on behavioral states. This model is inspired by molecular dynamics modeling that defines the foraging reorientation rate as a decaying parameter. By stochastically sampling from the probability distribution defined by this rate, both abrupt and gradual changes to reorientation rates can occur, matching experimentally observed results. Crucially, this model does not depend on behavioral states or information accumulation. Even though abrupt behavioral changes do occur, they may not necessarily be indicative of abrupt changes in behavioral states, especially when abrupt changes are not universally observed in the population.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07152">Evolutionary Generation of Random Surreal Numbers for Benchmarking</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.07152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many areas of scientific endeavour where large, complex datasets are needed for benchmarking. Evolutionary computing provides a means towards creating such sets. As a case study, we consider Conway's Surreal numbers. They have largely been treated as a theoretical construct, with little effort towards empirical study, at least in part because of the difficulty of working with all but the smallest numbers. To advance this status, we need efficient algorithms, and in order to develop such we need benchmark data sets of surreal numbers. In this paper, we present a method for generating ensembles of random surreal numbers to benchmark algorithms. The approach uses an evolutionary algorithm to create the benchmark datasets where we can analyse and control features of the resulting test sets. Ultimately, the process is designed to generate networks with defined properties, and we expect this to be useful for other types of network data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07157">GAAPO: Genetic Algorithmic Applied to Prompt Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.07157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, with their performance heavily dependent on the quality of input prompts \cite{schulhoff2025promptsurvey} \cite{sahoo2025promptengineering}. While prompt engineering has proven effective, it typically relies on manual adjustments, making it time-consuming and potentially suboptimal. This paper introduces GAAPO (Genetic Algorithm Applied to Prompt Optimization), a novel hybrid optimization framework that leverages genetic algorithm \cite{dejong1988gen} principles to evolve prompts through successive generations. Unlike traditional genetic approaches that rely solely on mutation and crossover operations, GAAPO integrates multiple specialized prompt generation strategies within its evolutionary framework. Through extensive experimentation on diverse datasets including ETHOS, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA, our analysis reveals several important point for the future development of automatic prompt optimization methods: importance of the tradeoff between the population size and the number of generations, effect of selection methods on stability results, capacity of different LLMs and especially reasoning models to be able to automatically generate prompts from similar queries... Furthermore, we provide insights into the relative effectiveness of different prompt generation strategies and their evolution across optimization phases. These findings contribute to both the theoretical understanding of prompt optimization and practical applications in improving LLM performance.

                arXiv:2504.07213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of studies that combine Evolutionary Machine Learning and self-supervised learning has been growing steadily in recent years. Evolutionary Machine Learning has been shown to help automate the design of machine learning algorithms and to lead to more reliable solutions. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, has produced good results in learning useful features when labelled data is limited. This suggests that the combination of these two areas can help both in shaping evolutionary processes and in automating the design of deep neural networks, while also reducing the need for labelled data. Still, there are no detailed reviews that explain how Evolutionary Machine Learning and self-supervised learning can be used together. To help with this, we provide an overview of studies that bring these areas together. Based on this growing interest and the range of existing works, we suggest a new sub-area of research, which we call Evolutionary Self-Supervised Learning and introduce a taxonomy for it. Finally, we point out some of the main challenges and suggest directions for future research to help Evolutionary Self-Supervised Learning grow and mature as a field.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) that balances exploration and exploitation. While evolutionary algorithms (EAs) show promise in HPO, they often struggle with effective exploitation. To address this, we integrate a linear surrogate model into a genetic algorithm (GA), allowing for smooth integration of multiple strategies. This combination improves exploitation performance, achieving an average improvement of 1.89 percent (max 6.55 percent, min -3.45 percent) over existing HPO methods.

                arXiv:2504.07453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the challenges of limited Battery Swap Stations datasets, high operational costs, and fluctuating user charging demand, this research proposes a probability estimation model based on charging pile data and constructs nine scenario-specific battery swap demand datasets. In addition, this study combines Least Recently Used strategy with Genetic Algorithm and incorporates a guided search mechanism, which effectively enhances the global optimization capability. Thus, a dual-factor decision-making based charging schedule optimization system is constructed. Experimental results show that the constructed datasets exhibit stable trend characteristics, adhering to 24-hour and 168-hour periodicity patterns, with outlier ratios consistently below 3.26%, confirming data validity. Compared to baseline, the improved algorithm achieves better fitness individuals in 80% of test regions under the same iterations. When benchmarked against immediate swap-and-charge strategy, our algorithm achieves a peak cost reduction of 13.96%. Moreover, peak user satisfaction reaches 98.57%, while the average iteration time remains below 0.6 seconds, demonstrating good computational efficiency. The complete datasets and optimization algorithm are open-sourced at https://github.com/qingshufan/GA-EVLRU.

                arXiv:2504.07884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on mixed-variable black-box optimization (MV-BBO), addressing continuous, integer, and categorical variables. Many real-world MV-BBO problems involve dependencies among these different types of variables, requiring efficient methods to optimize them simultaneously. Recently, stochastic optimization methods leveraging the mechanism of the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy have shown promising results in mixed-integer or mixed-category optimization. However, such methods cannot handle the three types of variables simultaneously. In this study, we propose CatCMA with Margin (CatCMAwM), a stochastic optimization method for MV-BBO that jointly optimizes continuous, integer, and categorical variables. CatCMAwM is developed by incorporating a novel integer handling into CatCMA, a mixed-category black-box optimization method employing a joint distribution of multivariate Gaussian and categorical distributions. The proposed integer handling is carefully designed by reviewing existing integer handlings and following the design principles of CatCMA. Even when applied to mixed-integer problems, it stabilizes the marginal probability and improves the convergence performance of continuous variables. Numerical experiments show that CatCMAwM effectively handles the three types of variables, outperforming state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods and baselines that simply incorporate existing integer handlings into CatCMA.

                arXiv:2504.07221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rising computational and energy demands of artificial intelligence systems urge the exploration of alternative software and hardware solutions that exploit physical effects for computation. According to machine learning theory, a neural network-based computational system must exhibit nonlinearity to effectively model complex patterns and relationships. This requirement has driven extensive research into various nonlinear physical systems to enhance the performance of neural networks. In this paper, we propose and theoretically validate a reservoir computing system based on a single bubble trapped within a bulk of liquid. By applying an external acoustic pressure wave to both encode input information and excite the complex nonlinear dynamics, we showcase the ability of this single-bubble reservoir computing system to forecast complex benchmarking time series and undertake classification tasks with high accuracy. Specifically, we demonstrate that a chaotic physical regime of bubble oscillation proves to be the most effective for this kind of computations.

Abstract: Hebbian learning limits Hopfield network storage capacity (pattern-to-neuron ratio around 0.14). We propose Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) learning. Unlike linear methods, KLR uses kernels to implicitly map patterns to high-dimensional feature space, enhancing separability. By learning dual variables, KLR dramatically improves storage capacity, achieving perfect recall even when pattern numbers exceed neuron numbers (up to ratio 1.5 shown), and enhances noise robustness. KLR demonstrably outperforms Hebbian and linear logistic regression approaches.

                arXiv:2502.03148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mutation process in evolution strategies has been interlinked with the normal distribution since its inception. Many lines of reasoning have been given for this strong dependency, ranging from maximum entropy arguments to the need for isotropy. However, some theoretical results suggest that other distributions might lead to similar local convergence properties. This paper empirically shows that a wide range of evolutionary strategies, from the (1+1)-ES to CMA-ES, show comparable optimization performance when using a mutation distribution other than the standard Gaussian. Replacing it with, e.g., uniformly distributed mutations, does not deteriorate the performance of ES, when using the default adaptation mechanism for the strategy parameters. We observe that these results hold not only for the sphere model but also for a wider range of benchmark problems.

Abstract: Going beyond 'dendritic democracy', we introduce a 'democracy of local processors', termed Cooperator. Here we compare their capabilities when used in permutation invariant neural networks for reinforcement learning (RL), with machine learning algorithms based on Transformers, such as ChatGPT. Transformers are based on the long standing conception of integrate-and-fire 'point' neurons, whereas Cooperator is inspired by recent neurobiological breakthroughs suggesting that the cellular foundations of mental life depend on context-sensitive pyramidal neurons in the neocortex which have two functionally distinct points. Weshow that when used for RL, an algorithm based on Cooperator learns far quicker than that based on Transformer, even while having the same number of parameters.

                arXiv:2407.04752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters have improved performance in various applications, but their inference processes demand significant energy and computational resources. In contrast, the human brain, with approximately 86 billion neurons, is much more energy-efficient than LLMs with similar parameters. Inspired by this, we redesign 7$\sim$70 billion parameter LLMs using bio-plausible spiking mechanisms, emulating the efficient behavior of the human brain. We propose the first spiking large language model, SpikeLLM. Coupled with the proposed model, two essential approaches are proposed to improve spike training efficiency: Generalized Integrate-and-Fire (GIF) neurons to compress spike length from $T$ to $\frac{T}{L} \log_2 L$ bits, and an Optimal Brain Spiking framework to divide outlier channels and allocate different $T$ for GIF neurons, which further compresses spike length to approximate $log_2T$ bits. The necessity of spike-driven LLM is proved by comparison with quantized LLMs with similar operations. In the OmniQuant pipeline, SpikeLLM reduces 11.01% WikiText2 perplexity and improves 2.55% accuracy of common scene reasoning on a LLAMA-7B W4A4 model. In the GPTQ pipeline, SpikeLLM achieves direct additive in linear layers, significantly exceeding PB-LLMs.

                arXiv:2504.05761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept drift and extreme verification latency pose significant challenges in data stream learning, particularly when dealing with recurring concept changes in dynamic environments. This work introduces a novel method based on the Growing Neural Gas (GNG) algorithm, designed to effectively handle abrupt recurrent drifts while adapting to incrementally evolving data distributions (incremental drifts). Leveraging the self-organizing and topological adaptability of GNG, the proposed approach maintains a compact yet informative memory structure, allowing it to efficiently store and retrieve knowledge of past or recurring concepts, even under conditions of delayed or sparse stream supervision. Our experiments highlight the superiority of our approach over existing data stream learning methods designed to cope with incremental non-stationarities and verification latency, demonstrating its ability to quickly adapt to new drifts, robustly manage recurring patterns, and maintain high predictive accuracy with a minimal memory footprint. Unlike other techniques that fail to leverage recurring knowledge, our proposed approach is proven to be a robust and efficient online learning solution for unsupervised drifting data flows.

Participants performed a reaction time task in a magnetic resonance scanner while being exposed to face and place stimuli with a distinct probabilistic distribution resulting in unexpected omissions and unexpected presentations of those stimuli. Participants’ responses were significantly faster for expected as compared to neutral or unexpected trials, showing that they learned the statistical regularities inherent to the task. Moreover, the region of interest analysis of beta estimates extracted from the fusiform face area and the parahippocampal place area revealed co-occurring negative and positive prediction error signals. This was evidenced by increases in brain activation for unexpected omissions and unexpected presentations of visual stimuli when compared to expected stimuli. Our results also underlined that these effects occur independently of stimulus repetition effects. Altogether, these findings support a predictive coding model of cognition, highlighting the importance of considering the potential dual nature of expectation violations.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>General cognitive ability (GCA), also called “general intelligence,” is thought to depend on network properties of the brain, which can be quantified through graph theoretic measures such as small worldness and module degree. An extensive set of studies examined links between GCA and graphical properties of resting state connectomes. However, these studies often involved small samples, applied just a few graph theory measures in each study, and yielded inconsistent results, making it challenging to identify the architectural underpinnings of GCA. Here, we address these limitations by systematically investigating univariate and multivariate relationships between GCA and 17 whole-brain and node-level graph theory measures in individuals from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 5937). We demonstrate that whole-brain graph theory measures, including small worldness and global efficiency, fail to exhibit meaningful relationships with GCA. In contrast, multiple node-level graphical measures, especially module degree (within-network connectivity), exhibit strong associations with GCA. We establish the robustness of these results by replicating them in a second large sample, the Human Connectome Project (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 847), and across a variety of modeling choices. This study provides the most comprehensive and definitive account to date of complex interrelationships between GCA and graphical properties of the brain’s intrinsic functional architecture.</span>

A total of 54 bilingual pairs were randomly assigned to interactive or noninteractive conditions and learned words via 9-grid picture matrices. The results revealed higher accuracy in picture selection for interactive learners during the learning phase. During the testing phase, participants in the interactive condition demonstrated significantly higher accuracy than those in the noninteractive condition. Both conditions showed significant inter-brain synchrony (IBS), but interactive learners had greater inter-brain synchrony than noninteractive in the somatosensory association cortex and right supramarginal gyrus. inter-brain synchrony level positively predicted test scores for interactive learners.

                <p>Human motor skill acquisition is improved by performance feedback, and coupling such feedback with extrinsic reward (such as money) can enhance skill learning. However, the neurophysiology underlying such behavioral effect is unclear. To bridge this gap, we assessed the effects of reward on multiple forms of motor plasticity during skill learning. Sixty-five healthy participants divided into three groups performed a pinch-grip skill task with sensory feedback only, sensory and reinforcement feedback, or both feedback coupled with an extrinsic monetary reward during skill training. To probe motor plasticity, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation at rest, on the left primary motor cortex before, at an early-training time point, and after training in the three groups and measured motor-evoked potentials from task-relevant muscle of the right arm. This allowed us to evaluate the amplitude and variability of corticospinal output, GABAergic short-intracortical inhibition, and use-dependent plasticity before training and at two additional time points (early and end training). At the behavioral level, monetary reward accelerated skill learning. In parallel, corticospinal output became less variable early on during training in the presence of extrinsic reward. Interestingly, this effect was particularly pronounced for participants who were more sensitive to reward, as evaluated in an independent questionnaire. Other measures of motor excitability remained comparable across groups. These findings highlight that a mechanism underlying the benefit of reward on motor skill learning is the fine-tuning of early-training resting-state corticospinal variability.</p>

                <p>Perceptual decision-making describes the process of selecting an appropriate action based on the sensory information present in the immediate environment and is hence an omnipresent factor in the life of animals. In preclinical research, a widespread approach to study the neuronal correlates of perceptual decision-making is to record (and manipulate) neuronal activity in head-fixed mice performing behavioral tasks. In contrast to the technologies used to record/manipulate neuronal activity, standardization of the behavioral training of mice is generally neglected, a circumstance that is particularly true for behavioral tasks involving auditory stimuli. Here, we present the DMC-Behavior Platform, an open-source, cost-efficient framework for training head-fixed mice in perceptual decision-making tasks involving auditory stimuli. Combining the DMC-Behavior Platform with strategies to record and manipulate neuronal activity offers many opportunities to test hypotheses on the neuronal underpinnings of cognitive processes. We demonstrate the utility of the platform by training mice on auditory variants of three behavioral tasks commonly used to study perceptual decision-making: a detection, a Go/NoGo, and a two-alternative forced choice task. The presented work establishes the seamless integration and synchronization of external devices to record neuronal activity, task-related, and nontask-related behavioral variables. Our platform provides a valuable tool for more standardized and reproducible investigations into the neuronal circuits underlying auditory-guided decision-making.</p>

                <p>Humans can adapt their movements in response to expected and unexpected perturbations. The speed and accuracy of these movement corrections may depend on the type of sensory information driving the perception of these perturbations. While previous research has indicated that corrections based on somatosensory information, comprised of proprioceptive and tactile inputs, are faster than corrections based on visual information, other studies have found comparable correction speeds in response to visual and tactile inputs. The purpose of this study was to systematically investigate the latencies (how fast) and magnitudes (how large) of movement corrections in response to perturbations of external visual targets, as well as somatosensory (proprioceptive and tactile) and tactile targets on the non-reaching limb. Participants performed reaching movements to a light-emitting diode (i.e., visual target), the felt position of a brush touching the index finger of the non-reaching hand (i.e., a tactile target), and the index finger of their non-reaching hand (somatosensory target). During some trials, the target was displaced 3&nbsp;cm away or toward the participant either before or after the movement onset. Participants demonstrated faster and larger corrections to somatosensory target perturbations than to visual or tactile target perturbations. However, corrections to visual targets were more accurate than corrections to tactile targets. These findings support the hypothesis that distinct sensorimotor processes may underlie the adjustments made in response to somatosensory information versus those made in response to visual and tactile information.</p>

                Background Metastatic dissemination is critically reliant on the formation of a receptive niche, a process which is thought to rely on signals derived from the primary tumor. Lymph nodes are continuously exposed to such signals through the flow of afferent lymph, allowing the potential reprograming of lymphoid tissue stroma in support of metastases or immunosuppression. The objective of this study was therefore to better characterize tumor-driven transcriptomic changes occurring to specific stromal populations within the tumor-draining lymph node. Methods We utilize single cell RNA sequencing of dissociated LN tissue extracted from tumor-bearing and naïve mice to profile the reprograming of tissue stroma within the pre-metastatic lymph node. Results Resulting data provides transcriptomic evidence of tumor-induced imprinting on marginal reticular cells (MRCs) and floor lymphatic endothelial cells (fLECs) populating the subcapsular sinus. These alterations appear to be unique to the tumor-draining LN and are not observed during inflammatory antigenic challenge. Notably, MRCs exhibit characteristics reminiscent of early desmoplastic CAF differentiation, fLECs engage distinct chemoattractant pathways thought to facilitate recruitment of circulating cancer cells, and both stromal populations exhibit signs of metabolic reprograming and immune-modulating potential. Conclusions Cumulatively, these findings build upon existing literature describing pre-metastatic niche formation and offer several promising avenues for future exploration.

                Background The number of overweight people (BMI 25–29.9kg.m-2) in the world is increasing, which increases the risk of health problems and psychological difficulties. To reduce these risks, it is imperative to address unhealthy habits including food and exercise. This qualitative study aimed to explore the needs, perceptions, and preferences of overweight individuals on tailored exercise programs that incorporate educational videos. Methodology Forty Individuals between the age of 18-30 years with a BMI of 25-29.9kg.m-2 were included in the study using Purposive sampling from October 2023 to November 2023. Semi-structured in-depth interview was conducted for 45-60 minutes approximately among both active and inactive overweight individuals by a researcher trained in qualitative research. These interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was performed using inductive and deductive approaches to identify the recurrent patterns, themes, and insights in the transcribed interviews. Results 8 themes, such as lifestyle factors, exercise explorations, holistic wellbeing and 44 subthemes emerged from the analysis, helping to shed light on the needs, perceptions, and preferences that overweight individuals experience when it comes to their preference for a customized exercise program provided through educational video. The participants wanted personalized regimens that catered to their requirements and levels of fitness. Conclusion In summary, the findings emphasize the value of educational videos that are easy to use, visually appealing, and supported by science. These videos should emphasize technique, varying levels of difficulty, and brief sessions.

                <p>by Sorenza P. Bastiaens, Davide Momi, John D. Griffiths</p>

The electroencephalographic alpha rhythm is one of the most robustly observed and widely studied empirical phenomena in all of neuroscience. However, despite its extensive implication in a wide range of cognitive processes and clinical pathologies, the mechanisms underlying alpha generation in neural circuits remain poorly understood. In this paper we offer a renewed foundation for research on this question, by undertaking a systematic comparison and synthesis of the most prominent theoretical models of alpha rhythmogenesis in the published literature. We focus on four models, each studied intensively by multiple authors over the past three decades: (i) Jansen-Rit, (ii) Moran-David-Friston, (iii) Robinson-Rennie-Wright, and (iv) Liley-Wright. Several common elements are identified, such as the use of second-order differential equations and sigmoidal potential-to-rate operators to represent population-level neural activity. Major differences are seen in other features such as wiring topologies and conduction delays. Through a series of mathematical analyses and numerical simulations, we nevertheless demonstrate that the selected models can be meaningfully compared, by associating parameters and circuit motifs of analogous biological significance. With this established, we conduct explorations of rate constant and synaptic connectivity parameter spaces, with the aim of identifying common patterns in key behaviours, such as the role of excitatory-inhibitory interactions in the generation of oscillations. Finally, using linear stability analysis we identify two qualitatively different alpha-generating dynamical regimes across the models: (i) noise-driven fluctuations and (ii) self-sustained limit-cycle oscillations, emerging due to an Andronov-Hopf bifurcation. The comprehensive survey and synthesis developed here can, we suggest, be used to help guide future theoretical and experimental work aimed at disambiguating these and other candidate theories of alpha rhythmogenesis.

                <p>by James B. Grotberg, Francesco Romanò, John C. Grotberg</p>

The air-blood barrier protects the lung from blood/serum entering the air spaces, i.e., from “drowning in your own fluids”. Failure leads to pulmonary edema, a regularly fatal complication during the Covid-19 pandemic which claimed 7 million lives worldwide. Finding no mathematical models for the underlying fluid mechanics, we created the first. Governing flow equations for alveolar capillary, interstitium, and alveolus are coupled by crossflows at the capillary and epithelial membranes and end-exit flows to the lymphatics. Case examples include normal/recovery, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, effects of positive end expiratory pressure, and a wide range of parameter values for permeability of the membranes and interstitial matrix. Previously unknown membrane fluid shear stresses calculate to values that affect cell function in many systems. We add active epithelial reabsorption which has two effects: shifting streamlines to favor alveolar-lymphatic clearance and adding to the direct alveolar-capillary clearance. Simple algebraic equations are derived for the interstitial fluid pressure, p<sub>i</sub>, membrane crossflow velocities and the critical capillary pressure, p<sub>crit</sub>, above which edema occurs. For validation, the p<sub>crit</sub> predictions fit clinical definitions and flow calculations of lymphatic vs capillary clearance match animal experimental data. For decades the value of p<sub>i</sub> has been imposed as an input, whereas we calculate the value as an output. They don’t agree. Since the space is too small for measurements, the ability to calculate p<sub>i</sub> and p<sub>crit</sub> offers new insights, questions long-held beliefs, and opens applications from physiological studies to personalized clinical care.

Despite hosting some of the highest concentrations of biodiversity and providing invaluable goods and services in the oceans, coral reefs are under threat from global change and other local human impacts. Changes in living ecosystems often induce changes in their acoustic characteristics, but despite recent efforts in passive acoustic monitoring of coral reefs, rapid measurement and identification of changes in their soundscapes remains a challenge. Here we present the new open-source software <i>CoralSoundExplorer</i>, which is designed to study and monitor coral reef soundscapes. <i>CoralSoundExplorer</i> uses machine learning approaches and is designed to eliminate the need to extract conventional acoustic indices. To demonstrate <i>CoralSoundExplorer</i>’s functionalities, we use and analyze a set of recordings from three coral reef sites, each with different purposes (undisturbed site, tourist site and boat site), located on the island of Bora-Bora in French Polynesia. We explain the <i>CoralSoundExplorer</i> analysis workflow, from raw sounds to ecological results, detailing and justifying each processing step. We detail the software settings, the graphical representations used for visual exploration of soundscapes and their temporal dynamics, along with the analysis methods and metrics proposed. We demonstrate that <i>CoralSoundExplorer</i> is a powerful tool for identifying disturbances affecting coral reef soundscapes, combining visualizations of the spatio-temporal distribution of sound recordings with new quantification methods to characterize soundscapes at different temporal scales.

                <p>by Jan Felix, Steven De Munck, J. Fernando Bazan, Savvas N. Savvides</p>

Activation of Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK) by their cognate cytokines ALKAL2 and ALKAL1 plays important roles in development, metabolism, and cancer. Recent structural studies revealed ALK/LTK-cytokine assemblies with distinct stoichiometries. Structures of ALK-ALKAL2 and LTK-ALKAL1 complexes with 2:1 stoichiometry determined by X-ray crystallography contrasted the 2:2 ALK-ALKAL2 complexes determined by cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography. Here, we show based on reanalysis of the cryo-EM data deposited in EMPIAR-10930 that over half of the ALK-ALKAL2 particles in the dataset are classified into 2D and 3D classes obeying a 2:1 stoichiometry besides the originally reported structure displaying 2:2 stoichiometry. Unlike particles representing the 2:2 ALK-ALKAL2 complex, particles for the 2:1 ALK-ALKAL2 complex suffer severely from preferred orientations that resulted in cryo-EM maps displaying strong anisotropy. Here, we show that extensive particle orientation rebalancing in cryoSPARC followed by 3D refinement with Blush regularization in RELION constitutes an effective strategy for avoiding map artifacts relating to preferred particle orientations and report a 3D reconstruction of the 2:1 ALK-ALKAL2 complex to 3.2 Å resolution from EMPIAR-10930. This new cryo-EM structure together with the crystal structures of ALK-ALKAL2 and LTK-ALKAL1 complexes with 2:1 stoichiometry reconciles a common receptor dimerization mode for ALK and LTK and provides direct evidence for the presence of an ALK-ALKAL2 complex with 2:1 stoichiometry next to the reported 2:2 stoichiometric assembly in the EMPIAR-10930 dataset. Finally, our analysis emphasizes the importance of public deposition of raw cryo-EM data to allow reanalysis and interpretation.

                <p>by Masak Takaine, Rikuri Morita, Yuto Yoshinari, Takashi Nishimura</p>

De novo purine synthesis (DPS) is up-regulated under conditions of high purine demand to ensure the production of genetic materials and chemical energy, thereby supporting cell proliferation. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing DPS remain unclear. We herein show that PRPP amidotransferase (PPAT), the rate-limiting enzyme in DPS, forms dynamic and motile condensates in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cells under a purine-depleted environment. The formation and maintenance of condensates requires phase separation, which is driven by target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1)-induced ribosome biosynthesis. The self-assembly of PPAT molecules facilitates condensate formation, with intracellular PRPP and purine nucleotides both regulating this self-assembly. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that clustering-mediated PPAT activation occurs through intermolecular substrate channeling. Cells unable to form PPAT condensates exhibit growth defects, highlighting the physiological importance of condensation. These results indicate that PPAT condensation is an adaptive mechanism that regulates DPS in response to both TORC1 activity and cellular purine demands.

We use our tongue much like our hands: to interact with objects and transport them. For example, we use our hands to sense properties of objects and transport them in the nearby space, and we use our tongue to sense properties of food morsels and transport them through the oral cavity. But what does the cerebellum contribute to control of tongue movements? Here, we trained head-fixed marmosets to make skillful tongue movements to harvest food from small tubes that were placed at sharp angles to their mouth. We identified the lingual regions of the cerebellar vermis and then measured the contribution of each Purkinje cell (P-cell) to control of the tongue by relying on the brief but complete suppression that they experienced following an input from the inferior olive. When a P-cell was suppressed during protraction, the tongue’s trajectory became hypermetric, and when the suppression took place during retraction, the tongue’s return to the mouth was slowed. Both effects were amplified when two P-cells were simultaneously suppressed. Moreover, these effects were present even when the pauses were not due to the climbing fiber input. Therefore, suppression of P-cells in the lingual vermis disrupted the forces that would normally decelerate the tongue as it approached the target. Notably, the population simple spike activity peaked near deceleration onset when the movement required precision (aiming for a tube), but not when the movement was for the purpose of grooming. Thus, the P-cells appeared to signal when to stop protrusion as the tongue approached its target.

Understanding how specific secretory cargoes are targeted to distinct domains of the plasma membrane in epithelial cells requires analyzing the trafficking of post-Golgi vesicles to their sites of secretion. We used the RUSH (retention using selective hooks) system to synchronously release an apical cargo, Cadherin 99C (Cad99C), and a basolateral cargo, the ECM protein Nidogen, from the endoplasmic reticulum and follow their movements to the plasma membrane. We also developed an interactive vesicle tracking framework, MSP-tracker and viewer, that exploits developments in computer vision and deep learning to determine vesicle trajectories in a noisy environment without the need for extensive training data. MSP-tracker outperformed other tracking software in detecting and tracking post-Golgi vesicles, revealing that Cad99c vesicles predominantly move apically with a mean speed of 1.1µm/sec. This is reduced to 0.85 µm/sec by a dominant slow dynein mutant, demonstrating that dynein transports Cad99C vesicles to the apical cortex. Furthermore, both the dynein mutant and microtubule depolymerization cause lateral Cad99C secretion. Thus, microtubule organization plays a central role in targeting apical secretion, suggesting that <i>Drosophila</i> does not have distinct apical versus basolateral vesicle fusion machinery. Nidogen vesicles undergo planar-polarized transport to the leading edge of follicle cells as they migrate over the ECM, whereas most Collagen is secreted at trailing edges. The follicle cells therefore bias secretion of different ECM components to opposite sides of the cell, revealing that the secretory pathway is more spatially organized than previously thought.

DeWitt, Pekka Kujala, Suzanne van Dijk, Judith Klumperman, Avi Ashkenazi</p>

Endoplasmic-reticulum resident inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1) supports protein homeostasis via its cytoplasmic kinase-RNase module. Known cancer dependency on IRE1 entails its enzymatic activation of the transcription factor XBP1s and regulated RNA decay. We discovered that some cancer cells surprisingly require IRE1 but not its enzymatic activity. IRE1 knockdown but not enzymatic IRE1 inhibition or XBP1 disruption attenuated cell cycle progression and tumor growth. IRE1 silencing led to activation of TP53 and CDKN1A/p21 in conjunction with increased DNA damage and chromosome instability, while decreasing heterochromatin as well as DNA and histone H3K9me3 methylation. Immunoelectron microscopy detected endogenous IRE1 at the nuclear envelope. Thus, cancer cells co-opt IRE1 either enzymatically or nonenzymatically, which has significant implications for IRE1’s biological role and therapeutic targeting.

                <p>by Jelena Trajkovic, Domenica Veniero, Simon Hanslmayr, Satu Palva, Gabriela Cruz, Vincenzo Romei, Gregor Thut</p>

Adaptive visual processing is enabled through the dynamic interplay between top-down and bottom-up (feedback/feedforward) information exchange, presumably propagated through brain oscillations. Here, we causally tested for the oscillatory mechanisms governing this interaction in the human visual system. Using concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation-electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), we emulated top-down signals by a single TMS pulse over the frontal eye field (right FEF), while manipulating the strength of sensory input through the presentation of moving concentric gratings (compared to a control-TMS site). FEF-TMS without sensory input led to a top-down modulated occipital phase realignment, alongside higher fronto-occipital phase connectivity, in the alpha/beta band. Sensory input in the absence of FEF-TMS increased occipital gamma activity. Crucially, testing the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes (FEF-TMS during sensory input) revealed an increased nesting of the bottom-up gamma activity in the alpha/beta-band cycles. This establishes a causal link between phase-to-power coupling and top-down modulation of feedforward signals, providing novel mechanistic insights into how attention interacts with sensory input at the neural level, shaping rhythmic sampling.

                <p>by Deepika Dogra, Van Anh Phan, Sinan Zhang, Cezar Gavrilovici, Nadia DiMarzo, Ankita Narang, Kingsley Ibhazehiebo, Deborah M. Kurrasch</p>

<i>SLC13A5</i> encodes a citrate transporter highly expressed in the brain and is important for regulating intra- and extracellular citrate levels. Mutations in this gene cause rare infantile epilepsy characterized by lifelong seizures, developmental delays, behavioral deficits, poor motor progression, and language impairments. SLC13A5 individuals respond poorly to treatment options; yet drug discovery programs are limited due to a paucity of animal models that phenocopy human symptoms. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create loss-of-function mutations in <i>slc13a5a</i> and <i>slc13a5b</i>, the zebrafish paralogs to human <i>SLC13A5</i>. <i>slc13a5</i> mutant larvae showed cognitive dysfunction and sleep disturbances, consistent with SLC13A5 individuals. These mutants also exhibited fewer neurons and a concomitant increase in apoptosis across the optic tectum, a region important for sensory processing. Further, <i>slc13a5</i> mutants displayed hallmark features of epilepsy, including an imbalance in glutamatergic and GABAergic excitatory-inhibitory gene expression, increased <i>fosab</i> expression, disrupted neurometabolism, and neuronal hyperexcitation as measured in vivo by extracellular field recordings and live calcium imaging. Mechanistically, we tested the involvement of NMDA signaling and zinc chelation in <i>slc13a5</i> mutant epilepsy-like phenotypes. Slc13a5 protein co-localizes with excitatory NMDA receptors in wild-type zebrafish and NMDA receptor expression is upregulated in the brain of <i>slc13a5</i> mutant larvae. Additionally, low levels of zinc are found in the plasma membrane of <i>slc13a5</i> mutants. NMDA receptor suppression and ZnCl<sub>2</sub> treatment in <i>slc13a5</i> mutant larvae rescued neurometabolic and hyperexcitable calcium events, as well as behavioral defects. These data provide empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis that excess extracellular citrate over-chelates the zinc ions needed to regulate NMDA receptor function, leading to sustained channel opening and an exaggerated excitatory response that manifests as seizures. These data show the utility of <i>slc13a5</i> mutant zebrafish for studying SLC13A5 epilepsy and open new avenues for drug discovery.

                Background Next-generation sequencing necessitates a minimum quantity and concentration of DNA/RNA samples, typically achieved through amplification using the PCR technique. However, this amplification step introduces several drawbacks to biological insights, including PCR bias and the loss of epigenetic information. The advent of long-read sequencing technologies facilitates direct sequencing, with the primary constraint being the limited amount of DNA/RNA present in biological samples. Methods Here, we present a novel method called Noise-Augmented Direct (NAD) sequencing that enables the direct sequencing of target DNA even when it falls below the minimum quantity and concentration required for long-read sequencing by augmenting with noise DNA and adaptive sampling. Adaptive sampling is an emerging technology of nanopore sequencing, allowing the enhanced sequencing of target DNA by selectively depleting noise DNA. In this study, we use the DNA standard of the Lambda phage genome as the noise DNA to augment samples containing low amounts of bacterial genomes (1 ng to 300 ng). Results The results with cost-effective flow cells indicate that NAD sequencing successfully detects the target DNA with an input quantity as low as 1 ng, and the bacterial genome of Salmonella enterica can be assembled to 30% completion at an accuracy of 98% with an input quantity of 3 ng. With high throughput flow cells, the bacterial genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assembled to near completion (99.9%) at an accuracy of 99.97% with an input quantity of 300 ng. Conclusions This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the potential of NAD sequencing in enhancing the robustness of long-read sequencing for small input DNA/RNA samples with noise augmentation and adaptive sampling.

                Background This study explores the pivotal role of women entrepreneurs in fostering economic growth and social transformation, focusing on micro and small enterprises (MSEs). Despite the significant rise in women entrepreneurship, challenges persist, including gender-based barriers, limited access to capital, and regional disparities. Understanding these dynamics is essential for formulating policies that support and empower women entrepreneurs. Method The present study employed a systematic literature review (SLR) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an advanced topic modeling technique, to identify prevalent themes within the literature. Data was extracted from Scopus-indexed journals (2000–2024), systematically filtered, and analyzed to uncover key patterns in women entrepreneurship research. Results The analysis identifies four central themes: (1) Women in Entrepreneurship and Gender Roles, (2) Small Business and Women Enterprises, (3) Social Impact of Women Entrepreneurs, and (4) Challenges Faced by Female Entrepreneurs. The findings highlight the transformative potential of digital platforms in enhancing business opportunities for women and addressing traditional constraints, such as mobility and market access. Conclusion This study highlights the need for targeted interventions to enhance digital literacy, bridge socio-cultural disparities, and establishing inclusive policies that foster a supportive entrepreneurial ecosystem. By synthesizing existing literature, this research provides actionable recommendations for policymakers, financial institutions, and stakeholders to strengthen women-led enterprises and drive gender-equitable growth.

                Background Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) has improved diagnosis and treatment planning in paediatric dentistry, but no bibliometric studies have examined the research landscape. This study provides an overview regarding the role of CBCT in paediatric dentistry. Methods A bibliometric review was conducted using articles from the Web of Science database. The search was performed on 22 February 2024, including publications up to that date. Conference papers and editorials were excluded. Data extracted included citation counts, publication dates, journals, impact factors, study designs, topics, geographical and institutional affiliations, authors, and keywords. Collaborative networks were visualised using VOSviewer, and Spearman’s correlation assessed the relationship between citation counts and other variables. Results The review analysed 517 articles, with the most cited receiving 557 citations. Publication dates ranged from 2005 to 2024, with a peak in 2023. Observational studies were the most common, particularly on maxillary expansion. The American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics was the most cited journal, and the USA was a major contributor. Jacobs R authored the most articles (n=19), and the University of Alberta led in institutional output. Spearman’s correlation showed a weak positive correlation between citation count and journal impact factor (rho=0.272, p<0.001) and a strong negative correlation with publication year (rho=-0.762, p<0.001). Conclusions This bibliometric review provides an overview of the use of CBCT in paediatric dentistry, particularly in maxillary expansion. The findings suggest that more specific imaging protocols may improve safety and clinical outcomes, and that further investigation of long-term outcomes may provide valuable insights.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-164/v2?src=rss">Development of a machine learning predictive model for early detection of breast cancer [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, with over 7.8 million cases reported in the last five years. Early detection and accurate classification are crucial for reducing mortality rates and improving outcomes. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative tool in medical imaging, enabling more efficient and accurate diagnostic processes. Objective This study aims to develop a machine learning-based predictive model for early detection and classification of breast cancer using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. Methods The dataset, comprising 569 samples and 32 features derived from fine needle aspirate biopsy images, was pre-processed through data cleaning, normalization using the Robust Scaler, and feature selection. Five supervised ML algorithms—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification (SVC) with linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernels, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—were implemented. Models were evaluated using performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 scores. Results The SVC-RBF model demonstrated the highest accuracy (98.68%) and balanced performance across other metrics, making it the most effective classifier for distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. Key features such as texture mean and area (worst) significantly contributed to classification accuracy. Conclusions This study highlights the potential of ML algorithms, particularly SVC-RBF, to revolutionize breast cancer diagnostics through improved accuracy and efficiency. Future research should validate these findings with diverse datasets and explore their integration into clinical workflows to enhance decision-making and patient care.

     alt="Label-Free Multiphoton Imaging Reveals Volumetric Shifts Across Development in Sensory-Related Brain Regions of a Miniature Transparent Vertebrate"/>
<p>Third harmonic generation microscopy, a multiphoton imaging modality, reveals the relative volume or investment (RI) in sensory-related brain regions across development in <i>Danionella dracula</i>, a miniature teleost fish with a body and brain that remains transparent throughout life. RI in higher-order, multimodal integration centers such as the telencephalon increases as juveniles transition to adulthood. By contrast, RI in modality-dominant regions is essentially stable over development, as in the olfactory bulb, or is greatest prior to the juvenile–adult transition, as in the optic tectum.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Animals integrate information from different sensory modalities as they mature and perform increasingly complex behaviors. This may parallel differential investment in specific brain regions depending on the changing demands of sensory inputs. To investigate developmental changes in the volume of canonical sensory regions, we used third harmonic generation imaging for morphometric analysis of forebrain and midbrain regions from larval through juvenile and adult stages in <i>Danionella dracula</i>, a transparent, miniature teleost fish whose brain is optically accessible throughout its lifespan. Relative to whole-brain volume, increased volume or investment in the telencephalon, a higher order sensory integration center, shows the most dramatic increases between 30–60 days postfertilization (dpf) and again at 90 dpf as animals reach adulthood. The torus longitudinalis (TL), a midbrain visuomotor integration center, also significantly increases between 60 and 90 dpf. In contrast, investment in the midbrain optic tectum (TeO), a retinal-recipient target, progressively decreases from 30 to 90 dpf, whereas investment is relatively consistent across all stages for the midbrain torus semicircularis (TS), a secondary auditory and mechanosensory lateral line center, and the olfactory bulb (OB), a direct target of the olfactory epithelium. In sum, increased investment in higher-order integration centers (telencephalon, TL) occurs as juveniles reach adulthood (60–90 dpf) and exhibit more complex cognitive tasks, whereas investment in modality-dominant regions occurs earlier (TeO) or is relatively consistent across development (TS, OB). Complete optical access throughout <i>Danionella</i>’s lifespan provides a unique opportunity to investigate how changing brain structure over development correlates with changes in connectivity, microcircuitry, or behavior.</p>

                Han et al. show that subtle differences in the flexible outer layer of misfolded α-synuclein fibrils influence their capacity to spread pathology in the brain. This study uncovers the unrecognized critical role of fibrils’ fuzzy outer region in pathological transmission, suggesting a new therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders.

                Glogowska et al. show that pressure-induced opening of the mechanosensitive Piezo1 cationic channel in macrophages is potentiated by a chronic treatment with oxLDL or 7-ketocholesterol, while acutely inhibited by DHA.

                Harrington et al. identified that the ribosomal factor EMG1 is involved in formation of specialized ribosomes during KSHV lytic replication. Its methyltransferase activity is responsible for preferential translation of KSHV ORFs. Depletion of EMG1 results in enhanced translation of KSHV uORFs, resulting in reduced viral late protein production.

                Pregnancy significantly challenges thermal homeostasis. Ladyman et al. show that a warm-responding neuronal population in the preoptic area expresses prolactin receptors. Deletion of prolactin receptors from these neurons causes hyperthermia during pregnancy and litter loss after birth, suggesting that prolactin action provides resilience to thermal challenges during pregnancy.

                Damiani et al. show that CDKL5 deficiency disorder mouse models have an altered gut microbiota composition. Targeting intestinal microbes through antibiotics improves behavior, visual responses, and microglia phenotype. Finally, a causal link between the CDKL5 KO microbiota and the observed phenotype is demonstrated through fecal transplantation into WT recipient mice.

                Lei et al. show that HLS1 negatively regulates plant senescence and the ABS3-mediated senescence pathway by interacting with ATG8 and attenuating the ABS3-ATG8 interaction and the ability of ABS3 to promote senescence. Their study provides insights into the functional link between HLS1, ABS3, and ATG8 in plant senescence regulation.

Bacteroidota, Planctomycetota, and Verrucomicrobiota show substrate-specific activity, with pullulan being a key substrate. These findings advance the understanding of bacterial roles in carbon cycling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97313">Allosteric modulation by the fatty acid site in the glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike</a></h4>

              
                The spike protein is essential to the SARS-CoV-2 virus life cycle, facilitating virus entry and mediating viral-host membrane fusion. The spike contains a fatty acid (FA) binding site between every two neighbouring receptor-binding domains. This site is coupled to key regions in the protein, but the impact of glycans on these allosteric effects has not been investigated. Using dynamical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (D-NEMD) simulations, we explore the allosteric effects of the FA site in the fully glycosylated spike of the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral variant. Our results identify the allosteric networks connecting the FA site to functionally important regions in the protein, including the receptor-binding motif, an antigenic supersite in the N-terminal domain, the fusion peptide region, and another allosteric site known to bind heme and biliverdin. The networks identified here highlight the complexity of the allosteric modulation in this protein and reveal a striking and unexpected link between different allosteric sites. Comparison of the FA site connections from D-NEMD in the glycosylated and non-glycosylated spike revealed that glycans do not qualitatively change the internal allosteric pathways but can facilitate the transmission of the structural changes within and between subunits.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102433">STAMBPL1 activates the GRHL3/HIF1A/VEGFA axis through interaction with FOXO1 to promote angiogenesis in triple-negative breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                In the clinic, anti-tumor angiogenesis is commonly employed for treating recurrent, metastatic, drug-resistant triple-negative, and advanced breast cancer. Our previous research revealed that the deubiquitinase STAMBPL1 enhances the stability of MKP-1, thereby promoting cisplatin resistance in breast cancer. In this study, we discovered that STAMBPL1 could upregulate the expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF1α in breast cancer cells. Therefore, we investigated whether STAMBPL1 promotes tumor angiogenesis. We demonstrated that STAMBPL1 increased <i>HIF1A</i> transcription in a non-enzymatic manner, thereby activating the HIF1α/VEGFA signaling pathway to facilitate triple-negative breast cancer angiogenesis. Through RNA-seq analysis, we identified the transcription factor GRHL3 as a downstream target of STAMBPL1 that is responsible for mediating <i>HIF1A</i> transcription. Furthermore, we discovered that STAMBPL1 regulates <i>GRHL3</i> transcription by interacting with the transcription factor FOXO1. These findings shed light on the role and mechanism of STAMBPL1 in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, offering novel targets and avenues for the treatment of triple-negative and advanced breast cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103064">Integrator complex subunit 12 knockout overcomes a transcriptional block to HIV latency reversal</a></h4>

              
                The latent HIV reservoir is a major barrier to HIV cure. Combining latency reversal agents (LRAs) with differing mechanisms of action such as AZD5582, a non-canonical NF-kB activator, and I-BET151, a bromodomain inhibitor is appealing toward inducing HIV-1 reactivation. However, even this LRA combination needs improvement as it is inefficient at activating proviruses in cells of people living with HIV (PLWH). We performed a CRISPR screen in conjunction with AZD5582 & I-BET151 and identified a member of the Integrator complex as a target to improve this LRA combination, specifically Integrator complex subunit 12 (INTS12). Integrator functions as a genome-wide attenuator of transcription that acts on elongation through its RNA cleavage and phosphatase modules. Knockout of INTS12 improved latency reactivation at the transcriptional level and is more specific to the HIV-1 provirus than AZD5582 & I-BET151 treatment alone. We found that INTS12 is present on chromatin at the promoter of HIV and therefore its effect on HIV may be direct. Additionally, we observed more RNAPII in the gene body of HIV only with the combination of INTS12 knockout with AZD5582 & I-BET151, indicating that INTS12 induces a transcriptional elongation block to viral reactivation. Moreover, knockout of INTS12 increased HIV-1 reactivation in CD4 T cells from virally suppressed PLWH ex vivo, and we detected viral RNA in the supernatant from CD4 T cells of all three virally suppressed PLWH tested upon INTS12 knockout, suggesting that INTS12 prevents full-length HIV RNA production in primary T cells. Finally, we found that INTS12 more generally limits the efficacy of a variety of LRAs with different mechanisms of action.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98554">Transplantation of exogenous mitochondria mitigates myocardial dysfunction after cardiac arrest</a></h4>

              
                The incidence of post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction (PAMD) is high, and there is currently no effective treatment available. This study aims to investigate the protective effects of exogenous mitochondrial transplantation in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Exogenous mitochondrial transplantation can enhance myocardial function and improve the survival rate. Mechanistic studies suggest that mitochondrial transplantation can limit impairment in mitochondrial morphology, augment the activity of mitochondrial complexes II and IV, and raise ATP level. As well, mitochondrial therapy ameliorated oxidative stress imbalance, reduced myocardial injury, and thus improved PAMD after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101885">Mechanistic insight for T-cell exclusion by cancer-associated fibroblasts in human lung cancer</a></h4>

              
                The tumor stroma consists mainly of extracellular matrix, fibroblasts, immune cells, and vasculature. Its structure and functions are altered during malignancy: tumor cells transform fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts, which exhibit immunosuppressive activities on which growth and metastasis depend. These include exclusion of immune cells from the tumor nest, cancer progression, and inhibition of T-cell-based immunotherapy. To understand these complex interactions, we measure the density of different cell types in the stroma using immunohistochemistry techniques on tumor samples from lung cancer patients. We incorporate these data into a minimal dynamical system, explore the variety of outcomes, and finally establish a spatio-temporal model that explains the cell distribution. We reproduce that cancer-associated fibroblasts act as a barrier to tumor expansion, but also reduce the efficiency of the immune response. Our conclusion is that the final outcome depends on the parameter values for each patient and leads to either tumor invasion, persistence, or eradication as a result of the interplay between cancer cell growth, T-cell cytotoxicity, and fibroblast activity. However, despite the existence of a wide range of scenarios, distinct trajectories, and patterns allow quantitative predictions that may help in the selection of new therapies and personalized protocols.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99210">Trade-offs in modeling context dependency in complex trait genetics</a></h4>

              
                Genetic effects on complex traits may depend on context, such as age, sex, environmental exposures, or social settings. However, it remains often unclear if the extent of context dependency, or gene-by-environment interaction (GxE), merits more involved models than the additive model typically used to analyze data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here, we suggest considering the utility of GxE models in GWAS as a trade-off between bias and variance parameters. In particular, we derive a decision rule for choosing between competing models for the estimation of allelic effects. The rule weighs the increased estimation noise when context is considered against the potential bias when context dependency is ignored. In the empirical example of GxSex in human physiology, the increased noise of context-specific estimation often outweighs the bias reduction, rendering GxE models less useful when variants are considered independently. However, for complex traits, we argue that the joint consideration of context dependency across many variants mitigates both noise and bias. As a result, polygenic GxE models can improve both estimation and trait prediction. Finally, we exemplify (using GxDiet effects on longevity in fruit flies) how analyses based on independently ascertained ‘top hits’ alone can be misleading, and that considering polygenic patterns of GxE can improve interpretation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106332">Active vision of bees in a simple pattern discrimination task</a></h4>

              
                Active vision, the sensory-motor process through which animals dynamically adjust visual input to sample and prioritise relevant information via photoreceptors, eyes, head, and body movements, is well-documented across species. In small-brained animals like insects, where parallel processing may be limited, active vision for sequential acquisition of visual features might be even more important. We investigated how bumblebees use active vision to distinguish between two visual patterns: a multiplication sign and its 45°-rotated variant, a plus sign. By allowing bees to freely inspect patterns, we analysed their flight paths, inspection times, velocities and regions of focus through high-speed videography. We observed that bees tended to inspect only a small region of each pattern, with a preference for lower and left-side sections, before accurately accepting target or rejecting distractor patterns. The specific pattern areas scanned differed between the plus and multiplication signs, yet flight behaviour remained consistent and specific to each pattern, regardless of whether the pattern was rewarding or punishing. Transfer tests showed that bees could generalise their pattern recognition to partial cues, maintaining scanning strategies and selective attention to learned regions. These findings highlight active vision as a crucial aspect of bumblebees' visual processing, where selective scanning behaviours during flight enhance discrimination accuracy and enable efficient environmental analysis and visual encoding.

">DTX4 regulates neural progenitor transitions during cortical development</a></h4>

              
                Neural progenitors drive cellular diversification in the neocortex. Prolongation of their proliferative capacity and increased diversity underpins the evolutionary expansion and morphological complexity of the human neocortex. Here, we investigate the mechanisms that regulate maintenance of the highly proliferative early neural progenitor subtypes and transition to subsequent progenitors of limited proliferative capacity during human and murine neocortical development. We identify DTX4, a Deltex family member, as an evolutionarily conserved molecular determinant of neural progenitor identity in the mammalian neocortex. DTX4 sustains the identity of radial glia, a highly proliferative progenitor subtype. Loss of DTX4, on the other hand, is a prerequisite for the generation of intermediate progenitors which possess low proliferative capacity. Perturbing DTX4 expression in human cerebral organoids and in the murine neocortex, alters progenitor composition, thereby inducing changes in neuronal diversity and cortical morphology. Mechanistically, we reveal that DTX4 controls progenitor identity by regulating the length of the cell cycle. Our findings underscore the critical role of cell cycle dynamics and of DTX4 in determining progenitor identity and thereby defining neuronal outcome during mammalian development.

                Tropomyosins (Tpm) are master regulators of actin dynamics through forming co-polymers with filamentous actin. Despite the well-understood function of muscle Tpms in the contractile apparatus of muscle cells, much less is known about the diverse physiological function of cytoplasmic Tpms in eukaryotic cells. Here, we investigated the role of the Tpm4.2 isoform in neuronal processes including signaling, neurite outgrowth and receptor recycling using primary neurons from Tpm4.2 knock-out mice. Live imaging of calcium and electrophysiology data demonstrated increased frequency, yet reduced strength of single neuron spikes. Calcium imaging further showed increase in neuronal networks. In vitro assays of Tpm4.2 knock-out neurons displayed impaired recycling of the AMPA neurotransmitter receptor subunit GluA1. Morphometric analysis of neurite growth showed increased dendritic complexity and altered dendritic spine morphology in Tpm4.2 knock-out primary neurons. Behavioral analysis of Tpm4.2 knock-out mice displayed heightened anxiety in Open field test whilst Elevated Plus maze displayed heightened anxiety only in females. A sex-dependent phenotype was also seen in the Social Preference test with impaired social memory and socialization in female Tpm4.2 knock-out mice, whilst male and female knock-out mice had impaired recognition memory in a Novel Object Recognition test. Our study depicts the multi-faceted role of the Tpm4.2 isoform and its co-polymer F-actin population in neurons, with potential im-plications for better understanding diseases of the nervous system which involve actin cytoskeleton dysfunction.

">Glycogen metabolism acts in neurons to support glycolytic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Glycogen is the largest energy reserve in the brain, but the specific role of glycogen in supporting neuronal energy metabolism in vivo is not well understood. We established a system in C. elegans to dynamically probe glycolytic states in single cells of living animals via the use of the glycolytic sensor HYlight and determined that neurons can dynamically regulate glycolysis in response to activity or transient hypoxia. We performed an RNAi screen and identified that PYGL-1, an ortholog of the human glycogen phosphorylase, is required in neurons for glycolytic plasticity. We determined that neurons employ at least two mechanisms of glycolytic plasticity: glycogen-dependent glycolytic plasticity (GDGP) and glycogen-independent glycolytic plasticity (GIGP). We uncover that GDGP is employed under conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction, such as transient hypoxia or in mutants for mitochondrial function. We find that the ability of neurons to plastically regulate glycolysis through cell-autonomous GDGP is important for sustaining the synaptic vesicle cycle. Together, our study reveals that, in vivo, neurons can directly use glycogen as a fuel source to sustain glycolytic plasticity and synaptic function.

">α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors regulate radial glia fate in the developing human cortex</a></h4>

              
                Prenatal nicotine exposure impairs fetal cortical grey matter volume, but the precise cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study elucidates the role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in progenitor cells and radial glia (RG) during human cortical development. We identify two nAChR subunits, CHRNA7 and the human-specific CHRFAM7A expressed in SOX2+ progenitors and neurons, with CHRFAM7A particularly enriched along RG endfeet. nAChR activation in organotypic slices and dissociated cultures increases RG proliferation while decreasing neuronal differentiation, whereas nAChR knockdown reduces RG and increases neurons. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that nicotine exposure downregulates key genes in excitatory neurons (ENs), with CHRNA7 or CHRFAM7A selectively modulating these changes, suggesting an evolutionary divergence in regulatory pathways. Furthermore, we identify YAP1 as a critical downstream effector of nAChR signaling, and inhibiting YAP1 reverses nicotine-induced phenotypic alterations in oRG cells, highlighting its role in nicotine-induced neurodevelopmental pathophysiology.

">Feedback-Feedforward Dynamics Shape De Novo Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                Humans excel at adjusting movements and acquiring new skills through feedback corrections and predictive control, yet how these feedback-feedforward computations evolve in the motor system remains unclear. We investigated this process by examining how humans learned a novel, continuous visuomotor mirror reversal (MR) tracking task over multiple days. Using a frequency-dependent system-identification approach and responses to cursor perturbations, we dissociated feedback-driven corrections from predictive feedforward adjustments. Our findings reveal two distinct learning pathways: early learning relies on rapid, corrective feedback at lower frequencies, while feedforward control gradually emerges at higher frequencies, compensating for feedback limitations. These findings suggest that motor learning involves a dynamic interplay between feedback and feedforward control, providing mechanistic insights into sensorimotor learning, with implications for optimizing motor skill acquisition and neurorehabilitation strategies

">Brain pericytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells retain vascular and phagocytic functions under hypoxia</a></h4>

              
                The integrity and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are largely regulated by pericytes. Pericyte deficiency leads to BBB breakdown and neurological dysfunction in major neurological disorders including stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Transplantation of pericytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-PC) has been shown to restore the BBB and improve functional recovery in mouse models of stroke and pericyte deficiency. However, the molecular profile and functional properties of iPSC-PC under hypoxic conditions, similar to those found in ischemic and neurodegenerative diseases remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that iPSC-PC under severe hypoxia retain essential functional properties, including key molecular markers, proliferation rates, and the ability to migrate to host brain vessels via function-associated PDGFRB-PDGFBB signaling. Additionally, we show that iPSC-PC exhibit similar clearance of amyloid betaneurotoxins from AD mouse brain sections under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. These findings suggest that iPSC-PC functions are largely resilient to hypoxia, highlighting their potential as a promising cell source for treating ischemic and neurodegenerative disorders.

">Differences in Cajal-Retzius cell density and postnatal persistence across cortical areas revealed by a novel intersectional genetic labeling approach</a></h4>

              
                Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells are glutamatergic neurons that transiently populate the most superficial layer of the isocortex and allocortex during development, serving an essential role during both prenatal and early postnatal brain development. Notably, these cells disappear from most cortical areas by postnatal day 14, but persist for much longer in the hippocampus. We developed a novel intersectional genetic labeling approach for CR cells that captures almost all of the TRP73-positive CR cells throughout the isocortex and allocortex. This intersectional strategy offers several advantages over previous methods commonly used for CR cell targeting. Here, we applied this new CR cell labeling strategy to investigate the distribution and persistence of CR cells throughout the whole mouse brain, at four different postnatal ages. We observed that the initial CR cell density and the rate of their disappearance varies substantially across different brain areas during development. Strikingly, we observed variation in cell death rate even between adjacent cortical subregions: comparing the medial and the lateral entorhinal cortex, the former retains a high density of CR cells for several months in contrast to the latter. Our results present a necessary revision of the phenomenon of CR cell persistence, showing that, in addition to hippocampus, several other cortical areas maintain a high density of these cells beyond the first two postnatal weeks.

">Homeostatic regulation across fast and slow timescales through aggregate synaptic dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Learned information and experiences are thought to be stored in synapses, composed of building block molecules whose number typically correlates with synaptic strength. Activity-dependent plasticity mechanisms, such as Hebbian learning, regulate these building blocks, promoting synaptic growth to encode acquired knowledge. However, this process can destabilize cortical networks through overexcitation, leading to runaway dynamics. To prevent such instabilities the brain uses compensatory mechanisms like synaptic scaling. Existing models rely on rapid timescales, contradicting experimental observations that synaptic scaling occurs slowly. Here, we introduce aggregate scaling, a simple framework to study synapse-mediated homeostasis based on the availability and competitive redistribution of synaptic building blocks. Our model enforces stability by integrating rapid regulation of the total synaptic strength and firing rate homeostasis over much slower, realistic timescales. It preserves key neuronal properties, such as firing activity around a homeostatic set-point, long-tailed distributions of synaptic weights, and response to brief stimulation.

">V1 superficial layers create a saliency map that feeds forward to the parietal cortex for attentional guidance</a></h4>

              
                A salient visual object with a distinct feature from the surrounding environment automatically captures attention. While the saliency signals have been found in many brain regions, their source remains highly controversial. Here, we investigated the neural origin of visual saliency using cortical layer-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of cerebral blood volume (CBV) at 7 Tesla. Behaviorally, human observers were better at detecting foreground bars with a larger orientation contrast from uniformly oriented background bars. Saliency-sensitive signals were strongest in the superficial layers of the primary visual cortex (V1), and in the middle layers of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) of the parietal cortex. Layer-dependent effective connectivity revealed the transmission of saliency signals along the feedforward pathway from V1 to IPS. Furthermore, behavioral sensitivity to the foreground stimulus correlated significantly with the fMRI response in the superficial layers of V1. Our findings provide mesoscale evidence that a visual saliency map is created by iso-feature suppression through lateral inhibition in the superficial layers of V1, and then feeds forward to attentional control brain regions to guide attention and eye movements.

">Vesicle-mediated oxytocin release drives melanocortin circuit maturation during a neonatal critical period</a></h4>

              
                The hypothalamus is crucial for regulating essential bodily functions, including energy balance. It is an exceedingly complex and heterogeneous brain region that contains a variety of neuronal systems that are interconnected with each other. Among these, the melanocortin system, which comprises pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, displays a remarkable anatomical relationship with oxytocin (OT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVH). Here, we demonstrate that OT neurons are instrumental in the development of the melanocortin system. Chemogenetic inhibition of OT neurons during the first postnatal week selectively disrupts POMC and AgRP projections to the PVH, without affecting other target nuclei like the dorsomedial nucleus. This developmental role is age-dependent, as silencing OT neurons in juvenile or adult stages has no impact on melanocortin circuits. OT neurons release various neuropeptides and neurotransmitters, and their secretion can be modulated by chemogenetic manipulation. Expressing the botulinum toxin serotype B light chain in OT neurons reveals that their developmental actions rely on SNARE-mediated exocytosis. Moreover, administering an OT receptor antagonist during the first postnatal week leads to similar melanocortin circuit defects and long-term metabolic effects. Furthermore, neonatal chemogenetic activation of OT neurons rescues POMC circuit deficits in a mouse model of Prader-Willi Syndrome. These findings reveal that OT acts as a paracrine neurotrophic factor orchestrating the development of melanocortin circuits during a restricted neonatal critical period.

">Transcription factor LHX2 suppresses astrocyte proliferation in the postnatal mammalian cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                In the developing cerebral cortex astrocytes arise from progenitors in the ventricular and subventricular zones (V-SVZ), and also from local proliferation within the parenchyma. In the mouse neocortex, astrocytes that occupy upper versus deep layers (UL/DL) are known to be distinct populations in terms of molecular and morphological features. Transcription factor LHX2 is expressed both in V-SVZ gliogenic progenitors and in differentiated astrocytes throughout development and into adulthood. Here we show that loss of Lhx2 at birth results in an increased astrocyte proliferation in UL but not the DL of the cortex in the first postnatal week. Consistent with this, transcriptomic signatures of UL astrocytes increase. By 3 months, Lhx2 mutant astrocytes display upregulation of GFAP, and transcriptomic signatures associated with reactive astrocytes, in the absence of injury. These results demonstrate a novel role for Lhx2 in regulating proliferation and molecular features of cortical astrocytes.

">Synapses drive local mitochondrial ATP synthesis to fuel plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Our brain constantly forms new memories and stabilizes existing memories. To achieve such cognitive flexibility, the brain is wired by plastic synapses that are hotspots of energy consumption. Supplying energy to distant synapses is challenging as they are distributed throughout dendrites and axons, spanning hundreds of microns from their cell body. Synapses, therefore, require an instant and local energy supply provided by mitochondria stabilized near dendritic spines. However, the mechanisms by which synapses communicate their energy demands to locally stable mitochondria to drive local energy production and sustain synaptic plasticity is unknown. Using highly sensitive spine- and mitochondrial ATP reporters and two-photon glutamate uncaging to stimulate individual spines, we find that synaptic plasticity input drives instant and sustained increase in spine ATP levels, provided by local ATP synthesis in ~10-20 m spatially confined compartments within mitochondria. This spatially localized mitochondrial ATP generation is driven by a spatially localized mitochondrial calcium influx independent of the endoplasmic reticulum. Notably, the initial spine ATP increase, supported by local mitochondrial ATP synthesis, is independent of CaMKII and the energy demands of spine structural plasticity. Without local calcium signaling and mitochondrial stabilization, synapses do not meet their instant and sustained energy needs, resulting in synaptic plasticity defects, as observed in neurological disorders.

                Atypical sensory processing in neurodevelopmental disorders contributes to cognitive, social, and behavioural disruptions, yet underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. Using a mouse model of SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency (HET), a common monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism, we investigated visual processing deficits. Syngap HET mice exhibited impaired behavioural visual discriminability, associated with reduced coding precision for visual stimuli in the primary visual cortex (V1). Notably, intrinsic properties of V1 neurons and visual responses under anaesthesia were unaltered, suggesting behavioural state-dependent disruptions in awake Syngap HET mice. Supporting this, both mice and individuals with SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency exhibited larger pupil size during visual stimulation, implicating neuromodulatory dysfunction. Targeting noradrenergic tone systemically with an 2-adrenergic receptor agonist restored V1 coding precision in Syngap HET mice. Our findings reveal neuromodulatory dysregulation as a novel mechanism underlying sensory disruptions in SYNGAP1-related disorder, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for addressing sensory impairments in neurodevelopmental disorders.

">The representation of regularity and randomness in auditory cortex of awake rats</a></h4>

              
                Auditory cortex possesses a remarkable ability to discriminate between tone sequences with different levels of statistical regularities. To examine this phenomenon at the level of single neurons, we recorded responses from auditory cortex of awake rats. The rats passively listened to multitone sequences composed of 4, 5 or 6 tones. The tones could be presented in periodic sequences with a fixed, repeated cycle; in a fully random condition; or in an intermediate condition in which cycles were maintained but tones were randomly permuted within each cycle (random cycle condition). Units showed a continuum of preferences between order-preferring neurons and randomness-preferring neurons. Unexpectedly, we found sensitivity to the position of sounds in the cycle ('phase modulation'). The strongest and most consistent phase modulations were in the responses to the random cycle condition. Finally, we show how such sensitivities may emerge from a simple, biologically-plausible computation.

">Lateral Hypothalamic Glutamate and GABA Neurons Cooperatively Shape Striatum-Wide Dopamine Dynamics During Consumption</a></h4>

              
                The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) contains GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons that converge on the midbrain dopamine system and exert opposing influences on consummatory feeding behavior. However, the activity dynamics of these populations during consumption and their impact on striatal dopamine release remain poorly understood. Here, we show that LHA GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons independently scale their activity during the consumption of rewarding and aversive solutions while cooperatively regulating dopamine release along the anterior-posterior axis of the striatum in mice. Dopamine release exhibited widespread modulation during consumption, with anterior striatal regions showing stronger representation of solution value and its recent history - an effect dependent on LHA activity. These findings suggest that the LHA acts as a central regulator of striatal dopamine release during consumption, providing a mechanism through which hypothalamic circuits influence motivational and consummatory behaviors.

                A central challenge in Alzheimers disease is understanding the mechanism of neuronal secretory dysfunction. By exploiting AI, we reveal how beta-amyloid disrupts key protein interactions within the neuronal secretory machinery. In a combinatorial strategy of reprogramming the neuronal secretory and metabolic components, we established a dual-target therapeutic framework that repairs synaptic and mitochondrial defects to counteract neurodegeneration in Alzheimers.

                <p>Despite their widespread use, we have limited knowledge of the mechanisms by which sedatives mediate their effects on brain-wide networks. This is, in part, due to the technical challenge of observing activity across large populations of neurons in normal and sedated brains. In this study, we examined the effects of the sedative dexmedetomidine, and its antagonist atipamezole, on spontaneous brain dynamics and auditory processing in zebrafish larvae, a stage when sex differentiation has not yet occurred. Our brain-wide, cellular-resolution calcium imaging reveals the brain regions involved in these network-scale dynamics and the individual neurons that are affected within those regions. Further analysis reveals a variety of dynamic changes in the brain at baseline, including marked reductions in spontaneous activity, correlation, and variance. The reductions in activity and variance represent a "quieter" brain state during sedation, an effect inducing highly correlated evoked activity in the auditory system to stand out more than it does in unsedated brains. We also observe a reduction in the persistence of auditory information across the brain during sedation, suggesting that the removal of spontaneous activity leaves the core auditory pathway free of impingement from other nonauditory information. Finally, we describe a less dynamic brain-wide network during sedation, with a higher energy barrier and a lower probability of brain state transitions during sedation. Overall, our brain-wide, cellular-resolution analysis shows that sedation leads to a quieter, more stable, and less dynamic brain and, that against this background, responses across the auditory processing pathway become sharper and more prominent.</p>

                <p><I>The Journal of Neuroscience</I> launched an open peer review (OPR) initiative in late 2023 to enhance transparency and accountability in scientific publishing. Analysis of 740 manuscripts and 1,490 reviews revealed that 81.4% of authors opted to share rebuttal letters, with increasing participation over time (67.6% in Dec 2023 to 94.4% in Aug 2024). Reviewer participation was lower (66.8%) but stable, with higher opt-in rates for longer, higher-quality reviews. Geographical analysis of author and reviewer institutions showed that authors from North American and European institutions had greater OPR opt-in rates, authors from Asian institutions had lower opt-in rates, and reviewers from North American institutions had lower opt-in rates compared with the average rates across regions. Further, analysis of manuscript subdiscipline showed it to be predictive of OPR opt-in rates, e.g., authors of manuscripts in cellular or molecular neuroscience were less likely to opt-in compared with the average across subdisciplines. Overall, OPR acceptance is growing, reflecting a positive shift toward open science.</p>

                <p>Probabilistic reinforcement learning (RL) tasks assay how individuals make decisions under uncertainty. The use of internal models (model-based) or direct learning from experiences (model-free), and the degree of choice stochasticity across alternatives (i.e., exploration), can all be influenced by the state space of the decision-making task. There is considerable individual variation in the balance between model-based and model-free control during decision-making, and this balance is affected by incentive motivation. The effect of variable reward incentives on the arbitration between model-based and model-free learning remains understudied, and individual differences in neural signatures and cognitive traits that moderate the effect of reward on model-free/model-based control are unknown. Here we combined a two-stage decision-making task utilizing differing reward incentives with computational modeling, neuropsychological tests, and neuroimaging to address these questions. Results showed the prospect of greater reward decreased exploration of alternative options and increased the balance toward model-based learning. These behavioral effects were replicated across two independent datasets including both sexes. Individual differences in processing speed and analytical thinking style affected how reward altered the dependence on both systems. Using a systems neuroscience-inspired approach to resting-state functional connectivity, we found reduced exploration of the options during the first stage of our task under high relative to low incentives was predicted by increased cross-network coupling between ventral and dorsal RL circuitry. These findings suggest that integrity of functional connections between stimulus valuation (ventral) and action valuation (dorsal) RL networks is associated with changes in the balance between explore&ndash;exploit decisions under changing reward incentives.</p>

                <p>Value-based decision&ndash;making involves multiple cortical and subcortical brain areas, but the distributed nature of neurophysiological activity underlying economic choices in the human brain remains largely unexplored. Specifically, the nature of the neurophysiological representation of reward-guided choices, as well as whether they are represented in a subset of reward-related regions or in a more distributed fashion, is unknown. Here, we hypothesize that reward choices, as well as choice-related computations (win probability, risk), are primarily represented in high-frequency neural activity reflecting local cortical processing and that they are highly distributed throughout the human brain, engaging multiple brain regions. To test these hypotheses, we used intracranial recordings from multiple areas (including orbitofrontal, lateral prefrontal, parietal, cingulate cortices as well as subcortical regions such as the hippocampus and amygdala) from neurosurgical patients of both sexes playing a decision-making game. We show that high-frequency activity (HFA;  and HFA) represents both individual choice-related computations (e.g., risk, win probability) and choice information with different prevalence and regional representation. Choice-related computations are locally and unevenly present in multiple brain regions, whereas choice information is widely distributed and more prevalent and appears later across all regions examined. These results suggest brain-wide reward processing, with local HFA reflecting the coalescence of choice-related information into a final choice, and shed light on the distributed nature of neural activity underlying economic choices in the human brain.</p>

                <p>Auditory deficits are a well-known symptom in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. The noncompetitive <I>N</I>-methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine has been used to model sensory and cognitive deficits in nonhuman primates, but its whole-brain effects remain largely unknown. Here we employed ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging at 9.4&nbsp;T in awake male and female marmoset monkeys (<I>Callithrix jacchus</I>) to compare brain activations to conspecific vocalizations, scrambled vocalizations, and nonvocal sounds following the administration of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine. Our findings reveal a broad suppression of activations across auditory regions following ketamine compared with saline. Additionally, we observed differential effects depending on the type of sound, with notable changes in the mediodorsal thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex, particularly during the processing of vocalizations. These findings suggest a potential overlap between the effects of ketamine and neural disruptions observed in schizophrenia, particularly affecting vocalization processing.</p>

                <p>Seminal studies in animal neuroscience demonstrate that frontostriatal circuits exhibit a ventral&ndash;dorsal functional gradient to integrate neural functions related to reward processing and cognitive control. Prominent neurodevelopmental models posit that heightened reward seeking and risk taking during adolescence result from maturational imbalances between frontostriatal neural systems underlying reward processing and cognitive control. The present study investigated whether the development of ventral (VS) and dorsal (DS) striatal resting-state connectivity (rsFC) networks along this proposed functional gradient relates to putative imbalances between reward and executive systems posited by a dual neural systems theory of adolescent development. One hundred sixty-three participants aged 11&ndash;25&nbsp;years (54% female, 90% white) underwent resting scans at baseline and biennially thereafter, yielding 339 scans across four assessment waves. We observed developmental increases in VS rsFC with brain areas implicated in reward processing (e.g., subgenual cingulate gyrus and medial orbitofrontal cortex) and concurrent decreases with areas implicated in executive function (EF; e.g., ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices). DS rsFC exhibited the opposite pattern. More rapid developmental increases in VS rsFC with reward areas were associated with developmental improvements in reward-based decision-making, whereas increases in DS rsFC with EF areas were associated with improved EF, though each network exhibited some crossover in function. Collectively, these findings suggest that typical adolescent neurodevelopment is characterized by a divergence in ventral and dorsal frontostriatal connectivity that may relate to developmental improvements in affective decision-making and EF.</p>

                <p>The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the linchpin of nerve-evoked muscle contraction. Broadly, the NMJ transduces nerve action potentials into muscle fiber action potentials (MFAPs). Efficient neuromuscular transmission requires cholinergic signaling, which generates endplate potentials (EPPs), and excitation, the amplification of an EPP by postsynaptic voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1.4) to generate the MFAP. Compared to the cholinergic component, the signaling pathways that organize Nav1.4 are poorly characterized. Muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), in addition to its Ig1 domain-dependent role as the main organizer of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), also binds BMPs via its Ig3 domain and shapes BMP-induced signaling. Using mice lacking the MuSK Ig3 domain ("Ig3-MuSK"), we probed the role of this domain at the NMJ. NMJs formed in Ig3-MuSK animals with pre- and postsynaptic specializations aligned at all ages examined. However, the Ig3-MuSK postsynaptic apparatus was fragmented from an early age. Synaptic electrophysiology showed that spontaneous and nerve-evoked acetylcholine release, AChR density, and endplate currents were comparable at WT and Ig3-MuSK NMJs. However, single fiber electromyography revealed that nerve-evoked MFAPs in Ig3-MuSK muscle were abnormal, exhibiting jitter and blocking. Nerve-evoked compound muscle action potentials and muscle force were also diminished. Finally, Nav1.4 levels were reduced at Ig3-MuSK NMJs, but not extrasynaptically, indicating that the observed excitability defects result from impaired synaptic localization of this ion channel. We propose distinct, domain-specific roles for MuSK at the NMJ: the Ig1 domain mediates agrin-LRP4-mediated AChR localization, while the Ig3 domain maintains postsynaptic Nav1.4 density, conferring the muscle excitability required to amplify cholinergic signals and trigger action potentials.</p>

                <p>The medial pulvinar thalamic nucleus (MPu) is an evolutionary novelty of the primate thalamus, prominently expanded in humans. Piecemeal data from studies in various monkey species indicate that MPu axons reach prefrontal, inferior parietal, cingulate, insular, or temporal areas; however, the precise wiring and functional logic of such brain-wide connections remain obscure. In marmoset monkeys (<I>Callithrix jacchus</I>) of both sexes, we visualized the axons originated from specific pulvinar domains by means of biotinylated dextran amine microinjections and compared them across multiple cases. In addition, by injecting retrograde tracers in the cortical areas targeted by the pulvinar axons, we investigated the organization of projection cells within MPu and the existence of long-range branched axons. Specific projection motifs reveal a caudal MPu subnucleus that innervates inferior and ventral temporal areas and a rostral MPu subnucleus that innervates temporal, ventral prefrontal, premotor, inferior posterior parietal, and cingulate areas. We demonstrate numerous MPu neurons that innervate through branched axons prefrontal and parietal or prefrontal and temporal areas; other cells with different projection patterns are closely intermingled with them. Our findings support the notion that MPu is a hub of the brain-wide networks that support complex visual and social cognition, sensory-guided reaching, working memory, and attention. Moreover, the finding of long-range branching MPu axons and dense terminal arborizations suggest that MPu cells may regulate functional connectivity among high-level cortical areas at different spatial scales. Besides, the anatomical "ground truth" provided by our study is relevant for functional imaging and distributed network modeling studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/15/e1845242025?rss=1">Sleep Modulates Neural Timescales and Spatiotemporal Integration in the Human Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spontaneous neural dynamics manifest across multiple temporal and spatial scales, which are thought to be intrinsic to brain areas and exhibit hierarchical organization across the cortex. In wake, a hierarchy of timescales is thought to naturally emerge from microstructural properties, gene expression, and recurrent connections. A fundamental question is timescales&rsquo; organization and changes in sleep, where physiological needs are different. Here, we describe two measures of neural timescales, obtained from broadband activity and gamma power, which display complementary properties. We leveraged intracranial electroencephalography in 106 human epilepsy patients (48 females) to characterize timescale changes from wake to sleep across the cortical hierarchy. We show that both broadband and gamma timescales are globally longer in sleep than in wake. While broadband timescales increase along the sensorimotor-association axis, gamma ones decrease. During sleep, slow waves can explain the increase of broadband and gamma timescales, but only broadband ones show a positive association with slow-wave density across the cortex. Finally, we characterize spatial correlations and their relationship with timescales as a proxy for spatiotemporal integration, finding high integration at long distances in wake for broadband and at short distances in sleep for gamma timescales. Our results suggest that mesoscopic neural populations possess different timescales that are shaped by anatomy and are modulated by the sleep/wake cycle.</p>

                <p>Auditory deviance detection, the neural process by which unexpected stimuli are identified within repetitive acoustic environments, is crucial for survival. While this phenomenon has been extensively studied in the cortex, recent evidence indicates that it also occurs in subcortical regions, including the inferior colliculus (IC). However, compared with animal studies, research on subcortical deviance detection in humans is often constrained by methodological limitations, leaving several important questions unanswered. This study aims to overcome some of these limitations by employing auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to investigate the earliest neural correlates of deviance detection in humans, with a focus on the IC. We presented healthy participants of either sex with low- and high-frequency chirps in an oddball paradigm and observed significant deviance detection effects in the ABR, specifically when low-frequency chirps were used as deviants within a context of high-frequency standards. These effects manifested as larger and faster ABRs to deviant stimuli, with the strongest responses occurring at higher stimulation rates. Our findings suggest that the human IC exhibits rapid, stimulus-specific deviance detection with differential modulation of response amplitude and latency. The data indicate that the temporal dynamics of novelty detection in humans align well with the data reported in animals, helping to bridge the gap between animal and human research. By uncovering previously unknown characteristics of subcortical deviance detection in humans, this study highlights the value of ABR recordings with excellent temporal resolution in investigating subcortical deviance detection processes.</p>

                <p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can cause impairments in spatial cognition and memory. The hippocampus is thought to support spatial cognition through the activity of place cells, neurons with spatial receptive fields. Coordinated firing of place cell populations is organized by different oscillatory patterns in the hippocampus during specific behavioral states. Theta rhythms organize place cell populations during awake exploration. Sharp wave-ripples organize place cell population reactivation during waking rest. Here, we examined the coordination of CA1 place cell populations during active behavior and subsequent rest in a rat model of FXS (<I>Fmr1</I> knock-out rats). While the organization of individual place cells by the theta rhythm was normal, the coordinated activation of sequences of place cells during individual theta cycles was impaired in <I>Fmr1</I> knock-out rats. Furthermore, the subsequent replay of place cell sequences was impaired during waking rest following active exploration. Together, these results expand our understanding of how genetic modifications that model those observed in FXS affect hippocampal physiology and suggest a potential mechanism underlying impaired spatial cognition in FXS.</p>

                <p>Determining the brain specializations unique to humans requires directly comparable anatomical information from other primates, especially our closest relatives. Human (<I>Homo sapiens</I>; m/f), chimpanzee (<I>Pan troglodytes</I>; f), and rhesus macaque (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>; m/f) white matter atlases were used to create connectivity blueprints, i.e., descriptions of the cortical gray matter in terms of the connectivity with homologous white matter tracts. This allowed a quantitative comparison of cortical organization across the species. We identified human-unique connectivity profiles concentrated in temporal and parietal cortices and hominid-unique organization in the prefrontal cortex. Functional decoding revealed human-unique hotspots correlated with language processing and social cognition. Overall, our results counter models that assign primacy to the prefrontal cortex for human uniqueness.</p>

                <p>The mammalian cochlea receives efferent feedback from the brain. Many functions for this feedback have been hypothesized, including on short timescales, such as mediating attentional states, and long timescales, such as buffering acoustic trauma. Testing these hypotheses has been impeded by an inability to make direct measurements of efferent effects in awake animals. Here, we assessed the role of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent nerve fibers on cochlear amplification by measuring organ of Corti vibratory responses to sound in both sexes of awake and anesthetized mice. We studied long-term effects by genetically ablating the efferents and/or afferents. Cochlear amplification increased with deafferentation using VGLUT3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice, but only when the efferents were intact, associated with increased activity within OHCs and supporting cells. Removing both the afferents and the efferents using VGLUT3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> Alpha9<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice did not cause this effect. To test for short-term effects, we recorded sound-evoked vibrations while using pupillometry to measure neuromodulatory brain state. We found no state dependence of cochlear amplification or of the auditory brainstem response. However, state dependence was apparent in the downstream inferior colliculus. Thus, MOC efferents upregulate cochlear amplification chronically with hearing loss, but not acutely with brain state fluctuations. This pathway may partially compensate for hearing loss while mediating associated symptoms, such as tinnitus and hyperacusis.</p>

                <p>The mechanisms through which general anesthetics induce loss of consciousness remain unclear. Previous studies have suggested that dorsal raphe nucleus serotonergic (DRN<sup>5-HT</sup>) neurons are involved in inhalational anesthesia, but the underlying neuronal and synaptic mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the role of DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons in propofol-induced anesthesia in larval zebrafish (sex undetermined at this developmental stage) using a combination of in vivo single-cell calcium imaging, two-photon laser ablation, optogenetic activation, in vivo glutamate imaging, and in vivo whole-cell recording. We found that calcium activity of DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons reversibly decreased during propofol perfusion. Ablation of DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons prolonged emergence from 30&nbsp;&micro;M propofol anesthesia, while induction times were not affected under concentrations of 1, 3, and 30&nbsp;&micro;M. Additionally, optogenetic activation of DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons strongly promoted emergence from propofol anesthesia. Propofol application to DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons suppressed both spontaneous and current injection-evoked spike firing, abolished spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, and decreased membrane input resistance. Presynaptic glutamate release events in DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons were also abolished by propofol. Furthermore, the hyperpolarization of DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons caused by propofol was abolished by picrotoxin, a GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor antagonist, which shortened emergence time from propofol anesthesia when locally applied to the DRN. Our results reveal that DRN<sup>5-HT</sup> neurons in zebrafish are involved in the emergence from propofol anesthesia by inhibiting presynaptic excitatory glutamate inputs and inducing GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor-mediated hyperpolarization.</p>

                <p>Neural circuits are refined by strengthening frequently used or advantaged synapses while eliminating redundant connections. In neonatal mice, cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are initially innervated by multiple climbing fibers (CFs) of similar strength. By postnatal day 7 (P7), one CF, the "winner," is selectively strengthened and begins dendritic translocation by P9, while both "winner" and "loser" CFs temporarily maintain somatic synapses. Although the functional differentiation of CF inputs is well understood, their structural differentiation is less clear. In this study, we examined "winner" CF synapses in dendrites and both "winner" and "loser" synapses in the soma using serial electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry in C57BL/6 mice. We found that "winner" CF synapses, both in the soma and dendrites, developed more complex pre- and postsynaptic structures than "loser" CFs, with an expanded area of postsynaptic density. Additionally, "winner" CF synapses expressed significantly higher levels of AMPA-type glutamate receptors. Notably, only dendritic "winner" synapses showed increased levels of Rab3-interacting molecule RIM, a key presynaptic regulator of neurotransmitter release. These findings reveal the molecular and structural features that enable "winner" CFs to reinforce their synaptic strength and innervation, allowing them to outcompete other inputs during early development.</p>

                <p>Modulation of neuronal oscillations holds promise for the treatment of neurological disorders. Nonetheless, conventional stimulation in a continuous open-loop manner can lead to side effects and suboptimal efficiency. Closed-loop strategies such as phase-locked stimulation aim to address these shortcomings by offering a more targeted modulation. While theories have been developed to understand the neural response to stimulation, their predictions have not been thoroughly tested using experimental data. Using a mechanistic coupled oscillator model, we elaborate on two key predictions describing the response to stimulation as a function of the phase and amplitude of ongoing neural activity. To investigate these predictions, we analyze electrocorticogram recordings from a previously conducted study in parkinsonian rats and extract the corresponding phase and amplitude response curves. We demonstrate that the amplitude response to stimulation is strongly correlated to the derivative of the phase response (<I></I> &gt; 0.8) in all animals except one, thereby validating a key model prediction. The second prediction postulates that the stimulation becomes ineffective when the network synchrony is high, a trend that appeared missing in the data. Our analysis explains this discrepancy by showing that the neural populations in parkinsonian rats did not reach the level of synchrony for which the theory would predict ineffective stimulation. Our results highlight the potential of fine-tuning stimulation paradigms informed by mathematical models that consider both the ongoing phase and amplitude of the targeted neural oscillation.</p>

                Background: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) incidence in Northeastern Thailand is very high and a major cause of mortality. CCA patients typically have a poor prognosis and short-term survival rate due to late-stage diagnosis. Thailand is the first Southeast Asian country to approve medicinal cannabis treatment, especially for palliative care with advanced cancer patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort comparative study of survival rates among 491 newly diagnosed advanced CCA patients was carried out between September 1, 2019, and June 30, 2021. A total of 404 patients were in the standard palliative care pain management treatment group (ST), and 87 were in the medicinal cannabis treatment group (CT). Patients with CCA were recruited from four tertiary hospitals and two secondary hospitals in five provinces of Northeast Thailand. The cumulative survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and independent prognostic factors were investigated using Cox regression. Results: For ST patients, there was a total follow-up time of 790 person-months, with a mortality rate of 48.35/100 person-months. For CT patients the total follow-up time was 476 person-months, with mortality rate of 10.9/ 100 person-months. The median survival time after registration at a palliative clinic was 0.83 months (95% CI: 0.71–0.95) for ST and 5.66 months (95% CI: 1.94–9.38) for CT. Multivariate analysis showed that CT treatment protocol was associated with a significantly better survival (P value <0.001; median time of CT, 5.66 months (95% CI: 1.94–9.38); median time of ST, 0.83 months (95% CI: 0.71–0.95). Therefore, CT had a reduced probability of dying from the disease (HRadj., 0.28 (95% CI: 0.20–0.37) Conclusions: The medical cannabis increased overall survival rates among CCA patients.

                Background Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) has a poor prognosis and is a major cause of mortality and suffering in Thailand’s Northeastern (Isaan) Region. Methods This prospective cohort study aimed to compare the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among 72 newly diagnosed CCA patients; 42 patients who received cannabis treatment (CT) and 30 patients who received a standard palliative care treatment (ST). The study was carried out between 1st September 2019 to 31st October 2020. Data were collected from patients from oncology clinics of six hospitals in five provinces of northeast Thailand. The HRQoL was measured at baseline, and at 2 and 4 months after diagnosis by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life questionnaires QLQ-C30, and QLQ-BIL21. The Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to compare quality of life scores between the two patient groups and Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to compare within groups QoL scores at pre-treatment, and 2 and 4 month follow-ups. Results Global health status and functional scales, for both groups were high at pre-treatment. At 2 and 4 month follow-up, CT group patients had consistent statistically significantly better Palliative Performance Scale (PPS), and QoL scores, and many symptom scores than the ST group. Conclusions Medicinal cannabis may increase QoL for advanced CCA patients. Our findings support the importance of early access to palliative cannabis care clinic before the terminal and acceleration phase close to death.

                Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with a high mortality rate. However, Pancoast tumors, a rare subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), represent an uncommon clinical presentation. While the liver, bones, brain, and adrenal glands are the most frequent metastatic sites of lung cancer, gastrointestinal involvement, particularly colonic metastasis, is exceedingly rare. Herein, we present the case of a 61-year-old man diagnosed with Pancoast-Tobias syndrome, initially manifesting through colonic metastasis.

                Background Several scholars defined the concepts of fuzzy soft set theory and their application on decision-making problem. Based on this concept, researchers defined the generalised fuzzy soft set and its applications. However, to the best of the author’s knowledge, the generalised fuzzy soft set has not been dealing with in the generalised fuzzy soft code set. In this paper, we introduce the notion of generalised fuzzy soft code set and its application. Methods The theory of fuzzy soft sets and its application, generalised fuzzy soft sets and fuzzy codes in different years were studied with various researchers. To derive a generalised fuzzy soft code set, we apply the concepts of generalised fuzzy soft set and a new view of fuzzy codes and its application. A new aspect of this paper is to introduce the definition of generalised fuzzy soft code sets and its application on medical diagnosis and decision-makings. Results Generalised fuzzy soft code is the most powerful and effective extension of fuzzy soft sets that deal with the choice’s parameterized values. It is an extended model of fuzzy soft sets and a new mathematical tool with significant advantages for handling uncertain information and is proposed by combining the concept of fuzzy soft sets and fuzzy code sets. This paper introduces the concept of generalised fuzzy soft code and its properties. Conclusions In this study, we combine generalised fuzzy soft set and a different approach to coding theory to introduce generalisation of fuzzy soft codes. The paper also considers the relation between generalised fuzzy soft code and its application. We discussed the matrix representation of generalised fuzzy soft code. Furthermore, a demonstration example illustrates how the strategy could be effectively applied to various problems.

                Contemporary machine learning models are increasingly becoming restricted by size and subsequent operations per forward pass, demanding increasing compute requirements. Quantization has emerged as a convenient approach to addressing this, in which weights and activations are mapped from their conventionally used floating-point 32-bit numeric representations to lower precision integers. This process introduces significant reductions in inference time and simplifies the hardware requirements. It is a well-studied result that the performance of such reduced precision models is congruent with their floating-point counterparts. However, there is a lack of literature that addresses the performance of quantized models in a perturbed input space, as is common when stress testing regular full-precision models, particularly for real-world deployments. We focus on addressing this gap in the context of 8-bit quantized convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We study three state-of-the-art CNNs: ResNet-18, VGG-16, and SqueezeNet1_1, and subject their floating point and fixed point forms to various noise regimes with varying intensities. We characterize performance in terms of traditional metrics, including top-1 and top-5 accuracy, as well as the F1 score. We also introduce a new metric, the Kullback-Liebler divergence of the two output distributions for a given floating-point/fixed-point model pair, as a means to examine how the model’s output distribution has changed as a result of quantization, which, we contend, can be interpreted as a proxy for model similarity in decision making. We find that across all three models and under each perturbation scheme, the relative error between the quantized and full-precision model was consistently low. We also find that Kullback-Liebler divergence was on the same order of magnitude as the unperturbed tests across all perturbation regimes except Brownian noise, where significant divergences were observed for VGG-16 and SqueezeNet1_1.

                Introduction This case highlights an atypical mild presentation of rhabdomyolysis, a potentially life-threatening condition that often presents with severe symptoms. This underlines the importance of maintaining a high index of clinical suspicion to facilitate an early diagnosis and prevent complications. Patient Concerns A 31-year-old man presented with localized left-sided chest pain persisting for one week, coinciding with the resumption of gym training. His medical history was notable for sickle cell traits, and physical examination was unremarkable. Diagnoses, Interventions, and Outcomes Initial investigations such as ECG, CBC, troponin, D-dimer, and chest radiography were reported to be normal. With an atypical presentation, rhabdomyolysis was suspected due to the onset of pain after exercise. The creatine kinase (CK) level was markedly elevated at 20,792 U/L, which confirmed the diagnosis. The patient received aggressive IV hydration, and subsequent clinical follow-up revealed resolution of symptoms and normalization of CK levels. The patient was discharged in stable condition with follow-up advice. Conclusion Clinical suspicion should be emphasized in patients visiting a doctor with symptoms of exercise, despite the lack of classic rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, prompt attention and intervention may prevent such patients from experiencing severe consequences.

                Circular RNAs (circRNAs), once thought to be a result of splicing errors, have been found to be involved in various molecular processes and the pathology of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, circRNA expression was found to be altered by lifestyle habits, such as smoking cigarettes. Past studies have revealed that the rate of smoking remains high in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this study, we isolated total RNA from uninfected T-cells that have been exposed to cigarette smoke and compared the expression levels of circRNAs to those of T-cells that were not exposed to cigarette smoke. We identified certain circRNAs that were upregulated or downregulated in T-cells when exposed to cigarette smoke. These data indicate that the study of circRNAs is warranted within the context of HIV.

In the mouse distal terminal phalanx (P3), it remains mystery why amputation at less than 33% of the digit results in regeneration, while amputation exceeding 67% leads to non-regeneration. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying this disparity could provide crucial insights for regenerative medicine. In this study, we aim to investigate the tissues within the wound bed to understand the tissue microenvironment associated with regenerative versus non-regenerative outcomes. We employed a P3-specific amputation model in mice, integrated with time-series RNA-seq and a macrophage assay challenged with pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, to explore these mechanisms. Our findings revealed that non-regenerative digits exhibit a greater intense early transcriptional response in the wound bed compared to regenerative ones. Furthermore, early macrophage phenotypes differ distinctly between regenerative and non-regenerative outcomes. Regenerative digits also display unique co-expression modules related to Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 (Bmp2). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between regenerative and non-regenerative digits are enriched in targets of several transcription factors, such as HOXA11 and HOXD11 from the HOX gene family, showing a time-dependent pattern of enrichment. These transcription factors, known for their roles in bone regeneration, skeletal patterning, osteoblast activity, fracture healing, angiogenesis, and key signaling pathways, may act as master regulators of the regenerative gene signatures. Additionally, we developed a deep learning AI model capable of predicting post-amputation time and level from RNA-seq data, indicating that the regenerative probability may be “encoded” in the transcriptomic response to amputation.

Abnormal cellular respiration plays a critical role in carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulation of respiratory gene expression across different cancer types remain unclear. Here, we developed a computational framework that provides an analytical approach for exploring the molecular alterations and clinical relevance of respiratory genes in pan-cancer. We identified a total of 53 gene signatures in the three stages of respiration (including glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation) through this framework and found that they were broadly differentially expressed and genetically altered across 33 cancer types. Pathway analysis manifested that the expression levels of almost all respiratory gene signatures were remarkably associated with the activation or inhibition of numerous oncogenic pathways, such as metabolism, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Survival analysis highlighted the oncogenic or tumor suppressor potential of the respiratory gene signatures. In particular, <i>VCAN</i> has shown significant oncogenic features in multiple cancer types. Finally, we identified a number of respiratory gene signatures that could be potential therapeutic targets, including <i>VCAN</i>. We also predicted small-molecule compounds targeting respiratory gene signatures or components of pathways regulated by them. Overall, our comprehensive analysis has greatly enhanced the understanding of molecular alterations of respiratory genes in tumorigenesis and progression, and provided insights into developing new therapeutic strategies.

                <p>by Yi Cheng, Xingyu Wang, Qiang Zhang, Renkai Ge, Mei Zhou, Yue Dai</p>

Persistent inward currents (PICs) play a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability. These currents are composed of calcium (CaL) and sodium (NaP) components in vertebrate spinal neurons. Recent studies have reported that PICs are expressed in serotonergic neurons (5-HT) in medulla of mice. Multiple patterns of PICs were identified in 5-HT neurons, corresponding to a range of distinct repetitive firing types. The mechanisms underlying formation of these PIC patterns and firing types remain unknown. Using combined modeling and experimental approaches we explored the ionic mechanisms responsible for the PIC patterns and firing types. The whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed on the medullary 5-HT neurons of postnatal day 3–6 mice. A 5-HT neuron model was built based on the membrane properties of the 5-HT neurons and kinetics of voltage-gated channels. Results from physiological experiments and modeling simulations included: (1) PICs in 5-HT neurons were classified into six patterns based on their current trajectory induced by bi-ramp voltage, while repetitive firings were categorized into three types according to their response to bi-ramp current. Modulation of PICs conductance and kinetics altered the PIC patterns and firing types. (2) NaP conductance contributed to amplitude of PICs, whereas the slow inactivation gate (S<sub>gate</sub>) of NaP regulated the PIC patterns and firing types. Increasing S<sub>gate</sub> changed trajectory of PICs from counterclockwise to clockwise and firing types from asymmetrical to symmetric types induced by bi-ramp current. (3) CaL conductance dominated the amplitude of PICs, while CaL kinetics (half-activation voltage and slope) determined inactivation of PICs and prolongation of repetitive firing. (4) The novel finding was that distribution of CaL in distal dendrites modulated the PIC patterns and firing types. This study provides insights into the ionic mechanisms underlying generation of multiple PIC patterns and firing types in 5-HT neurons.

The physical organization of the genome in three-dimensional space regulates many biological processes, including gene expression and cell differentiation. Three-dimensional characterization of genome structure is critical to understanding these biological processes. Direct experimental measurements of genome structure are challenging; computational models of chromatin structure are therefore necessary. We develop an approach that combines a particle-based chromatin polymer model, molecular simulation, and machine learning to efficiently and accurately estimate chromatin structure from <i>indirect</i> measures of genome structure. More specifically, we introduce a new approach where the interaction parameters of the polymer model are extracted from experimental Hi-C data using a graph neural network (GNN). We train the GNN on simulated data from the underlying polymer model, avoiding the need for large quantities of experimental data. The resulting approach accurately estimates chromatin structures across all chromosomes and across several experimental cell lines despite being trained almost exclusively on simulated data. The proposed approach can be viewed as a general framework for combining physical modeling with machine learning, and it could be extended to integrate additional biological data modalities. Ultimately, we achieve accurate and high-throughput estimations of chromatin structure from Hi-C data, which will be necessary as experimental methodologies, such as single-cell Hi-C, improve.

                <p>by Daniela S Santurio, Luciana R C Barros, Ingmar Glauche, Artur c Fassoni</p>

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy holds significant potential for cancer treatment, although disease relapse and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) remain as frequent clinical challenges. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the temporal dynamics of CAR-T cell therapy response and CRS, we developed a novel multi-layer mathematical model incorporating antigen-mediated CAR-T cell expansion, antigen-negative resistance, and macrophage-associated cytokine release. Three key mechanisms of macrophage activation are considered: release of damage-associated molecular patterns, antigen-binding mediated activation, and CD40-CD40L contact. The model accurately describes 25 patient time courses with different responses and IL-6 cytokine kinetics. We successfully link the dynamic shape of the response to interpretable model parameters and investigate the influence of CAR-T cell dose and initial tumor burden on the occurrence of cytokine release and treatment outcome. By disentangling the timeline of macrophage activation, the model identified distinct contributions of each activation mechanism, suggesting the CD40-CD40L axis as a major driver of cytokine release and a clinically feasible target to control the activation process and modulate cytokine peak height. Our multi-layer model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interactions between CAR-T cells, tumor cells, and macrophages during therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003084">TMED9 coordinates the clearance of misfolded GPI-anchored proteins out of the ER and into the Golgi</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elsa Ronzier, Prasanna Satpute-Krishnan</p>

The p24-family member, TMED9, has recently emerged as a player in secretory pathway protein quality control (PQC) that influences the trafficking and degradation of misfolded proteins. Here, we show that TMED9 plays a central role in the PQC of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). Typically, upon release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident chaperone calnexin, misfolded GPI-APs traffic to the Golgi by an ER-export pathway called Rapid ER stress-induced Export (RESET). From the Golgi, they access the plasma membrane where they are rapidly internalized for lysosomal degradation. We used biochemical and imaging approaches in cultured cells to demonstrate that at steady-state, the majority of misfolded GPI-APs reside in the ER in association with calnexin and TMED9. During RESET, they dissociate from calnexin and increase their association with TMED9. Inhibition of TMED9’s function through siRNA-induced depletion or chemical inhibitor, BRD4780, blocked ER-export of misfolded GPI-APs. In contrast, TMED9-inhibition did not prevent ER-export of wild-type GPI-APs, indicating a specific role for TMED9 in GPI-AP PQC. Intriguingly, we discovered that acute treatment with BRD4780 induced a shift in TMED9 localization away from the ER to the downstream Golgi cisternae and blocked the RESET pathway. Upon removal of BRD4780 following acute treatment, TMED9 regained access to the ER where TMED9 was able to associate with the RESET substrate and restore the RESET pathway. These results suggest that TMED9 plays a requisite role in RESET by capturing misfolded GPI-APs that are released by calnexin within the ER and conveying them to the Golgi.
