                Examination of bacteria/host cell interactions is important for understanding the aetiology of many infectious diseases. The colony forming unit (CFU) has been the standard for quantifying bacterial burden for the past century, however, this suffers from low sensitivity and is dependent on bacterial culturability in vitro. Our data demonstrate the discrepancy between the CFU and bacterial genome copy number in an osteomyelitis-relevant co-culture system and we confirm diagnosis and quantify bacterial load in clinical bone specimens. This study provides an improved workflow for the quantification of bacterial burden in such cases.

">Recovery after human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) treatment in post-MCAO rats requires handling associated with repeated behavioral testing.</a></h4>

              
                Rehabilitation is the only current intervention that improves sensorimotor function in ischemic stroke patients, similar to task-specific intensive training in animal models of stroke. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are promising in restoring brain damage and function in stroke models. Additionally, the non-invasive intranasal route allows EVs to reach the brain and target specific ischemic regions. Yet unclear is how handling might enhance recovery or influence other therapies such as EVs after stroke. We used the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke in rats to assess how intensive handling alone, in the form of sensorimotor behavioral tests, or in combination with an intranasal multidose or single dose of EVs restored neurological function and ischemic damage. Handled rats were exposed to a battery of sensorimotor tests, including the modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS), beam balance, corner, grid walking, forelimb placement, and cylinder tests, together with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post-stroke (dps). Handled MCAO rats were also exposed to an intranasal multidose of EVs (8 doses in total across four weeks, each dose containing 0.8 x 109 EVs in 120 microliters) or a single dose of EVs (2.4 x 109 EVs in 200 microliters) at 2 dps. Non-handled rats were evaluated only by mNSS and MRI at 2, 28, and 56 dps and were treated with a single intranasal dose of EVs. Our results showed that handling animals after MCAO is necessary for EVs to work and that a single cumulative dose of EVs further improves the neurological function recovered during handling without affecting ischemic damage. These results show the importance of rehabilitation in combination with other treatments and highlight how intensive behavioral testing might influence functional recovery after stroke, especially when other treatments are also given.

">Cortical inhibitory parvalbumin interneurons exhibit metabolic specializations coordinated by PGC-1Î± that are lost in rodents and humans after traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-INs) regulate neuronal and circuit activity, and their dysfunction is observed across neurological conditions, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), epilepsy, Alzheimers disease, and schizophrenia. PV-INs are particularly vulnerable to cell loss, potentially due to their increased metabolic demands arising from their uniquely high level of electrical activity, which render them susceptible to metabolic pressure. Here, we use single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNAseq) data from a rodent model of TBI, as well as human TBI data, and demonstrate PV-INs have unique metabolic specializations that are lost after injury and can be rescued by in vivo treatment with the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose. We generated a novel PV-IN transcriptional identity module comprised primarily of genes encoding specialized ion channels, metabolic enzymes, and synaptic machinery, that identifies heterogenous subsets of injury-associated PV-INs with loss of PV-IN transcriptional identity. We show that changes in metabolic specialization are coupled to changes in transcriptional identity in PV-INs and implicate the PV-IN-enriched transcriptional co-activator, Ppargc1a, as a key driver of PV-IN transcriptional metabolic dysfunction. We also identify a family of long non-coding RNAs enriched in this subset of transcriptionally dysfunctional PV-INs that negatively correlates with PV-IN metabolic specialization. Lastly, we utilize these tools to interrogate a published human TBI snRNAseq data set and find nearly identical changes, underscoring the importance of PV-IN metabolic dysfunction in the pathology of TBI.

">Genetic ablation of the DNA demethylation pathway in retinal progenitor cells impairs photoreceptor development and function, leading to retinal dystrophy</a></h4>

              
                Rod and cone photoreceptors are critical for vision, and their loss leads to blindness. We explored the role of epigenetic mechanisms in photoreceptor development and function that is still poorly understood. To this end, we created mice in which the DNA demethylation pathway was inactivated in retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). We have shown that DNA demethylation caused by the activity of TET oxidases is necessary during the differentiation of RPCs into photoreceptors. Disruption of the TET-dependent DNA demethylation pathway prevents the proper expression of genes necessary for photoreceptor development and function (e.g., Rho, Nr2e3, Prph2, Pde6a, Pde6b, Pde6g, Cplx4, Grk1, Cnga1, Cngb1, Cplx4). The result of this is underdevelopment or complete absence of outer segments and synaptic termini in photoreceptors of TET-deficient retinas, resulting in loss of rod and cone function, as assayed by electroretinogram. The number of photoreceptors decreases in the TET-deficient retinas over time, leading to retinal dystrophy.

">Cocaine-Induced Gene Regulation in D1 and D2 Neuronal Ensembles of the Nucleus Accumbens Revealed by Single-Cell RNA Sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Cocaine use disorder is characterized by persistent drug-seeking behavior and a high risk of relapse, driven by lasting molecular and circuit adaptations in the nucleus accumbens. To explore the transcriptomic changes underlying these alterations, we employed fluorescence-activated nucleus sorting coupled with single-nucleus RNA sequencing to analyze D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons in this brain region of male mice subjected to acute cocaine exposure or to prolonged withdrawal from repeated cocaine exposure without or with an acute cocaine rechallenge. This approach allowed us to precisely delineate and contrast transcriptionally distinct neuronal subpopulations [boxh] or ensembles [boxh] across various treatment conditions. We identified significant heterogeneity within both D1 and D2 MSNs, revealing distinct clusters with unique transcriptional profiles. Notably, we identified a discrete D1 MSN population characterized by the upregulation of immediate early genes, as well as another group of D1 MSNs linked to prolonged withdrawal, uncovering novel regulators of withdrawal-related transcriptome dynamics. Our findings provide a high-resolution transcriptomic map of D1 and D2 MSNs, illustrating the dynamic changes induced by cocaine exposure and withdrawal. These insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cocaine use disorder highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention aimed at preventing relapse.

">Central nucleus of the amygdala to medial prefrontal cortex 5-HTergic neural circuit modulates the recovery of consciousness during sevoflurane anesthesia</a></h4>

              
                General anesthesia, widely employed for its capacity to induce unconsciousness during surgical and diagnostic procedures, frequently results in postoperative recovery delays, a common complication. The precise mechanisms underpinning this delayed emergence from anesthesia remain not /fully understood. Prior research has established a strong association between sleep-wake neural circuits and the anesthetic effects of general anesthetics, with serotonin (5-HT) playing a pivotal role in the regulation of anesthesia emergence. Extensive projections exist between the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In this study, we utilized pharmacological, chemogenetic, and optogenetic techniques to explore the relationship between the 5-HT neural circuitry within the central amygdala (CeA)-mPFC pathway and the process of awakening from general anesthesia. Our findings reveal that modulating the 5-HT system in both the CeA and mPFC, via endogenous and exogenous means, can effectively reverse delayed emergence. This suggests that the 5-HT-ergic pathway within the CeA-mPFC circuit is instrumental in regulating the awakening process from sevoflurane anesthesia. These insights may inform future clinical interventions designed to prevent delayed emergence and reduce postoperative risks.

">Olfactory combinatorial coding supports risk-reward decision making in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Vertebrate and insect olfactory systems generate diversity in odor perception using combinatorial coding, where individual odorant molecules activate unique but overlapping sets of olfactory receptor neurons. It is not well understood how these patterns are decoded and transformed into downstream physiological responses. Here, we demonstrate that Caenorhabditis elegans uses combinatorial coding to formulate locomotory responses to the odorant 1-octanol (1-oct). Whole-network Ca++ imaging showed that 1-oct is encoded combinatorially, activating multiple sensory neurons including ASH and AWC, associated with repulsion and attraction, respectively. The temporal dynamics of these neuronal activations indicate that 1-oct stimulates attractive and repulsive afferent pathways simultaneously; altering the relative strengths of these pathways is sufficient to convert 1-oct from a repellent to an attractant in microfluidics-based behavioral assays. These results identify the balance between attraction and repulsion as a key factor determining chemotactic behavior, achieved through modulation of locomotory reversals and speed. At the circuit level, the attractive and repulsive pathways can both entrain the activity of the reverse command interneuron AVA, a key regulator of reversals, with the stronger pathway predominating. This coding strategy facilitates context-dependent modulation of sensory responses. 1-oct is present in decaying plant material, signaling the possible presence of bacterial food. However, 1-oct is also toxic, and therefore represents a high risk food signal. Adding a different food signal (representing better food in a different location) suppresses the 1-oct attraction pathway by depressing AWC activity, tips the sensory balance toward the aversive pathway, and converts 1-oct attraction into 1-oct repulsion.

">Neocortical long-range inhibition promotes cortical synchrony and sleep</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral states such as sleep and wake are highly correlated with specific patterns of rhythmic activity in the cortex. During low arousal states such as slow wave sleep, the cortex is synchronized and dominated by low frequency rhythms coordinated across multiple regions. Although recent evidence suggests that GABAergic inhibitory neurons are key players in cortical state modulation, the in vivo circuit mechanisms coordinating synchronized activity among local and distant neocortical networks are not well understood. Here, we show that somatostatin and chondrolectin co-expressing cells (Sst-Chodl cells), a sparse and unique class of neocortical inhibitory neurons, are selectively active during low arousal states and are largely silent during periods of high arousal. In contrast to other neocortical inhibitory neurons, we show these neurons have long-range axons that project across neocortical areas. Activation of Sst-Chodl cells is sufficient to promote synchronized cortical states characteristic of low arousal, with increased spike co-firing and low frequency brain rhythms, and to alter behavioral states by promoting sleep. Contrary to the prevailing belief that sleep is exclusively driven by subcortical mechanisms, our findings reveal that these long-range inhibitory neurons not only track changes in behavioral state but are sufficient to induce both sleep-like cortical states and sleep behavior, establishing a crucial circuit component in regulating behavioral states.

">Spinal interneuron population dynamics underlying flexible pattern generation</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian spinal locomotor network is composed of diverse populations of interneurons that collectively orchestrate and execute a range of locomotor behaviors. Despite the identification of many classes of spinal interneurons constituting the locomotor network, it remains unclear how the network's collective activity computes and modifies locomotor output on a step-by-step basis. To investigate this, we analyzed lumbar interneuron population recordings and multi-muscle electromyography from spinalized cats performing air stepping and used artificial intelligence methods to uncover state space trajectories of spinal interneuron population activity on single step cycles and at millisecond timescales. Our analyses of interneuron population trajectories revealed that traversal of specific state space regions held millisecond-timescale correspondence to the timing adjustments of extensor-flexor alternation. Similarly, we found that small variations in the path of state space trajectories were tightly linked to single-step, microvolt-scale adjustments in the magnitude of muscle output.

	<p>Background: Technological advancements have been rapidly integrated within the neurosurgical education track since it is a high-risk specialty with little margin for error. Indeed, simulation and virtual reality during training can improve surgical performance and technical skills. Our study aims to investigate the impact of neurosurgical technology-based simulation activities on medical students. Methods and Materials: The &amp;amp;ldquo;Suturing Mission&amp;amp;ndash;The Symposium&amp;amp;rdquo; was a three-day event held at Humanitas University. Participants had access to live-streamed conferences held by worldwide experts in several fields of neurosurgery and practical simulations of dura mater sutures, microvascular anastomosis, and augmented reality neurosurgical approaches. An anonymous survey was conducted at the beginning and end of the event. Results: 141 medical students with a mean age of 21 participated. After the course, 110 participants (77.5%) showed interest in pursuing a surgical path, with a great prevalence in those who had planned to have a surgical career before the event (88.7% vs. 41.4%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Participants were also asked about their comfort levels while handling surgical instruments, and a good outcome was reached in 72.7% of participants, with a significant difference between those who had previously attended a suture course (87.8% vs. 66.3%, p = 0.012). Conclusion: Training sessions on surgical simulators were effective in increasing participants&amp;amp;rsquo; interest in pursuing a surgical path, improving their understanding of postgraduate orientation, and boosting their confidence with surgical instruments.</p>

	<p>The pervasive sedentary lifestyle exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced physical activity (PA) among school-age children, necessitating innovative strategies to evaluate short PA breaks that are feasible in a classroom setting. This study explored the cognitive and neurophysiological (electroencephalography; EEG) impacts of short bouts of different PA modalities on inhibitory control (flanker task) and episodic memory (word recognition task) in children. Utilizing a within-participants cross-over design, thirty-six children (n = 36; 9&amp;amp;ndash;12 years old) attended the lab on three separate days with each visit including either a 9 min bout of sustained moderate-intensity cycling, high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE), or seated rest. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were assessed during the flanker task (P3 component) and the word recognition task (LPC and FN400 components) to elucidate the neural mechanisms underpinning behavioral outcomes. Findings indicated no differences in flanker performance but greater episodic memory recall for HIIE compared to seated rest. Neurophysiological results revealed no differences for P3, but notably larger amplitude for LPC and FN400 postcycling, particularly over parietal electrode sites. These results underscore the potential of short PA breaks to improve cognitive and neurocognitive function in children, offering a feasible integration strategy into daily school routines without extensive time commitment.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a neurometabolic disease with an increasing incidence. The pathophysiology is unknown, but improvement of diagnosis and management requires discovery of novel biomarkers. Our objective was to identify such candidate biomarkers in IIH, and secondarily, test for associations between identified metabolites and disease severity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a prospective caseâcontrol study with collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum, and clinical data from new-onset, treatment-naÃ¯ve patients with IIH (nâ=â60). Patients were included consecutively from 2 tertiary headache centers in Denmark, and age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) -matched healthy controls (nâ=â35) were recruited. Clinical data were retrieved at ocular remission (nâ=â55). Samples were analyzed using non-targeted mass spectrometry.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Serum sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), adenosine, and glutamate were 0.46-fold (qâ&lt;â0.0001), 0.25-fold (qâ=â0.0048), and 0.44-fold (qâ&lt;â0.0001) lower, respectively, in IIH. CSF stearoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC-18) and 2-palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC-16) were 0.42 (qâ=â0.0025) and 0.37 (qâ&lt;â0.001) -fold lower. LysoPC-18 was higher in patients with moderateâsevere versus mild papilledema (<i>p</i>â=â0.022). LysoPC-18 correlated positively with retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (<i>p</i>â=â0.0012, râ=â0.42) and inversely with mean deviation on automated perimetry (<i>p</i>â=â0.01, râ=ââ0.35). Higher baseline serum S1P (<i>p</i>â=â0.018) and lower CSF LysoPC-16 (<i>p</i>â=â0.003) were associated with optic nerve atrophy at ocular remission. Pathway analysis suggests dysregulated lipid metabolism and redox disturbances in new-onset IIH.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identify perturbed metabolism in new-onset IIH. S1P and LysoPC-16 demonstrate potential prognostic value due to association with subsequent optic nerve atrophy. This association between specific, differential metabolites and outcome provides substantial evidence for novel biomarkers of clinical significance that should be the focus of further targeted studies.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrogens are believed to modulate cognitive functions in part through the modulation of synaptic transmission in the cortex and hippocampus. Administration of 17Î²-estradiol (E2) can rapidly enhance excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and facilitate excitatory synaptic transmission in rat lateral entorhinal cortex via activation of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER1). To assess the mechanisms through which GPER1 activation facilitates synaptic transmission, we assessed the effects of acute 10ânM E2 administration on pharmacologically isolated evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in layer II/III entorhinal neurons. Female Long-Evans rats were ovariectomized between postnatal day (PD) 63 and 74 and implanted with a subdermal E2 capsule to maintain continuous low levels of E2. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained between 7 and 20âdays after ovariectomy. Application of E2 for 20âmin did not significantly affect AMPA or NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic currents. However, GABA receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic currents (IPSCs) were markedly reduced by E2 and returned towards baseline levels during the 20-min washout period. The inhibition of GABA-mediated IPSCs was blocked in the presence of the GPER1 receptor antagonist G15. GPER1 can modulate protein kinase A (PKA), but blocking PKA with intracellular KT5720 did not prevent the E2-induced reduction in IPSCs. GPER1 can also stimulate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a negative modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, and blocking activation of ERK with PD90859 prevented the E2-induced reduction of IPSCs. E2 can therefore result in a rapid GPER1 and ERK signaling-mediated reduction in GABA-mediated IPSCs. This provides a novel mechanism through which E2 can rapidly modulate synaptic excitability in entorhinal layer II/III neurons and may also contribute to E2 and ERK-dependent alterations in synaptic transmission in other brain areas.</p>

">Long-term perceptual priors drive confidence bias which favors prior-congruent evidence</a></h4>

              
                Within a Bayesian framework, both our perceptual decisions and confidence about those decisions are based on the precision-weighted integration of prior expectations and incoming sensory information. This assumes priors to influence both decisions and confidence in the same way. Against this assumption, asymmetries have been found in the influence that priors have on confidence compared to discrimination decisions. However, these patterns were found for high-level probabilistic expectations that are flexibly induced in the task context. It remains unclear whether this generalizes to low-level perceptual priors that are naturally formed through long term exposure. Here we investigated human participants' confidence in decisions made under the influence of a long-term perceptual prior: the slow-motion prior. Participants viewed moving line stimuli for which the slow-motion prior biases the perceived motion direction. On each trial, they made two consecutive motion direction decisions followed by a confidence decision. We contrasted two conditions - one in which the prior biased perceptual decisions and one in which decisions were driven by the sensory information alone. We found a confidence bias favoring the condition in which the prior influenced decisions, even when accounting for performance differences. Computational modeling revealed this effect to best be explained by confidence using the prior-congruent evidence as an additional cue, beyond the posterior evidence used in the perceptual decision. This suggests a confirmatory confidence bias favoring evidence congruent with low-level perceptual priors, revealing that, in line with high-level expectations, even long-term priors have a particularly strong influence at the metacognitive level.

">Association between Adolescent Brain Morphometry and Cognitive Function: Insights from a Cross-Sectional Analysis of ABCD Data from 9 to 15 Years Old</a></h4>

              
                During the adolescent developmental stage, significant changes occur in both brain structure and cognitive function. Brain structure serves as the foundation for cognitive function and can be accurately assessed using a comprehensive set of brain cortical and subcortical morphometry measures. Exploring the association between whole-brain morphometry and cognitive function during adolescence can help elucidate the underlying relationship between brain structural development and cognitive development. Despite extensive research in this area, previous studies have two main limitations. Firstly, they often use a limited number of brain morphometry measures, which do not provide a comprehensive representation of brain structure. Secondly, most previous studies rely on relatively small sample sizes, increasing the risk of sampling error, low statistical power, and even overestimation of effects. To address these limitations, we analyzed the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, which includes 8543 subjects (13,992 scans) aged 9-15 years. These scans were categorized into six groups with one-year intervals based on their ages for independent age-specific analysis. We computed 16 brain regional morphometry measures derived from Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (SMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI), and integrated them with morphometric similarity networks (MSNs). This approach enabled us to compute 16,563 morphometry measures encompassing brain region, connection, and hub aspects. Subsequently, these measures were input into a robust large-scale computational model to investigate their relationship with cognitive performances. We found that brain regions making the most significant contributions to cognitive function during adolescence, and those exhibiting the greatest variability in their contributions over time, were primarily situated in the frontal and temporal lobes. Subcortex were the least involved. We also observed strong correlations between key brain morphometry measures related to different cognitive performances within same domain. Furthermore, SMRI measures demonstrated stronger associations with cognitive performances compared to DTI and RSI measures. Overall, our study aims to facilitate a comprehensive and reliable understanding of the association between adolescent brain morphometry and cognitive function.

">Functionally Adaptive Structural Basis Sets of the Brain: A Dynamic Fusion Approach</a></h4>

              
                The precise relationship between brain structure and dynamic neural function has long been an open area of research, and recently, a topic of much debate. Whether investigated through the lens of interregional white matter connectivity or cortical surface morphology, the common thread that links many studies in this subfield of research is the focus on identifying a singular structural basis set, upon which functional activation signals are reconstructed to define the linkage between structure and function. Such approaches are limited in two respects; first, these basis sets are defined solely upon structural data and ignore the influence of functional coupling entirely, and second, these approaches operate on the somewhat narrow assumption that a single structure-function coupling governs the activity of the whole brain at all times. The first limitation can be addressed with the use of multimodal data fusion, which identifies hidden linkages between structural and functional brain imaging data; however, many multimodal fusion approaches still necessitate functional data to be heavily summarized over the time dimension, resulting in temporally rigid structure-function linkages. Regarding the second limitation, given that functional brain activity and connectivity vary over multiple timescales, it is natural to consider this also might be true of structure-function couplings. Here, we introduce dynamic fusion, implemented as an ICA-based symmetric fusion approach, which enables flexible, time-resolved linkages between structure and function utilizing dynamic functional connectivity (dFNC) states. We show evidence that challenges current claims regarding structural basis sets and suggests that temporally evolving structural basis sets can better reflect dynamic functional manifolds and better capture diagnostically relevant structure-functional coupling than traditionally computed structural bases. Lastly, differential analysis of component stability across repeated scans from a control cohort reveals organization of static and dynamic structure/function coupling falls along unimodal/transmodal hierarchical lines.

">Mouse models of non-dystrophic and dystrophic myotonia exhibit nociplastic pain-like behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Pain is a prominent and debilitating symptom in myotonic disorders, yet its physiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study assessed preclinical pain-like behavior in murine models of pharmacologically induced myotonia and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). In both myotonia congenita and DM1, impairment of the CLCN1 gene, which encodes skeletal muscle voltage-gated CLC-1 chloride channels, reduces chloride ion conductance in skeletal muscle cells, leading to prolonged muscle excitability and delayed relaxation after contraction. We used the CLC-1 antagonist anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (9-AC) at intraperitoneal doses of 30 or 60 mg/kg and HSA LR20b DM1 mice to model CLC-1-induced myotonia. Our experimental approach included in vivo pain behavioral testing, ex vivo calcium imaging, and whole-cell current-clamp electrophysiology in mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. A single injection of 9-AC induced myotonia in mice, which persisted for several hours and resulted in long-lasting allodynic pain-like behavior. Similarly, HSA LR20b mice exhibited both allodynia and hyperalgesia. Despite these pain-like behaviors, DRG neurons did not show signs of hyperexcitability in either myotonic model. These findings suggest that myotonia induces nociplastic pain-like behavior in preclinical rodents, likely through central sensitization mechanisms rather than peripheral sensitization. This study provides insights into the pathophysiology of pain in myotonic disorders and highlights the potential of using myotonic mouse models to explore pain mechanisms and assess novel analgesics. Future research should focus on the central mechanisms involved in myotonia-induced pain and develop targeted therapies to alleviate this significant clinical burden.

">Post-encoding administration of oxytocin selectively enhances memory consolidation of male faces in females</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin plays a critical role in modulating social cognition and enhancing human memory for faces. However, it remains unclear which stage of memory oxytocin affects to enhance face memory. Our study explored oxytocin's potential to selectively enhance the consolidation of social memories, specifically human faces, and whether this effect varies between genders. In two preregistered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with heterosexual participants (total N=294, comprising 149 males and 145 females), we explored how oxytocin affects memory consolidation. We administered oxytocin immediately after encoding (i.e., Study1) and 30 minutes before retrieval in a parallel study (i.e., Study2). This design allowed us to confirm that oxytocin's effects were indeed due to consolidation rather than retrieval. We found that administering oxytocin post-encoding, but not before-retrieval, significantly improved female participants' ability to recognize male faces 24 hours later, with no similar enhancement observed in males recognizing opposite-gender faces. Together with our analyses of social placebo effects and approachability rating during encoding, we concluded that oxytocin enhanced consolidation of long-term social memories in humans. Our results not only advance the understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying social memory consolidation but also highlight oxytocin as a pharmacological tool for selectively enhancing human memory consolidation.

">Acute nicotine vapor normalizes sensorimotor gating and reduces locomotor activity deficits in HIV-1 transgenic rats</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: Despite improved life expectancy of people with HIV (PWH), HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (NCI) persists, alongside deficits in sensorimotor gating and neuroinflammation. PWH exhibit high smoking rates, possibly due to neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and cognitive-enhancing effects of nicotine, suggesting potential self-medication. Objectives: Here, we tested the effects of acute nicotine vapor exposure on translatable measures of sensorimotor gating and exploratory behavior in the HIV-1 transgenic (HIV-1Tg) rat model of HIV. Methods: Male and female HIV-1Tg and F344 control rats (n=57) were exposed to acute nicotine or vehicle vapor. Sensorimotor gating was assessed using prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response, and exploratory behavior was evaluated using the behavioral pattern monitor (BPM). Results: Vehicle-treated HIV-1Tg rats exhibited PPI deficits at low prepulse intensities compared to F344 controls, as seen previously. No PPI deficits were observed in nicotine-treated HIV-1Tg rats, however. HIV-1Tg rats were hypoactive in the BPM relative to controls, whilst nicotine vapor increased activity and exploratory behavior across genotypes. Cotinine analyses confirmed comparable levels of the primary metabolite of nicotine across genotypes. Conclusions: Previous findings of PPI deficits in HIV-1Tg rats were replicated and, importantly, attenuated by acute nicotine vapor. Evidence for similar cotinine levels suggest a nicotine-specific effect in HIV-1Tg rats. HIV-1Tg rats had reduced exploratory behavior compared to controls, attenuated by acute nicotine vapor. Therefore, acute nicotine may be beneficial for remediating sensorimotor and locomotor activity deficits in PWH. Future studies should determine the long-term effects of nicotine vapor on similar HIV/NCI-relevant behaviors.

">The Retrosplenial Cortical Role in Delayed Spatial Alternation.</a></h4>

              
                The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) plays an important role in spatial cognition. RSC neurons exhibit a variety of spatial firing patterns and lesion studies have found that the RSC is necessary for spatial working memory tasks. However, little is known about how RSC neurons might encode spatial memory during a delay period. In the present study, we trained control rats and rats with excitotoxic lesions of the RSC on spatial alternation task with varying delay durations and in a separate group of rats, we recorded RSC neuronal activity as the rats performed the alternation task. We found that RSC lesions significantly impaired alternation performance, particularly at the longest delay duration. We also found that RSC neurons exhibited reliably different firing patterns throughout the delay periods preceding left and right trials, consistent with a working memory signal. These differential firing patterns were absent during the delay periods preceding errors. We also found that many RSC neurons exhibit a large spike in firing rate leading up to the start of the trial. Many of these trial start responses also differentiated left and right trials, suggesting that they could play a role in priming the 'go left' or 'go right' behavioral responses. Our results suggest that these firing patterns represent critical memory information that underlies the RSC role in spatial working memory.

">Noradrenergic tuning of arousal is coupled to coordinatedmovements</a></h4>

              
                Matching arousal level to the motor activity of an animal is important for efficiently allocating cognitive resources and metabolic supply in response to behavioral demands, but how the brain coordinates changes in arousal and wakefulness in response to motor activity remains an unclear phenomenon. We hypothesized that the locus coeruleus (LC), as the primary source of cortical norepinephrine (NE) and promoter of cortical and sympathetic arousal, is well-positioned to mediate movement-arousal coupling. Here, using a combination of physiological recordings, fiber photometry, optogenetics, and behavioral tracking, we show that the LCNE activation is tightly coupled to the return of organized movements during waking from an anesthetized state. Moreover, in an awake animal, movement initiations are coupled to LCNE activation, while movement arrests, to LCNE deactivation. We also report that LCNE activity covaries with the depth of anesthesia and that LCNE photoactivation leads to sympathetic activation, consistent with its role in mediating increased arousal. Together, these studies reveal a more nuanced, modulatory role that LCNE plays in coordinating movement and arousal.

                Naturalistic paradigms can assure ecological validity and yield novel insights in psychology and neuroscience. However, using behavioral experiments to obtain the human ratings necessary to analyze data collected with these paradigms is usually costly and time-consuming. Large language models like GPT have great potential for predicting human-like behavioral judgments. The current study evaluates the performance of GPT as a substitute for human judgments for affective dynamics in narratives. Our results revealed that GPT's inference of hedonic valence dynamics is highly correlated with human affective perception. Moreover, the inferred neural activity based on GPT derived valence ratings is similar to inferred neural activity based on human judgments, suggesting the potential of using GPT's prediction as a reliable substitute for human judgments.

">Stimulus-specific processing of auditory deviants and repetitive stimulus sequences in the human brainstem</a></h4>

              
                Detecting unexpected events, also known as deviant stimuli, is essential for survival. Research on the neural mechanisms that underlie deviance detection has gained momentum in the last decades. One major discovery from this research is that deviance detection is not limited to high-order cortical areas but is also present in evolutionary older subcortical structures. However, most of the research studying subcortical deviance detection has so far been limited to animal experiments, with studies in humans mostly focussing on cortical effects. It is therefore still mostly unknown how and to what extend deviance detection manifests in the human brainstem. Here, we aimed to tackle this issue by measuring auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to investigate the earliest correlates of deviance detection in the human brain. We demonstrate that the human brainstem is sensitive to auditory deviants and that the measured effects depend on the carrier frequency of the stimuli. We found the strongest and fastest deviance detection responses when low-frequency chirps occurred as deviants in a context of high-frequency stimuli. A second experiment revealed that the larger deviant ABR amplitudes can be explained by repetition suppression effects of the more frequent standard stimulus. On the contrary, high-frequency chirps did not elicit deviance detection and caused repetition enhancement instead of suppression. These results show that the human auditory brainstem is sensitive to the probability of occurrence of the stimulus and can use different, stimulus-specific processing mechanisms. Our results reveal a previously unknown complexity of advanced auditory signal processing in the human brainstem.

">Interaction between mitochondrial translocator protein and aging in inflammatory responses in mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) is a biomarker of inflammation which is upregulated in the brain in aging and associated neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we investigated the interaction between aging and TSPO immunomodulatory function in mouse hippocampus, a region severely affected in AD. Aging resulted in a reversal of TSPO knockout transcriptional signatures following inflammatory insult, with TSPO deletion drastically exacerbating inflammatory transcriptional responses in the aging hippocampus whilst dampening inflammation in the young hippocampus. Drugs that disrupt cell cycle and induce DNA-damage such as heat shock protein and topoisomerase inhibitors were identified to mimic the inflammatory transcriptional signature characterizing TSPO-dependent aging most closely. This TSPO-aging interaction is an important consideration in the interpretation of TSPO-targeted biomarker and therapeutic studies, as well as in vitro studies which cannot model the aging brain.

                Identifying the origins and contributions of different immune cell populations following brain injury is crucial for understanding their roles in inflammation and tissue repair. This study investigated the infiltration and phenotypic characteristics of skull bone marrow-derived immune cells in the murine brain after TBI. We performed calvarium transplantation from GFP donor mice and subjected the recipients to controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury 14 days post-transplant. Confocal imaging at 3 days post-CCI revealed GFP+ calvarium-derived cells infiltrating the ipsilateral core lesional area, expressing CD45 and CD11b immune markers. These cells included neutrophil (Ly6G+) and monocyte (Ccr2+) identities. Calvarium-derived GFP+/Iba1+ monocyte/macrophages expressed the efferocytosis receptor MerTK and displayed engulfment of NeuN+ and caspase 3+ apoptotic cells. Phenotypic analysis showed that greater calvarium-derived monocyte/macrophages disproportionately express the anti-inflammatory arginase-1 marker than pro-inflammatory CD86. To differentiate the responses of blood- and calvarium-derived macrophages, we transplanted GFP calvarium skull bone into tdTomato bone marrow chimeric mice, then performed CCI injury 14 days post-transplant. Calvarium-derived GFP+ cells predominantly infiltrated the lesion boundary, while blood-derived TdTomato+ cells dispersed throughout the lesion and peri-lesion. Compared to calvarium-derived cells, more blood-derived cells expressed pro-inflammatory CD86 and displayed altered 3D morphologic traits. These findings uniquely demonstrate that skull bone-derived immune cells infiltrate the brain after injury and contribute to the neuroinflammatory milieu, representing a novel immune cell source that may be further investigated for their causal role in functional outcomes.

">An improved method for sampling and quantitative protein analytics of cerebrospinal fluid of single mice</a></h4>

              
                Mice are the most commonly used preclinical animal model, but protein analytics of murine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) remains challenging because of low CSF volume (often <10 microL) and frequent blood contaminations. We developed an improved CSF sampling method that allows routine collection of increased volumes (20-30 microL) of pure CSF from individual mice, enabling multiple protein analytical assays from a single sample. Based on cell counts and hemoglobin ELISAs, we provide an easy quality control workflow for obtaining cell- and blood-free murine CSF. Through mass spectrometry-based proteomics using an absolutely quantified external standard, we estimated concentrations for hundreds of mouse CSF proteins. While repeated CSF sampling from the same mouse was possible, it induced CSF proteome changes. Applying the improved method, we found that the mouse CSF proteome remains largely stable over time in wild-type mice, but that amyloid pathology in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease massively changes the CSF proteome. Neurofilament light chain and TREM2, markers of neurodegeneration and activated microglia, respectively, were strongly upregulated and validated using immunoassays. In conclusion, our refined murine CSF collection method overcomes previous limitations, allowing multiple quantitative protein analyses for applications in biomedicine.

">The role of liprin-Î±1 phosphorylation in its liquid-liquid phase separation: regulation by PPP2R5D/PP2A holoenzyme</a></h4>

              
                Liprin-alpha1 is a widely expressed scaffolding protein responsible for regulating cellular processes such as focal adhesion, cell motility, and synaptic transmission. Liprin-alpha1 interacts with many proteins including ELKS, GIT1, liprin-beta, and LAR-family receptor tyrosine protein phosphatase. Through these protein-protein interactions, liprin-alpha1 assemble large higher-order molecular complexes; however, the regulation of this complex assembly/disassembly is unknown. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a process that concentrates proteins within cellular nano-domains to facilitate efficient spatiotemporal signaling in response to signaling cascades. While there is no report that liprin-alpha1 spontaneously undergoes LLPS, we found that GFP-liprin-alpha1 expressed in HEK293 cells occasionally forms droplet-like condensates. MS-based interactomics identified Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A)/B56delta (PPP2R5D) trimers as specific interaction partners of liprin-alpha1 through a canonical Short Linear Interaction Motif (SLiM) in its N-terminal dimerization domain. Mutations of this SLiM nearly abolished PP2A interaction and resulted in significantly increased LLPS. GFP-liprin-alpha1 showed significantly increased droplet formation in HEK293 cells devoid of B56delta (PPP2R5D knockout), suggesting that PPP2R5D/PP2A holoenzyme inhibits liprin-alpha1 LLPS. Guided by reported liprin-alpha1 Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites, we found liprin-alpha1 phospho-mimetic mutant at serine 763 (S763E) is sufficient to drive its LLPS. Domain mapping studies of liprin-alpha1 indicated that the intrinsically disordered region, the N-terminal dimerization domain, and the SAM domains are all necessary for liprin-alpha1 LLPS. Finally, expression of p.E420K, a human PPP2R5D variant causing Houge-Janssens Syndrome type 1(also known as Jordan Syndrome), significantly compromised suppression of liprin-alpha1 LLPS. Our work identified B56delta-PP2A holoenzyme as an inhibitor of liprin-alpha LLPS via regulation at multiple phosphorylation sites.

">AAV-mediated gene transfer of WDR45 corrects neurologic deficits in the mouse model of beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is an ultra-rare, X-linked dominant, neurodegenerative disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the WDR45 gene. It manifests in neurodevelopmental delay and seizures followed by secondary neurologic decline with dystonia/parkinsonism and dementia in adolescence and early adulthood and is characterized by progressive accumulation of iron in the basal ganglia. WDR45 encodes {beta}-propeller-shaped scaffold protein, or WIPI4, which plays an important role in autophagosome formation. While the mechanisms of how WIPI4 loss of function results in neurologic decline and brain pathology have not yet been established, findings of lower autophagic activity provide a direct link between impaired autophagy and neurologic disease in BPAN. Here we performed phenotypical characterization of a novel mouse model of BPAN, Wdr45_ex9+1g>a mouse. We identified hyperactive behavior and reduction of autophagy markers in brain tissue in Wdr45_ex9+1g>a hemizygous males as early as at 2 months of age. Given the early onset and spectrum of neurologic symptoms such as hyper-arousal and attention deficits in human patients, this model presents a disease-relevant phenotype and can be used in preclinical studies. We used this mouse model for a proof-of-concept study to evaluate whether AAV-mediated CNS-targeted gene transfer of WDR45 can provide therapeutic benefit and be considered a therapeutic paradigm for BPAN. We observed successful expression of human WDR45 transcripts and WIPI4 protein in the brain tissue, rescue of hyperactive behavior, and correction of autophagy markers in the brain tissue. This data demonstrates that WDR45 gene transfer can be a promising therapeutic strategy for BPAN.

">Decoding in the fourth dimension: Classification of temporal patterns and their generalization across locations</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscience research has increasingly used decoding techniques, in which multivariate statistical methods identify patterns in neural data that allow the classification of experimental conditions or participant groups. Typically, the features used for decoding are spatial in nature, including voxel patterns and electrode locations. However, the strength of many neurophysiological recording techniques such as electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography is in their rich temporal, rather than spatial, content. The present report proposes a new decoding method that relies on the time information contained in neural time series. This information is then used in a subsequent step, generalization across location (GAL), which characterizes the relationship between sensor locations based on their ability to cross-decode. Two datasets are used to demonstrate usage of this method, referred to as time-GAL, involving (1) event-related potentials in response to affective pictures and (2) steady-state visual evoked potentials in response to aversively conditioned grating stimuli. In both cases, experimental conditions were successfully decoded based on the temporal features contained in the neural time series. Cross-decoding occurred in regions known to be involved in visual and affective processing. We conclude that the time-GAL approach holds promise for analyzing neural time series from a wide range of paradigms and measurement domains providing an assumption-free method to quantifying differences in temporal patterns of neural information processing and whether these patterns are shared across sensor locations.

">Dissociation of novel open loop from ventral putamen to motor areas from classic closed loop in humans II: task-based function</a></h4>

              
                Humans ubiquitously increase the speed of their movements when motivated by incentives (i.e., capturing reward or avoiding loss). The complex interplay between incentivization and motor output is pertinent for unpacking the functional profiles of different circuits that link the basal ganglia with motor cortical areas. Here, we analyzed the functional profile of nodes forming two circuits involving putamen and motor cortical areas: the traditional "closed-loop circuit" (CLC) from sensorimotor dorsal putamen (PUTd) and a putative "open-loop circuit" (OLC) from ventral putamen (PUTv). Establishing differential function between CLC and OLC is particularly relevant for therapeutic approaches to Parkinson's disease, where OLC function is hypothesized to be relatively spared by the disease process. In a large sample fMRI study, 68 healthy controls executed speeded reaches with a joystick under different levels of incentivization to accurately hit precision targets. We dissociated effects of "incentive per se" (i.e., changes in brain activity when an upcoming movement obtains a reward or avoids a loss) from "RT effects" (i.e., brain activity that directly scales with adjustments to movement initiation time). Incentive per se was observed across sites in both CLC and OLC. However, RT effects were primarily in nodes of the OLC and motor sites, consistent with the hypothesized anatomy and function of OLC. Our findings additionally suggest valence might mediate when incentives recruit OLC to more prominent control of motor behavior.

">Extracting Auditory Emotion in Noise: A distributed auxiliary auditory network supporting affect processing of non-predictably obscured vocalisations</a></h4>

              
                Decoding affect information encoded within a vocally produced signal is a key part of daily communication. The acoustic channels that carry the affect information, however, are not uniformly distributed across a spectrotemporal space meaning that natural listening environments with dynamic, competing noise may unpredictably obscure some spectrotemporal regions of the vocalisation, reducing the potential information available to the listener. In this study, we utilise behavioural and functional MRI investigations to first assess which spectrotemporal regions of a human vocalisation contribute to affect perception in the listener, and then use a reverse-correlation fMRI analysis to see which structures underpin this perceptually challenging task when categorisation relevant acoustic information is unmasked by noise. Our results show that, despite the challenging task and non-uniformity of contributing spectral regions of affective vocalizations, a distributed network of (non-primary auditory) brain regions in the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, and lateral limbic regions supports affect processing in noise. Given the conditions for recruitment and previously established functional contributions of these regions, we propose that this task is underpinned by a reciprocal network between frontal cortical regions and ventral limbic regions that assist in flexible adaptation and tuning to stimuli, while a hippocampal and parahippocampal regions support the auditory systems processing of the degraded auditory information via associative and contextual processing.

">Phasic alertness generates urgency and amplifies competition between evidence accumulators</a></h4>

              
                Although phasic alertness generally benefits cognitive performance, it often increases the interference caused by distracting information, resulting in impaired decision-making and cognitive control. However, it is unclear why phasic alertness has these negative effects. Here, we present a novel, biologically-informed account, according to which phasic alertness generates an evidence-independent urgency signal. This urgency signal shortens overall response times, but also amplifies competition between evidence accumulators, thus slowing down decision-making and impairing cognitive control. The key assumptions of this account are supported with pupil measurements and electrophysiological data from human decision-makers performing an arrow flanker task. We also show that a computational model of the flanker task that incorporates time-varying urgency can reproduce the behavioral effects of phasic alertness, but only when the evidence accumulators compete with each other through lateral inhibition. Our results reveal a close interplay between dynamic changes in urgency, cognitive control and evidence accumulation.

">Common and unique neurophysiological signatures for the stopping and revising of actions reveal the temporal dynamics of inhibitory control</a></h4>

              
                Inhibitory control is a crucial cognitive-control ability for behavioral flexibility that has been extensively investigated through action-stopping tasks. Multiple neurophysiological features have been proposed to represent 'signatures' of inhibitory control during action-stopping, though the processes signified by these signatures are still controversially discussed. The present study aimed to disentangle these processes by comparing simple stopping situations with those in which additional action revisions were needed. Three experiments in female and male humans were performed to characterize the neurophysiological dynamics involved in action-stopping and -changing, with hypotheses derived from recently developed two-stage 'pause-then-cancel' models of inhibitory control. Both stopping and revising an action triggered an early broad 'pause'-process, marked by frontal EEG Beta-bursts and non-selective suppression of corticospinal excitability. However, partial-EMG responses showed that motor activity was only partially inhibited by this 'pause', and that this activity can be further modulated during action-revision. In line with two-stage models of inhibitory control, subsequent frontocentral EEG activity after this initial 'pause' selectively scaled depending on the required action revisions, with more activity observed for more complex revisions. This demonstrates the presence of a selective, effector-specific 'retune' phase as the second process involved in action-stopping and -revision. Together, these findings show that inhibitory control is implemented over an extended period of time and in at least two phases. We are further able to align the most commonly proposed neurophysiological signatures to these phases and show that they are differentially modulated by the complexity of action-revision.

">Sliding window functional connectivity inference with nonstationary autocorrelations and cross-correlations</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity (FC) is the degree of synchrony of time series between distinct, spatially separated brain regions. While traditional FC analysis assumes the temporal stationarity throughout a brain scan, there is growing recognition that connectivity can change over time and is not stationary, leading to the concept of dynamic FC (dFC). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can assess dFC using the sliding window method with the correlation analysis of fMRI signals. Accurate statistical inference of sliding window correlation must consider the autocorrelated nature of the time series. Currently, the dynamic consideration is mainly confined to the point estimation of sliding window correlations. Using in vivo resting-state fMRI data, we first demonstrate the non-stationarity in both the cross-correlation function (XCF) and the autocorrelation function (ACF). Then, we propose the variance estimation of the sliding window correlation considering the nonstationary of XCF and ACF. This approach provides a means to dynamically estimate confidence intervals in assessing dynamic connectivity. Using simulations, we compare the performance of the proposed method with other methods, showing the impact of dynamic ACF and XCF on connectivity inference. Accurate variance estimation can help in addressing the critical issue of false positivity and negativity.

	<p>Imbalance and falls in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) do not only reduce their quality of life but also their life expectancy. Aging-related symptoms as well as disease-specific motor and non-motor symptoms contribute to these conditions and should be treated when appropriate. In addition to an active lifestyle, advanced exercise training is useful and effective, especially for less medically responsive symptoms such as freezing of gait and postural instability at advanced stages. As treadmill training in non-immersive virtual reality, including dual tasks, significantly reduced the number of falls in PD patients, the mechanism(s) explaining this effect should be further investigated. Such research could help to select the most suitable patients and develop the most effective training protocols based on this novel technology. Real-life digital surrogate markers of mobility, such as those describing aspects of endurance, performance, and the complexity of specific movements, can further improve the quality of mobility assessment using wearables.</p>

                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an initial decline in declarative memory, while nondeclarative memory processing remains relatively intact. Error-based motor adaptation is traditionally seen as a form of nondeclarative memory, but recent findings suggest that it involves both fast, declarative, and slow, nondeclarative adaptive processes. If the declarative memory system shares resources with the fast process in motor adaptation, it can be hypothesized that the fast, but not the slow, process is disturbed in AD patients. To test this, we studied 20 early-stage AD patients and 21 age-matched controls of both sexes using a reach adaptation paradigm that relies on spontaneous recovery after sequential exposure to opposing force fields. Adaptation was measured using error clamps and expressed as an adaptation index (AI). Although patients with AD showed slightly lower adaptation to the force field than the controls, both groups demonstrated effects of spontaneous recovery. The time course of the AI was fitted by a hierarchical Bayesian two-state model in which each dynamic state is characterized by a retention and learning rate. Compared to controls, the retention rate of the fast process was the only parameter that was significantly different (lower) in the AD patients, confirming that the memory of the declarative, fast process is disturbed by AD. The slow adaptive process was virtually unaffected. Since the slow process learns only weakly from an error, our results provide neurocomputational evidence for the clinical practice of errorless learning of everyday tasks in people with dementia.</p>

                <p>In the rodent whisker system, active sensing and sensorimotor integration are mediated in part by the dynamic interactions between the motor cortex (M1) and somatosensory cortex (S1). However, understanding these dynamic interactions requires knowledge about the synapses and how specific neurons respond to their input. Here, we combined optogenetics, retrograde labeling, and electrophysiology to characterize the synaptic connections between M1 and layer 5 (L5) intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) neurons in S1 of mice (both sexes). We found that M1 synapses onto IT cells displayed modest short-term depression, whereas synapses onto PT neurons showed robust short-term facilitation. Despite M1 inputs to IT cells depressing, their slower kinetics resulted in summation and a response that increased during short trains. In contrast, summation was minimal in PT neurons due to the fast time course of their M1 responses. The functional consequences of this reduced summation, however, were outweighed by the strong facilitation at these M1 synapses, resulting in larger response amplitudes in PT neurons than IT cells during repetitive stimulation. To understand the impact of facilitating M1 inputs on PT output, we paired trains of inputs with single backpropagating action potentials, finding that repetitive M1 activation increased the probability of bursts in PT cells without impacting the time dependence of this coupling. Thus, there are two parallel but dynamically distinct systems of M1 synaptic excitation in L5 of S1, each defined by the short-term dynamics of its synapses, the class of postsynaptic neurons, and how the neurons respond to those inputs.</p>

                Near-death experience (NDE) is a transcendent mental event of uncertain etiology that arises on the cusp of biological death. Since the discovery of NDE in the mid-1970s, multiple neuroscientific theories have been developed in an attempt to account for it in strictly materialistic or reductionistic terms. Therefore, in this conception, NDE is at most an extraordinary hallucination without any otherworldly, spiritual, or supernatural denotations. During the last decade or so, a number of animal and clinical studies have emerged which reported that about the time of death, there may be a surge of high frequency electroencephalogram (EEG) at a time when cortical electrical activity is otherwise at a very low ebb. This oscillatory rhythm falls within the range of the enigmatic brain wave-labelled gamma-band activity (GBA). Therefore, it has been proposed that this brief, paradoxical, and perimortem burst of the GBA may represent the neural foundation of the NDE. This study examines three separate but related questions concerning this phenomenon. The first problem pertains to the electrogenesis of standard GBA and the extent to which authentic cerebral activity has been contaminated by myogenic artifacts. The second problem involves the question of whether agents that can mimic NDE are also underlain by GBA. The third question concerns the electrogenesis of the surge in GBA itself. It has been contended that this is neither cortical nor myogenic in origin. Rather, it arises in a subcortical (amygdaloid) location but is recorded at the cortex via volume conduction, thereby mimicking standard GBA. Although this surge of GBA contains genuine electrophysiological activity and is an intriguing and provocative finding, there is little evidence to suggest that it could act as a kind of neurobiological skeleton for a phenomenon such as NDE.

                Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused substantial morbidity and mortality on a global scale. A strong correlation has been found between COVID-19 treatment outcomes and noncommunicable diseases such as cancers. However, there is limited information on the outcomes of cancer patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19. Methods We conducted an analysis on data collected in a large prospective cohort study set-up by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC). All patients with laboratory-confirmed or clinically-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Cancer was defined as having a current solid organ or haematological malignancy. The following outcomes were assessed; 30-day in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of hospitalization and receipt of higher-level care. Results Of the 560,547 hospitalised individuals who were analysed, 27,243 (4.9%) had cancer. Overall, cancer patients were older and had more comorbidities than non-cancer patients. Patients with cancer had higher 30-day in-hospital mortality than non-cancer patients (29.1.3% vs 18.0%) and longer hospital stays (median of 12 days vs 8 days). However, patients with cancer were admitted less often to intensive care units than non-cancer patients (12.6% vs 17.1%) and received less invasive mechanical ventilation than non-cancer patients (4.5% vs 7.6%). The hazard ratio of dying from cancer, adjusted for age, sex and country income level was 1.18 (95%CI: 1.15-1.2). Conclusions This studyâs findings underscore the heightened vulnerability of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cancer, revealing a higher mortality rate, longer hospital stays, and an unstructured pattern of care that reflects the complexity of managing severely ill patients during a public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Background The 2013-2016 West African Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak resulted in 28,600 cases and 11,300 deaths officially reported to the World Health Organization. Previous studies investigating factors associated with death had conflicting findings, interventions showing promising outcomes had small sample sizes, studies were often single- or dual-country based and most focused on laboratory-confirmed EVD and not on clinically-suspected EVD. We used the Ebola data platform of the Infectious Disease Data Observatory (IDDO) to review individual patient records to assess factors associated with death, and particularly whether there were differences between laboratory-confirmed and clinically-suspected cases. Methods This was a cohort study involving analysis of secondary data in the IDDO database. The study population included all patients classified as having either clinically-suspected or laboratory-confirmed EVD, admitted to 22 Ebola Treatment Units (ETU) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between December 2013 and March 2016. Baseline characteristics and treatments were documented along with ETU exit outcomes. Factors associated with death were investigated by multivariable modified Poisson regression. Results There were 14,163 patients, of whom 6,208 (43.8%) were laboratory-confirmed and 7,955 (56.2%) were clinically-suspected. Outcomes were not recorded in 2,889 (20.4%) patients. Of the 11,274 patients with known outcomes, 4,090 (36.3%) died: 2,956 (43.6%) with laboratory-confirmed EVD and 1,134 (18.8%) with clinically-suspected EVD. The strongest risk factor for death was confirmed disease status. Patients with laboratory-confirmed disease had 2.9 times higher risk of death compared to clinically-suspected patients, after adjusting for other co-variables. Other factors significantly associated with death included a higher risk for patients aged â¥60 years and a lower risk for patients in Sierra Leone. Conclusions Although laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to ETUs fared worse than clinically-suspected patients, the latter still had a substantial risk of death and more attention needs to be paid to this group in future EVD outbreaks.

                Background Hypospadias is a common congenital anomaly of the penis characterized by ventral opening of urethra. This abnormality is often accompanied by scrotal abnormalities, where both penile and scrotal development occur at the same time during the fetal period. This study aims to analyze associated scrotal anomalies in children with hypospadias. Methods This is a retrospective cross-sectional study of boys diagnosed with hypospadias during a 6 years period. The age of patients, severity of hypospadias, and associated scrotal anomalies such as penoscrotal transposition (PST), bifid scrotum (BS), and scrotal hypoplasia were assessed. Scrotoplasty procedure was also recorded. The association between the severity of hypospadias, incidence of scrotal anomalies, severity of both PST and BF were analyzed using Chi-square test and alternatively Fisher exact test, p<0,05 considered significant. Results During the study period, there were 240 hypospadias patients, with a median age of 5,6 years. Most patients had severe hypospadias. Associated scrotal anomalies were found in 63,3% of patients. Incidence of scrotal anomaly was higher in patients with severe hypospadias (75%) compared to mild cases (75% vs 36.1%; p<0.001; PR= 2.08 (95% CI: 1.51 â 2.86)). Patients with severe hypospadias had a more severe PST, especially in bilateral minor and major forms compared to patients with mild cases (p<0.001); and was significantly associated with severe and partial type of SB (p<0.001). Patients with a more severe PST tend to have a more severe SB, on contrary, patients with minor PST tend to have a milder or even no BS (p<0.001). Scrotoplasty was performed in 35,4% of cases. Conclusion Most hypospadias patients had associated scrotal anomaly, in which severe hypospadias was associated with the more severe type of PST and BS.

                The Raman effect originates from spontaneous inelastic scattering of photons by matter. These photons provide a characteristic fingerprint of this matter, and are extensively utilized for chemical and biological sensing. The probability of generation, and hence the detection of these Raman scattered photons, is very low; hence, it is difficult to use this directly for sensing in complex matrices. To amplify this signal, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been extensively investigated and has emerged as a powerful analytical tool for sensing diverse analytes, including ions, small molecules, inorganics, organics, radionucleotides, and cells. Plasmonic nanoparticles, called hotspots, exhibit localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). This amplifies the Raman signal and may offer up to a 1010-fold SERS signal enhancement. The development of SERS active substrates requires further consideration and optimization of several critical features such as surface periodicity, hotspot density, mitigation of sample or surface autofluorescence, tuning of surface hydrophilicities, use of specific (bio) recognition elements with suitable linkers and bioconjugation chemistries, and use of appropriate optics to obtain relevant sensing outcomes in terms of sensitivity, cross-sensitivity, limit of detection, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), stability, shelf-life, and disposability. This article details the optimization of the aforementioned considerations in the use of disposable materials such as commercial grades of paper, textiles, glasses, polymers, and some specific substrates such as blue-ray digital versatile discs (DVDs) for use as SERS-active substrates for point-of-use (POU) sensing applications. The advancements in these technologies have been reviewed and critiqued for analyte detection in resource-limited settings, highlighting the prospects of applications ranging from single-molecule to single-cell detection.

                Background Tuberculosis is one of the diseases that requires comprehensive treatment. This disease is highly contagious and can be transmitted through the air. Climate factors play a role in the increasing cases of tuberculosis. This study aimed to determine the correlation between climatic variables and TB in Kolaka District, Southeast Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, Methods This research was modeled using an autoregressive (AR) Bayesian model with three possible likelihoods; Gaussian, Poisson and Negative Binomial responses. Results Minimum temperature and average temperature, a coefficient of 4.234 suggests that for every 1 degree increase in minimum temperature, there is an estimated increase of approximately four cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Maximum temperature, a coefficient of 17.851 suggests that for every 1 degree increase in maximum temperature, there is an estimated increase of around 17-18 cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Humidity, a coefficient of -13.413 suggests that for every 1% increase in humidity, there is an estimated decrease of around 13 cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Rainfall, a coefficient of -0.327 suggests that for every 1 mm increase in rainfall, there is an estimated decrease of around 0.327 cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Light, a coefficient of -4.322 suggests that for every 1-hour increase in light duration, there is an estimated decrease of around four cases, assuming other variables remain constant. Conclusions Climate change has a significant impact on tuberculosis through temperature-related factors. These factors influence the prevalence, spread, and vulnerability to TB. Addressing these challenges requires a holistic approach involving adaptation planning. Strong public health systems and healthcare infrastructure can help mitigate the risks and impacts of climate change-related tuberculosis.

                Background SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 46 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23â0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26â8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03â0.85). Conclusion Older and male COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of having diabetes compared to younger and female COVID-19 patients. As diabetes is a comorbidity in COVID-19, it can be concluded that old age and male sex are associated with a more severe disease.

                Introduction Actinomycosis is an uncommon inflammatory bacterial disease caused by Actinomyces species, especially Actinomyces Israeli. Abdominopelvic forms are relatively rare and may involve the colon as a solid mass, mimicking a malignant tumor. Case presentation A 68-year-old Tunisian man, with a history of diabetes, hypertension, penicillin allergy, and renal failure, presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, vomiting, and bowel obstruction. CT scan showed an acute intestinal obstruction upstream with obstructive tissular mass at the sigmoid colon. Emergency surgery revealed a sigmoid mass and a pre-perforative cecum. Subtotal colectomy was performed, with ileostomy and distal end closure. Histological examination confirmed Actinomyces infection. The patient was then placed on long-term doxycycline and Bactrim, with no recurrence over a 9-month follow-up period. Conclusion Abdominal actinomycosis, though rare, presents diagnostic challenges. It can be mistaken for malignancy, leading to unnecessary surgery in non-complicated cases, since it is effectively treated by antibiotics. In complicated cases, a combined approach involving both surgery and antibiotic therapy is necessary until the infection is completely eradicated.

<i>Candida albicans</i> is a commensal of the human microbiota that can form biofilms on implanted medical devices. These biofilms are tolerant to antifungals and to the host immune system. To identify novel genes modulating <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> biofilm formation, we performed a large-scale screen with 2,454 <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> doxycycline-dependent overexpression strains and identified 16 genes whose overexpression significantly hampered biofilm formation. Among those, overexpression of the <i>ZCF15</i> and <i>ZCF26</i> paralogs that encode transcription factors and have orthologs only in biofilm-forming species of the <i>Candida</i> clade, caused impaired biofilm formation both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, overexpression of <i>ZCF15</i> impeded biofilm formation without any defect in hyphal growth. Transcript profiling, transcription factor binding, and phenotypic microarray analyses conducted upon overexpression of <i>ZCF15</i> and <i>ZCF26</i> demonstrated their role in reprogramming cellular metabolism by regulating central metabolism including glyoxylate and tricarboxylic acid cycle genes. Taken together, this study has identified a new set of biofilm regulators, including <i>ZCF15</i> and <i>ZCF26</i>, that appear to control biofilm development through their specific role in metabolic remodeling.

Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy and the most significant contributor to mortality in female oncology patients. Potassium Two Pore Domain Channel Subfamily K Member 1 (KCNK1) is differentially expressed in a variety of tumors, but the mechanism of its function in breast cancer is unknown. In this study, we found for the first time that KCNK1 was significantly up-regulated in human breast cancer and was correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. KCNK1 promoted breast cancer proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and vivo. Further studies unexpectedly revealed that KCNK1 increased the glycolysis and lactate production in breast cancer cells by binding to and activating lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), which promoted histones lysine lactylation to induce the expression of a series of downstream genes and LDHA itself. Notably, increased expression of LDHA served as a vicious positive feedback to reduce tumor cell stiffness and adhesion, which eventually resulted in the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. In conclusion, our results suggest that KCNK1 may serve as a potential breast cancer biomarker, and deeper insight into the cancer-promoting mechanism of KCNK1 may uncover a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We have examined the number and distribution of NeuN-immunoreactive cortical white matter interstitial cells (WMICs) and compared them to the neurons in layers 1â6 across the overlying cortex in coronal sections from postnatal macaques. The data have been gathered from over 300 selected regions at gyral crowns, at sulci, and at linear regions of the cortex where we also determined cortical layer thicknesses: standard thicknesses and tangential thicknesses. Cortical thicknesses and cell numbers showed variability according to gyral, linear, or sulcal regions. In spite of these variations, our standardized cell numbers in layers 1 to 6b and interstitial cells underlying layer 6b-white matter boundary have shown a consistent correlation between the number of WMICs and the number of layer 5 and 6a cortical neurons on all cortical regions studied: for each WMIC, there are on the order of five cortical neurons in layer 5 and approximately three cortical neurons in layer 6a, irrespective of the origins of the selected cortical area or whether they are from gyral, linear, or sulcal regions. We propose that the number of interstitial neurons in the postnatal macaque cortex is correlated to the density of neurons within layers 5 and 6a and, from a clinical perspective, the change in density or distribution of interstitial neurons in schizophrenia or epilepsy may in fact be linked to the number of layers 5 and 6a neurons.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the brain, connectivity determines function. Neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PB) relay diverse information to widespread brain regions, but the connections and functions of PB neurons that express <i>Nps</i> (neuropeptide S, NPS) remain mysterious. Here, we use Cre-dependent anterograde tracing and whole-brain analysis to map their output connections. While many other PB neurons project ascending axons through the central tegmental tract, NPS axons reach the forebrain via distinct periventricular and ventral pathways. Along the periventricular pathway, NPS axons target the tectal longitudinal column and periaqueductal gray, then continue rostrally to target the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus. Along the ventral pathway, NPS axons blanket much of the hypothalamus but avoid the ventromedial and mammillary nuclei. They also project prominently to the ventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, A13 cell group, and magnocellular subparafasciular nucleus. In the hindbrain, NPS axons have fewer descending projections, targeting primarily the superior salivatory nucleus, nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, and periolivary region. Combined with what is known already about NPS and its receptor, the output pattern of <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons in the PB region predicts roles in threat response and circadian behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23620?af=R">Temporal organization of narrative recall is present but attenuated in adults with hippocampal amnesia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Studies of the impact of brain injury on memory processes often focus on the quantity and episodic richness of those recollections. Here, we argue that the organization of one's recollections offers critical insights into the impact of brain injury on functional memory. It is well-established in studies of word list memory that free recall of unrelated words exhibits a clear temporal organization. This <i>temporal contiguity effect</i> refers to the fact that the order in which word lists are recalled reflects the original presentation order. Little is known, however, about the organization of recall for semantically rich materials, nor how recall organization is impacted by hippocampal damage and memory impairment. The present research is the first study, to our knowledge, of temporal organization in semantically rich narratives in three groups: (1) Adults with bilateral hippocampal damage and severe declarative memory impairment, (2) adults with bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) damage and no memory impairment, and (3) demographically matched non-brain-injured comparison participants. We find that although the narrative recall of adults with bilateral hippocampal damage reflected the temporal order in which those narratives were experienced above chance levels, their temporal contiguity effect was significantly attenuated relative to comparison groups. In contrast, individuals with vmPFC damage did not differ from non-brain-injured comparison participants in temporal contiguity. This pattern of group differences yields insights into the cognitive and neural systems that support the use of temporal organization in recall. These data provide evidence that the retrieval of temporal context in narrative recall is hippocampal-dependent, whereas damage to the vmPFC does not impair the temporal organization of narrative recall. This evidence of limited but demonstrable organization of memory in participants with hippocampal damage and amnesia speaks to the power of narrative structures in supporting meaningfully organized recall despite memory impairment.</p>

                Background Tuberculosis (TB) remains a key contributor to global mortality; ranks second as the most fatal infectious disease and seventh among the top ten causes of death in Ghana. There is insufficient literature regarding the utilization of Bayesian hierarchical models for examining the spatial and spatio-temporal dynamics of tuberculosis risk in Ghana. Aim This study addresses this gap by determining TB hotspots regions in Ghana using the Bayesian modeling framework. Methods TB data were obtained from the Ghana Health Service and National Tuberculosis Programme for the 10 administrative regions of Ghana, from 2008 to 2017. Spatial and spatio-temporal TB relative risk for each region were estimated under the Bayesian modeling frameworks. Maps for TB risks were created to visualized regions with TB hotspots. Model fitting and parameter estimation were conducted using integrated nested Laplace approximation via R version 4.3.2. Results Among the baseline predictors, TB cure rate, TB success rate, knowledge about TB, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence, percentage of literacy, and high income were found to be most significant predictors of TB risk in Ghana. We noted an increased risk of TB infection in the Northern zone and the Eastern and Greater Accra regions in the Southern zone. Spatio-temporal distribution of TB infection risk was predominantly concentrated in the Southern zone. Clustering of TB risk was observed among neighboring regions. Conclusion Factors influencing tuberculosis (TB) risk in Ghana are TB cure rate, TB success rate, knowledge about TB, HIV prevalence, literacy rate, and income level. The risk distribution was mainly concentrated in the Southern zone, with clusters of TB risk observed among neighboring regions. To achieve a significant reduction in TB cases, it is essential to allocate resources to TB hotspots regions and also implement measures to control significant predictors of TB infection risk.

                About 10 to 20% of reported pregnancies have complications like spontaneous abortion (SA), preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB), and fetal growth restriction (FGR); 60% are attributed to maternal nutritional alterations. Multiple micronutrients (MMN) are supplemented in the antenatal period, but no proper validation/guidelines are available regarding dosing/time, the need for initiation, and the duration of supplementation. Studies have reported adverse pregnancy complications related to the overuse/unwanted use of multiple micronutrient supplementations during pregnancy. Identifying the exact population requiring supplementation is necessary to prevent its abuse. This article attempts to review the impacts of micronutrient deficiency/supplementation in cases of SA, FGR, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preterm delivery and PE. The study used a literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar, Mendeley, and Scopus Databases using search words pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), fetal growth restriction (FGR), preterm delivery, preeclampsia (PE) or âadverse pregnancyâ associated with minerals, micronutrients, or supplementation. The review also considered in-house literature databases, a single-window search at Kasturba Medical College (KMC) Health sciences library, MAHE (Manipal Academy of Higher Education). The figures included in the study were created by Biorender.com. Micronutrients play multiple roles during pregnancy and fetoplacental growth stimulating growth hormone secretion, Lysyl oxidase (LOX), involved in the crosslinking between collagen and elastin in the amniotic membrane, downregulation of interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, Il-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and several chemokines involved in hypertension, immune-inflammatory pathways, attenuate insulin resistance, structural development of neurons and glia. Over-supplementation has led to complications such as spontaneous abortion and gestational diabetes mellitus. Since there is a lack of standardization concerning micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy, there is a need for systematic study related to the role of micronutrients during each trimester of pregnancy to optimize its supplementation and to prevent hazards associated with its abuse.

                Background Undescended testes (UDT) is a condition where one or both testes is absent in the scrotum. The general age recommendation in which the treatment should be performed is before 18 months old due to the infertility risk and malignancy in later life. On the other hand, in post-pubertal UDT, the current guideline recommends orchiectomy; however, this recommendation is weak. Therefore, this study aimed to provide a systematic review of post-pubertal UDT treatment, focusing on the malignancy risk point of view. Methods A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Wiley Online Library and the Cochrane Library up to 5 March 2023. Any study with either post-pubertal orchiectomy or orchidopexy in patients with UDT and reporting the testicular malignancy was included. The exclusion criteria were studies with lack of information of UDT correction time, no history of correction and the full text wasnât available. The data collected were the occurrence of testicular malignancy in post-pubertal UDT patients corrected with any method. Quality and bias assessment was assessed with Newcastle-Ottawa scale and Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Results Seven articles (three case reports and four observational studies) were reviewed with a total of 42 patients who underwent post-pubertal correction of either unilateral or bilateral UDT. The correction age ranged from 13 to 34 years old, with follow-up of 48.7â252 months. Among those who developed malignancies, the most common were seminoma, teratoma and carcinoma in situ of the testes. In addition, this study was able to propose an algorithm for post-pubertal UDT treatment strategy. Conclusions The scarce resource was the main limitation of this study. Nevertheless, this review showed that post-pubertal UDT management should be tailored individually. Several factors that should be considered include the condition of the contralateral descended testis, UDT location, serum testosterone level, patientâs age, comorbidities, and interest in fertility.

                Sudden deafness is a common cause of emergency consultation in otology. Usually, despite investigations, no etiology is known. Intracochlear hemorrhage is a rare cause of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) and may be associated with various labyrinthine disorders. In such cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the clef of the diagnosis. We report the case of a 70-year-old patient who was referred to our department for sudden hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. Otoscopic and neurological examinations were normal, and pure-tone audiometry revealed left profound sensorineural hearing loss. Videonystagmography (VNG) revealed left vestibular deficit. MRI demonstrated a high signal intensity inside the cochlea on unenhanced T1-weighted images, and no other abnormalities were found; in particular, no enhancement after intravenous administration of gadolinium. No etiology was identified. Vertigo disappeared rapidly with corticosteroid treatment and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, but hearing did not improve. Intra-labyrinthine hemorrhage causing SSNHL is rare, and the hearing prognosis is poor.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-328/v2?src=rss">Accuracy of nurse-based Cipto Triage Method in the emergency department [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The Cipto Triage Method (CTM) is a method developed in Indonesia for assessing the clinical acuity of emergency department patients. To evaluate the accuracy of the CTM, this study compared triage decisions using the CTM performed by nurses to the triage decisions performed by emergency medical officers (EMO). Methods This cross-sectional diagnostic study was performed in a single-centre referral hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Adult patients who attended the emergency department (ED) met the inclusion criteria. Trauma cases, pregnancy, and psychiatric disorders were excluded. All eligible patients underwent triage assessment based on CTM by a triage nurse and were then referred to the ED treatment zone for triage assessment performed by an EMO. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratio were calculated. Results Between April and July 2022, 902 participants were randomly selected. The overall accuracy of the triage assessment of the index test was 84.7%, and the PPV of resuscitation and urgent triage was very good (90.5% and 84.5%, respectively). In the non-urgent category, the PPV was acceptable (72%), but the NPV was very good (92.2%). Conclusions Nurse-based triage assessment using CTM in the ED had very good accuracy in determining clinical acuity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94748">Coordinated molecular and ecological adaptations underlie a highly successful parasitoid</a></h4>

              
                The success of an organism depends on the molecular and ecological adaptations that promote its beneficial fitness. Parasitoids are valuable biocontrol agents for successfully managing agricultural pests, and they have evolved diversified strategies to adapt to both the physiological condition of hosts and the competition of other parasitoids. Here, we deconstructed the parasitic strategies in a highly successful parasitoid, <i>Trichopria drosophilae</i>, which parasitizes a broad range of <i>Drosophila</i> hosts, including the globally invasive species <i>D. suzukii</i>. We found that <i>T. drosophilae</i> had developed specialized venom proteins that arrest host development to obtain more nutrients via secreting tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), as well as a unique type of cellâteratocytesâthat digest host tissues for feeding by releasing trypsin proteins. In addition to the molecular adaptations that optimize nutritional uptake, this pupal parasitoid has evolved ecologically adaptive strategies including the conditional tolerance of intraspecific competition to enhance parasitic success in older hosts and the obligate avoidance of interspecific competition with larval parasitoids. Our study not only demystifies how parasitoids weaponize themselves to colonize formidable hosts but also provided empirical evidence of the intricate coordination between the molecular and ecological adaptations that drive evolutionary success.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96876">Drosophila medulla neuroblast termination via apoptosis, differentiation and gliogenic switch is scheduled by the depletion of the neuroepithelial stem cell pool</a></h4>

              
                The brain is consisted of diverse neurons arising from a limited number of neural stem cells. <i>Drosophila</i> neural stem cells called neuroblasts (NBs) produces specific neural lineages of various lineage sizes depending on their location in the brain. In the <i>Drosophila</i> visual processing centre - the optic lobes (OLs), medulla NBs derived from the neuroepithelium (NE) give rise to neurons and glia cells of the medulla cortex. The timing and the mechanisms responsible for the cessation of medulla NBs are so far not known. In this study, we show that the termination of medulla NBs during early pupal development is determined by the exhaustion of the NE stem cell pool. Hence, altering NE-NB transition during larval neurogenesis disrupts the timely termination of medulla NBs. Medulla NBs terminate neurogenesis via a combination of apoptosis, terminal symmetric division via Prospero, and a switch to gliogenesis via Glial Cell Missing (Gcm), however, these processes occur independently of each other. We also show that temporal progression of the medulla NBs is mostly not required for their termination. As the <i>Drosophila</i> OL shares a similar mode of division with mammalian neurogenesis, understanding when and how these progenitors cease proliferation during development can have important implications for mammalian brain size determination and regulation of its overall function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84747">Arabidopsis transcriptome responses to low water potential using high-throughput plate assays</a></h4>

              
                Soil-free assays that induce water stress are routinely used to investigate drought responses in the plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Due to their ease of use, the research community often relies on polyethylene glycol (PEG), mannitol, and salt (NaCl) treatments to reduce the water potential of agar media, and thus induce drought conditions in the laboratory. However, while these types of stress can create phenotypes that resemble those of water deficit experienced by soil-grown plants, it remains unclear how these treatments compare at the transcriptional level. Here, we demonstrate that these different methods of lowering water potential elicit both shared and distinct transcriptional responses in <i>Arabidopsis</i> shoot and root tissue. When we compared these transcriptional responses to those found in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots subject to vermiculite drying, we discovered many genes induced by vermiculite drying were repressed by low water potential treatments on agar plates (and vice versa). Additionally, we also tested another method for lowering water potential of agar media. By increasing the nutrient content and tensile strength of agar, we show the âhard agarâ (HA) treatment can be leveraged as a high-throughput assay to investigate natural variation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> growth responses to low water potential.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/81698">Discovery of runs-of-homozygosity diplotype clusters and their associations with diseases in UK Biobank</a></h4>

              
                Runs of homozygosity (ROH) segments, contiguous homozygous regions in a genome were traditionally linked to families and inbred populations. However, a growing literature suggests that ROHs are ubiquitous in outbred populations. Still, most existing genetic studies of ROH in populations are limited to aggregated ROH content across the genome, which does not offer the resolution for mapping causal loci. This limitation is mainly due to a lack of methods for the efficient identification of shared ROH diplotypes. Here, we present a new method, ROH-DICE, to find large ROH diplotype clusters, sufficiently long ROHs shared by a sufficient number of individuals, in large cohorts. ROH-DICE identified over 1 million ROH diplotypes that span over 100 SNPs and are shared by more than 100 UK Biobank participants. Moreover, we found significant associations of clustered ROH diplotypes across the genome with various self-reported diseases, with the strongest associations found between the extended HLA region and autoimmune disorders. We found an association between a diplotype covering the HFE gene and hemochromatosis, even though the well-known causal SNP was not directly genotyped or imputed. Using a genome-wide scan, we identified a putative association between carriers of an ROH diplotype in chromosome 4 and an increase in mortality among COVID-19 patients (P-value=1.82Ã10<sup>-11</sup>). In summary, our ROH-DICE method, by calling out large ROH diplotypes in a large outbred population, enables further population genetics into the demographic history of large populations. More importantly, our method enables a new genome-wide mapping approach for finding disease-causing loci with multi-marker recessive effects at a population scale.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94547">The non-mitotic role of HMMR in regulating the localization of TPX2 and the dynamics of microtubules in neurons</a></h4>

              
                A functional nervous system is built upon the proper morphogenesis of neurons to establish the intricate connection between them. The microtubule cytoskeleton is known to play various essential roles in this morphogenetic process. While many microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) have been demonstrated to participate in neuronal morphogenesis, the function of many more remains to be determined. This study focuses on a MAP called HMMR in mice, which was originally identified as a hyaluronan binding protein and later found to possess microtubule and centrosome binding capacity. HMMR exhibits high abundance on neuronal microtubules and altering the level of HMMR significantly affects the morphology of neurons. Instead of confining to the centrosome(s) like cells in mitosis, HMMR localizes to microtubules along axons and dendrites. Furthermore, transiently expressing HMMR enhances the stability of neuronal microtubules and increases the formation frequency of growing microtubules along the neurites. HMMR regulates the microtubule localization of a non-centrosomal microtubule nucleator TPX2 along the neurite, offering an explanation for how HMMR contributes to the promotion of growing microtubules. This study sheds light on how cells utilize proteins involved in mitosis for non-mitotic functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88985">The Alk receptor tyrosine kinase regulates Sparkly, a novel activity regulating neuropeptide precursor in the Drosophila central nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Numerous roles for the Alk receptor tyrosine kinase have been described in <i>Drosophila</i>, including functions in the central nervous system (CNS), however the molecular details are poorly understood. To gain mechanistic insight, we employed Targeted DamID (TaDa) transcriptional profiling to identify targets of Alk signaling in the larval CNS. TaDa was employed in larval CNS tissues, while genetically manipulating Alk signaling output. The resulting TaDa data were analyzed together with larval CNS scRNA-seq datasets performed under similar conditions, identifying a role for Alk in the transcriptional regulation of neuroendocrine gene expression. Further integration with bulk and scRNA-seq datasets from larval brains in which Alk signaling was manipulated identified a previously uncharacterized <i>Drosophila</i> neuropeptide precursor encoded by <i>CG4577</i> as an Alk signaling transcriptional target. <i>CG4577</i>, which we named <i>Sparkly (Spar)</i>, is expressed in a subset of Alk-positive neuroendocrine cells in the developing larval CNS, including circadian clock neurons. In agreement with our TaDa analysis, overexpression of the <i>Drosophila</i> Alk ligand Jeb resulted in increased levels of Spar protein in the larval CNS. We show that Spar protein is expressed in circadian (clock) neurons, and flies lacking Spar exhibit defects in sleep and circadian activity control. In summary, we report a novel activity regulating neuropeptide precursor gene that is regulated by Alk signaling in the <i>Drosophila</i> CNS.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89889">Choline supplementation in early life improves and low levels of choline can impair outcomes in a mouse model of Alzheimerâs disease</a></h4>

              
                Maternal choline supplementation (MCS) improves cognition in Alzheimerâs disease (AD) models. However, the effects of MCS on neuronal hyperexcitability in AD are unknown. We investigated the effects of MCS in a well-established mouse model of AD with hyperexcitability, the Tg2576 mouse. The most common type of hyperexcitability in Tg2576 mice are generalized EEG spikes (interictal spikes [IIS]). IIS also are common in other mouse models and occur in AD patients. In mouse models, hyperexcitability is also reflected by elevated expression of the transcription factor âFosB in the granule cells (GCs) of the dentate gyrus (DG), which are the principal cell type. Therefore, we studied ÎFosB expression in GCs. We also studied the neuronal marker NeuN within hilar neurons of the DG because reduced NeuN protein expression is a sign of oxidative stress or other pathology. This is potentially important because hilar neurons regulate GC excitability. Tg2576 breeding pairs received a diet with a relatively low, intermediate, or high concentration of choline. After weaning, all mice received the intermediate diet. In offspring of mice fed the high choline diet, IIS frequency declined, GC âFosB expression was reduced, and hilar NeuN expression was restored. Using the novel object location task, spatial memory improved. In contrast, offspring exposed to the relatively low choline diet had several adverse effects, such as increased mortality. They had the weakest hilar NeuN immunoreactivity and greatest GC ÎFosB protein expression. However, their IIS frequency was low, which was surprising. The results provide new evidence that a diet high in choline in early life can improve outcomes in a mouse model of AD, and relatively low choline can have mixed effects. This is the first study showing that dietary choline can regulate hyperexcitability, hilar neurons, ÎFosB, and spatial memory in an animal model of AD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90735">A novel method for estimating properties of attentional oscillators reveals an age-related decline in flexibility</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic attending theory proposes that the ability to track temporal cues in the auditory environment is governed by entrainment, the synchronization between internal oscillations and regularities in external auditory signals. Here, we focused on two key properties of internal oscillators: their preferred rate, the default rate in the absence of any input; and their flexibility, how they adapt to changes in rhythmic context. We developed methods to estimate oscillator properties (Experiment 1) and compared the estimates across tasks and individuals (Experiment 2). Preferred rates, estimated as the stimulus rates with peak performance, showed a harmonic relationship across measurements and were correlated with individualsâ <i>spontaneous motor tempo</i>. Estimates from motor tasks were slower than those from the perceptual task, and the degree of slowing was consistent for each individual. Task performance decreased with trial-to-trial changes in stimulus rate, and responses on individual trials were biased toward the preceding trialâs stimulus properties. Flexibility, quantified as an individualâs ability to adapt to faster-than-previous rates, decreased with age. These findings show domain-specific rate preferences for the assumed oscillatory system underlying rhythm perception and production, and that this system loses its ability to flexibly adapt to changes in the external rhythmic context during aging.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90606">Automated multiconformer model building for X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM</a></h4>

              
                In their folded state, biomolecules exchange between multiple conformational states that are crucial for their function. Traditional structural biology methods, such as X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), produce density maps that are ensemble averages, reflecting molecules in various conformations. Yet, most models derived from these maps explicitly represent only a single conformation, overlooking the complexity of biomolecular structures. To accurately reflect the diversity of biomolecular forms, there is a pressing need to shift toward modeling structural ensembles that mirror the experimental data. However, the challenge of distinguishing signal from noise complicates manual efforts to create these models. In response, we introduce the latest enhancements to qFit, an automated computational strategy designed to incorporate protein conformational heterogeneity into models built into density maps. These algorithmic improvements in qFit are substantiated by superior R<sub>free</sub> and geometry metrics across a wide range of proteins. Importantly, unlike more complex multicopy ensemble models, the multiconformer models produced by qFit can be manually modified in most major model building software (e.g., Coot) and fit can be further improved by refinement using standard pipelines (e.g., Phenix, Refmac, Buster). By reducing the barrier of creating multiconformer models, qFit can foster the development of new hypotheses about the relationship between macromolecular conformational dynamics and function.

	<p>Aim: Remethylation disorders such as 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency reduce the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. The resulting hyperhomocysteinemia can lead to serious neurological consequences and multisystem toxicity. The role of MTHFR genotypes has not been investigated in patients with Rett Syndrome (RTT). In this study, we sought to assess the impact of co-occurring MTHFR genotypes on symptom profiles in RTT. Method: Using pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing, the MTHFR genetic polymorphisms rs1801133 (c.665C&amp;amp;gt;T mutation) and rs1801131 (c.1286A&amp;amp;gt;C mutation) were determined in 65 patients (18.7 years &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.1 [mean &amp;amp;plusmn; standard deviation]) with RTT as part of routine clinical care within the Centre for Interventional Paediatric Psychopharmacology (CIPP) Rett Centre, a National and Specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) in the UK. The clinical severity of patients was assessed using the RTT-anchored Clinical Global Impression Scale (RTT-CGI). Results: The clinical severity symptom distribution varied between the homozygous and heterozygous MTHFR rs1801133 and rs1801131 genotypes. Those with the homozygous genotype had a narrower spread of severity scores across several domains (language and communication, ambulation, hand-use and eye contact clinical domains). Patients with the homozygous genotype had statistically significantly greater CGI-Severity scores than individuals with a non-homozygous MTHFR genotype (Z = &amp;amp;minus;2.44, p = 0.015). When comparing the ratings of moderately impaired (4), markedly impaired (5), severely impaired (6) and extremely impaired (7), individuals with the homozygous MTHFR genotype were more impaired than those with the non-homozygous MTHFR genotype (Z = &amp;amp;minus;2.06, p = 0.039). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of prescribed anti-epileptic drugs between the genotypes. Conclusions: Our findings show that in those with a pathogenic RTT genetic variant, co-occurring homozygotic MTHFR rs1801133 and rs1801131 polymorphisms may act as associative genetic modifiers of clinical severity in a subset of patients. Profiling of rs1801133 and rs1801131 in RTT may therefore be useful, especially for high-risk patients who may be at the most risk from symptom deterioration.</p>

	<p>Attention is an essential psychological component in sports games, which conditions sports success. The purpose of this study was to identify the attention style (internal or external) and the weight of attention qualities depending on the practiced team sport (basketball, volleyball, or handball) and gender (female or male), in athletes aged 15&amp;amp;ndash;18. A total of 177 active athletes (87 female (mean age &amp;amp;plusmn; standard deviation: 16.07 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.94 years) and 90 male (mean age &amp;amp;plusmn; standard deviation: 15.96 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.82 years)) were involved in the study, including 62 handball players (28 female and 34 male), 58 volleyball players (30 female and 28 male) and 57 basketball players (29 female and 28 male). In the study, two questionnaires were applied: one implemented to identify the attentive style with the two dimensions internal and external (standardized), called questionnaire for the assessment of attentional style in athletes (QASA), and one designed by us, called questionnaire to identify the weights of attention qualities according to the characteristics of the practiced sport (QAQCS), aiming to identify the most relevant quality of attention, depending on the practiced sport. Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha for both questionnaires was between 0.701 and 0.855. The results recorded in the present study reveal a variation in the attentional style between the groups of athletes and between genders. The results of the study highlight that in handball, girls have a predominantly external style with a total of 10.213 points; in boys&amp;amp;rsquo; handball, the predominant focus of attention is internal with a total score of 9.087 points. Girls&amp;amp;rsquo; volleyball focus of attention is predominantly external, with 8.999 points; in boys&amp;amp;rsquo; volleyball, the attention style is internal, registering a score of 9.713 points. In girls&amp;amp;rsquo; basketball, the predominant focus of attention is internal, with a total score of 8.516 points; in boys&amp;amp;rsquo; basketball, the external attention style is predominant, with 9.213 points. Looking at the weight of attention qualities, it was found that the most relevant for girls is concentration and mobility for handball players, stability was identified in volleyball, and distributiveness in basketball. In boys&amp;amp;rsquo; handball teams, mobility is the most essential, just like in basketball, and in volleyball it was found that stability has the biggest impact. ANOVA analysis highlighted statistically significant differences between groups of sports games by gender category, at both subscales of (QASA), as well as QAQCS, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05. The results of our study highlight differences between the attentional styles and their qualities in relation to the gender and the specific sport played, which determines differentiated approaches to these psychological components</p>

	<p>The original conceptualization of REM sleep as paradoxical sleep was based on its EEG resembling wakefulness and its association with dreaming. Over time, the concept of paradox was expanded to include various associations with REM sleep, such as dream exclusivity, high recall, and pathophysiology. However, none of these associations are unique to REM sleep; they can also occur in other sleep states. Today, after more than fifty years of focused research, two aspects of REMS clearly retain paradoxical exclusivity. Despite the persistent contention that the EEG of human REMS consists of wake-like, low-voltage, non-synchronous electrical discharges, REMS is based on and defined by the intracranial electrical presence of 5&amp;amp;ndash;8 Hz. theta, which has always been the marker of REMS in other animals. The wake-like EEG used to define REMS on human polysomnography is secondary to a generalized absence of electrophysiological waveforms because the strong waves of intracranial theta do not propagate to scalp electrodes placed outside the skull. It is a persistent paradox that the theta frequency is restricted to a cyclical intracranial dynamic that does not extend beyond the lining of the brain. REMS has a persistent association with narratively long and salient dream reports. However, the extension of this finding to equate REMS with dreaming led to a foundational error in neuroscientific logic. Major theories and clinical approaches were built upon this belief despite clear evidence that dreaming is reported throughout sleep in definingly different physiologic and phenomenological forms. Few studies have addressed the differences between the dreams reported from the different stages of sleep so that today, the most paradoxical aspect of REMS dreaming may be how little the state has actually been studied. An assessment of the differences in dreaming between sleep stages could provide valuable insights into how dreaming relates to the underlying brain activity and physiological processes occurring during each stage. The brain waves and dreams of REMS persist as being paradoxically unique and different from waking and the other states of sleep consciousness.</p>

                <p>Formation and retrieval of remote contextual memory depends on cortical engram neurons that are defined during learning. Manipulation of astrocytic G<SUB>q</SUB> and G<SUB>i</SUB> associated G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling has been shown to affect memory processing, but little is known about the role of cortical astrocytic G<SUB>s</SUB>-GPCR signaling in remote memory acquisition and the functioning of cortical engram neurons. We assessed this by chemogenetic manipulation of astrocytes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of male mice, during either encoding or consolidation of a contextual fear memory, while simultaneously labeling cortical engram neurons. We found that stimulation of astrocytic G<SUB>s</SUB> signaling during memory encoding and consolidation did not alter remote memory expression. In line with this, the size of the mPFC engram population and the recall-induced reactivation of these neurons was unaffected. Hence, our data indicate that activation of G<SUB>s</SUB>-GPCR signaling in cortical astrocytes is not sufficient to alter memory performance and functioning of cortical engram neurons.</p>

                <p>How features of complex visual patterns are combined to drive perception and eye movements is not well understood. Here we simultaneously assessed human observers&rsquo; perceptual direction estimates and ocular following responses (OFR) evoked by moving plaids made from two summed gratings with varying contrast ratios. When the gratings were of equal contrast, observers&rsquo; eye movements and perceptual reports followed the motion of the plaid pattern. However, when the contrasts were unequal, eye movements and reports during early phases of the OFR were biased toward the direction of the high-contrast grating component; during later phases, both responses followed the plaid pattern direction. The shift from component- to pattern-driven behavior resembles the shift in tuning seen under similar conditions in neuronal responses recorded from monkey MT. Moreover, for some conditions, pattern tracking and perceptual reports were correlated on a trial-by-trial basis. The OFR may therefore provide a precise behavioral readout of the dynamics of neural motion integration for complex visual patterns.</p>

                <p>by Soraya Mirzaei, Mojtaba Tefagh</p>

Microbial communities play fundamental roles in every complex ecosystem, such as soil, sea and the human body. The stability and diversity of the microbial community depend precisely on the composition of the microbiota. Any change in the composition of these communities affects microbial functions. An important goal of studying the interactions between species is to understand the behavior of microbes and their responses to perturbations. These interactions among species are mediated by the exchange of metabolites within microbial communities. We developed a computational model for the microbial community that has a separate compartment for exchanging metabolites. This model can predict possible metabolites that cause competition, commensalism, and mutual interactions between species within a microbial community. Our constraint-based community metabolic modeling approach provides insights to elucidate the pattern of metabolic interactions for each common metabolite between two microbes. To validate our approach, we used a toy model and a syntrophic co-culture of <i>Desulfovibrio vulgaris</i> and <i>Methanococcus maripaludis</i>, as well as another in co-culture between <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i> and <i>Rhodoferax ferrireducens</i>. For a more general evaluation, we applied our algorithm to the honeybee gut microbiome, composed of seven species, and the epiphyte strain <i>Pantoea eucalypti 299R</i>. The epiphyte strain Pe299R has been previously studied and cultured with six different phyllosphere bacteria. Our algorithm successfully predicts metabolites, which imply mutualistic, competitive, or commensal interactions. In contrast to OptCom, MRO, and MICOM algorithms, our COMMA algorithm shows that the potential for competitive interactions between an epiphytic species and Pe299R is not significant. These results are consistent with the experimental measurements of population density and reproductive success of the Pe299R strain.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be used for non-invasive evaluation of hemodynamics. However, its routine use is limited by labor-intensive manual segmentation, CFD mesh creation, and time-consuming simulation. This study aims to train a deep learning model to both generate patient-specific volume-meshes of the pulmonary artery from 3D cardiac MRI data and directly estimate CFD flow fields. This proof-of-concept study used 135 3D cardiac MRIs from both a public and private dataset. The pulmonary arteries in the MRIs were manually segmented and converted into volume-meshes. CFD simulations were performed on ground truth meshes and interpolated onto point-point correspondent meshes to create the ground truth dataset. The dataset was split 110/10/15 for training, validation, and testing. Image2Flow, a hybrid image and graph convolutional neural network, was trained to transform a pulmonary artery template to patient-specific anatomy and CFD values, taking a specific inlet velocity as an additional input. Image2Flow was evaluated in terms of segmentation, and the accuracy of predicted CFD was assessed using node-wise comparisons. In addition, the ability of Image2Flow to respond to increasing inlet velocities was also evaluated. Image2Flow achieved excellent segmentation accuracy with a median Dice score of 0.91 (IQR: 0.86â0.92). The median node-wise normalized absolute error for pressure and velocity magnitude was 11.75% (IQR: 9.60â15.30%) and 9.90% (IQR: 8.47â11.90), respectively. Image2Flow also showed an expected response to increased inlet velocities with increasing pressure and velocity values. This proof-of-concept study has shown that it is possible to simultaneously perform patient-specific volume-mesh based segmentation and pressure and flow field estimation using Image2Flow. Image2Flow completes segmentation and CFD in ~330ms, which is ~5000 times faster than manual methods, making it more feasible in a clinical environment.

                <p>by Lars DâHondt, Friedl De Groote, Maarten Afschrift</p>

The unique structure of the human foot is seen as a crucial adaptation for bipedalism. The footâs arched shape enables stiffening the foot to withstand high loads when pushing off, without compromising foot flexibility. Experimental studies demonstrated that manipulating foot stiffness has considerable effects on gait. In clinical practice, altered foot structure is associated with pathological gait. Yet, experimentally manipulating individual foot properties (e.g. arch height or tendon and ligament stiffness) is hard and therefore our understanding of how foot structure influences gait mechanics is still limited. Predictive simulations are a powerful tool to explore causal relationships between musculoskeletal properties and whole-body gait. However, musculoskeletal models used in three-dimensional predictive simulations assume a rigid foot arch, limiting their use for studying how foot structure influences three-dimensional gait mechanics. Here, we developed a four-segment foot model with a longitudinal arch for use in predictive simulations. We identified three properties of the ankle-foot complex that are important to capture ankle and knee kinematics, soleus activation, and ankle power of healthy adults: (1) compliant Achilles tendon, (2) stiff heel pad, (3) the ability to stiffen the foot. The latter requires sufficient arch height and contributions of plantar fascia, and intrinsic and extrinsic foot muscles. A reduced ability to stiffen the foot results in walking patterns with reduced push-off power. Simulations based on our model also captured the effects of walking with anaesthetised intrinsic foot muscles or an insole limiting arch compression. The ability to reproduce these different experiments indicates that our foot model captures the main mechanical properties of the foot. The presented four-segment foot model is a potentially powerful tool to study the relationship between foot properties and gait mechanics and energetics in health and disease.

The apicomplexan intracellular parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is a major food borne pathogen that is highly prevalent in the global population. The majority of the <i>T</i>. <i>gondii</i> proteome remains uncharacterized and the organization of proteins into complexes is unclear. To overcome this knowledge gap, we used a biochemical fractionation strategy to predict interactions by correlation profiling. To overcome the deficit of high-quality training data in non-model organisms, we complemented a supervised machine learning strategy, with an unsupervised approach, based on similarity network fusion. The resulting combined high confidence network, ToxoNet, comprises 2,063 interactions connecting 652 proteins. Clustering identifies 93 protein complexes. We identified clusters enriched in mitochondrial machinery that include previously uncharacterized proteins that likely represent novel adaptations to oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, complexes enriched in proteins localized to secretory organelles and the inner membrane complex, predict additional novel components representing novel targets for detailed functional characterization. We present ToxoNet as a publicly available resource with the expectation that it will help drive future hypotheses within the research community.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012207">Beliefs, compulsive behavior and reduced confidence in control</a></h4>

OCD has been conceptualized as a disorder arising from dysfunctional beliefs, such as overestimating threats or pathological doubts. Yet, how these beliefs lead to compulsions and obsessions remains unclear. Here, we develop a computational model to examine the specific beliefs that trigger and sustain compulsive behavior in a simple symptom-provoking scenario. Our results demonstrate that a single belief disturbanceâa lack of confidence in the effectiveness of oneâs preventive (harm-avoiding) actionsâcan trigger and maintain compulsions and is directly linked to compulsion severity. This distrust can further explain a number of seemingly unrelated phenomena in OCD, including the role of not-just-right feelings, the link to intolerance to uncertainty, perfectionism, and overestimation of threat, and deficits in reversal and state learning. Our simulations shed new light on which underlying beliefs drive compulsive behavior and highlight the important role of perceived ability to exert control for OCD.

Computable biomedical knowledge (CBK) is: âthe result of an analytic and/or deliberative process about human health, or affecting human health, that is explicit, and therefore can be represented and reasned upon using logic, formal standards, and mathematical approaches.â Representing biomedical knowledge in a machine-interpretable, computable form increases its ability to be discovered, accessed, understood, and deployed. Computable knowledge artifacts can greatly advance the potential for implementation, reproducibility, or extension of the knowledge by users, who may include practitioners, researchers, and learners. Enriching computable knowledge artifacts may help facilitate reuse and translation into practice. Following the examples of 10 Simple Rules papers for scientific code, software, and applications, we present 10 Simple Rules intended to make shared computable knowledge artifacts more useful and reusable. These rules are mainly for researchers and their teams who have decided that sharing their computable knowledge is important, who wish to go beyond simply describing results, algorithms, or models via traditional publication pathways, and who want to both make their research findings more accessible, and to help others use their computable knowledge. These rules are roughly organized into 3 categories: planning, engineering, and documentation. Finally, while many of the following examples are of computable knowledge in biomedical domains, these rules are generalizable to computable knowledge in any research domain.

Computational biologists are frequently engaged in collaborative data analysis with wet lab researchers. These interdisciplinary projects, as necessary as they are to the scientific endeavor, can be surprisingly challenging due to cultural differences in operations and values. In this Ten Simple Rules guide, we aim to help dry lab researchers identify sources of friction and provide actionable tools to facilitate respectful, open, transparent, and rewarding collaborations.

                <p>by GenÃ­s Bayarri, Pau Andrio, Josep LluÃ­s GelpÃ­, Adam Hospital, Modesto Orozco</p>

Interactive Jupyter Notebooks in combination with Conda environments can be used to generate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable/Reproducible) biomolecular simulation workflows. The interactive programming code accompanied by documentation and the possibility to inspect intermediate results with versatile graphical charts and data visualization is very helpful, especially in iterative processes, where parameters might be adjusted to a particular system of interest. This work presents a collection of FAIR notebooks covering various areas of the biomolecular simulation field, such as molecular dynamics (MD), proteinâligand docking, molecular checking/modeling, molecular interactions, and free energy perturbations. Workflows can be launched with myBinder or easily installed in a local system. The collection of notebooks aims to provide a compilation of demonstration workflows, and it is continuously updated and expanded with examples using new methodologies and tools.

                <p>by Bartosz A. Gren, Maciej Antczak, Tomasz Zok, Joanna I. Sulkowska, Marta Szachniuk</p>

Unlike proteins, RNAs deposited in the Protein Data Bank do not contain topological knots. Recently, admittedly, the first trefoil knot and some lasso-type conformations have been found in experimental RNA structures, but these are still exceptional cases. Meanwhile, algorithms predicting 3D RNA models have happened to form knotted structures not so rarely. Interestingly, machine learning-based predictors seem to be more prone to generate knotted RNA folds than traditional methods. A similar situation is observed for the entanglements of structural elements. In this paper, we analyze all models submitted to the CASP15 competition in the 3D RNA structure prediction category. We show what types of topological knots and structure element entanglements appear in the submitted models and highlight what methods are behind the generation of such conformations. We also study the structural aspect of susceptibility to entanglement. We suggest that predictors take care of an evaluation of RNA models to avoid publishing structures with artifacts, such as unusual entanglements, that result from hallucinations of predictive algorithms.

                <p>by Yu-Ying Phoebe Hsieh, Wanting Sun, Janet M. Young, Robin Cheung, Deborah A. Hogan, Ajai A. Dandekar, Harmit S. Malik</p>

Fungi and bacteria coexist in many polymicrobial communities, yet the molecular basis of their interactions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the fungus <i>Candida albicans</i> sequesters essential magnesium ions from the bacterium <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. To counteract fungal Mg<sup>2+</sup> sequestration, <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> expresses the Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter MgtA when Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels are low. Thus, loss of MgtA specifically impairs <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> in co-culture with <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i>, but fitness can be restored by supplementing Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Using a panel of fungi and bacteria, we show that Mg<sup>2+</sup> sequestration is a general mechanism of fungal antagonism against gram-negative bacteria. Mg<sup>2+</sup> limitation enhances bacterial resistance to polymyxin antibiotics like colistin, which target gram-negative bacterial membranes. Indeed, experimental evolution reveals that <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> evolves <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i>-dependent colistin resistance via non-canonical means; antifungal treatment renders resistant bacteria colistin-sensitive. Our work suggests that fungalâbacterial competition could profoundly impact polymicrobial infection treatment with antibiotics of last resort.

                <p>by Sophie Bavard, Erik StuchlÃ½, Arkady Konovalov, Sebastian Gluth</p>

Humans are known to be capable of inferring hidden preferences and beliefs of their conspecifics when observing their decisions. While observational learning based on choices has been explored extensively, the question of how response times (RT) impact our learning of othersâ social preferences has received little attention. Yet, while observing choices alone can inform us about the direction of preference, they reveal little about the strength of this preference. In contrast, RT provides a continuous measure of strength of preference with faster responses indicating stronger preferences and slower responses signaling hesitation or uncertainty. Here, we outline a preregistered orthogonal design to investigate the involvement of both choices and RT in learning and inferring otherâs social preferences. Participants observed other peopleâs behavior in a social preferences task (Dictator Game), seeing either their choices, RT, both, or no information. By coupling behavioral analyses with computational modeling, we show that RT is predictive of social preferences and that observers were able to infer those preferences even when receiving only RT information. Based on these findings, we propose a novel observational reinforcement learning model that closely matches participantsâ inferences in all relevant conditions. In contrast to previous literature suggesting that, from a Bayesian perspective, people should be able to learn equally well from choices and RT, we show that observersâ behavior substantially deviates from this prediction. Our study elucidates a hitherto unknown sophistication in human observational learning but also identifies important limitations to this ability.

                <p>by Jiao Li, Chao Zhang, Yao Meng, Siqi Yang, Jie Xia, Huafu Chen, Wei Liao</p>

The human brain is organized as segregation and integration units and follows complex developmental trajectories throughout life. The cortical manifold provides a new means of studying the brainâs organization in a multidimensional connectivity gradient space. However, how the brainâs morphometric organization changes across the human lifespan remains unclear. Here, leveraging structural magnetic resonance imaging scans from 1,790 healthy individuals aged 8 to 89 years, we investigated age-related global, within- and between-network dispersions to reveal the segregation and integration of brain networks from 3D manifolds based on morphometric similarity network (MSN), combining multiple features conceptualized as a âfingerprintâ of an individualâs brain. Developmental trajectories of global dispersion unfolded along patterns of molecular brain organization, such as acetylcholine receptor. Communities were increasingly dispersed with age, reflecting more disassortative morphometric similarity profiles within a community. Increasing within-network dispersion of primary motor and association cortices mediated the influence of age on the cognitive flexibility of executive functions. We also found that the secondary sensory cortices were decreasingly dispersed with the rest of the cortices during aging, possibly indicating a shift of secondary sensory cortices across the human lifespan from an extreme to a more central position in 3D manifolds. Together, our results reveal the age-related segregation and integration of MSN from the perspective of a multidimensional gradient space, providing new insights into lifespan changes in multiple morphometric features of the brain, as well as the influence of such changes on cognitive performance.

                Background Salmonella enterica are bacteria that include more than 2,500 serovars. Most of these serovars have been linked to human foodborne illnesses, mainly related to poultry and pigs. Thus, these animals are considered the reservoirs of many Salmonella serovars and strains related to antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, serovars, Î²-lactam resistance genes, and the risk factors associated with Salmonella enterica in pork commercialized in open markets of Quito city. Methods For this, 165 pork meat samples were taken from municipal markets in three areas in the city. These samples were microbiologically processed following the ISO 6579-2014 standardized method. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was used to identify Salmonella serotyping and resistance genes. Strains not identified by PCR were typed by the Kauffman White Le Minor scheme. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with the presence of the microorganism. Results Salmonella prevalence in pork was 9.1%. Identified serovars were 4, [5], 12: i:- (53.3%), Infantis (33.3%), and Derby (13.4%). Furthermore, the Î²-lactam resistance genes bla CTX-M-65 could be identified in three S. infantis isolates. Multivariate analysis showed that temperature (above 8Â°C) and cutting surfaces (wood) presented significant association values. Conclusions In conclusion, pork in traditional markets of Quito is contaminated with Salmonella enterica, whose main serovars pose a public health concern, and shows beta-lactam resistance.

Methods Using specific keywords related to onabotulinumtoxinA and anti-CGRP treatments for migraines, we conducted a comprehensive search of electronic databases, including PubMed and the Cochrane Library, spanning from 2015 to 2024. The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results Our analysis included 13 publications that revealed notable decreases in migraine frequency and severity with both treatment modalities. While CGRP mAbs demonstrated significant reductions in migraine days with minimal adverse effects, BoNT-A emerged as a superior option due to its cost-efficiency and higher patient satisfaction. Both treatments exhibited mild short-term side effects; however, CGRP mAbs were occasionally associated with extended periods of constipation. The simplicity of adherence, with either monthly self-administered injections of CGRP mAbs or quarterly physician-administered BoNT-A injections, further distinguished these treatments. BoNT-A, in particular, was recognized for enhancing overall quality of life and performance metrics. Conclusions BoNT-A stands out as a low-cost intervention effective across various migraine categories, including chronic, episodic, unilateral, and vestibular types, significantly alleviating pain severity and reducing migraine episode frequency. The findings underscore that both CGRP mAbs and BoNT-A are comparably effective for CM prophylaxis. However, BoNT-A is especially beneficial for patients ineligible for CGRP mAb therapy or those requiring localized treatment with minimal systemic exposure risk. For patients resistant or refractory to BoNT-A, combining it with CGRP mAbs may maximize therapeutic benefits due to their distinct modes of action. The efficacy, safety, and cost-benefit analyses of these medications may help clinicians make more informed treatment decisions based on the study's findings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-664/v1?src=rss">(Semi)automated approaches to data extraction for systematic reviews and meta-analyses in social sciences: A living review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background An abundance of rapidly accumulating scientific evidence presents novel opportunities for researchers and practitioners alike, yet such advantages are often overshadowed by resource demands associated with finding and aggregating a continually expanding body of scientific information. Data extraction activities associated with evidence synthesis have been described as time-consuming to the point of critically limiting the usefulness of research. Across social science disciplines, the use of automation technologies for timely and accurate knowledge synthesis can enhance research translation value, better inform key policy development, and expand the current understanding of human interactions, organizations, and systems. Ongoing developments surrounding automation are highly concentrated in research for evidence-based medicine with limited evidence surrounding tools and techniques applied outside of the clinical research community. The goal of the present study is to extend the automation knowledge base by synthesizing current trends in the application of extraction technologies of key data elements of interest for social scientists. Methods We report the baseline results of a living systematic review of automated data extraction techniques supporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the social sciences. This review follows PRISMA standards for reporting systematic reviews. Results The baseline review of social science research yielded 23 relevant studies. Conclusions When considering the process of automating systematic review and meta-analysis information extraction, social science research falls short as compared to clinical research that focuses on automatic processing of information related to the PICO framework. With a few exceptions, most tools were either in the infancy stage and not accessible to applied researchers, were domain specific, or required substantial manual coding of articles before automation could occur. Additionally, few solutions considered extraction of data from tables which is where key data elements reside that social and behavioral scientists analyze.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23608?af=R">In vivo structural connectivity of the reward system along the hippocampal long axis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent work has identified a critical role for the hippocampus in reward-sensitive behaviors, including motivated memory, reinforcement learning, and decision-making. Animal histology and human functional neuroimaging have shown that brain regions involved in reward processing and motivation are more interconnected with the ventral/anterior hippocampus. However, direct evidence examining gradients of structural connectivity between reward regions and the hippocampus in humans is lacking. The present study used diffusion MRI (dMRI) and probabilistic tractography to quantify the structural connectivity of the hippocampus with key reward processing regions in vivo. Using a large sample of subjects (<i>N</i>â=â628) from the human connectome dMRI data release, we found that connectivity profiles with the hippocampus varied widely between different regions of the reward circuit. While the dopaminergic midbrain (ventral tegmental area) showed stronger connectivity with the anterior versus posterior hippocampus, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex showed stronger connectivity with the posterior hippocampus. The limbic (ventral) striatum demonstrated a more homogeneous connectivity profile along the hippocampal long axis. This is the first study to generate a probabilistic atlas of the hippocampal structural connectivity with reward-related networks, which is essential to investigating how these circuits contribute to normative adaptive behavior and maladaptive behaviors in psychiatric illness. These findings describe nuanced structural connectivity that sets the foundation to better understand how the hippocampus influences reward-guided behavior in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23607?af=R">The wellâworn route revisited: Striatal and hippocampal system contributions to familiar route navigation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Classic research has shown a division in the neuroanatomical structures that support flexible (e.g., short-cutting) and habitual (e.g., familiar route following) navigational behavior, with hippocampalâcaudate systems associated with the former and putamen systems with the latter. There is, however, disagreement about whether the neural structures involved in navigation process particular forms of spatial information, such as associations between constellations of cues forming a cognitive map, versus single landmark-action associations, or alternatively, perform particular reinforcement learning algorithms that allow the use of different spatial strategies, so-called model-based (flexible) or model-free (habitual) forms of learning. We sought to test these theories by asking participants (<i>N</i>â=â24) to navigate within a virtual environment through a previously learned, 9-junction route with distinctive landmarks at each junction while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a series of probe trials, we distinguished knowledge of individual landmark-action associations along the route versus knowledge of the correct <i>sequence</i> of landmark-action associations, either by having absent landmarks, or âout-of-sequenceâ landmarks. Under a map-based perspective, sequence knowledge would not require hippocampal systems, because there are no constellations of cues available for cognitive map formation. Within a learning-based model, however, responding based on knowledge of sequence <i>would</i> require hippocampal systems because prior context has to be utilized. We found that hippocampalâcaudate systems were more active in probes requiring sequence knowledge, supporting the learning-based model. However, we also found greater putamen activation in probes where navigation based purely on sequence memory could be planned, supporting models of putamen function that emphasize its role in action sequencing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23609?af=R">AMPA and NMDA receptors in dentate gyrus mediate memory for sucrose in two port discrimination task</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although the phenomenon of memory formation and recall associated with the use of psychotropic drugs has been extensively studied, mechanisms underlying memories for natural reward have not been clarified. Herein, we test the hypothesis that glutamatergic receptors in the dentate gyrus play a role in memories associated with sucrose. We used pellet self-administration protocol to generate memories in two-port nose-poke discrimination task using male Wistar rats. During non-rewarded probe trial, the conditioned animals readily discriminated the active port versus inactive port and showed massive increase in mRNA expression of AMPA receptor subunit genes (gria2, gria3) as well as c-Fos protein in the DG. Access to sweet pellet further enhanced c-Fos expression in the DG. However, animals pre-treated with AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX (intra-DG), on exposure to operant chamber (no pellet), showed decreased discrimination as well as c-Fos expression. We suggest that AMPA receptors in DG mediate recall and consolidation of memories associated with sucrose consumption. CNQX pre-treated animals, if presented with sweet pellet on nose poke, exhibited high discrimination index coupled with increased c-Fos expression. In these CNQX treated rats, the DI was again decreased following administration of NMDA receptor antagonist AP5. We suggest that, although AMPA receptors are blocked, the access to sweet pellet may induce surge of glutamate in the DG, which in turn may reinstate memories via activation of erstwhile silent synapses in NMDA dependant manner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23610?af=R">A comparison of hippocampal and retrosplenial cortical spatial and contextual firing patterns</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus (HPC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) are key components of the brain's memory and navigation systems. Lesions of either region produce profound deficits in spatial cognition and HPC neurons exhibit well-known spatial firing patterns (place fields). Recent studies have also identified an array of navigation-related firing patterns in the RSC. However, there has been little work comparing the response properties and information coding mechanisms of these two brain regions. In the present study, we examined the firing patterns of HPC and RSC neurons in two tasks which are commonly used to study spatial cognition in rodents, open field foraging with an environmental context manipulation and continuous T-maze alternation. We found striking similarities in the kinds of spatial and contextual information encoded by these two brain regions. Neurons in both regions carried information about the rat's current spatial location, trajectories and goal locations, and both regions reliably differentiated the contexts. However, we also found several key differences. For example, information about head direction was a prominent component of RSC representations but was only weakly encoded in the HPC. The two regions also used different coding schemes, even when they encoded the same kind of information. As expected, the HPC employed a sparse coding scheme characterized by compact, high contrast place fields, and information about spatial location was the dominant component of HPC representations. RSC firing patterns were more consistent with a distributed coding scheme. Instead of compact place fields, RSC neurons exhibited broad, but reliable, spatial and directional tuning, and they typically carried information about multiple navigational variables. The observed similarities highlight the closely related functions of the HPC and RSC, whereas the differences in information types and coding schemes suggest that these two regions likely make somewhat different contributions to spatial cognition.</p>

                Functional network (FN) analyses play a pivotal role in uncovering insights into brain function and understanding the pathophysiology of various brain disorders. This paper focuses on classical and advanced methods for deriving brain FNs from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We systematically review their foundational principles, advantages, shortcomings, and interrelations, encompassing both static and dynamic FN extraction approaches. In the context of static FN extraction, we present hypothesis-driven methods such as region of interest (ROI)-based approaches as well as data-driven methods including matrix decomposition, clustering, and deep learning. For dynamic FN extraction, both window-based and windowless methods are surveyed with respect to the estimation of time-varying FN and the subsequent computation of FN states. We also discuss the scope of application of the various methods and avenues for future improvements.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88648">Stochastic characterization of navigation strategies in an automated variant of the Barnes maze</a></h4>

              
                Animals can use a repertoire of strategies to navigate in an environment, and it remains an intriguing question how these strategies are selected based on the nature and familiarity of environments. To investigate this question, we developed a fully automated variant of the Barnes maze, characterized by 24 vestibules distributed along the periphery of a circular arena, and monitored the trajectories of mice over 15 days as they learned to navigate towards a goal vestibule from a random start vestibule. We show that the patterns of vestibule visits can be reproduced by the combination of three stochastic processes reminiscent of random, serial, and spatial strategies. The processes randomly selected vestibules based on either uniform (random) or biased (serial and spatial) probability distributions. They closely matched experimental data across a range of statistical distributions characterizing the length, distribution, step size, direction, and stereotypy of vestibule sequences, revealing a shift from random to spatial and serial strategies over time, with a strategy switch occurring approximately every six vestibule visits. Our study provides a novel apparatus and analysis toolset for tracking the repertoire of navigation strategies and demonstrates that a set of stochastic processes can largely account for exploration patterns in the Barnes maze.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90908">The trunk replaces the longer mandible as the main feeding organ in elephant evolution</a></h4>

              
                The long-trunked elephantids underwent a significant evolutionary stage characterized by an exceptionally elongated mandible. The initial elongation and subsequent regression of the long mandible, along with its co-evolution with the trunk, present an intriguing issue that remains incompletely understood. Through comparative functional and eco-morphological investigations, as well as feeding preference analysis, we reconstructed the feeding behavior of major groups of longirostrine elephantiforms. In the <i>Platybelodon</i> clade, the rapid evolutionary changes observed in the narial region, strongly correlated with mandible and tusk characteristics, suggest a crucial evolutionary transition where feeding function shifted from the mandible to the trunk, allowing proboscideans to expand their niches to more open regions. This functional shift further resulted in elephantids relying solely on their trunks for feeding. Our research provides insights into how unique environmental pressures shape the extreme evolution of organs, particularly in large mammals that developed various peculiar adaptations during the late Cenozoic global cooling trends.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93325">Spatial and temporal pattern of structureâfunction coupling of human brain connectome with development</a></h4>

              
                Brain structural circuitry shapes a richly patterned functional synchronization, supporting for complex cognitive and behavioural abilities. However, how coupling of structural connectome (SC) and functional connectome (FC) develops and its relationships with cognitive functions and transcriptomic architecture remain unclear. We used multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data from 439 participants aged 5.7â21.9 years to predict functional connectivity by incorporating intracortical and extracortical structural connectivity, characterizing SCâFC coupling. Our findings revealed that SCâFC coupling was strongest in the visual and somatomotor networks, consistent with evolutionary expansion, myelin content, and functional principal gradient. As development progressed, SCâFC coupling exhibited heterogeneous alterations dominated by an increase in cortical regions, broadly distributed across the somatomotor, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. Moreover, we discovered that SCâFC coupling significantly predicted individual variability in general intelligence, mainly influencing frontoparietal and default mode networks. Finally, our results demonstrated that the heterogeneous development of SCâFC coupling is positively associated with genes in oligodendrocyte-related pathways and negatively associated with astrocyte-related genes. This study offers insight into the maturational principles of SCâFC coupling in typical development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88466">E3 ubiquitin ligase Deltex facilitates the expansion of Wingless gradient and antagonizes Wingless signaling through a conserved mechanism of transcriptional effector Armadillo/Î²-catenin degradation</a></h4>

              
                The Wnt/Wg pathway controls myriads of biological phenomena throughout the development and adult life of all organisms across the phyla. Thus, an aberrant Wnt signaling is associated with a wide range of pathologies in humans. Tight regulation of Wnt/Wg signaling is required to maintain proper cellular homeostasis. Here, we report a novel role of E3 ubiquitin ligase Deltex in Wg signaling regulation. <i>Drosophila dx</i> genetically interacts with <i>wg a</i>nd its pathway components. Furthermore, Dx LOF results in a reduced spreading of Wg while its over-expression expands the diffusion gradient of the morphogen. We attribute this change in Wg gradient to the endocytosis of Wg through Dx which directly affects the short- and long-range Wg targets. We also demonstrate the role of Dx in regulating Wg effector Armadillo where Dx down-regulates Arm through proteasomal degradation. We also showed the conservation of Dx function in the mammalian system where DTX1 is shown to bind with Î²-catenin and facilitates its proteolytic degradation, spotlighting a novel step that potentially modulates Wnt/Wg signaling cascade.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90505">Cyclic muscle contractions reinforce the actomyosin motors and mediate the full elongation of C. elegans embryo</a></h4>

              
                The paramount importance of mechanical forces in morphogenesis and embryogenesis is widely recognized, but understanding the mechanism at the cellular and molecular level remains challenging. Because of its simple internal organization, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> is a rewarding system of study. As demonstrated experimentally, after an initial period of steady elongation driven by the actomyosin network, muscle contractions operate a quasi-periodic sequence of bending, rotation, and torsion, that leads to the final fourfold size of the embryos before hatching. How actomyosin and muscles contribute to embryonic elongation is investigated here theoretically. A filamentary elastic model that converts stimuli generated by biochemical signals in the tissue into driving forces, explains embryonic deformation under actin bundles and muscle activity, and dictates mechanisms of late elongation based on the effects of energy conversion and dissipation. We quantify this dynamic transformation by stretches applied to a cylindrical structure that mimics the body shape in finite elasticity, obtaining good agreement and understanding of both wild-type and mutant embryos at all stages.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87518">Metabolic regulation of misfolded protein import into mitochondria</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria are the cellular energy hub and central target of metabolic regulation. Mitochondria also facilitate proteostasis through pathways such as the âmitochondria as guardian in cytosolâ (MAGIC) whereby cytosolic misfolded proteins (MPs) are imported into and degraded inside mitochondria. In this study, a genome-wide screen in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> uncovered that Snf1, the yeast AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibits the import of MPs into mitochondria while promoting mitochondrial biogenesis under glucose starvation. We show that this inhibition requires a downstream transcription factor regulating mitochondrial gene expression and is likely to be conferred through substrate competition and mitochondrial import channel selectivity. We further show that Snf1/AMPK activation protects mitochondrial fitness in yeast and human cells under stress induced by MPs such as those associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85560">Multimodal HLA-I genotype regulation by human cytomegalovirus US10 and resulting surface patterning</a></h4>

              
                Human leucocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules play a central role for both NK and T-cell responses that prevent serious human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) disease. To create opportunities for viral spread, several HCMV-encoded immunoevasins employ diverse strategies to target HLA-I. Among these, the glycoprotein US10 is so far insufficiently studied. While it was reported that US10 interferes with HLA-G expression, its ability to manipulate classical HLA-I antigen presentation remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that US10 recognizes and binds to all HLA-I (HLA-A, -B, -C, -E, -G) heavy chains. Additionally, impaired recruitment of HLA-I to the peptide loading complex was observed. Notably, the associated effects varied significantly dependending on HLA-I genotype and allotype: (i) HLA-A molecules evaded downregulation by US10, (ii) tapasin-dependent HLA-B molecules showed impaired maturation and cell surface expression, and (iii) Î²<sub>2</sub>m-assembled HLA-C, in particular HLA-C*05:01 and -C*12:03, and HLA-G were strongly retained in complex with US10 in the endoplasmic reticulum. These genotype-specific effects on HLA-I were confirmed through unbiased HLA-I ligandome analyses. Furthermore, in HCMV-infected fibroblasts inhibition of overlapping US10 and US11 transcription had little effect on HLA-A, but induced HLA-B antigen presentation. Thus, the US10-mediated impact on HLA-I results in multiple geno- and allotypic effects in a so far unparalleled and multimodal manner.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93694">Boosting biodiversity monitoring using smartphone-driven, rapidly accumulating community-sourced data</a></h4>

              
                Comprehensive biodiversity data is crucial for ecosystem protection. The <i>Biome</i> mobile app, launched in Japan, efficiently gathers species observations from the public using species identification algorithms and gamification elements. The app has amassed &gt;6 million observations since 2019. Nonetheless, community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. Species distribution models (SDMs) estimate species distribution while accommodating such bias. Here, we investigated the quality of <i>Biome</i> data and its impact on SDM performance. Species identification accuracy exceeds 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but seed plants, molluscs, and fishes scored below 90%. Our SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan revealed that incorporating <i>Biome</i> data into traditional survey data improved accuracy. For endangered species, traditional survey data required &gt;2000 records for accurate models (Boyce index â¥ 0.9), while blending the two data sources reduced this to around 300. The uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by <i>Biome</i> data, compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas, may explain this improvement. Combining multiple data sources better estimates species distributions, aiding in protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment. Establishing a platform for accumulating community-sourced distribution data will contribute to conserving and monitoring natural ecosystems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93662">Identification of a third myosin-5a-melanophilin interaction that mediates the association of myosin-5a with melanosomes</a></h4>

              
                Transport and localization of melanosome at the periphery region of melanocyte are depended on myosin-5a (Myo5a), which associates with melanosome by interacting with its adaptor protein melanophilin (Mlph). Mlph contains four functional regions, including Rab27a-binding domain, Myo5a GTD-binding motif (GTBM), Myo5a exon F-binding domain (EFBD), and actin-binding domain (ABD). The association of Myo5a with Mlph is known to be mediated by two specific interactions: the interaction between the exon-F-encoded region of Myo5a and Mlph-EFBD and that between Myo5a-GTD and Mlph-GTBM. Here, we identify a third interaction between Myo5a and Mlph, that is, the interaction between the exon-G-encoded region of Myo5a and Mlph-ABD. The exon-G/ABD interaction is independent from the exon-F/EFBD interaction and is required for the association of Myo5a with melanosome. Moreover, we demonstrate that Mlph-ABD interacts with either the exon-G or actin filament, but cannot interact with both of them simultaneously. Based on above findings, we propose a new model for the Mlph-mediated Myo5a transportation of melanosomes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98649">Novel autophagy inducers by accelerating lysosomal clustering against Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                The autophagy-lysosome pathway plays an indispensable role in the protein quality control by degrading abnormal organelles and proteins including a-synuclein (aSyn) associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the activation of this pathway is mainly by targeting lysosomal enzymic activity. Here, we focused on the autophagosome-lysosome fusion process around the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) regulated by lysosomal positioning. Through high-throughput chemical screening, we identified 6 out of 1,200 clinically approved drugs enabling the lysosomes to accumulate around the MTOC with autophagy flux enhancement. We further demonstrated that these compounds induce the lysosomal clustering through a JIP4-TRPML1-dependent mechanism. Among them, the lysosomal-clustering compound albendazole promoted the autophagy-dependent degradation of Triton-X-insoluble, proteasome inhibitor-induced aggregates. In a cellular PD model, albendazole boosted insoluble aSyn degradation. Our results revealed that lysosomal clustering can facilitate the breakdown of protein aggregates, suggesting that lysosome-clustering compounds may offer a promising therapeutic strategy against neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the presence of aggregate-prone proteins.

                Autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are only partially represented in current experimental models and the development of humanized immune mice is crucial for better understanding of immunopathogenesis and testing of therapeutics. We describe a humanized mouse model with several key features of MS. Severely immunodeficient B2m-NOG mice were transplanted with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HLA-DRB1-typed MS and healthy (HI) donors and showed rapid engraftment by human T and B lymphocytes. Mice receiving cells from MS patients with recent/ongoing EpsteinâBarr virus reactivation showed high B cell engraftment capacity. Both HLA-DRB1*15 (DR15) MS and DR15 HI mice, not HLA-DRB1*13 MS mice, developed human T cell infiltration of CNS borders and parenchyma. DR15 MS mice uniquely developed inflammatory lesions in brain and spinal cord gray matter, with spontaneous, hCD8 T cell lesions, and mixed hCD8/hCD4 T cell lesions in EAE immunized mice, with variation in localization and severity between different patient donors. Main limitations of this model for further development are poor monocyte engraftment and lack of demyelination, lymph node organization, and IgG responses. These results show that PBMC humanized mice represent promising research tools for investigating MS immunopathology in a patient-specific approach.

	<p>Recent evidence shows that it is possible to identify the elements responsible for sensorineural hearing loss, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and macrophages, by performing perilymph sampling. However, current studies have only focused on the diagnosis of such as otologic conditions. Hearing loss is a feature of certain neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis, and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is widely detected in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Although the environment of the inner ear is highly regulated, there are several communication pathways between the perilymph of the inner ear and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Thus, examination of the perilymph may help understand the mechanism behind the hearing loss observed in certain neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we review the constituents of CSF and perilymph, the anatomy of the inner ear and its connection with the brain. Then, we discuss the relevance of perilymph sampling in neurology. Currently, perilymph sampling is only performed during surgical procedures, but we hypothesize a simplified and low-invasive technique that could allow sampling in a clinical setting with the same ease as performing an intratympanic injection under direct visual check. The use of this modified technique could allow for perilymph sampling in people with hearing loss and neuroinflammatory/neurodegenerative disorders and clarify the relationship between these conditions; in fact, by measuring the concentration of neuroinflammatory and/or neurodegenerative biomarkers and those typically expressed in the inner ear in aging SNHL, it could be possible to understand if SNHL is caused by aging or neuroinflammation.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that is typically characterized by a range of motor dysfunctions, and its impact extends beyond physical abnormalities into emotional well-being and cognitive symptoms. The loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) leads to an array of dysfunctions in the functioning of the basal ganglia (BG) circuitry that manifests into PD. While active research is being carried out to find the root cause of SNc cell death, various therapeutic techniques are used to manage the symptoms of PD. The most common approach in managing the symptoms is replenishing the lost dopamine in the form of taking dopaminergic medications such as levodopa, despite its long-term complications. Another commonly used intervention for PD is deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is most commonly used when levodopa medication efficacy is reduced, and, in combination with levodopa medication, it helps reduce the required dosage of medication, prolonging the therapeutic effect. DBS is also a first choice option when motor complications such as dyskinesia emerge as a side effect of medication. Several studies have also reported that though DBS is found to be effective in suppressing severe motor symptoms such as tremors and rigidity, it has an adverse effect on cognitive capabilities. Henceforth, it is important to understand the exact mechanism of DBS in alleviating motor symptoms. A computational model of DBS stimulation for motor symptoms will offer great insights into understanding the mechanisms underlying DBS, and, along this line, in our current study, we modeled a cortico-basal ganglia circuitry of arm reaching, where we simulated healthy control (HC) and PD symptoms as well as the DBS effect on PD tremor and bradykinesia. Our modeling results reveal that PD tremors are more correlated with the theta band, while bradykinesia is more correlated with the beta band of the frequency spectrum of the local field potential (LFP) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons. With a DBS current of 220 pA, 130 Hz, and a 100 microsecond pulse-width, we could found the maximum therapeutic effect for the pathological dynamics simulated using our model using a set of parameter values. However, the exact DBS characteristics vary from patient to patient, and this can be further studied by exploring the model parameter space. This model can be extended to study different DBS targets and accommodate cognitive dynamics in the future to study the impact of DBS on cognitive symptoms and thereby optimize the parameters to produce optimal performance effects across modalities. Combining DBS with rehabilitation is another frontier where DBS can reduce symptoms such as tremors and rigidity, enabling patients to participate in their therapy. With DBS providing instant relief to patients, a combination of DBS and rehabilitation can enhance neural plasticity. One of the key motivations behind combining DBS with rehabilitation is to expect comparable results in motor performance even with milder DBS currents.</p>

	<p>Both chronic and recurrent spinal pain alter sensorimotor integration (SMI), which is demonstrated using complex neurophysiological techniques. Currently, there is no patient-reported outcome measure that documents and/or assesses SMI in populations with spinal problems. The purpose of this study was to develop the Sensory&amp;amp;ndash;Motor Dysfunction Questionnaire (SMD-Q) and assess its test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability and internal consistency in individuals with recurrent spinal pain. The SMD-Q was developed based on the existing literature on motor control disturbances associated with disordered SMI. The initial SMD-Q drafts underwent review by two separate panels of subject matter experts and a focus group with subclinical spine pain. Their suggestions were incorporated into the questionnaire prior to reliability testing. The questionnaire was administered twice at a seven-day interval using QualtricsTM. A total of 20 participants (14 females and 6 males; 20.95 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.46 years of age) completed the study. Quadratic weighted kappa (Kw) was used to assess test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability and Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha (&amp;amp;alpha;) was used to assess internal consistency. Four items had a Kw &amp;amp;lt; 0.40, seven had a 0.40 &amp;amp;lt; Kw &amp;amp;lt; 0.75, and one had a Kw &amp;amp;gt; 0.75 (excellent agreement), with excellent internal consistency (&amp;amp;alpha; &amp;amp;gt; 0.90). The pilot SMD-Q appears to reliably measure altered SMI, suggesting that revisions and testing with a larger sample are worth pursuing.</p>

	<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a critical condition characterized by a high prevalence, substantial mortality rates, and unpredictable clinical outcomes, which results in a serious threat to human health. Improving the timeliness and accuracy of prognosis assessment is crucial to minimizing mortality and long-term disability associated with ICH. Due to the complexity of ICH, the diagnosis of ICH in clinical practice heavily relies on the professional expertise and clinical experience of physicians. Traditional prognostic methods largely depend on the specialized knowledge and subjective judgment of healthcare professionals. Meanwhile, existing artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, which predominantly utilize features derived from computed tomography (CT) scans, fall short of capturing the multifaceted nature of ICH. Although existing methods are capable of integrating clinical information and CT images for prognosis, the effectiveness of this fusion process still requires improvement. To surmount these limitations, the present study introduces a novel AI framework, termed the ICH Network (ICH-Net), which employs a joint-attention cross-modal network to synergize clinical textual data with CT imaging features. The architecture of ICH-Net consists of three integral components: the Feature Extraction Module, which processes and abstracts salient characteristics from the clinical and imaging data, the Feature Fusion Module, which amalgamates the diverse data streams, and the Classification Module, which interprets the fused features to deliver prognostic predictions. Our evaluation, conducted through a rigorous five-fold cross-validation process, demonstrates that ICH-Net achieves a commendable accuracy of up to 87.77%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods detailed within our research. This evidence underscores the potential of ICH-Net as a formidable tool in prognosticating ICH, promising a significant advancement in clinical decision-making and patient care.</p>

	<p>Background: Automated pupillometry (AP) is a handheld, non-invasive tool that is able to assess pupillary light reflex dynamics and is useful for the detection of intracranial hypertension. Limited evidence is available on acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. The primary objective was to evaluate the ability of AP to discriminate AIS patients from healthy subjects (HS). Secondly, we aimed to compute a predictive score for AIS diagnosis based on clinical, demographic, and AP variables. Methods: We included 200 consecutive patients admitted to a comprehensive stroke center who underwent AP assessment through NPi-200 (NeurOptics&amp;amp;reg;) within 72 h of stroke onset and 200 HS. The mean values of AP parameters and the absolute differences between the AP parameters of the two eyes were considered in the analyses. Predictors of stroke diagnosis were identified through univariate and multivariate logistic regressions; we then computed a nomogram based on each variable&amp;amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp;beta; coefficient. Finally, we developed a web app capable of displaying the probability of stroke diagnosis based on the predictive algorithm. Results: A high percentage of pupil constriction (CH, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), a low constriction velocity (CV, p = 0.002), and high differences between these two parameters (p = 0.036 and p = 0.004, respectively) were independent predictors of AIS. The highest contribution in the predictive score was provided by CH, the Neurological Pupil Index, CV, and CV absolute difference, disclosing the important role of AP in the discrimination of stroke patients. Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that AP parameters, and in particular, those concerning pupillary constriction, may be useful for the early diagnosis of AIS.</p>

	<p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is involved in a range of central and peripheral pathways related to appetitive behavior. Hence, this study explored the effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on substance and behavioral addictions, including alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, cannabis, psychostimulants, compulsive shopping, and sex drive/libido. Data were collected from various social platforms. Keywords related to GLP-1 RAs and substance/behavioral addiction were used to extract relevant comments. The study employed a mixed-methods approach to analyze online discussions posted from December 2019 to June 2023 and collected using a specialized web application. Reddit entries were the focus here due to limited data from other platforms, such as TikTok and YouTube. A total of 5859 threads and related comments were extracted from six subreddits, which included threads about GLP-1 RAs drugs and associated brand names. To obtain relevant posts, keywords related to potential substance use and compulsive behavior were selected. Further analysis involved two main steps: (1) manually coding posts based on users&amp;amp;rsquo; references to the potential impact of GLP-1 RAs on substance use and non-substance habits, excluding irrelevant or unclear comments; (2) performing a thematic analysis on the dataset of keywords, using AI-assisted techniques followed by the manual revision of the generated themes. Second, a thematic analysis was performed on the keyword-related dataset, using AI-assisted techniques followed by the manual revision of the generated themes. In total, 29.75% of alcohol-related; 22.22% of caffeine-related; and 23.08% of nicotine-related comments clearly stated a cessation of the intake of these substances following the start of GLP-1 RAs prescription. Conversely, mixed results were found for cannabis intake, and only limited, anecdotal data were made available for cocaine, entactogens, and dissociative drugs&amp;amp;rsquo; misuse. Regarding behavioral addictions, 21.35% of comments reported a compulsive shopping interruption, whilst the sexual drive/libido elements reportedly increased in several users. The current mixed-methods approach appeared to be a useful tool in gaining insight into complex topics such as the effects of GLP-1 RAs on substance and non-substance addiction-related disorders; some GLP-1 RA-related mental health benefits could also be inferred from here. Overall, it appeared that GLP-1 RAs may show the potential to target both substance craving and maladaptive/addictive behaviors, although further empirical research is needed.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0244-23.2024?rss=1">Experiencing an Elongated Limb in Virtual Reality Modifies the Tactile Distance Perception of the Corresponding Real Limb</a></h4>

              
                <p>In measurement, a reference frame is needed to compare the measured object to something already known. This raises the neuroscientific question of which reference frame is used by humans when exploring the environment. Previous studies suggested that, in touch, the body employed as measuring tool also serves as reference frame. Indeed, an artificial modification of the perceived dimensions of the body changes the tactile perception of external object dimensions. However, it is unknown if such a change in tactile perception would occur when the body schema is modified through the illusion of owning a limb altered in size. Therefore, employing a virtual hand illusion paradigm with an elongated forearm of different lengths, we systematically tested the subjective perception of distance between two points [tactile distance perception (TDP) task] on the corresponding real forearm following the illusion. Thus, the TDP task is used as a proxy to gauge changes in the body schema. Embodiment of the virtual arm was found significantly greater after the synchronous visuotactile stimulation condition compared with the asynchronous one, and the forearm elongation significantly increased the TDP. However, we did not find any link between the visuotactile-induced ownership over the elongated arm and TDP variation, suggesting that vision plays the main role in the modification of the body schema. Additionally, significant effect of elongation found on TDP but not on proprioception suggests that these are affected differently by body schema modifications. These findings confirm the body schema malleability and its role as a reference frame in touch.</p>

                <p>Essential tremor (ET), a movement disorder characterized by involuntary oscillations of the limbs during movement, remains to date not well understood. It has been recently suggested that the tremor originates from impaired delay compensation, affecting movement representation and online control. Here we tested this hypothesis directly with 24 ET patients (14 female; 10 male) and 28 neurologically intact (NI) human volunteers (17 female; 11 male) in an upper limb postural perturbation task. After maintaining their hand in a visual target, participants experienced perturbations of unpredictable direction and magnitude and were instructed to counter the perturbation and steer their hand back to the starting position. In comparison with NI volunteers, ET patients&rsquo; early muscular responses (short and long-latency responses, 20&ndash;50 and 50&ndash;100&nbsp;ms, respectively) were preserved or even slightly increased. However, they exhibited perturbation-dependent deficits when stopping and stabilizing their hand in the final target supporting the hypothesis that the tremor was generated by the feedback controller. We show in a computational model that errors in delay compensation accumulating over time produced the same small increase in initial feedback response followed by oscillations that scaled with the perturbation magnitude as observed in ET population. Our experimental results therefore validate the computational hypothesis that inaccurate delay compensation in long-latency pathways could be the origin of the tremor.</p>

                <p>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, also referred to as paradoxical sleep for the striking resemblance of its electroencephalogram (EEG) to the one observed in wakefulness, is characterized by the occurrence of transient events such as limb twitches or facial and rapid eye movements. Here, we investigated the local activity of the primary somatosensory or barrel cortex (S1) in naturally sleeping head-fixed male mice during REM. Through local field potential recordings, we uncovered local appearances of spindle waves in the barrel cortex during REM concomitant with strong delta power, challenging the view of a wakefulness-like activity in REM. We further performed extra- and intracellular recordings of thalamic cells in head-fixed mice. Our data show high-frequency thalamic bursts of spikes and subthreshold spindle oscillations in approximately half of the neurons of the ventral posterior medial nucleus which further confirmed the thalamic origin of local cortical spindles in S1 in REM. Cortical spindle oscillations were suppressed, while thalamus spike firing increased, associated with rapid mouse whisker movements and S1 cortical activity transitioned to an activated state. During REM, the sensory thalamus and barrel cortex therefore alternate between high (wake-like) and low (non-REM sleep-like) activation states, potentially providing a neuronal substrate for mnemonic processes occurring during this paradoxical sleep stage.</p>

                <p>Even in the absence of specific sensory input or a behavioral task, the brain produces structured patterns of activity. This organized activity is modulated by changes in arousal. Here, we use wide-field voltage imaging to establish how arousal relates to cortical network voltage and hemodynamic activity in spontaneously behaving head-fixed male and female mice expressing the voltage-sensitive fluorescent FRET sensor Butterfly 1.2. We find that global voltage and hemodynamic signals are both positively correlated with changes in arousal with a maximum correlation of 0.5 and 0.25, respectively, at a time lag of 0&nbsp;s. We next show that arousal influences distinct cortical regions for both voltage and hemodynamic signals. These include a broad positive correlation across most sensory-motor cortices extending posteriorly to the primary visual cortex observed in both signals. In contrast, activity in the prefrontal cortex is positively correlated to changes in arousal for the voltage signal while it is a slight net negative correlation observed in the hemodynamic signal. Additionally, we show that coherence between voltage and hemodynamic signals relative to arousal is strongest for slow frequencies below 0.15&nbsp;Hz and is near zero for frequencies &gt;1&nbsp;Hz. We finally show that coupling patterns are dependent on the behavioral state of the animal with correlations being driven by periods of increased orofacial movement. Our results indicate that while hemodynamic signals show strong relations to behavior and arousal, these relations are distinct from those observed by voltage activity.</p>

                <p>Vertebrate vision begins with light absorption by rod and cone photoreceptors, which transmit signals from their synaptic terminals to second-order neurons: bipolar and horizontal cells. In mouse rods, there is a single presynaptic ribbon-type active zone at which the release of glutamate occurs tonically in the dark. This tonic glutamatergic signaling requires continuous exo- and endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. At conventional synapses, endocytosis commonly requires dynamins: GTPases encoded by three genes (<I>Dnm1&ndash;3</I>), which perform membrane scission. Disrupting endocytosis by dynamin deletions impairs transmission at conventional synapses, but the impact of disrupting endocytosis and the role(s) of specific dynamin isoforms at rod ribbon synapses are understood incompletely. Here, we used cell-specific knock-outs (KOs) of the neuron-specific <I>Dnm1</I> and <I>Dnm3</I> to investigate the functional roles of dynamin isoforms in rod photoreceptors in mice of either sex. Analysis of synaptic protein expression, synapse ultrastructure, and retinal function via electroretinograms (ERGs) showed that dynamins 1 and 3 act redundantly and are essential for supporting the structural and functional integrity of rod ribbon synapses. Single <I>Dnm3</I> KO showed no phenotype, and single <I>Dnm1</I> KO only modestly reduced synaptic vesicle density without affecting vesicle size and overall synapse integrity, whereas double <I>Dnm1/Dnm3</I> KO impaired vesicle endocytosis profoundly, causing enlarged vesicles, reduced vesicle density, reduced ERG responses, synaptic terminal degeneration, and disassembly and degeneration of postsynaptic processes. Concurrently, cone function remained intact. These results show the fundamental redundancy of dynamins 1 and 3 in regulating the structure and function of rod ribbon synapses.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/25/e1444232024?rss=1">Separate Cue- and Alpha-Related Mechanisms for Distractor Suppression</a></h4>

              
                <p>Research on selective attention has largely focused on the enhancement of behaviorally important information, with less focus on the suppression of distracting information. Enhancement and suppression can operate through a push&ndash;pull relationship attributable to competitive interactions among neural populations. There has been considerable debate, however, regarding (1) whether suppression can be voluntarily deployed, independent of enhancement, and (2) whether voluntary deployment of suppression is associated with neural processes occurring prior to the distractor onset. Here, we investigated the interplay between pre- and post-distractor neural processes, while male and female human subjects performed a visual search task with a cue that indicated the location of an upcoming distractor. We utilized two established EEG markers of suppression: the distractor positivity (P<SUB>D</SUB>) and alpha power (~8&ndash;15&nbsp;Hz). The P<SUB>D</SUB>&mdash;a component of event-related potentials&mdash;has been linked with successful distractor suppression, and increased alpha power has been linked with attenuated sensory processing. Cueing the location of an upcoming distractor speeded responses and led to an earlier P<SUB>D</SUB>, consistent with earlier suppression due to strategic use of a spatial cue. In comparison, higher predistractor alpha power contralateral to distractors led to a later P<SUB>D</SUB>, consistent with later suppression. Lower alpha power contralateral to distractors instead led to distractor-related attentional capture. Lateralization of alpha power was not linked to the spatial cue. This observation, combined with differences in the timing of suppression&mdash;as indexed by earlier and later P<SUB>D</SUB> components&mdash;demonstrates that cue-related, voluntary suppression can occur separate from alpha-related gating of sensory processing.</p>
