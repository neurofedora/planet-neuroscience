              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03706">Controllable Surface Diffusion Generative Model for Neurodevelopmental Trajectories</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.03706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preterm birth disrupts the typical trajectory of cortical neurodevelopment, increasing the risk of cognitive and behavioral difficulties. However, outcomes vary widely, posing a significant challenge for early prediction. To address this, individualized simulation offers a promising solution by modeling subject-specific neurodevelopmental trajectories, enabling the identification of subtle deviations from normative patterns that might act as biomarkers of risk. While generative models have shown potential for simulating neurodevelopment, prior approaches often struggle to preserve subject-specific cortical folding patterns or to reproduce region-specific morphological variations. In this paper, we present a novel graph-diffusion network that supports controllable simulation of cortical maturation. Using cortical surface data from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), we demonstrate that the model maintains subject-specific cortical morphology while modeling cortical maturation sufficiently well to fool an independently trained age regression network, achieving a prediction accuracy of $0.85 \pm 0.62$.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04435">Cognitive Effort in the Two-Step Task: An Active Inference Drift-Diffusion Model Approach</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.04435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-level theories rooted in the Bayesian Brain Hypothesis often frame cognitive effort as the cost of resolving the conflict between habits and optimal policies. In parallel, evidence accumulator models (EAMs) provide a mechanistic account of how effort arises from competition between the subjective values of available options. Although EAMs have been combined with frameworks like Reinforcement Learning to bridge the gap between high-level theories and process-level mechanisms, relatively less attention has been paid to their implications for a unified notion of cognitive effort. Here, we combine Active Inference (AIF) with the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) to investigate whether the resulting AIF-DDM can simultaneously account for effort arising from both habit violation and value discriminability. To our knowledge, this is the first time AIF has been combined with an EAM. We tested the AIF-DDM on a behavioral dataset from the two-step task and compared its predictions to an information-theoretic definition of cognitive effort based on AIF. The model's predictions successfully accounted for second-stage reaction times but failed to capture the dynamics of the first stage. We argue the latter discrepancy likely stems from the experimental design rather than a fundamental flaw in the model's assumptions about cognitive effort. Accordingly, we propose several modifications of the two-step task to better measure and isolate cognitive effort. Finally, we found that integrating the DDM significantly improved parameter recovery, which could help future studies to obtain more reliable parameter estimates.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03717">Relationship between Perceived Maneuverability and Involuntary Eye Movements under Systematically Varied Time Constants of Ride-on Machinery</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.03717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies suggest that involuntary eye movements exhibit greater stability during active motion compared to passive motion, and this effect may also apply to the operation of ride-on machinery. Moreover, a study suggested that experimentally manipulating the sense of agency (SoA) by introducing delays may influence the stability of involuntary eye movements. Although a preliminary investigation examined involuntary eye movements and perceived maneuverability under two distinct machine dynamics with preserved SoA, it remains unclear how systematic variations in motion dynamics influence these factors. Therefore, the purpose of the present research was to investigate whether systematic variations in the dynamic properties of a ride-on machine, where the perceived maneuverability is modulated, influence the accuracy of involuntary eye movements in human operators. Participants rode a yaw-rotational platform whose time constant from joystick input to motor torque of a rotational machine was systematically manipulated. During the operation, eye movements were recorded while participants fixated on a visual target. After each condition, participants provided subjective ratings of maneuverability and cognitive load. As the platform's time constant increased, the perceived maneuverability scores decreased while the cognitive loads increased. Concurrently, involuntary eye movement accuracy decreased. Moderate to weak positive correlations emerged between the perceived maneuverability scores and the eye movement gain and accuracy, while a weak negative correlation was found with cognitive load.

                arXiv:2508.04255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of rodent social behavior has shifted in the last years from relying on direct human observation to more nuanced approaches integrating computational methods in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. While conventional approaches introduce bias and can fail to capture the complexity of rodent social interactions, modern approaches bridging computer vision, ethology and neuroscience provide more multifaceted insights into behavior which are particularly relevant to social neuroscience. Despite these benefits, the integration of AI into social behavior research also poses several challenges. Here we discuss the main steps involved and the tools available for analyzing rodent social behavior, examining their advantages and limitations. Additionally, we suggest practical solutions to address common hurdles, aiming to guide young researchers in adopting these methods and to stimulate further discussion among experts regarding the evolving requirements of these tools in scientific applications.

                arXiv:2508.04383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can possess consciousness is a contentious question because of the inherent challenges of defining and operationalizing subjective experience. This paper proposes a framework to reframe the question of artificial consciousness into empirically tractable tests. We introduce three evaluative criteria - S (subjective-linguistic), L (latent-emergent), and P (phenomenological-structural) - collectively termed SLP-tests, which assess whether an AI system instantiates interface representations that facilitate consciousness-like properties. Drawing on category theory, we model interface representations as mappings between relational substrates (RS) and observable behaviors, akin to specific types of abstraction layers. The SLP-tests collectively operationalize subjective experience not as an intrinsic property of physical systems but as a functional interface to a relational entity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07543">Ordinal Characterization of Similarity Judgments</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2310.07543v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing judgments of similarity within a perceptual or semantic domain, and making inferences about the underlying structure of this domain from these judgments, has an increasingly important role in cognitive and systems neuroscience. We present a new framework for this purpose that makes limited assumptions about how perceptual distances are converted into similarity judgments. The approach starts from a dataset of empirical judgments of relative similarities: the fraction of times that a subject chooses one of two comparison stimuli to be more similar to a reference stimulus. These empirical judgments provide Bayesian estimates of underling choice probabilities. From these estimates, we derive indices that characterize the set of judgments in three ways: compatibility with a symmetric dis-similarity, compatibility with an ultrametric space, and compatibility with an additive tree. Each of the indices is derived from rank-order relationships among the choice probabilities that, as we show, are necessary and sufficient for local consistency with the three respective characteristics. We illustrate this approach with simulations and example psychophysical datasets of dis-similarity judgments in several visual domains and provide code that implements the analyses at https://github.com/jvlab/simrank.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14221">Brain functions emerge as thermal equilibrium states of the connectome</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.14221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental idea in neuroscience is that cognitive functions -- such as perception, learning, memory, and locomotion -- are shaped and constrained by the brain's structural organization. Despite significant progress in mapping and analyzing structural connectomes, the principles linking the brain's physical architecture to its functional capabilities remain elusive. Here, we introduce an algebraic quantum model to bridge this theoretical gap, offering new insights into the relationship between the connectome and emergent brain functions, while connecting structural data to functional predictions. Using the well-mapped C. elegans anatomical and extrasynaptic connectomes, we demonstrate that brain functions, defined as functional networks of a neural system, emerge as thermal equilibrium states of an algebraic quantum system derived from the graph algebra of the underlying directed multigraph. Specifically, these equilibrium states, characterized by the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) formalism, reveal how individual neurons contribute to functional network formation. Our model illuminates the structure-function relationship in neural circuits through two key features: (1) a functional connectome that delineates topologically driven neuronal interactions and (2) an Integration Capacity (IC) index that quantifies how effectively neurons coordinate and modulate diverse information flows. Together, these features provide a statistical and mechanistic account of information flow and reveal how the network topology of the connectome predicts cognition and complex behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21738">The Spatiotemporal Organization of Motor Cortex Activity Supporting Manual Dexterity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.21738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motor cortex (M1) is a crucial brain area for controlling voluntary movements, such as reaching and grasping for a cup of coffee. M1 is organized in a somatotopic manner, such that M1 output driving movement to different parts of the body is organized along the cortical surface. In primates, the arm and hand are represented in M1 as separate but overlapping territories. Unit activity recorded from the M1 forelimb representation comodulates with parameters related to reaching and/or grasping. The overall aim of this dissertation is to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of M1 activity that produces reach-to-grasp movements. To address this goal, intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is delivered along the precentral gyrus of two macaque monkeys to define the M1 motor map. Subsequently, cortical activity is recorded from the M1 forelimb representation using intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI) while macaques execute an instructed reach-to-grasp task. Results from imaging experiments produce spatial maps that define cortical territories with increased activity during reach-to-grasp movements. Next, unit activity was recorded from the M1 forelimb representation with a laminar multielectrode while macaques completed the same reach-to-grasp task. Recording site locations differed between sessions to comprehensively sample unit responses throughout the M1 forelimb representation. Imaging experiments reveal that activity supporting reach-to-grasp movements was concentrated in patches that comprise less than half of the M1 forelimb representation. Electrophysiology recordings reveal that activity related to reaching is spatially organized within M1 distinctly from activity related to grasping. The results support the idea that spatial organizing principles are inherent in M1 activity that supports reach-to-grasp movements.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03115">The Multi-biophysical nature of Computation in brain neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.03115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comprehending the nature of action potentials is fundamental to our understanding of the functioning of nervous systems in general. The ionic mechanisms underlying action potentials in the squid giant axon were first described by Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952 and their findings have formed our orthodox view of how the physiological action potential functions. However, substan-tial evidence has now accumulated to show that the action potential is accompanied by a syn-chronized coupled soliton pressure pulse in the cell membrane, the action potential pulse (AP-Pulse) which we have recently shown to have an essential function in computation. Here we ex-plore the interactions between the soliton and the ionic mechanisms known to be associated with the action potential. Computational models of the action potential usually describe it as a binary event, but we have shown that it must be a quantum ternary event known as the computa-tional action potential (CAP), whose temporal fixed point is the threshold of the soliton, rather than the rather plastic action potential peak used in other models to facilitate meaningful compu-tation. We have demonstrated this type of frequency computation for the retina, in detail, and also provided an extensive analysis for computation for other brain neural networks. The CAP ac-companies the APPulse and the Physiological action potential. Therefore, we conclude that nerve impulses appear to be an ensemble of three inseparable, interdependent, concurrent states: the physiological action potential, the APPulse and the CAP. However, while the physio-logical action potential is important in terms of neural connectivity, it is irrelevant to computational processes as this is always facilitated by the soliton part of the APPulse.

Abstract: Even when massively overparameterized, deep neural networks show a remarkable ability to generalize. Research on this phenomenon has focused on generalization within distribution, via smooth interpolation. Yet in some settings neural networks also learn to extrapolate to data far beyond the bounds of the original training set, sometimes even allowing for infinite generalization, implying that an algorithm capable of solving the task has been learned. Here we undertake a case study of the learning dynamics of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on the streaming parity task in order to develop an effective theory of algorithm development. The streaming parity task is a simple but nonlinear task defined on sequences up to arbitrary length. We show that, with sufficient finite training experience, RNNs exhibit a phase transition to perfect infinite generalization. Using an effective theory for the representational dynamics, we find an implicit representational merger effect which can be interpreted as the construction of a finite automaton that reproduces the task. Overall, our results disclose one mechanism by which neural networks can generalize infinitely from finite training experience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09206">pyhgf: A neural network library for predictive coding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.09206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian models of cognition have gained considerable traction in computational neuroscience and psychiatry. Their scopes are now expected to expand rapidly to artificial intelligence, providing general inference frameworks to support embodied, adaptable, and energy-efficient autonomous agents. A central theory in this domain is predictive coding, which posits that learning and behaviour are driven by hierarchical probabilistic inferences about the causes of sensory inputs. Biological realism constrains these networks to rely on simple local computations in the form of precision-weighted predictions and prediction errors. This can make this framework highly efficient, but its implementation comes with unique challenges on the software development side. Embedding such models in standard neural network libraries often becomes limiting, as these libraries' compilation and differentiation backends can force a conceptual separation between optimization algorithms and the systems being optimized. This critically departs from other biological principles such as self-monitoring, self-organisation, cellular growth and functional plasticity. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{pyhgf}: a Python package backed by JAX and Rust for creating, manipulating and sampling dynamic networks for predictive coding. We improve over other frameworks by enclosing the network components as transparent, modular and malleable variables in the message-passing steps. The resulting graphs can implement arbitrary computational complexities as beliefs propagation. But the transparency of core variables can also translate into inference processes that leverage self-organisation principles, and express structure learning, meta-learning or causal discovery as the consequence of network structural adaptation to surprising inputs. The code, tutorials and documentation are hosted at: https://github.com/ilabcode/pyhgf.

                arXiv:2508.03966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) and large language models (LLMs) differ in how program specifications are provided: GP uses input-output examples, and LLMs use text descriptions. In this work, we compared the ability of PushGP and GPT-4o to synthesize computer programs for tasks from the PSB2 benchmark suite. We used three prompt variants with GPT-4o: input-output examples (data-only), textual description of the task (text-only), and a combination of both textual descriptions and input-output examples (data-text). Additionally, we varied the number of input-output examples available for building programs. For each synthesizer and task combination, we compared success rates across all program synthesizers, as well as the similarity between successful GPT-4o synthesized programs. We found that the combination of PushGP and GPT-4o with data-text prompting led to the greatest number of tasks solved (23 of the 25 tasks), even though several tasks were solved exclusively by only one of the two synthesizers. We also observed that PushGP and GPT-4o with data-only prompting solved fewer tasks with the decrease in the training set size, while the remaining synthesizers saw no decrease. We also detected significant differences in similarity between the successful programs synthesized for GPT-4o with text-only and data-only prompting. With there being no dominant program synthesizer, this work highlights the importance of different optimization techniques used by PushGP and LLMs to synthesize programs.

                arXiv:2508.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work proposes a Deep Learning architecture for the prediction of various consumer choice behaviors from time series of raw gaze or eye fixations on images of the decision environment, for which currently no foundational models are available. The architecture, called STARE (Spatio-Temporal Attention Representation for Eye Tracking), uses a new tokenization strategy, which involves mapping the x- and y- pixel coordinates of eye-movement time series on predefined, contiguous Regions of Interest. That tokenization makes the spatio-temporal eye-movement data available to the Chronos, a time-series foundation model based on the T5 architecture, to which co-attention and/or cross-attention is added to capture directional and/or interocular influences of eye movements. We compare STARE with several state-of-the art alternatives on multiple datasets with the purpose of predicting consumer choice behaviors from eye movements. We thus make a first step towards developing and testing DL architectures that represent visual attention dynamics rooted in the neurophysiology of eye movements.

                arXiv:2508.04270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primate visual cortex exhibits topographic organization, where functionally similar neurons are spatially clustered, a structure widely believed to enhance neural processing efficiency. While prior works have demonstrated that conventional deep ANNs can develop topographic representations, these models largely neglect crucial temporal dynamics. This oversight often leads to significant performance degradation in tasks like object recognition and compromises their biological fidelity. To address this, we leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture spike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic deep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the hierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual cortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations. Our results show that STC effectively generates representative topographic features across simulated visual cortical areas. While introducing topography typically leads to significant performance degradation in ANNs, our spiking architecture exhibits a remarkably small performance drop (No drop in ImageNet top-1 accuracy, compared to a 3\% drop observed in TopoNet, which is the best-performing topographic ANN so far) and outperforms topographic ANNs in brain-likeness. We also reveal that topographic organization facilitates efficient and stable temporal information processing via the spike mechanism in TDSNNs, contributing to model robustness. These findings suggest that TDSNNs offer a compelling balance between computational performance and brain-like features, providing not only a framework for interpreting neural science phenomena but also novel insights for designing more efficient and robust deep learning models.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for optimizing the sliding mode control (SMC) parameter for a robot manipulator applying a genetic algorithm (GA). The objective of the SMC is to achieve precise and consistent tracking of the trajectory of the robot manipulator under uncertain and disturbed conditions. However, the system effectiveness and robustness depend on the choice of the SMC parameters, which is a difficult and crucial task. To solve this problem, a genetic algorithm is used to locate the optimal values of these parameters that gratify the capability criteria. The proposed method is efficient compared with the conventional SMC and Fuzzy-SMC. The simulation results show that the genetic algorithm with SMC can achieve better tracking capability and reduce the chattering effect.

                arXiv:2508.04167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lenia is a continuous extension of Conway's Game of Life that exhibits rich pattern formations including self-propelling structures called gliders. In this paper, we focus on Asymptotic Lenia, a variant formulated as partial differential equations. By utilizing this mathematical formulation, we analytically derive the conditions for glider patterns, which we term the ``Glider Equation.'' We demonstrate that by using this equation as a loss function, gradient descent methods can successfully discover stable glider configurations. This approach enables the optimization of update rules to find novel gliders with specific properties, such as faster-moving variants. We also derive a velocity-free equation that characterizes gliders of any speed, expanding the search space for novel patterns. While many optimized patterns result in transient gliders that eventually destabilize, our approach effectively identifies diverse pattern formations that would be difficult to discover through traditional methods. Finally, we establish connections between Asymptotic Lenia and neural field models, highlighting mathematical relationships that bridge these systems and suggesting new directions for analyzing pattern formation in continuous dynamical systems.

Abstract: Modeling the evolution of high-dimensional systems from limited snapshot observations at irregular time points poses a significant challenge in quantitative biology and related fields. Traditional approaches often rely on dimensionality reduction techniques, which can oversimplify the dynamics and fail to capture critical transient behaviors in non-equilibrium systems. We present Multi-Marginal Stochastic Flow Matching (MMSFM), a novel extension of simulation-free score and flow matching methods to the multi-marginal setting, enabling the alignment of high-dimensional data measured at non-equidistant time points without reducing dimensionality. The use of measure-valued splines enhances robustness to irregular snapshot timing, and score matching prevents overfitting in high-dimensional spaces. We validate our framework on several synthetic and benchmark datasets, including gene expression data collected at uneven time points and an image progression task, demonstrating the method's versatility.

                arXiv:2508.04459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems like aircraft and spacecraft are expensive to operate in the real world. The design, validation, and testing for such systems therefore relies on a combination of mathematical modeling, abundant numerical simulations, and a relatively small set of real-world experiments. Due to modeling errors, simplifications, and uncertainties, the data synthesized by simulation models often does not match data from the system's real-world operation. We consider the broad research question of whether this model mismatch can be significantly reduced by generative artificial intelligence models (GAIMs). Unlike text- or image-processing, where generative models have attained recent successes, GAIM development for aerospace engineering applications must not only train with scarce operational data, but their outputs must also satisfy governing equations based on natural laws, e.g., conservation laws. The scope of this paper primarily focuses on two case studies of optimally controlled systems that are commonly understood and employed in aircraft guidance, namely: minimum-time navigation in a wind field and minimum-exposure navigation in a threat field. We report GAIMs that are trained with a relatively small set, of the order of a few hundred, of examples and with underlying governing equations. By focusing on optimally controlled systems, we formulate training loss functions based on invariance of the Hamiltonian function along system trajectories. We investigate three GAIM architectures, namely: the generative adversarial network (GAN) and two variants of the variational autoencoder (VAE). We provide architectural details and thorough performance analyses of these models. The main finding is that our new models, especially the VAE-based models, are able to synthesize data that satisfy the governing equations and are statistically similar to the training data despite small volumes of training data.

Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to emotion detection using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs). Unlike traditional unimodal techniques that rely on a single data type, we explore a multimodal framework integrating text, audio, and facial expressions. The proposed cGAN architecture is trained to generate synthetic emotion-rich data and improve classification accuracy across multiple modalities. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in emotion recognition performance compared to baseline models. This work highlights the potential of cGANs in enhancing human-computer interaction systems by enabling more nuanced emotional understanding.

Abstract: Inspired by the brain's hierarchical processing and energy efficiency, this paper presents a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture for lifelong Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The proposed system first employs an efficient static SNN to identify potential intrusions, which then activates an adaptive dynamic SNN responsible for classifying the specific attack type. Mimicking biological adaptation, the dynamic classifier utilizes Grow When Required (GWR)-inspired structural plasticity and a novel Adaptive Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (Ad-STDP) learning rule. These bio-plausible mechanisms enable the network to learn new threats incrementally while preserving existing knowledge. Tested on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark in a continual learning setting, the architecture demonstrates robust adaptation, reduced catastrophic forgetting, and achieves $85.3$\% overall accuracy. Furthermore, simulations using the Intel Lava framework confirm high operational sparsity, highlighting the potential for low-power deployment on neuromorphic hardware.

This leads to many benefits in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Currently, the design of EENNs is carried out manually by experts, a complex and time-consuming task that requires accounting for many aspects, including the correct placement, the thresholding, and the computational overhead of the EECs. For this reason, the research is exploring the use of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automatize the design of EENNs. Currently, few comprehensive NAS solutions for EENNs have been proposed in the literature, and a fully automated, joint design strategy taking into consideration both the backbone and the EECs remains an open problem. To this end, this work presents Neural Architecture Search for Hardware Constrained Early Exit Neural Networks (NACHOS), the first NAS framework for the design of optimal EENNs satisfying constraints on the accuracy and the number of Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) operations performed by the EENNs at inference time. In particular, this provides the joint design of backbone and EECs to select a set of admissible (i.e., respecting the constraints) Pareto Optimal Solutions in terms of best tradeoff between the accuracy and number of MACs. The results show that the models designed by NACHOS are competitive with the state-of-the-art EENNs. Additionally, this work investigates the effectiveness of two novel regularization terms designed for the optimization of the auxiliary classifiers of the EENN

                arXiv:2403.05839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing event stream based trackers undergo evaluation on short-term tracking datasets, however, the tracking of real-world scenarios involves long-term tracking, and the performance of existing tracking algorithms in these scenarios remains unclear. In this paper, we first propose a new long-term, large-scale frame-event visual object tracking dataset, termed FELT. It contains 1,044 long-term videos that involve 1.9 million RGB frames and event stream pairs, 60 different target objects, and 14 challenging attributes. To build a solid benchmark, we retrain and evaluate 21 baseline trackers on our dataset for future work to compare. In addition, we propose a novel Associative Memory Transformer based RGB-Event long-term visual tracker, termed AMTTrack. It follows a one-stream tracking framework and aggregates the multi-scale RGB/event template and search tokens effectively via the Hopfield retrieval layer. The framework also embodies another aspect of associative memory by maintaining dynamic template representations through an associative memory update scheme, which addresses the appearance variation in long-term tracking. Extensive experiments on FELT, FE108, VisEvent, and COESOT datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed tracker. Both the dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/FELT_SOT_Benchmark

                arXiv:2405.06419v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In practical scenarios, time series forecasting necessitates not only accuracy but also efficiency. Consequently, the exploration of model architectures remains a perennially trending topic in research. To address these challenges, we propose a novel backbone architecture named Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN) from the perspective of information fusion. Specifically, we introduce the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module based on evidence theory to capture the uncertainty of multivariate time series data from both channel and time dimensions. Additionally, we develop a novel multi-source information fusion method to effectively integrate the two distinct dimensions from BPA output, leading to improved forecasting accuracy. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that TEFN achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining significantly lower complexity and reduced training time. Also, our experiments show that TEFN exhibits high robustness, with minimal error fluctuations during hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, due to the fact that BPA is derived from fuzzy theory, TEFN offers a high degree of interpretability. Therefore, the proposed TEFN balances accuracy, efficiency, stability, and interpretability, making it a desirable solution for time series forecasting.

                arXiv:2502.12020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a network of coupled oscillators that can learn to solve a classification task from a set of examples -- performing both training and inference through the nonlinear evolution of the system. We accomplish this by combining three key elements to achieve learning: A long-term memory that stores learned responses, analogous to the synapses in biological brains; a short-term memory that stores the neural activations, similar to the firing patterns of neurons; and an evolution law that updates the synapses in response to novel examples, inspired by synaptic plasticity. Achieving all three elements in wave-based information processors such as metamaterials is a significant challenge. Here, we solve it by leveraging the material multistability to implement long-term memory, and harnessing symmetries and thermal noise to realize the learning rule. Our analysis reveals that the learning mechanism, although inspired by synaptic plasticity, also shares parallelisms with bacterial evolution strategies, where mutation rates increase in the presence of noxious stimuli.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09781">Learning richness modulates equality reasoning in neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.09781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equality reasoning is ubiquitous and purely abstract: sameness or difference may be evaluated no matter the nature of the underlying objects. As a result, same-different (SD) tasks have been extensively studied as a starting point for understanding abstract reasoning in humans and across animal species. With the rise of neural networks that exhibit striking apparent proficiency for abstractions, equality reasoning in these models has also gained interest. Yet despite extensive study, conclusions about equality reasoning vary widely and with little consensus. To clarify the underlying principles in learning SD tasks, we develop a theory of equality reasoning in multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). Following observations in comparative psychology, we propose a spectrum of behavior that ranges from conceptual to perceptual outcomes. Conceptual behavior is characterized by task-specific representations, efficient learning, and insensitivity to spurious perceptual details. Perceptual behavior is characterized by strong sensitivity to spurious perceptual details, accompanied by the need for exhaustive training to learn the task. We develop a mathematical theory to show that an MLP's behavior is driven by learning richness. Rich-regime MLPs exhibit conceptual behavior, whereas lazy-regime MLPs exhibit perceptual behavior. We validate our theoretical findings in vision SD experiments, showing that rich feature learning promotes success by encouraging hallmarks of conceptual behavior. Overall, our work identifies feature learning richness as a key parameter modulating equality reasoning, and suggests that equality reasoning in humans and animals may similarly depend on learning richness in neural circuits.

                arXiv:2504.15110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold superposition theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as an improved backbone for most deep learning frameworks, promising more adaptivity than their multilayer perceptron (MLP) predecessor by allowing for trainable spline-based activation functions. In this paper, we probe the theoretical foundations of the KAN architecture by showing that it can optimally approximate any Besov function in $B^{s}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$ on a bounded open, or even fractal, domain $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at the optimal approximation rate with respect to any weaker Besov norm $B^{\alpha}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$; where $\alpha < s$. We complement our approximation result with a statistical guarantee by bounding the pseudodimension of the relevant class of Res-KANs. As an application of the latter, we directly deduce a dimension-free estimate on the sample complexity of a residual KAN model when learning a function of Besov regularity from $N$ i.i.d. noiseless samples, showing that KANs can learn the smooth maps which they can approximate.

                arXiv:2505.09742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.

                arXiv:2508.03324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding. These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based HGR.

">Competing valence-related roles of dopamine in the tail of the striatum</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain evaluates aversion and appetition to guide behavior remains an open question. Here, we investigated the role of dopamine signaling in the tail of the striatum (TS) in regulating competing valence-based behaviors and learning. TS dopamine dynamics were monitored as mice performed a classical conditioning task in which an odor cue predicted either an aversive air puff or a water reward. Initially, mice exhibited anticipatory blinking, which diminished over time, while anticipatory licking emerged later, coinciding with adaptation to the air puff. Dopamine responses in the TS to the air puff and its associated odor were initially elevated but declined with repeated exposure. Optogenetic disruption of this decline suppressed adaptation and hindered appetitive learning. These findings demonstrate that TS dopamine dynamics are essential for behavioral adaptation to aversive stimuli, which indirectly facilitates appetitive learning, underscoring a regulatory mechanism for shifting between defensive and reward-seeking behaviors.

                <p>Neurite outgrowth is critically controlled by calcium influx-mediated cytoskeleton dynamics. Spastin, a AAA ATPase microtubule-severing protein, also plays an important role in neurite outgrowth. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying posttranscriptional fine-tuning spastin activity, particularly in the context of calcium signaling, remain elusive. Here, we identified that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II beta (CaMKII&beta;) isoform acted as an upstream kinase to mediate the phosphorylation of spastin. CaMKII&beta; interacted with and phosphorylated spastin on Ser233 and Ser562 amino acids. Moreover, CaMKII&beta;-mediated phosphorylation reduced the polyubiquitination level of spastin and suppressed its proteasomal degradation. This enhanced protein stability by CaMKII&beta; increased the microtubule-severing activity of spastin and coordinately promoted the neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons. Inhibition of spastin or CaMKII&beta; impaired synaptic activity, as evidenced by reduced frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). Behaviorally, treatment with spastin or CaMKII&beta; inhibitors led to deficits in short-term working memory and spatial learning, as assessed by Y-maze and Morris water maze tests in male mice, respectively. In general, this study unveils a novel mechanism whereby CaMKII&beta;-mediated phosphorylation of spastin connects extracellular calcium signaling to the regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics and neurite outgrowth.</p>

                <p>Interpreting ambiguous environmental cues, like facial expressions, becomes increasingly challenging with age, especially as cognitive resources decline. Managing these challenges requires adaptive neural mechanisms that are essential for maintaining mental well-being. The locus ceruleus (LC), the brain's main norepinephrine source, regulates attention, arousal, and stress response. With extensive cortical connections, the LC supports adapting to cognitive demands and resolving conflicting cues from environment, particularly in later life. Previous research suggests that LC interacts with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during high-conflict tasks. However, whether LC activity and its connectivity with the PFC support emotional ambiguity processing and contributes to emotional well-being in healthy aging remains unclear. To address this gap, we used 7T-MRI to examine LC function in 75 younger (25.8 &plusmn; 4.02&nbsp;years, 35 females) and 69 older adults (71.3 &plusmn; 4.1&nbsp;years, 35 females) during facial emotion recognition task morphed with varying ambiguity: unambiguous, intermediate ambiguity, and absolute ambiguity. Behaviorally, participants had longer response times and lower confidence during the absolute-ambiguity condition, while older adults perceived ambiguous faces as happy more frequently than younger adults. Neuroimaging results revealed older adults exhibited greater LC activity and enhanced connectivity with dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) during absolute ambiguity compared with younger adults. This heightened connectivity in older adults was linked to better task-independent self-reported mental well-being questionnaires and greater emotional resilience scores derived from principal component analysis. Overall, these findings suggest that greater LC activity supports managing cognitively demanding tasks, while enhanced LC&ndash;dlPFC connectivity promotes emotional well-being, highlighting this neural pathway's role in healthy aging.</p>

                <p>Stress is a critical risk factor for the development of psychological disorders, including anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Key brain regions, including the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (IL-mPFC), play crucial roles in fear regulation. Our previous research demonstrated that neuronal genomic activity of glucocorticoid receptors in the BLA during a 2&nbsp;h acute restraint stress (ARS) is essential for inducing anxiety-like behavior 10&nbsp;d later. Additionally, blocking BLA &beta;-adrenergic signaling during the elevated plus maze is crucial for preventing this stress-induced delayed anxiety-like behavior. Here, we utilized adult male Wistar rats to expand on these findings, revealing that a single ARS session increases the activity of BLA neurons and their projections to the IL-mPFC while decreasing the activity of IL-mPFC neurons and their projections to the BLA during fear extinction. This finding highlights the key role of the BLAIL-mPFC circuitry in fear extinction and its susceptibility to acute stress-induced changes. Notably, the delayed stress-induced fear extinction deficit and decreased IL-mPFC activity during fear extinction depend on the stress-responsive BLA neuronal ensemble and BLA &beta;-adrenergic signaling during contextual fear conditioning (CFC) 10&nbsp;d poststress. Our findings demonstrate the significance of BLA &beta;-adrenergic signaling during CFC, as it induces delayed stress-induced impairments in extinction and regulates IL-mPFC activity during fear extinction. Furthermore, this study indicates that the BLA is a pivotal regulator of delayed stress effects at both the circuitry and behavioral levels, thus shedding new light on the mechanisms underlying stress-related psychiatric conditions.</p>

                <p>Nicotine addiction remains a major cause of disease and premature death worldwide. Nicotine modulates neural pathways that underlie both rewarding and aversive behavioral effects, but persistent activation of brain reward circuitry drives nicotine consumption despite the negative consequences. When nicotine users attempt to quit, additional neural mechanisms are recruited to generate an aversive withdrawal state, which contributes to the remarkably high relapse rate among nicotine users. The interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) and its presynaptic inputs from the medial habenula are key mediators of aversive nicotine withdrawal symptoms, but the downstream neural targets mediating these effects are unknown. The aversive effects of acute exposure to high doses of nicotine require inhibitory IPN GABAergic projections to the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDTg), a key driver of reward-related dopamine signaling. Here we show that optogenetic inhibition of these IPN-&gt;LDTg projections reduces behavioral and physiological effects of nicotine withdrawal in male and female mice. Using fiber photometry, we found that nicotine withdrawal reduced reward-related signaling with decreases in both LDTg neuronal activity and nucleus accumbens dopamine release. These studies demonstrate a direct link between aversive and appetitive neural pathways that is active during nicotine withdrawal, providing novel targets for treating nicotine addiction.</p>

                <p>The endogenous aspect of social influence, reflected in the spontaneous alignment of behaviors within close social relationships, plays a crucial role in understanding human social behavior. In two studies involving 222 human subjects (Study 1: <I>n</I> = 175, 106 females; Study 2: <I>n</I> = 47, 33 females), we used a longitudinal behavioral study and a naturalistic stimuli neuroimaging study to investigate the endogenous consumer behavior similarities and their neural basis in real-world social networks. The findings reveal that friends, compared with nonfriends, exhibit higher similarity in product evaluation, which undergoes dynamic changes as the structure of social networks changes. Both neuroimaging and meta-analytic decoding results indicate that friends exhibit heightened neural synchrony, which is linked to cognitive functions such as object perception, attention, memory, social judgment, and reward processing. Stacking machine learning-based predictive models demonstrate that the functional connectivity maps of brain activity can predict the purchase intention of their friends or their own rather than strangers. Based on the significant neural similarity which exists among individuals in close relationships within authentic social networks, the current study reveals the predictive capacity of neural activity in predicting the behavior of friends.</p>

                <p>The brain's representation of hand position is critical for voluntary movement. Representation is multisensory, combining visual and proprioceptive cues. When these cues conflict, the brain recalibrates its unimodal estimates, shifting them closer together to compensate. Research suggests such updates to body representation are communicated to the motor system to keep hand movements accurate. The neural mechanism is unclear and may depend on how the brain integrates and recalibrates visuoproprioceptive signals: models ranging from hierarchical convergence after unisensory processing to more distributed frameworks have been proposed. We hypothesized that the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is crucial in this updating process due to its role in proprioception and connections with both primary motor cortex (M1) and multisensory regions of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). In human participants of both sexes, Experiment 1 showed that short-latency afferent inhibition, a measure of somatosensory&ndash;motor integration, changed with proprioceptive recalibration and only in the presence of a cue conflict. This indicates that S1 activity reflects the results of multisensory computations and is inconsistent with a pure hierarchical convergence model of visuoproprioceptive integration. Experiment 2 found that modulating S1, but not M1, with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation increased proprioceptive variance and recalibration. This is consistent with the idea that motor effects of proprioceptive recalibration are mediated by the S1-&gt;M1 pathway, although not directly controlled by M1 itself. The specificity of our findings to proprioceptive&mdash;not visual&mdash;recalibration argues against a fully distributed framework, but our findings support a model of multisensory integration with reciprocal interactions between S1 and PPC.</p>

                <p>Identification of the neuron type is critical when using extracellular recordings in awake, behaving animal subjects to understand computation in neural circuits. Yet, modern recording probes have limited power to resolve neuron identity. Here, we present a generalizable framework for assigning the neuron type from extracellular recordings in nonhuman primates. The framework uses a combination of logic, circuit architecture, laminar information, and functional discharge properties. We apply the framework to the well characterized architecture of the cerebellar circuit by using well validated strategies to perform expert identification for a subset of extracellular neural recordings in behaving male rhesus macaques. We then use the subpopulation of expert-labeled neurons to train deep-learning classifiers to perform neuron identification with readily accessible extracellular features as inputs. Waveform, discharge statistics, and the anatomical layer each provide information about neuron identity for a sizable fraction of cerebellar units. Together, as inputs to a deep-learning classifier, the features perform even better. Our tools and methodologies, validated during smooth pursuit eye movements in the cerebellar floccular complex of awake behaving monkeys, can guide expert identification of the neuron type across neural circuits and species by leveraging the circuit layer, waveforms, discharge statistics, anatomical context, and circuit-specific knowledge. Thus, our generalized methodology lays essential groundwork for characterization of information processing at the level of neural circuits.</p>

                <p>In sleep, the brain balances protecting processes like memory consolidation with preserving responsiveness to significant external stimuli. Although reductions in higher-level auditory processes during deeper sleep have been described, the sleep-dependent changes across levels of auditory hierarchy, particularly as regards early sound representations, remain undefined. The frequency-following response (FFR) is an evoked auditory response that indexes neural encoding of sound periodicity. It is generated by neural populations in the brainstem, thalamus, and auditory cortex that phase-lock to periodic auditory stimuli and encode pitch information. The FFR&rsquo;s neural sources, which can be resolved using magnetoencephalography, allow evaluation of neural representation strength throughout the auditory neuraxis as a function of sleep state, as well as neural events like slow waves and sleep spindles that are hypothesized to attenuate acoustic processing as a means of preserving the sleep state. We recorded FFRs during a 2.5 h nap from 14 healthy male and female human adults to investigate how sleep depth and microarchitecture affect auditory encoding. We show that FFR strength is maintained across non-rapid eye movement sleep stages in subcortical nuclei, yet decreases in deeper sleep in the auditory cortex. FFR strength was not influenced by slow wave or spindle activity, but rather by reduced communication between the thalamus and cortex. This differentiation in sound representation across the auditory hierarchy suggests a means by which the brain might balance environmental monitoring with preserving critical restorative processes.</p>

                <p>Extensive evidence shows that humans are inconsistent in their choices. Yet, the neural mechanism underlying inconsistent choice remains unknown. Here, we aim to show that inconsistent choice is tied to the valuation process but is also linked to motor dynamics during task execution. We report the results from two behavioral and one neuroimaging studies. Human subjects (<I>n</I> = 206, 117 females) completed a well validated risky-choice task to measure their inconsistency levels, followed by two novel tasks, explicitly designed to examine motor dynamics free of value computations. We record mouse trajectories during task execution and extract 34 features to examine the role of motor dynamics in choice inconsistency. We show that motor dynamics predict inconsistency levels, even when motor output is absent any sort of valuation elements, nor is it related to deliberation about the decision. These results are robust across all three studies and when using various analysis strategies. We then apply neuroimaging and show that inconsistency is represented in value brain areas but, at the same time, is also related to activity in motor brain regions. These findings suggest that inconsistent choice behavior may arise from multiple cognitive processes and invite choice theorists to examine models of inconsistent choice that include heterogeneous sources of stochasticity.</p>

                <p>Recognizing speech in noise, such as in a busy restaurant, is an essential cognitive skill where the task difficulty varies across environments and noise levels. Although there is growing evidence that the auditory system relies on statistical representations for perceiving and coding natural sounds, it is less clear how statistical cues and neural representations contribute to segregating speech in natural auditory scenes. Here we demonstrate that male and female human listeners rely on mid-level statistics to segregate and recognize speech in environmental noise. Using natural backgrounds and variants with perturbed spectrotemporal statistics, we show that speech recognition accuracy at a fixed noise level varies extensively across natural backgrounds (0&ndash;100%). Furthermore, for each background the unique interference created by summary statistics can mask or unmask speech, thus hindering or improving speech recognition. To identify the neural coding strategy and statistical cues that influence accuracy, we developed generalized perceptual regression, a framework that links summary statistics from a neural model to word recognition accuracy. Whereas summary statistics from a peripheral cochlear model account for only 60% of perceptual variance, summary statistics from a mid-level auditory midbrain model accurately predict single-trial sensory judgments, accounting for &gt;90% of the perceptual variance. Furthermore, perceptual weights from the regression framework identify which statistics and tuned neural filters are influential and how they impact recognition. Thus, perception of speech in natural backgrounds relies on a mid-level auditory representation involving interference of multiple summary statistics that impact recognition beneficially or detrimentally across natural background sounds.</p>

                <p>by Wenjia Zhou, Junhua Zhang</p>

Discovery of cancer driver pathways is essential for targeted therapies, since these pathways govern tumor progression and treatment resistance. However, their context-specific patterns across populations remain poorly understood. Leveraging pan-cancer genomic data, we apply our two models, EntCDP and ModSDP, to perform stratified analyses from four perspectives: region, tumor type, age group, and risk factors. Our results reveal the regional biases in perturbed pathways, such as PI3K-Akt in Chinese patients and GPCR in American patients with bladder cancer. Subtype comparisons highlight the mTOR signaling in lung adenocarcinoma and the FoxO signaling in lung squamous cell carcinoma. Pediatric-adult comparisons emphasize the enrichment of Ras signaling in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and PAK signaling in pediatric glioblastoma, respectively. Risk factor associations further link Notch-mediated pathways to alcohol consumption and CDKN-regulated pathways to obesity-related cancers. Our findings demonstrate the utility of stratified driver pathway analysis in uncovering common and specific mechanisms, which can help prioritize context-aware therapeutic targets.

                <p>by Nobuhiko Wagatsuma, Sou Nobukawa, Tomoki Kurikawa</p>

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia are complex and heterogeneous mental disorders involving the dysfunction of multiple neural systems. The atypical and heterogenous temporal coordinations of neuronal activity, which are widely observed in these two disorders, are hypothesized to stem from an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance in the brain. To investigate the association between the E/I imbalance and atypical neural activities, and to assess the influence of specific subtypes of inhibitory interneurons on network activity regulation, we developed a computational microcircuit model with biologically plausible layer 2/3 of visual cortex that combined excitatory pyramidal neurons with three subtypes of inhibitory interneurons (parvalbumin [PV], somatostatin [SOM], and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide [VIP]). We numerically explored the role of distinct types of E/I imbalance by changing the population size of different subtype neurons. We find that when the E/I balance is disrupted by decreasing the PV population size, activity of the PV population precedes that of the pyramidal population, which enhances beta and gamma oscillations. Conversely, pyramidal neuronal population activity was the precursor of PV interneuron activity when the E/I imbalance was induced by decreasing the SOM population size; this preferentially impaired gamma-frequency activity. The disruption of E/I balance altered the information flow between pyramidal and PV populations, modulating neuronal dynamics. Our results suggest that E/I imbalance due to different subtype interneurons would induce the distinct types of the atypical neural behaviors associated with neural system dysfunction.

Computational pathway design and retro-biosynthetic approaches can facilitate the development of innovative biochemical production routes, biodegradation strategies, and the funneling of multiple precursors into a single bioproduct. However, effective pathway design necessitates a comprehensive understanding of biochemistries, enzyme activities, and thermodynamic feasibility. Herein, we introduce novoStoic2.0, an integrated platform that combines tools for estimating overall stoichiometry, designing de novo synthesis pathways, assessing thermodynamic feasibility, and selecting enzymes. novoStoic2.0 offers a unified web-based interface as a part of the AlphaSynthesis platform (http://novostoic.platform.moleculemaker.org/) tailored for the synthesis of thermodynamically viable pathways as well as the selection of enzymes for re-engineering required for novel reaction steps. We exemplify the utility of the platform to identify novel pathways for hydroxytyrosol synthesis, which are shorter than the known pathways and require reduced cofactor usage. In summary, novoStoic2.0 aims to streamline the process of pathway design contributing to the development of sustainable biotechnological solutions.

                <p>by Anne van der Meij, Hannah Tyrrell, Dustin J. Sokolowski, Evan M. F. Shepherdson, Marie A. Elliot, Justin R. Nodwell</p>

More than a billion tons of chitin are produced on earth each year. Chitin is rich in nitrogen and carbon, making it a valuable resource in competitive microbial ecosystems. However, almost all chitin is found in large, insoluble structures like insect and crustacean exoskeletons. For this material to enter a microorganism’s primary metabolism, it must be degraded extracellularly through a saprophytic process. The extracellular nature of this process means that liberated oligomers may also become accessible to other microorganisms. How microbes navigate this challenge in terrestrial ecosystems remains largely unclear. Here, we show that <i>Streptomyces venezuelae</i> thrives on raw, insoluble chitin as its sole carbon and nitrogen source, outperforming glucose in metabolic activity and sporulation. This was facilitated by a chitinolytic system encompassing up to 10 chitinases and the DasABC chitobiose importer. While deleting some chitinases affected growth on chitin, others did not, implying some degree of functional redundancy. A <i>dasBC</i> null mutation conferred a severe growth defect suggesting that chitobiose is a key breakdown product during chitin-based metabolism in <i>S. venezuelae</i>. The DasABC transporter also played a crucial role in preventing the built-up of chitobiose extracellularly, thereby restricting its access to <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> in co-cultures. Given the global ubiquity of <i>Streptomyces</i> in soil, this pathway likely plays a significant role in soil ecology as well as carbon and nitrogen turnover on a global scale.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Memories formed in adulthood can last a lifetime, whereas those formed early in life are rapidly forgotten through a process known as infantile amnesia. In recent years, tremendous progress has been made in understanding the memory engram—the physical trace of a memory in the brain—and how it transforms as memories evolve from recent to remote. This review focuses on engram cells and examines their roles in memory encoding, consolidation, retrieval, and forgetting from development to adulthood. We concentrate on four key brain regions: the hippocampus, the retrosplenial cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the anterior thalamic nuclei. We first focus on the adult brain, highlighting recent studies that reveal the distinct contributions of engram cells in each brain region, with particular emphasis on synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. We then explore how coordinated activity across these regions supports long-term memory. In the second section, we review emerging knowledge of engram cells in the developing brain, examining how developmental differences in their functions contribute to infant memory generalization and infantile amnesia. Compared to adults, much less is known about how, or to what extent, early-life memories undergo consolidation. In the final section, we synthesize current knowledge of memory consolidation and retrieval in the adult brain with what is known about the development of the four brain regions we discuss. We then propose key directions for future research. In sum, this review brings together recent findings that deepen our understanding of the dynamic changes in memory engrams that underlie consolidation and long-term storage and explores how developmental differences may shape the maturation of memory processes.</p>

                The velum interpositum (VI) is a membranous extension of the leptomeninges under the hippocampus. In this issue of Neuron, Hohsfield et al. characterizes cellular properties of the VI in mice and its role as a gateway for myeloid cells infiltrating the brain parenchyma.

                In this issue of Neuron, Zheng et al. show that disease-causing mutations identified in human TMEM63B alter its lipid scrambling but not ion channel function. These mutations disrupt a putative hydrophobic latch that may regulate scramblase activity in response to membrane thinning.

                The molecular mechanisms that govern the extended neuronal maturation in the primate brain remain incompletely understood. In this issue of Neuron, Gao et al. measure gene activity, chromatin state, and electrical properties of individual neurons in the macaque to reveal some of the genetic regulators of neuronal maturation in the cerebral cortex.

                In this issue of Neuron, Dijkstra et al. showed that deciding whether a perceived stimulus is actually present or whether it is just one’s own imagination depends on specific signals in the fusiform gyrus that are monitored by higher brain regions.

                In Cell, Haziza et al. demonstrate TEMPO (transmembrane electrical measurement performed optically) neural recording achieving unprecedented voltage sensitivity. The authors show recordings of sub-threshold traveling waves across brain regions and dissect cell-specific dynamics involved in epilepsy, opening a new frontier in studying neural dynamics from specific cell populations.

                Hollis, Sharma, et al. examine cell-type-specific diurnal rhythms in control and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-affected human brains. They find that AD preserves core clock function but disrupts output rhythms, especially in ribosomal and oxidative phosphorylation genes. In mice, circadian stress adds to AD pathology to further reduce ribosomal components and translational capacity.

                Fujisawa, Tanabe, and colleagues show that the transcription factor BATF is a pioneer in the effector differentiation of CD8+ T cells. BATF initiates chromatin reorganization upon antigen encounters and heterodimerizes with IRF4 to drive the dynamic rearrangement of epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes.

                The mechanism whereby the Bicoid morphogen gradient regulates target gene expression domains has been challenging to explain at the level of DNA binding. Here, Degen et al. demonstrate how transcription factor-nucleosome competition at key binding sites determines the concentration-dependent regulation of target gene expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102392">Acute aerobic exercise intensity does not modulate pain potentially due to differences in fitness levels and sex effects: results from a pharmacological fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                Exercise might lead to a release of endogenous opioids, potentially resulting in pain relief. However, the neurobiological underpinnings of this effect remain unclear. Using a pharmacological within-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with the opioid antagonist naloxone and different levels of aerobic exercise and pain, we investigated exercise-induced hypoalgesia (<i>N</i> = 39, 21 female). Overall, high-intensity (HI) aerobic exercise did not reduce pain as compared to low-intensity aerobic exercise. Accordingly, we observed no significant changes in the descending pain modulatory system. The µ-opioid antagonist naloxone significantly increased overall pain ratings but showed no interaction with exercise intensity. An exploratory analysis suggested an influence of fitness level (as indicated by the functional threshold power) and sex, where males showed greater hypoalgesia after HI exercise with increasing fitness levels. This effect was attenuated by naloxone and mirrored by fMRI signal changes in the medial frontal cortex, where activation also varied with fitness level and sex, and was reversed by naloxone. These results indicate that different aerobic exercise intensities have no differential effect on pain in a mixed population sample, but individual factors such as fitness level and sex might play a role. The current study underscores the need for personalised exercise interventions to enhance pain relief in healthy as well as chronic pain populations, taking into account the sex and fitness status as well as the necessity to further investigate the opioidergic involvement in exercise-induced pain modulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101918">Identification and characterization of early human photoreceptor states and cell-state-specific retinoblastoma-related features</a></h4>

              
                Human cone photoreceptors differ from rods and serve as the retinoblastoma cell-of-origin, yet the developmental basis for their distinct behaviors is poorly understood. Here, we used deep full-length single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to distinguish post-mitotic cone and rod developmental states and identify cone-specific features related to retinoblastomagenesis. The analyses revealed nascent, immediately post-mitotic cone and rod precursors characterized by higher THRB or NRL regulon activities, immature and maturing cone and rod precursors with concurrent cone- and rod-related gene and regulon expression, and distinct early and late cone and rod maturation states distinguished by maturation-associated declines in RAX regulon activity. Cell-state-specific gene expression features inferred from full-length scRNA-seq were consistent with past 3' scRNA-seq analyses. Beyond the cell state characterizations, full-length scRNA-seq revealed that both L/M cone and rod precursors co-expressed <i>NRL</i> and <i>THRB</i> RNAs yet differentially expressed functionally antagonistic <i>NRL</i> isoforms and prematurely terminated <i>THRB</i> transcripts. Moreover, early L/M cone precursors sequentially expressed several lncRNAs along with <i>MYCN</i>, which composed the seventh most L/M-cone-specific regulon, and <i>SYK</i>, which was implicated in the cone precursors’ proliferative response to <i>RB1</i> loss. These findings reveal previously unresolved photoreceptor precursor states and suggest a role for early cone-precursor-intrinsic <i>SYK</i> expression in retinoblastoma initiation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97400">Cytoneme-mediated intercellular signaling in keratinocytes is essential for epidermal remodeling in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                The skin, the largest organ, functions as a primary defense mechanism. Epidermal stem cells supply undifferentiated keratinocytes that differentiate as they migrate toward the outermost skin layer. Although such a replenishment process is disrupted in various human skin diseases, its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. With high-resolution live imaging and in vivo manipulations, we revealed that Notch signaling between keratinocytes is mediated by signaling filopodia called cytonemes and is essential for proper keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation. Inhibiting keratinocyte cytonemes reduced Notch expression within undifferentiated keratinocytes, leading to abnormal differentiation and hyperproliferation, resembling human skin disease phenotypes. Overproduction of Interleukin (IL)–17 signal, associated with skin diseases like psoriasis, induces psoriatic phenotypes by reducing cytoneme extension in zebrafish. Our study suggests that intercellular signaling between keratinocytes through cytonemes is critical for epidermal maintenance, and its misregulation could be an origin of human skin diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105111">Simulation-based survey of TMEM16 family reveals that robust lipid scrambling requires an open groove</a></h4>

              
                Biological membranes are complex and dynamic structures with different populations of lipids in their inner and outer leaflets. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated TMEM16 family of membrane proteins plays an important role in collapsing this asymmetric lipid distribution by spontaneously and bidirectionally scrambling phospholipids between the two leaflets, which can initiate signaling and alter the physical properties of the membrane. While evidence shows that lipid scrambling can occur via an open hydrophilic pathway (groove) that spans the membrane, it remains unclear if all family members facilitate lipid movement in this manner. Here, we present a comprehensive computational study of lipid scrambling by all TMEM16 members with experimentally solved structures. We performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 27 structures from five different family members solved under activating and non-activating conditions, and we captured over 700 scrambling events in aggregate. This enabled us to directly compare scrambling rates, mechanisms, and protein–lipid interactions for fungal and mammalian TMEM16s, in both open (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound) and closed (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free) conformations with statistical rigor. We show that all TMEM16 structures thin the membrane and that the majority of scrambling (&gt;90%) occurs at the groove only when TM4 and TM6 have sufficiently separated. Surprisingly, we also observed 60 scrambling events that occurred outside the canonical groove, over 90% of which took place at the dimer–dimer interface in mammalian TMEM16s. This new site suggests an alternative mechanism for lipid scrambling in the absence of an open groove.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99547">Bridging verbal coordination and neural dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Our use of language, which is profoundly social in nature, essentially takes place in interactive contexts and is shaped by precise coordination dynamics that interlocutors must observe. Thus, language interaction is highly demanding on fast adjustment of speech production. Here, we developed a real-time coupled-oscillators virtual partner (VP) that allows – by changing the coupling strength parameters – to modulate the ability to synchronise speech with a virtual speaker. Then, we recorded the intracranial brain activity of 16 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy while they performed a verbal coordination task with the VP. More precisely, patients had to repeat short sentences synchronously with the VP. This synchronous speech task is efficient to highlight both the dorsal and ventral language pathways. Importantly, combining time-resolved verbal coordination and neural activity shows more spatially differentiated patterns and different types of neural sensitivity along the dorsal pathway. More precisely, high-frequency activity (HFa) in left secondary auditory regions is highly sensitive to verbal coordinative dynamics, while primary regions are not. Finally, while bilateral engagement was observed in the HFa of the inferior frontal gyrus BA44 – which seems to index online coordinative adjustments that are continuously required to compensate deviation from synchronisation – interpretation of right hemisphere involvement should be approached cautiously due to relatively sparse electrode coverage. These findings illustrate the possibility and value of using a fully dynamic, adaptive, and interactive language task to gather deeper understanding of the subtending neural dynamics involved in speech perception, production as well as their interaction.

">Inhibition from the oxytocin system tunes prefrontal circuit dynamics to promote social behavior</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a central role in the selection and expression of diverse social behaviors. A balance of excitation and inhibition is necessary for normal social functioning, but it remains unclear how inhibition sculpts pyramidal activity to promote social behaviors. To address this question, we developed a novel social decision-making task in which female mice chose between social and non-social options. To explore the role of a task-relevant inhibitory subpopulation in social decision-making, we targeted neurons in the medial PFC (mPFC) expressing oxytocin receptors (OXTR neurons). Combining optogenetic inhibition of OXTR neurons with population calcium imaging of pyramidal neural activity, we found that OXTR neurons normally promote interaction with a male compared to a non-social alternative. OXTR neurons also regulate pyramidal activity, which enables a specific ensemble to represent the male option during decision-making. Computational modeling reproduced these findings through a pyramidal competition mechanism, in which regulation by OXTR neurons allows a male-representing pyramidal ensemble to effectively compete against the remaining pyramidal population to drive male choice. These results provide a potential mechanism by which PFC excitation-inhibition balance contributes to normal social functioning.

">Altered brain structure in an ATRX-deficient mouse model of autism spectrum disorder</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the ATRX gene are a primary cause of ATR-X syndrome, which is characterized by intellectual disability, autism, and a range of brain structural abnormalities, including microcephaly. We previously showed that mice with conditional ATRX ablation in forebrain excitatory neurons display deficits in fear memory and autism-related behaviors, with some effects exhibiting sexual dimorphism. In this study, we used high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to systematically characterize brain structural changes associated with these behavioral abnormalities. Whole-brain analysis revealed male-specific microcephaly, while subregional analysis identified significant reductions in hippocampal structures and increased volume of the caudal cortex in mutant animals of both sexes. We also identified structural alterations in regions retaining ATRX expression, such as the thalamus, midbrain, cerebellum, and several fiber tracts. These findings suggest that ATRX loss disrupts the coordinated development of interconnected brain regions. Overall, our results implicate impaired cortico-thalamic-cerebellar connectivity as a potential neural substrate underlying the autistic-like behaviors observed in this mouse model, providing new insights into the neurobiological basis of ATR-X syndrome.

">Sex-specific exploration accounts for differences in valence learning in male and female mice</a></h4>

              
                Valence, the quality by which something is perceived as good or bad, appetitive or aversive, is a fundamental building block of emotional experience and a primary driver of adaptive behavior. Pavlovian fear and reward learning paradigms are widely used in preclinical research to probe mechanisms of valence learning but with limited consideration of sex as a biological variable despite known sex differences in neuropsychiatric disorders associated with impaired valence. Here, we compare appetitive-only, aversive-only and mixed-valence cue-outcome Pavlovian conditioning paradigms in male and female mice to dissociate effects of context, valence and salience in a sex-specific manner. Using a data-driven approach to identify behaviors indicative of valence learning in an unbiased manner, we compare task performance between paradigms in male and female mice. We show that while male and female mice acquire appetitive and aversive associations in both single- and mixed-valence paradigms, sex differences emerge in single-valence paradigms. Ultimately, we show that these apparent sex differences in valence learning are driven by non-specific baseline differences in exploratory behavior. Males explore more at baseline, altering their trajectory of cue-reward association acquisition whereas females explore less at baseline, increasing shock facilitated freezing in aversive-only contexts, masking cue discrimination. Overall, our findings illustrate how task design differentially impacts behavioral expression in male and female mice and demonstrate that mixed-valence paradigms afford a more accurate assessment of valence learning in both sexes.

">Cross-species variant-to-function analyses implicate MEIS1 in conferring sleep abnormalities and impaired cerebellar development</a></h4>

              
                Genome wide association study (GWAS) reports substantially outpace subsequent functional characterization. Pinpointing the causal effector gene(s) at GWAS loci remains challenging given the non-coding genomic residency of >98% of these signals. We previously implicated effector genes at GWAS loci for the complex and polygenic disorder of human insomnia using a high-resolution cell-specific, chromatin capture-based variant-to-gene mapping protocol, paired with sleep phenotyping in Drosophila. In this study, we leveraged a diurnal vertebrate model with higher genomic conservation, namely zebrafish, to screen our six highest confidence candidate genes and identify those whose loss-of-function impaired sleep characteristics related to human insomnia-like behaviors. Of these genes, we observed that CRISPR-mediated deletion of the zebrafish ortholog of MEIS1 produced nighttime specific sleep fragmentation and increased latency to sleep, pointing to a conserved role for MEIS1 in sleep maintenance. Comparing our human cell-based chromatin accessibility and contact maps with publicly available zebrafish spatial genomic data revealed highly conserved genomic architecture harboring the insomnia GWAS variant of interest. Notably, this genomic conservation was selective for the zebrafish ortholog which contributed to the sleep phenotype, meis1b, while the duplicated ohnolog meis1a proved dispensable. Motivated by this, we characterized the spatio-temporal expression of meis1b in zebrafish, showing it is comparable to human with respect to cerebellar granule progenitors. Ultimately, we found that loss of meis1b impairs cerebellar development. Together, our work provides a powerful model for screening human disorder risk genes for sleep fragmentation using a tractable vertebrate and supports a conserved cerebellar role for MEIS1 in sleep disturbance.

">Spatio-temporal dynamics of lateral Na+ diffusion in apical dendrites of mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Sodium ions (Na+) are major charge carriers mediating neuronal excitation and play a fundamental role in brain physiology. Glutamatergic synaptic activity is accompanied by large transient Na+ increases, but the spatio-temporal dynamics of Na+ signals and properties of Na+ diffusion within dendrites are largely unknown. To address these questions, we employed multi-photon Na+ imaging combined with whole-cell patch-clamp in dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in tissue slices from mice of both sexes. Fluorescence lifetime microscopy revealed a dendritic baseline Na+ concentration of ~10 mM. Using intensity-based line-scan imaging we found that local, glutamate-evoked Na+ signals spread rapidly within dendrites, with peak amplitudes decreasing and latencies increasing with increasing distance from the site of stimulation. Spread of Na+ along dendrites was independent of dendrite diameter, order or overall spine density in the ranges measured. Our experiments also show that dendritic Na+ readily invades spines and suggest that spine necks may represent a partial diffusion barrier. Experimental data were well reproduced by mathematical simulations assuming normal diffusion with a diffusion coefficient of DNa+= 600 m2/s. Modeling moreover revealed that lateral diffusion is key for the clearance of local Na+ increases at early time points, whereas when diffusional gradients are diminished, Na+/K+-ATPase becomes more relevant. Taken together, our study thus demonstrates that Na+ influx causes rapid lateral diffusion of Na+ within spiny dendrites. This results in an efficient redistribution and fast recovery from local Na+ transients which is mainly governed by concentration differences.

">Psilocybin triggers an activity-dependent rewiring of large-scale cortical networks</a></h4>

              
                Psilocybin holds promise as a treatment for mental illnesses. One dose of psilocybin induces structural remodeling of dendritic spines in the medial frontal cortex in mice. The dendritic spines would be innervated by presynaptic neurons, but the sources of these inputs have not been identified. Here, using monosynaptic rabies tracing, we map the brain-wide distribution of inputs to frontal cortical pyramidal neurons. We discover that psilocybin's effect on connectivity is network-specific: strengthening the routing of inputs from perceptual and medial regions (homolog of default mode network) to subcortical targets, while weakening inputs that are part of cortico-cortical recurrent loops. The pattern of synaptic reorganization depends on the drug-evoked spiking activity, because silencing a presynaptic region during psilocybin administration disrupts the rewiring. Collectively, the results reveal the impact of psilocybin on the connectivity of large-scale cortical networks and demonstrate neural activity modulation as an approach to sculpt the psychedelic-evoked neural plasticity.

">Primary cortical neurons form calcium-phosphate sheets with a bone-precursor-like ultrastructure</a></h4>

              
                Calcium-phosphate is a critical component in healthy bone and teeth formation, but its pathologic buildup in brain can occur in dyshomeostatic calcium disorders like Alzheimer's disease and Leigh syndrome. Extracellular calcium-phosphate in the nervous system is not well understood, but prior evidence suggests mitochondria as a potential source. Recently, large unidentified double-membrane-bound hyper-electron dense sheet aggregates of unknown content were reported in Huntington's disease model neurons using cryo-ET that were absent in wild-type control neurons. We use a combination of cryo-ET, cryo-CLEM, and LDSAED to demonstrate that these sheet aggregates are generated by wild-type cortical neurons isolated from embryonic day 18 rat embryos and have an octacalcium phosphate-like structure. They appear to be derived from mitochondria and are extruded at least in part by migrasomes. These findings reveal an important link for how mitochondria can serve as reservoirs for intracellular and extracellular calcium-phosphate highlighting them as potential therapeutic targets in neurological disorders characterized by pathological calcification, such as Alzheimer's disease.

                EEG resting-state measures, such as spectral power and microstates, have been associated with human long-term memory (LTM) performance. However, findings across studies are inconsistent and sometimes contradictory, likely due to a low reliability of the measures employed. These inconsistencies limit the interpretability and generalizability of results, emphasizing the need for a systematic evaluation of measure reliability. In this study, we addressed this gap by identifying the most reliable EEG resting-state measures and evaluating their predictive value for LTM performance in a second-language (L2) vocabulary learning paradigm. A group of children (N = 36) and adults (N = 90) participated in 2 studies on app-assisted learning of second language vocabulary. Participants completed a test on L2 vocabulary and a resting-state EEG recording (180 s eyes open) before and after learning a second language using a smartphone app. We used Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) to identify resting state EEG measures with satisfying test-retest reliability (ICC >= 0.75) and then assessed how these reliable measures are associated with L2 vocabulary learning representing LTM performance. Highest ICC values were found for oscillatory power in the alpha range and in the frequency of occurrences, duration and coverages of microstates. Calculations yielded ICC values of 0.84/0.86 (children/adults) for alpha power and 0.88/0.80 for microstate measures. Of these measures, only alpha power showed a positive correlation with LTM performance, but only in the adult population (r = 0.38, p < .01). No other measures were associated with LTM (all p > 0.05). Alpha power could thus serve as a stable and reliable marker of the neural mechanisms accounting for high LTM performance in the fully developed adult brain.

">Temporal Dynamics of Depression in Premanifest Huntington's Disease: A Network Dysconnection Approach</a></h4>

              
                Depression emerges years before motor signs in Huntington's disease gene expansion carriers (HDGECs), yet the neural mechanisms underlying this temporal relationship remain unclear. A growing body of evidence links depression in HDGECs to striatal and default mode network (DMN) regions, however, the longitudinal evolution of network dysfunction and its relationship to depressive symptoms has not been characterized. The study included 105 HDGECs (53 Females, Mage = 43, Mean CAG repeat length = 43) from the largest longitudinal study of premanifest HD, TrackOn-HD. Here, we applied spectral dynamic causal modelling to examine effective connectivity changes over 24 months, alongside voxel-based morphometry of grey matter atrophy and linear mixed models of depressive symptoms, including volumetry. We show that depression-related network dysconnection operates independently of regional grey matter atrophy, with HDGECs exhibiting widespread striatal volume loss but no differential atrophy patterns between depression groups. Critically, we demonstrate that larger posterior cingulate cortex volumes predicted increased depression severity specifically in HDGECs with depression history, across both Beck Depression Inventory-II (p = .041) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression Subscale (p = .002). Spectral dynamic causal models explained 88.6% of variance in depression groups and 90.4% in non-depression groups, demonstrating robust model performance. Longitudinal effective connectivity analyses revealed distinct dysconnection profiles: HDGECs with depression history showed widespread interhemispheric alterations including progressive inhibitory changes of striatal-DMN circuits and aberrant hippocampal regulatory control, while those without depression exhibited more focal dysconnection. These patterns occurred despite no group differences in grey matter atrophy trajectories across striatal or cortical regions over the 24-month period. Furthermore, we identify that clinically elevated depressive symptoms associate with differential connectivity patterns of the PCC and hippocampus depending on depression history, suggesting pathological mechanisms become progressively maladaptive. Our findings challenge that structural preservation confers functional resilience in neurodegeneration, instead suggesting pathological mechanisms and revealing that functional network reorganization in relatively preserved regions drives depression vulnerability in premanifest HD.

In the current study, we made a detailed quantitative comparison of the synaptic structure in the predominantly input layers of primate primary visual cortex (layer 4C) and in the predominant output layer (layer 3B) using focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM). We quantified the synaptic density in each layer, classified synaptic boutons according to their number of synapses and mitochondrial content, and quantified key morphometric parameters, including bouton volume, postsynaptic density (PSD) area and morphology, volume occupied by mitochondria, and postsynaptic targets. Our results revealed that for all the layers there is a higher proportion of single-synapse boutons without mitochondria. Multisynaptic boutons containing mitochondria (MSBm+) -which likely correspond to TC terminals -were significantly more abundant in the thalamocortical recipient layers 4C and 4C{beta}. These MSBm+ boutons were also larger, more likely to contact dendritic spines, and contained more mitochondria than other bouton categories. In contrast, layer 3B, displayed a lower prevalence of MSBm+ boutons, these boutons were smaller than those in layer 4C and made fewer synapses. These findings highlight laminar differences in bouton architecture and support the idea that TC synapses are structurally adapted to support high synaptic efficacy. Together, our data provide a detailed quantitative framework for understanding the synaptic organization of primate V1, with implications for sensory processing and cortical circuit function.

">Sardine: a modular framework for developing data acquisition and near real-time analysis applications</a></h4>

              
                We present Sardine, a software framework built with .NET to control experimental setups through the reliable execution of dynamic networks of independent modules, where each module can interface with a hardware device (e.g., camera, motor) or represent an operation over data (e.g., image filter, data stream). The Sardine framework delivers robust fault-tolerant hardware control and eliminates downstream delays by implementing dedicated data processing queues for each module. Any .NET class can be seamlessly adapted into a Sardine module, enabling effortless integration with existing codebases. Sardines modular architecture ensures flexibility to accommodate changes in experimental paradigms, simplifying the adaptation of essential features, such as swapping hardware components or redefining the logic of their interactions. The core of Sardine is a novel aggregation system that connects modules in two layers, designed to streamline complex workflows such as those in microscopy applications. The first layer (link layer) enables concurrent operations between modules, such as synchronizing a camera module with a stage controller or a laser module, while maintaining a dependency tree to ensure devices operate as intended. For example, in an imaging experiment, Sardine oversees individual module malfunctions, such as a camera failure or stage misalignment, gracefully handling errors and dynamically restoring functionality to impacted network segments to minimize disruption. The second layer (data layer) facilitates the transmission of information across modules by associating them with operations that produce, consume, or transform data. In an imaging context, this could involve processing raw image data from a camera module, passing it through a real-time analysis module for feature detection, and forwarding the results to a visualization module for immediate feedback. This two-layer architecture ensures seamless data flow and robust error handling, making Sardine ideal for dynamic and complex experimental setups. Sardine also integrates logging, a metadata collection system, and tools to create graphical applications.

">Cellf-Deception: Human microglia clone 3 (HMC3) cells exhibit more astrocyte-like than microglia-like gene expression</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in Alzheimer's research suggest that the brain's immune system plays a critical role in the development and progression of this devastating disease. Microglial cells are vital as immune cells in the brain's defense system. Human Microglia Clone 3 (HMC3) is a cell line developed as a promising experimental model to understand the role of microglial cells in human diseases, including Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. The frequency of HMC3 cell usage has increased in recent years, with the idea that this cell line could serve as a convenient model for human microglial cell functions. Here, we utilize gene-pair ratios from pseudo-bulk and scRNAseq expression data to create predictive models of cell-type origins. Our model reveals that the HMC3 cell line represents various cells, with the highest cell similarity score relating to astrocytes, not microglia. These findings suggest that the HMC3 cell line is not a reliable human microglia model and that extreme caution should be taken when interpreting the results of studies using the HMC3 cell line.

">Ethanol induces neuroimmune dysregulation and soluble TREM2 generation in a human iPSC neuron, astrocyte, microglia triculture model</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) affect substantial populations worldwide and increase the risk of developing cognitive impairments and alcohol-associated dementia. While chronic inflammatory signaling likely plays an important role in alcohol-associated neurological sequalae, the precise mechanisms underlying alcohol-associated neuropathology remain enigmatic. We hypothesize that alcohol leads to neuroimmune dysregulation among neurons, astrocytes, and microglia; and is perpetuated by innate immune signaling pathways involving cell-cell signaling. To investigate how alcohol dysregulates neuroimmune interactions in a human context, we constructed a triculture model comprising neurons, astrocytes, and microglia derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. After exposure to ethanol, we observed significant differential gene expression relating to innate immune pathways, inflammation, and microglial activation. Microglial activation was confirmed with morphological analysis and expression of CD68, a lysosomal-associated membrane protein and marker for phagocytic microglial activation. A striking finding in our study was the elevation of TREM2 expression and, specifically, TREM2 alternative splice variants that are predicted to give rise to soluble TREM2 . These results suggest that ethanol exposure in the brain may lead to increased microglial activation and production of soluble isoform named TREM2219 through alternate splicing. Deciphering the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning ethanol-related neuroimmune dysregulation within a human context promises to shed light on the etiology of AUD-related disorders, potentially contributing to the development of effective therapeutic strategies.

                MotilA is a Python-based image analysis pipeline for quantifying fine process motility of microglia from 3D time-lapse two-channel fluorescence microscopy data. Developed for high-resolution multiphoton in vivo imaging datasets, MotilA enables both single-file and batch processing across multiple experimental conditions. It performs image preprocessing, segmentation, and motility quantification over time, using a pixel-based change detection strategy that yields biologically interpretable metrics such as the turnover rate (TOR) of microglial fine processes. While originally designed for microglial imaging, the pipeline can be extended to other cell types and imaging applications that require analysis of dynamic morphological changes. MotilA is openly available, platform-independent, and includes extensive documentation, tutorials, and example data to facilitate adoption by the broader scientific community. It is released under the GPL-3.0 open-source license.

">Walking Selectively Modulates Behaviorally Relevant Auditory Responses According to Stride Cycle Phase</a></h4>

              
                Human perception operates in dynamic environments, requiring sensory processing to continuously adapt to ongoing motor activity. Here, we investigated how natural walking modulates auditory change detection by recording EEG while participants performed a transitional click train task during sitting and walking. Behaviorally, walking significantly elevated auditory change detection thresholds, reflecting reduced perceptual sensitivity. Electrophysiologically, three distinct auditory responses onset, change, and offset were evoked; both the onset and change responses were attenuated during walking, with the most pronounced effect observed for the cognitively demanding change response. Notably, this modulation was further amplified for the change response during active engagement compared to passive listening, implicating attentional resource allocation. Strikingly, both behavioral performance and change-related neural responses fluctuated rhythmically with the gait cycle, while onset and offset responses remained comparatively stable. Together, these findings reveal a stride-phase-dependent gating mechanism that selectively modulates perceptually relevant auditory signals, illustrating how the brain rhythmically reallocates sensory resources to optimize perception during locomotion.

">Sensitivity analysis of voltage-gated ion channel models.</a></h4>

              
                Modeling voltage-gated ion channel function is essential for understanding neuronal excitability. However, finding the right balance between model complexity and practicality is a significant challenge. In this study, I explored how sensitive Markov models of ion channels were to different parameters, beginning with a straightforward two-state system and progressing to more intricate three- and four-state models. Through tests using step voltage and sine wave protocols, I discovered clear sensitivity patterns during both the activation and deactivation phases. As expected, forward transitions were most influential during activation, while reverse transitions became more pronounced during deactivation. Notably, I found that transitions between closed states had minimal impact on the overall whole-cell current or the opening probability (Po). This underscores a significant limitation in relying on these measurements to constrain specific parameters. These results highlight the strengths and limitations of Markov models, showing that their effectiveness can be restricted by how sensitive parameters are to the protocols used in experiments. My findings set clear guidelines on the level of complexity feasible in Markov models of voltage-gated ion channels and offer insights that can help create more efficient and reliable models of neuronal excitability.

">Early life chronic stress-disrupted activity of the dorsal raphe nucleus selectively drives behavioral impairments</a></h4>

              
                Stress elicits variable systemic and neural changes in vertebrates, with outcomes ranging from adaptive to pathological. Several studies have implicated the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), a brainstem nucleus containing a heterogeneous population of serotonergic (5-HT) neurons, in the adaptive stress response and the pathological changes resulting from chronic stress. However, it is not known whether early life chronic stress affects the developing DRN activity, or whether the stress-induced changes affect 5-HT DRN neurons in a subregion- or phenotype-specific manner. To answer these questions, we used in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging of 5-HT DRN neurons in larval zebrafish exposed to chronic unpredictable stress during early life. We found that early life chronic stress prevented the normal habituation of the serotonergic system to a repeated acute stressor by altering the balance of excitatory/inhibitory responses within the DRN. Interestingly, these changes were most pronounced in a subset of stress-vulnerable serotonergic cells co-expressing GABAergic markers. Further, using chemogenetic ablation of 5-HT DRN neurons, we showed that stress-induced plasticity of the DRN contributed to changes in startle response habituation and in locomotive activity, but not in anxiety-like behaviors. Collectively, our results emphasize the role of stress-induced plasticity of DRN neurons in the selective regulation of maladaptive behavioral outcomes.

">Identifying Neuroimaging Biomarkers of Resilience and Vulnerability to Chronic Stress in An Animal Model: An Exploratory Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Stress is a main contributor to mood disorders, with individuals displaying great heterogeneity in response to stressful life events and adversity. Identifying biomarkers of vulnerability and resilience to stress would facilitate a prevention-based approach to mental illness that benefits individuals and reduces healthcare costs. The present study adopted a multivariate machine-learning approach to track neuroimaging biomarkers predictive of resilience and vulnerability following a chronic restraint stress (CRS) model. 96 male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent two sessions of MRI and behavioral tests, before and after CRS. Resilience and vulnerability to CRS were assessed with elevated plus maze and forced swimming tests. Hierarchical clustering was applied to construct brain networks. Partial correlation was used to compute network connectivity. Repeated nested cross validation with a support vector machine was employed to identify rs-fMRI biomarkers predictive of resilience and vulnerability following CRS. No strong group effect size of behavioral changes following CRS was observed within the same animals, suggesting the presence of resilient and vulnerable subgroups. Although the average model performance was modest (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.3 ~ 0.67), baseline functional connectivity across cerebellum, brainstem, striatum, prefrontal and salience-orbitofrontal regions, as well as functional alteration across hippocampus, striatum, prefrontal regions, auditory thalamus, cerebellum, inferior colliculi and brainstem were identified as stable features. The present study is the first to identify connectome-based neuroimaging biomarkers predictive of resilience and vulnerability using an animal model. The results may provide insights into neuroimaging biomarkers to aid diagnosis and prevention of mood disorders in humans.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Object categorization is essential to navigate everyday life. It is ultra-rapid, can be completed by purely feedforward mechanisms, and is therefore thought to rely on neural representations that are robust. But how do these representations adapt when category boundaries change (eg buying fruit versus buying apples)? We tested this by asking participants to categorize images at different levels of abstraction while measuring their scalp electrical activity (EEG) with high temporal resolution. Participants categorized images either at the superordinate (animal/non-animal) or at the basic (bird/non-bird) level. We compared classification accuracy and representational similarity of EEG signals between birds, non-bird animals, and vehicles to determine if neural representations are modified according to categorical requirements. We found that neural representations of birds and non-bird animals were indistinguishable in the superordinate task but were separable in the basic task from ~250 ms. On the other hand, the separability of neural representations between non-bird animals and vehicles did not differ by task. These findings suggest that top-down influences modulate categorical representations as needed, but only if discrimination is difficult. We conclude that neural representations of categories are adaptively altered to suit the current task requirements.</span>

Although such semantic interference (SI) activates the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG), its lesions do not systematically increase SI induced by written word distractors. Therefore, whether the LIFG plays a causal role in resolving SI remains an open question. We hypothesized that it does, but the influence of LIFG lesions on SI from a written distractor in a given trial is obscured by concurrent interference from participants’ own spoken responses in preceding trials. To test this hypothesis, we disentangled SI from these two competitor modalities in 25 post-stroke individuals who performed a picture-word interference task. Supporting the hypothesis, larger lesions to the pars triangularis of the LIFG increased SI from participants’ previous spoken responses whenever they were semantically related to the current response. With this effect accounted for, larger pars triangularis lesions also increased SI from semantically related written distractors. In contrast, lesions to all other examined neuroanatomical regions either decreased or did not influence SI. Thus, the left pars triangularis does play a causal role in resolving SI regardless of competitor modality.</span>

This study investigated neurophysiological mechanisms underlying modifiable dementia risk factors in cognitively unimpaired older adults. Seventy-nine cognitively unimpaired older adults underwent magnetic resonance imaging brain scans, with spectroscopy measurements taken from the sensorimotor cortex (SMC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), using a Hadamard Encoding and Reconstruction of MEGA-Edited Spectroscopy sequence, optimized for measuring GABA+. Modifiable dementia risk scores were calculated using the Assessment for Cognitive Health and Dementia Risk (CogDrisk). Hierarchical linear regression analyses revealed a significant negative relationship within the SMC, with lower GABA+ (β = −0.249, <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> = 0.009) associated with higher risk scores. In the PFC, lower tNAA and tCho concentrations significantly predicted higher risk scores (β = −0.168 and −0.170, respectively). These findings suggest that GABAergic system alterations may underlie the pathophysiology of modifiable dementia risk in healthy aging, while changes in tNAA and tCho may reflect early alterations in neuronal integrity. These region-specific neurochemical findings may help identify potential early biomarkers for dementia risk and suggest new therapeutic pathways for preventive interventions.</span>

<p>We identify directly adjacent to the pallial–subpallial boundary a <i>pax6a</i>-negative dorsal Vdd2 portion of the zebrafish larval subpallium that develops into the extended medial amygdala (EMeA). Zebrafish subpallial dopaminergic neurons that locate to Vdd2 belong to the EMeA and form a heterogeneous group differentially expressing <i>calbindin2a</i> and <i>cortistatin/sst7</i>.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The amygdala is a heterogeneous, multinuclear telencephalic structure critical for motivated and emotion-related behaviors in vertebrates. In ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) like the teleost zebrafish, a telencephalic outward-growing process called eversion makes defining amygdaloid territories particularly challenging. Teleosts are also peculiar in that they develop numerous dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the subpallium, while in tetrapods, such populations are less prominent or appear only transiently. To shed light on the organization of the amygdala in teleosts, we pursued an evolutionary developmental approach focusing on the topological origin of subpallial DA neurons. Specifically, we analyzed the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) in conjunction with expression patterns of <i>pax6a+b</i>, <i>isl1a</i>, <i>nkx2.1</i>, <i>lhx8a</i>, <i>otpa+b</i>, and <i>calb2a</i> as markers of different telencephalic subdivisions in brains of 5- and 30-day-old zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>, Teleostei). Our data show that the previously identified dorsalmost division of the ventral telencephalon (Vdd) needs to be subdivided into an anteroventral <i>pax6a/b</i>-positive portion (Vdd1) and a posterodorsal <i>pax6a/b</i>-negative portion (Vdd2). This <i>pax6a</i>-negative Vdd2 portion develops into the extended medial amygdala (EMeA), including the DA population adjacent to the pallial–subpallial border. Our results also show that the EMeA DA neurons form a heterogeneous group of amygdaloid neurons because they differentially express <i>calb2a</i> and <i>sst7</i>. Our work sheds light on the early evolution and development of the amygdala and provides a foundation for functional analysis of the newly defined DA subtypes of the extended amygdala in zebrafish.</p>

                <p>The degeneration of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons disrupts the neural control of natural behavior, such as walking, posture, and gait in Parkinson's disease. While some aspects of motor symptoms can be managed by DA replacement therapies, others respond poorly. Recent advancements in machine learning-based technologies offer opportunities to better understand the organizing principles of behavior modules at fine timescales and its dependence on dopaminergic modulation. In the present study, we applied the motion sequencing (MoSeq) platform to study the spontaneous locomotor activities of neurotoxin and genetic mouse models of parkinsonism as the midbrain DA neurons progressively degenerate. We also evaluated the treatment efficacy of levodopa (<scp>l</scp>-DOPA) on behavioral modules at fine timescales. We revealed robust changes in the kinematics and usage of the behavioral modules that encode spontaneous locomotor activity. Further analysis demonstrates that fast behavioral modules with higher velocities were more vulnerable to loss of DA and preferentially affected at early stages of Parkinsonism. Last, <scp>l</scp>-DOPA effectively improved the velocity, but not the usage and transition probability, of behavioral modules in parkinsonian animals. In conclusion, the hypokinetic phenotypes in parkinsonism involve the decreased velocities of behavioral modules and their disrupted temporal organization during movement. Moreover, we showed that the therapeutic effect of <scp>l</scp>-DOPA is mainly mediated by its effect on the velocities of behavior modules at fine timescales. This work documents robust changes in the velocity, usage, and temporal organization of behavioral modules and their responsiveness to dopaminergic treatment under the parkinsonian state.</p>

The nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens is an ongoing healthcare challenge, with consequences for the health of vulnerable individuals. Outbreaks in hospitals can require the closure of bays or entire wards, reducing hospital capacity and having a financial impact upon healthcare providers. Here we evaluate a novel strategy of pre-exposure prophylaxis as a means to reduce the nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We model the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) upon levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, and ultimately the probability of an infection. We then implement this model within simulations describing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections within a hospital context, simulating an intervention in which UDCA is given to patients on a ward for 10 days following the detection of a case of SARS-CoV-2 on that ward. Under default model parameters we infer a potential 17% reduction in the nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to patients, with increased importation of cases into the hospital increasing the effectiveness of the intervention, and of the order 1000–2000 patient treatment days per nosocomial patient infection prevented. Our study provides preliminary evidence of the value of pre-exposure prophylaxis with UDCA as a strategy to reduce nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Multiplexed tissue imaging (MTI) and other spatial profiling technologies commonly utilize serial tissue sectioning to comprehensively profile samples by imaging each section with unique biomarker panels or assays. The dependence on serial sections is attributed to technological limitations of MTI panel size or incompatible multi-assay protocols. Although image registration can align serially sectioned MTIs, integration at the single-cell level poses a challenge due to inherent biological heterogeneity. Existing computational methods overlook both cell population heterogeneity across modalities and spatial information, which are critical for effectively completing this task. To address this problem, we first use Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate the overlap between serial 5μm-thick sections. We then introduce COEXIST, a novel algorithm that synergistically combines shared molecular profiles with spatial information to seamlessly integrate serial sections at the single-cell level. We demonstrate COEXIST necessity and performance across several applications. These include combining MTI panels for improved spatial single-cell profiling, rectification of miscalled cell phenotypes using a single MTI panel, and the comparison of MTI platforms at single-cell resolution. COEXIST not only elevates MTI platform validation but also overcomes the constraints of MTI’s panel size and the limitation of full nuclei on a single slide, capturing more intact nuclei in consecutive sections and thus enabling deeper profiling of cell lineages and functional states.

                <p>by Shicong Lei, Yu’an Li, Zheng Ma, Hepeng Zhang, Min Tang</p>

The run-and-tumble behavior is a simple yet powerful mechanism that enables microorganisms to efficiently navigate and adapt to their environment. These organisms run and tumble alternately, with transition rates modulated by intracellular chemical concentration. We introduce a neural network-based model capable of identifying the governing equations underlying run-and-tumble dynamics. This model accommodates the nonlinear functions describing movement responses to intracellular biochemical reactions by integrating the general structure of ODEs that represent these reactions, without requiring explicit reconstruction of the reaction mechanisms. It is trained on datasets of measured responses to simple, controllable signals. The resulting model is capable of predicting movement responses in more realistic, complex, temporally varying environments. Moreover, the model can be used to deduce the underlying structure of hidden intracellular biochemical dynamics. We have successfully tested the validity of the identified equations based on various models of <i>Escherichia coli</i> chemotaxis, demonstrating efficacy even in the presence of noisy measurements. Moreover, we have identified the governing equation of the photo-response of <i>Euglena gracilis</i> cells using experimental data, which was previously unknown, and predicted the potential architecture of the intracellular photo-response pathways for these cells.

Sexual dimorphism is a crucial aspect of morphological and behavioral traits in animals. Unlike males, adult female locusts, i.e., <i>Locusta migratoria</i>, have highly extensible abdominal intersegmental membranes (ISMs) that facilitate deep oviposition into the soil, displaying an iconic sexual dimorphism, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we reveal that the extremely extensible ISMs in adult females are predominantly controlled by two female-specific proteins, LmAbd-1 and LmAbd-6, ensuring the oviposition behavior. Moreover, we discovered that LmJHBP, a juvenile hormone (JH) binding protein specifically expressed in adult female ISMs, mediates JH signaling to induce <i>LmAbd-1</i> and <i>LmAbd-6</i> expression. Importantly, the sex differentiation pathway (i.e., <i>Tra-2</i> and <i>Dsx</i>) determines the female-specific expression pattern of <i>LmJHBP,</i> and thus those of JH signaling and <i>LmAbd-1</i> and <i>LmAbd-6</i> expression. The finding of Tra/Dsx-JHBP axis significantly advanced understanding of sexual dimorphism and the adaptation of oviposition behavior in insects, the evolutionarily successful “segmentation” animals.

                <p>by Aswin Krishna, Gerry Tonkin-Hill, Thibaut Morel-Journel, Stephen Bentley, Paul Turner, François Blanquart, Sonja Lehtinen</p>

Competition plays a key role in shaping the structure and diversity of bacterial populations. In many clinically important bacterial species, strains compete at multiple scales: at the between-host scale for new hosts to colonise, and at the within-host scale during co-colonisation. Characterising these multiple facets of competition plays an important role in understanding bacterial ecology. This is particularly relevant for antibiotic resistance, where competition between antibiotic-susceptible and resistant strains determines resistance dynamics. In this work, we perform survival analyses on a large longitudinal dataset of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> carriage to quantify how within-host competition affects the rates of clearance and establishment of pneumococcal strains. We find that the presence of a within-host competitor is associated with a 33% increase in clearance and a 54% reduction in establishment. Priority effects and serotype differences partially predict the outcomes of this within-host competition. Further, we quantify the effects of antibiotic resistance on between- and within-host components of fitness. Antibiotic consumption is associated with increased clearance rate for both susceptible and resistant strains, albeit to a higher extent in susceptible strains. In the absence of antibiotics, we find some evidence that resistance is associated with increased susceptibility to within-host competition, suggesting a fitness cost of resistance. Overall, our work provides quantitative insights into pneumococcal competition across scales and the role of this competition in shaping pneumococcal epidemiology.
