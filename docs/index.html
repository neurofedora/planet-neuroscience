                <p><b>Brain Sciences, Vol. 12, Pages 1033: Age-Related Variance in Performance versus Ratings of Attention and Impulse Regulation in Children: Implications for the Assessment of ADHD</b></p>

	<p>Executive function task (EF) deficits are hypothesized to underlie difficulties with self-regulation. However, tasks assessing EF impairments have only been weakly correlated with rating scales that index self-regulation difficulties. A community sample of children and youth aged between 8 and 20 years old were assessed longitudinally. Growth curve analyses and correlations were conducted to better understand how these two types of measures relate to one another across development, as well as the impact of age-related variance. EF was assessed using the Stroop Task and Trail Making test and behavioral ratings of self-regulation were captured using the SWAN scale. EF task performance improved steeply until age 14&amp;amp;ndash;15, whereas the SWAN Scale showed small age-related decreases. EF task performance was moderately correlated with age among 8&amp;amp;ndash;13-year-olds and to a lesser extent among 14&amp;amp;ndash;20-year-olds. SWAN scores were not significantly related to age in either group. Correlations were similar in an ADHD &amp;amp;ldquo;at-risk&amp;amp;rdquo; subgroup. EF task performance and parent ratings of attention regulation have different developmental trajectories, which may partly explain why correlations are low to modest in these samples. In particular, age-related variance is an important methodological consideration with significant implications for the assessment of self-regulation in children and youth with ADHD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Questionable Research Practices, Low Statistical Power, and Other Obstacles to Replicability: Why Preclinical Neuroscience Research Would Benefit from Registered Reports</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Replicability, the degree to which a previous scientific finding can be repeated in a distinct set of data, has been considered an integral component of institutionalized scientific practice since its inception several hundred years ago. In the past decade, large-scale replication studies have demonstrated that replicability is far from favorable, across multiple scientific fields. Here, I evaluate this literature and describe contributing factors including the prevalence of questionable research practices (QRPs), misunderstanding of <I>p</I>-values, and low statistical power. I subsequently discuss how these issues manifest specifically in preclinical neuroscience research. I conclude that these problems are multifaceted and difficult to solve, relying on the actions of early and late career researchers, funding sources, academic publishers, and others. I assert that any viable solution to the problem of substandard replicability must include changing academic incentives, with adoption of registered reports being the most immediately impactful and pragmatic strategy. For animal research in particular, comprehensive reporting guidelines that document potential sources of sensitivity for experimental outcomes is an essential addition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Selective Ablation of Sod2 in Astrocytes Induces Sex-Specific Effects on Cognitive Function, D-Serine Availability, and Astrogliosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cognitive decline is a debilitating aspect of aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease are closely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species, neuroinflammation, and astrogliosis. This study investigated the effects of decreased mitochondrial antioxidant response specifically in astrocytes on cognitive performance and neuronal function in C57BL/6J mice using a tamoxifen-inducible astrocyte-specific knockout of manganese superoxide dismutase (aSOD2-KO), a mitochondrial matrix antioxidant that detoxifies superoxide generated during mitochondrial respiration. We reduced astrocyte SOD2 levels in male and female mice at 11&ndash;12 months of age and tested in an automated home cage (PhenoTyper) apparatus for diurnal patterns, spatial learning, and memory function at 15 months of age. aSOD2-KO impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial working memory and decreased cognitive flexibility in the reversal phase of the testing paradigm in males. Female aSOD2-KO showed no learning and memory deficits compared with age-matched controls despite significant reduction in hippocampal SOD2 expression. aSOD2-KO males further showed decreased hippocampal long-term potentiation, but paired-pulse facilitation was unaffected. Levels of <scp>d</scp>-serine, an NMDA receptor coagonist, were also reduced in aSOD2-KO mice, but female knockouts showed a compensatory increase in serine racemase expression. Furthermore, aSOD2-KO mice demonstrated increased density of astrocytes, indicative of astrogliosis, in the hippocampus compared with age-matched controls. These data demonstrate that reduction in mitochondrial antioxidant stress response in astrocytes recapitulates age-related deficits in cognitive function, <scp>d</scp>-serine availability, and astrogliosis. Therefore, improving astrocyte mitochondrial homeostasis may provide a therapeutic target for intervention for cognitive impairment in aging.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Diminished antioxidant response is associated with increased astrogliosis in aging and in Alzheimer's disease. Manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) is an antioxidant in the mitochondrial matrix that detoxifies superoxide and maintains mitochondrial homeostasis. We show that astrocytic ablation of SOD2 impairs hippocampal-dependent plasticity in spatial working memory, reduces long-term potentiation of hippocampal neurons and levels of the neuromodulator <scp>d</scp>-serine, and increases astrogliosis, consistent with defects in advanced aging and Alzheimer's disease. Our data provide strong evidence for sex-specific effects of astrocytic SOD2 functions in age-related cognitive dysfunction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase Regulates Dscam Expression through a Noncanonical Function of the Cytoplasmic Poly(A)-Binding Protein</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) plays a pivotal role in the development, degeneration, and regeneration of neurons. DLK can regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. The <I>Drosophila</I> DLK, Wallenda (Wnd), regulates the expression of Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) to control presynaptic arbor growth. This regulation is mediated by the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of <I>Dscam</I> mRNA, which suggests that RNA binding proteins (RBPs) mediate DLK function. We performed a genome-wide cell-based RNAi screen of RBPs and identified the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein, pAbp, as an RBP that mediates Wnd-induced increase in Dscam expression. Genetic analysis shows that Wnd requires <I>pAbp</I> for promoting presynaptic arbor growth and for enhancing Dscam expression. Our analysis revealed that <I>Dscam</I> mRNAs harbor short poly(A) tails. We identified a region in <I>Dscam</I> 3'UTR that specifically interacts with pAbp. Removing this region significantly reduced Wnd-induced increase in Dscam expression. These suggest that a noncanonical interaction of PABP with the 3'UTR of target transcripts is essential for DLK functions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The kinase DLK plays key roles in a multitude of neuronal responses, including axon development, neurodegeneration, and nerve injury. Previous studies show that DLK acts via mRNAs to regulate protein synthesis, but how DLK does so is poorly understood. This study demonstrates that DLK regulates the synthesis of Dscam through the poly(A)-binding protein PABP-C. Whereas PABP-C is known as a general translational activator, our study shows that DLK-mediated Dscam expression involves a noncanonical interaction between PABP-C and the <I>Dscam</I> mRNA, which leads to a selective regulation of <I>Dscam</I> translation by PABP-C. Thus, our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms that underlie the function of DLK and regulation of gene expression of PABP-C.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Meclizine and Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Agonists Attenuate Severe Pain and Ca2+ Activity of Primary Sensory Neurons in Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) affects ~68% of patients undergoing chemotherapy, causing debilitating neuropathic pain and reducing quality of life. Cisplatin is a commonly used platinum-based chemotherapeutic drug known to cause CIPN, possibly by causing oxidative stress damage to primary sensory neurons. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are widely hypothesized to be involved in pain processing and pain mitigation. Meclizine is an H1 histamine receptor antagonist known to have neuroprotective effects, including an anti-oxidative effect. Here, we used a mouse model of cisplatin-induced CIPN using male and female mice to test agonists of mGluR8 and Group II mGluR as well as meclizine as interventions to reduce cisplatin-induced pain. We performed behavioral pain tests, and we imaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of the large population of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons <I>in vivo</I>. For the latter, we used a genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, Pirt-GCaMP3, which enabled us to monitor different drug interventions at the level of the intact DRG neuronal ensemble. We found that CIPN increased spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in DRG neurons, increased number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and increased hyper-responses to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. We found that mechanical and thermal pain caused by CIPN was significantly attenuated by the mGluR8 agonist, (S)&ndash;3,4-DCPG, the Group II mGluR agonist, LY379268, and the H1 histamine receptor antagonist, meclizine. DRG neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity elevated by CIPN was attenuated by LY379268 and meclizine, but not by (S)&ndash;3,4-DCPG. Furthermore, meclizine and LY379268 attenuated cisplatin-induced weight loss. These results suggest that Group II mGluR agonist, mGluR8 agonist, and meclizine are promising candidates as new treatment options for CIPN, and studies of their mechanisms are warranted.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a painful condition that affects most chemotherapy patients and persists several months or longer after treatment ends. Research on CIPN mechanism is extensive but has produced only few clinically useful treatments. Using <I>in vivo</I> GCaMP Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in live animals over 1800 neurons/dorsal root ganglia (DRG) at once, we have characterized the effects of the chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin and three treatments that decrease CIPN pain. Cisplatin increases sensory neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and develops various sensitization. Metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, LY379268 or the H1 histamine receptor antagonist, meclizine decreases cisplatin's effects on neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and reduces pain hypersensitivity. Our results and experiments provide insights into cellular effects of cisplatin and drugs preventing CIPN pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Adenosine and Astrocytes Determine the Developmental Dynamics of Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity in the Somatosensory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>During development, critical periods of synaptic plasticity facilitate the reordering and refinement of neural connections, allowing the definitive synaptic circuits responsible for correct adult physiology to be established. The L4&ndash;L2/3 synapses in the somatosensory cortex (S1) exhibit a presynaptic form of spike timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) that probably fulfills a role in synaptic refinement. This t-LTD persists until the fourth postnatal week in mice, disappearing thereafter. When we investigated the mechanisms underlying this maturation-related loss of t-LTD in either sex mouse slices, we found that it could be completely recovered by antagonizing adenosine type 1 receptors. By contrast, an agonist of A<SUB>1</SUB>R impeded the induction of t-LTD at P13&ndash;27. Furthermore, we found that the adenosine that mediated the loss of t-LTD at the end of the fourth week of development is most probably supplied by astrocytes. At more mature stages (P38&ndash;60), we found that the protocol used to induce t-LTD provokes t-LTP. We characterized the mechanisms underlying the induction of this form of LTP, and we found it to be expressed presynaptically, as witnessed by paired-pulse and coefficient of variation analysis. In addition, this form of presynaptic t-LTP requires the activation of NMDARs and mGlu1Rs, and the entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the postsynaptic neuron through L-type voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Nitric oxide is also required for t-LTP as a messenger in the postsynaptic neuron as are the adenosine and glutamate that are released in association with astrocyte signaling. These results provide direct evidence of the mechanisms that close the window of plasticity associated with t-LTD and that drive the switch in synaptic transmission from t-LTD to t-LTP at L4&ndash;L2/3 synapses, in which astrocytes play a central role.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> During development, critical periods of plasticity facilitate the reordering and refining of neural connections, allowing correct adult physiology to be established.

We describe here these mechanisms and those involved in the switch from LTD to LTP observed as the brain matures. Defining these events responsible for closing (and opening) plasticity windows may be important for brain repair, sensorial recovery, the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders, and for educational policy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Influence of Rat Central Thalamic Neurons on Foraging Behavior in a Hazardous Environment</a></h4>

              
                <p>Foraging entails a complex balance between approach and avoidance alongside sensorimotor and homeostatic processes under the control of multiple cortical and subcortical areas. Recently, it has become clear that several thalamic nuclei located near the midline regulate motivated behaviors. However, one midline thalamic nucleus that projects to key nodes in the foraging network, the central medial thalamic nucleus (CMT), has received little attention so far. Therefore, the present study examined CMT contributions to foraging behavior using inactivation and unit recording techniques in male rats. Inactivation of CMT or the basolateral amygdala (BLA) with muscimol abolished the normally cautious behavior of rats in the foraging task. Moreover, CMT neurons showed large but heterogeneous activity changes during the foraging task, with many neurons decreasing or increasing their discharge rates, with a modest bias for the latter. A generalized linear model revealed that the nature (inhibitory vs excitatory) and relative magnitude of the activity modulations seen in CMT neurons differed markedly from those of principal BLA cells but were very similar to those of fast-spiking BLA interneurons. Together, these findings suggest that CMT is an important regulator of foraging behavior. In the Discussion, we consider how CMT is integrated into the network of structures that regulate foraging.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Foraging entails a complex balance between approach and avoidance alongside sensorimotor and homeostatic processes under the control of multiple cortical and subcortical areas. Although the central medial thalamic nucleus (CMT) is connected to many nodes in this network, its role in the regulation of foraging behavior has not been investigated so far. Here, we examined CMT contributions to foraging behavior using inactivation and unit recording techniques. We found that CMT inactivation abolishes the normally cautious foraging behavior of rats and that CMT neurons show large but heterogeneous changes in firing rates during the foraging task. Together, these results suggest that CMT is an important regulator of foraging behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pallidal Activity Related to Posture and Movement during Reaching in the Cat</a></h4>

              
                <p>We tested the hypothesis that the pallidum contributes to the control of both posture and movement. We recorded neuronal activity from the pallidum in a task in which male cats reached forward from a standing posture to depress a lever. In agreement with previous studies, we found that a majority of pallidal cells (91/116, 78%), including neurons in both the entopeduncular nucleus and the globus pallidus, showed significant modulation of their activity during reaching with the contralateral limb. Mostly different populations of cells were active during the transport (flexion) and lever press (extension) phase of the task. Most cells showed dynamic patterns of activity related to the movement. However, a modest proportion of modulated cells (18/91, 20%) showed properties consistent with a contribution to the control of anticipatory postural responses, whereas a further 10% showed activity consistent with a contribution to postural support during the movement. Although some cells that showed modified activity only during reaches with the contralateral forelimb, many cells (65/91, 71%) were also activated during reaches with the ipsilateral forelimb. This was particularly true for cells related to the lever press, many of which discharged similarly during reaches of either limb. This suggests a context-dependent control of movement and posture in which the same muscles are used for different functions during contralateral and ipsilateral reach. Comparison with the results from recordings made previously from the motor cortex and the pontomedullary reticular formation in the same task show more similarities with the former than the latter.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Pathologic changes in basal ganglia function frequently lead to problems with postural stability and gait initiation. Here, we show that some neurons in one of the output regions of the basal ganglia, the pallidum, show discharge activity compatible with a contribution to postural control. At the same time, we note that such cells are a minority in this region with most cells being related to movement rather than posture. We also show that many neurons are active during movements of both the contralateral and ipsilateral limbs, sometimes with identical discharge patterns. We suggest that this indicates a context-dependent regulation of movement and posture in the pallidum.</p>

                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized pathologically by the structural and functional impairments of synapses in the hippocampus, inducing the learning and memory deficiencies. Ras GTPase is closely related to the synaptic function and memory. This study was to investigate the effects of farnesyl transferase inhibitor lonafarnib on the synaptic structure and function in AD male mice and explore the potential mechanism. Our results showed 50 mg/kg lonafarnib (intraperitoneal) rescued the impaired spatial memory and improved the damaged synaptic transmission and plasticity of A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice. In addition, lonafarnib ameliorated the morphology of synaptic dendrites and spines in A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice. Furthermore, lonafarnib enhanced &alpha;7nAChR cell surface expression and phosphorylation of downstream Akt and CaMKII in A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice, which were inhibited by &alpha;7nAChR antagonist methyl lycaconitine (MLA), and increased the phosphorylation of CREB in a CaMKII- but not ERK-dependent way. Lonafarnib enhanced hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentration in A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice, which was sensitive to MLA and KN93 (an inhibitor of CaMKII), but not related to ERK and Akt pathways. H-Ras, but not Rhes, was related to the lonafarnib induced improvement of &alpha;7nAChR cell surface expression and BDNF content. Interestingly, lonafarnib induced improvement of synaptic transmission, plasticity and spatial cognition in A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice was abolished by BDNF deprivation with TrkB/Fc chimera protein. Our results indicate that lonafarnib can rescue the structural and functional impairments of synapses in the A&beta;<SUB>1-42</SUB> mice, which may be related to the improvement of BDNF content through the H-Ras-&alpha;7nAChR-dependent CaMKII-CREB pathway, leading to the improvement of spatial cognition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized pathologically by the structural and functional impairments of synapses in the hippocampus, inducing the learning and memory deficiencies. However, no effective drugs have not been developed for the treatment of AD synaptic. This study for the first time reported the beneficial effects of Ras inhibitor lonafarnib on the synaptic structure and function in AD mice, providing an alternative way for the treatment of "synaptic disease" in AD patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Auditory and Visual Phase-Locking Are Observed during Audio-Visual Benefit and Silent Lip-Reading for Speech Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Speech perception in noisy environments is enhanced by seeing facial movements of communication partners. However, the neural mechanisms by which audio and visual speech are combined are not fully understood. We explore MEG phase-locking to auditory and visual signals in MEG recordings from 14 human participants (6 females, 8 males) that reported words from single spoken sentences. We manipulated the acoustic clarity and visual speech signals such that critical speech information is present in auditory, visual, or both modalities. MEG coherence analysis revealed that both auditory and visual speech envelopes (auditory amplitude modulations and lip aperture changes) were phase-locked to 2-6 Hz brain responses in auditory and visual cortex, consistent with entrainment to syllable-rate components. Partial coherence analysis was used to separate neural responses to correlated audio-visual signals and showed non-zero phase-locking to auditory envelope in occipital cortex during audio-visual (AV) speech. Furthermore, phase-locking to auditory signals in visual cortex was enhanced for AV speech compared with audio-only speech that was matched for intelligibility. Conversely, auditory regions of the superior temporal gyrus did not show above-chance partial coherence with visual speech signals during AV conditions but did show partial coherence in visual-only conditions. Hence, visual speech enabled stronger phase-locking to auditory signals in visual areas, whereas phase-locking of visual speech in auditory regions only occurred during silent lip-reading. Differences in these cross-modal interactions between auditory and visual speech signals are interpreted in line with cross-modal predictive mechanisms during speech perception.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Verbal communication in noisy environments is challenging, especially for hearing-impaired individuals. Seeing facial movements of communication partners improves speech perception when auditory signals are degraded or absent. The neural mechanisms supporting lip-reading or audio-visual benefit are not fully understood. Using MEG recordings and partial coherence analysis, we show that speech information is used differently in brain regions that respond to auditory and visual speech. While visual areas use visual speech to improve phase-locking to auditory speech signals, auditory areas do not show phase-locking to visual speech unless auditory speech is absent and visual speech is used to substitute for missing auditory signals. These findings highlight brain processes that combine visual and auditory signals to support speech understanding.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sensorimotor Cortex GABA Moderates the Relationship between Physical Exertion and Assessments of Effort</a></h4>

              
                <p>Experiences of physical exertion guide our assessments of effort. While these assessments critically influence our decisions to engage in daily activities, little is known about how they are generated. We had female and male human participants exert grip force and assess how effortful these exertions felt; and used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure their brain GABA concentration. We found that variability in exertion (i.e., the coefficient of variation in their force exertion profile) was associated with increases in assessments of effort, making participants judge efforts as more costly. GABA levels in the sensorimotor cortex (SM1) moderated the influence of exertion variability on overassessments of effort. In individuals with higher sensorimotor GABA, exertion variability had a diminished influence on overassessments of effort. Essentially, sensorimotor GABA had a protective effect on the influence of exertion variability on inflations of effort assessment. Our findings provide a neurobiological account of how the brain's GABAergic system integrates features of physical exertion into judgments of effort, and how basic sensorimotor properties may influence higher-order judgments of effort.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Feelings of effort critically shape our decisions to partake in activities of daily living. It remains unclear how the brain translates physical activity into judgments about effort (i.e., "How effortful did that activity feel?"). Using modeling of behavior and neuroimaging, we show how the nervous system uses information about physical exertion to generate assessments of effort. We found that higher variability in exertion was associated with increases in assessments of effort, making participants judge efforts as more costly. GABA, the brain's main inhibitory neurotransmitter, moderated the influence of exertion variability on overassessments of effort. These findings illustrate how low-level features of motor performance and sensorimotor neurochemistry influence higher-order cognitive processes related to feelings of effort.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Transfer of Tactile Learning from Trained to Untrained Body Parts Supported by Cortical Coactivation in Primary Somatosensory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>A pioneering study by <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B59">Volkmann (1858)</cross-ref> revealed that training on a tactile discrimination task improved task performance, indicative of tactile learning, and that such tactile learning transferred from trained to untrained body parts. However, the neural mechanisms underlying tactile learning and transfer of tactile learning have remained unclear. We trained groups of human subjects (female and male) in daily sessions on a tactile discrimination task either by stimulating the palm of the right hand or the sole of the right foot. Task performance before training was similar between the palm and sole. Posttraining transfer of tactile learning was greater from the trained right sole to the untrained right palm than from the trained right palm to the untrained right sole. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivariate pattern classification analysis revealed that the somatotopic representation of the right palm in contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI) was coactivated during tactile stimulation of the right sole. More pronounced coactivation in the cortical representation of the right palm was associated with lower tactile performance for tactile stimulation of the right sole and more pronounced subsequent transfer of tactile learning from the trained right sole to the untrained right palm. In contrast, coactivation of the cortical sole representation during tactile stimulation of the palm was less pronounced and no association with tactile performance and subsequent transfer of tactile learning was found. These results indicate that tactile learning may transfer to untrained body parts that are coactivated to support tactile learning with the trained body part.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Perceptual skills such as the discrimination of tactile cues can improve by means of training, indicative of perceptual learning and sensory plasticity. However, it has remained unclear whether and if so, how such perceptual learning can occur if the training task is very difficult. Here, we show for tactile perceptual learning that the representation of the palm of the hand in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) is coactivated to support learning of a difficult tactile discrimination task with tactile stimulation of the sole of the foot. Such cortical coactivation of an untrained body part to support tactile learning with a trained body part might be critically involved in the subsequent transfer of tactile learning between the trained and untrained body parts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Altered Development of Amygdala-Connected Brain Regions in Males and Females with Autism</a></h4>

              
                <p>Altered amygdala development is implicated in the neurobiology of autism, but little is known about the coordinated development of the brain regions directly connected with the amygdala. Here we investigated the volumetric development of an amygdala-connected network, defined as the set of brain regions with monosynaptic connections with the amygdala, in autism from early to middle childhood. A total of 950 longitudinal structural MRI scans were acquired from 282 children (93 female) with autism and 128 children with typical development (61 female) at up to four time points (mean ages: 39, 52, 64, and 137 months, respectively). Volumes from 32 amygdala-connected brain regions were examined using mixed effects multivariate distance matrix regression. The Social Responsiveness Scale-2 was administered to assess degree of autistic traits and social impairments. The amygdala-connected network exhibited persistent diagnostic differences (<I>p</I> values &le; 0.03) that increased over time (<I>p</I> values &le; 0.02). These differences were most prominent in autistics with more impacted social functioning at baseline. This pattern was not observed across regions without monosynaptic amygdala connection. We observed qualitative sex differences. In males, the bilateral subgenual anterior cingulate cortices were most affected, while in females the left fusiform and superior temporal gyri were most affected. In conclusion, (1) autism is associated with widespread alterations to the development of brain regions connected with the amygdala, which were associated with autistic social behaviors; and (2) autistic males and females exhibited different patterns of alterations, adding to a growing body of evidence of sex differences in the neurobiology of autism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Global patterns of development across brain regions with monosynaptic connection to the amygdala differentiate autism from typical development, and are modulated by social functioning in early childhood. Alterations to brain regions within the amygdala-connected network differed in males and females with autism. Results also indicate larger volumetric differences in regions having monosynaptic connection with the amygdala than in regions without monosynaptic connection.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Three Dimensions of Association Link Migraine Symptoms and Functional Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Migraine is a heterogeneous disorder with variable symptoms and responsiveness to therapy. Because of previous analytic shortcomings, variance in migraine symptoms has been inconsistently related to brain function. In the current analysis, we used data from two sites (<I>n</I> = 143, male and female humans), and performed canonical correlation analysis, relating resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) with a broad range of migraine symptoms, ranging from headache characteristics to sleep abnormalities. This identified three dimensions of covariance between symptoms and RSFC. The first dimension related to headache intensity, headache frequency, pain catastrophizing, affect, sleep disturbances, and somatic abnormalities, and was associated with frontoparietal and dorsal attention network connectivity, both of which are major cognitive networks. Additionally, RSFC scores from this dimension, both the baseline value and the change from baseline to postintervention, were associated with responsiveness to mind-body therapy. The second dimension was related to an inverse association between pain and anxiety, and to default mode network connectivity. The final dimension was related to pain catastrophizing, and salience, sensorimotor, and default mode network connectivity. In addition to performing canonical correlation analysis, we evaluated the current clustering of migraine patients into episodic and chronic subtypes, and found no evidence to support this clustering. However, when using RSFC scores from the three significant dimensions, we identified a novel clustering of migraine patients into four biotypes with unique functional connectivity patterns. These findings provide new insight into individual variability in migraine, and could serve as the foundation for novel therapies that take advantage of migraine heterogeneity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Using a large multisite dataset of migraine patients, we identified three dimensions of multivariate association between symptoms and functional connectivity. This analysis revealed neural networks that relate to all measured symptoms, but also to specific symptom ensembles, such as patient propensity to catastrophize painful events. Using these three dimensions, we found four biotypes of migraine informed by clinical and neural variation together. Such findings pave the way for precision medicine therapy for migraine.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Neural networks for self-adjusting mutation rate estimation when the recombination rate is unknown</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Klara Elisabeth Burger, Peter Pfaffelhuber, Franz Baumdicker</p>

Estimating the mutation rate, or equivalently effective population size, is a common task in population genetics. If recombination is low or high, optimal linear estimation methods are known and well understood. For intermediate recombination rates, the calculation of optimal estimators is more challenging. As an alternative to model-based estimation, neural networks and other machine learning tools could help to develop good estimators in these involved scenarios. However, if no benchmark is available it is difficult to assess how well suited these tools are for different applications in population genetics.
Here we investigate feedforward neural networks for the estimation of the mutation rate based on the site frequency spectrum and compare their performance with model-based estimators. For this we use the model-based estimators introduced by Fu, Futschik et al., and Watterson that minimize the variance or mean square error for no and free recombination. We find that neural networks reproduce these estimators if provided with the appropriate features and training sets. Remarkably, using the model-based estimators to adjust the weights of the training data, only one hidden layer is necessary to obtain a single estimator that performs almost as well as model-based estimators for low and high recombination rates, and at the same time provides a superior estimation method for intermediate recombination rates. We apply the method to simulated data based on the human chromosome 2 recombination map, highlighting its robustness in a realistic setting where local recombination rates vary and/or are unknown.

                <p>by Sara Gonzales, Matthew B. Carson, Kristi Holmes</p>

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Policy for Data Management and Sharing (DMS Policy) recognizes the NIH’s role as a key steward of United States biomedical research and information and seeks to enhance that stewardship through systematic recommendations for the preservation and sharing of research data generated by funded projects. The policy is effective as of January 2023. The recommendations include a requirement for the submission of a Data Management and Sharing Plan (DMSP) with funding applications, and while no strict template was provided, the NIH has released supplemental draft guidance on elements to consider when developing a plan. This article provides 10 key recommendations for creating a DMSP that is both maximally compliant and effective.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Type 2 diabetes disrupts circadian orchestration of lipid metabolism and membrane fluidity in human pancreatic islets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Volodymyr Petrenko, Flore Sinturel, Ursula Loizides-Mangold, Jonathan Paz Montoya, Simona Chera, Howard Riezman, Charna Dibner</p>

Recent evidence suggests that circadian clocks ensure temporal orchestration of lipid homeostasis and play a role in pathophysiology of metabolic diseases in humans, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). Nevertheless, circadian regulation of lipid metabolism in human pancreatic islets has not been explored. Employing lipidomic analyses, we conducted temporal profiling in human pancreatic islets derived from 10 nondiabetic (ND) and 6 T2D donors. Among 329 detected lipid species across 8 major lipid classes, 5% exhibited circadian rhythmicity in ND human islets synchronized in vitro. Two-time point-based lipidomic analyses in T2D human islets revealed global and temporal alterations in phospho- and sphingolipids. Key enzymes regulating turnover of sphingolipids were rhythmically expressed in ND islets and exhibited altered levels in ND islets bearing disrupted clocks and in T2D islets. Strikingly, cellular membrane fluidity, measured by a Nile Red derivative NR12S, was reduced in plasma membrane of T2D diabetic human islets, in ND donors’ islets with disrupted circadian clockwork, or treated with sphingolipid pathway modulators. Moreover, inhibiting the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis led to strong reduction of insulin secretion triggered by glucose or KCl, whereas inhibiting earlier steps of de novo ceramide synthesis resulted in milder inhibitory effect on insulin secretion by ND islets. Our data suggest that circadian clocks operative in human pancreatic islets are required for temporal orchestration of lipid homeostasis, and that perturbation of temporal regulation of the islet lipid metabolism upon T2D leads to altered insulin secretion and membrane fluidity. These phenotypes were recapitulated in ND islets bearing disrupted clocks.

                Researchers use ChIP binding data to identify potential transcription factor binding sites. Similarly, they use gene expression data from sequencing or microarrays to quantify the effect of the transcription factor overexpression or knockdown on its targets. Therefore, the integration of the binding and expression data can be used to improve the understanding of a transcription factor function. Here, we implemented the binding and expression target analysis (BETA) in an R/Bioconductor package. This algorithm ranks the targets based on the distances of their assigned peaks from the transcription factor ChIP experiment and the signed statistics from gene expression profiling with transcription factor perturbation. We further extend BETA to integrate two sets of data from two transcription factors to predict their targets and their combined functions. In this article, we briefly describe the workings of the algorithm and provide a workflow with a real dataset for using it. The gene targets and the aggregate functions of transcription factors YY1 and YY2 in HeLa cells were identified. Using the same datasets, we identified the shared targets of the two transcription factors, which were found to be, on average, more cooperatively regulated.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Learning shifts the preferred theta phase of gamma oscillations in CA1</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal neuronal oscillations reflect different cognitive processes and can therefore be used to dissect the role of hippocampal subfields in learning and memory. In particular, it has been suggested that encoding and retrieval is associated with slow gamma (25–55 Hz) and fast gamma (60–100 Hz) oscillations, respectively, which appear in a nested manner at specific phases of the ongoing theta oscillations (4–12 Hz). However, the relationship between memory demand and the theta phase of gamma oscillations remains unclear. Here, we assessed the theta phase preference of gamma oscillations in the CA1 region, at the starting and junction zones of a T-maze, while rats were learning an appetitive task. We found that the theta phase preference of slow gamma showed a ~180° phase shift when animals switched from novice to skilled performance during task acquisition. This phase-shift was not present at the junction zone, where animals chose a right or left turn within the T-maze, suggesting that a recall/decision process had already taken place at the starting zone. Our findings indicate that slow gamma oscillations support both encoding and retrieval, depending on the theta phase at which they occur. These properties are particularly evident prior to cognitive engagement in an acquired spatial task.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Associations of Vascular Risk and Amyloid Burden with Subsequent Dementia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Midlife vascular risk factors (MVRFs) are associated with incident dementia, as are amyloid β (Aβ) deposition and neurodegeneration. Whether vascular and Alzheimer disease-associated factors contribute to dementia independently or interact synergistically to reduce cognition is poorly understood.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities–Positron Emission Tomography study were followed from 1987–1989 (45–64 years old) through 2016–2017 (74–94 years old), with repeat cognitive assessment and dementia adjudication. In 2011–2013, dementia-free participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (with white matter hyperintensity [WMH] and brain volume measurement) and florbetapir (Aβ) positron emission tomography. The relative contributions of vascular risk and injury (MVRFs, WMH volume), elevated Aβ standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), and neurodegeneration (smaller temporoparietal brain regions) to incident dementia were evaluated with adjusted Cox models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In 298 individuals, 36 developed dementia (median follow-up = 4.9 years). Midlife hypertension and Aβ each independently predicted dementia risk (hypertension: hazard ratio [HR] = 2.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16–5.67; Aβ SUVR [per standard deviation (SD)]: HR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.72–3.84), but did not interact significantly, whereas late life diabetes (HR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.18–5.28) and Aβ independently predicted dementia risk. WMHs (per SD: HR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.03–2.20) and Aβ SUVR (HR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.83–3.47) independently contributed to incident dementia, but WMHs lost significance when MVRFs were included. Smaller temporoparietal brain regions were associated with incident dementia, independent of Aβ and MVRFs (HR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.18–4.01).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Midlife hypertension and late life Aβ are independently associated with dementia risk, without evidence for synergy on a multiplicative scale. Given the independent contributions of vascular and amyloid mechanisms, multiple pathways should be considered when evaluating interventions to reduce the burden of dementia.

                <p>We determined the incidence of post-traumatic epilepsy after severe traumatic brain injury. Of 392 patients surviving to discharge, cumulative incidence of post-traumatic epilepsy was 25% at 5 years and 32% at 15 years, an increase compared with historical reports. Among patients with one late seizure (&gt;7 days post-trauma), the risk of seizure recurrence was 62% after 1 year and 82% at 10 years. Competing hazards regression identified age, decompressive hemicraniectomy, and intracranial infection as independent predictors of post-traumatic epilepsy. Patients with severe traumatic brain injury and a single late post-traumatic seizure will likely require long-term antiseizure medicines. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Network Effects of Brain Lesions Causing Central Post‐Stroke Pain</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To test whether lesions causing central post-stroke pain (CPSP) are associated with a specific connectivity profile, whether these connections are associated with metabolic changes, and whether this network aligns with neuromodulation targets for pain.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two independent lesion datasets were utilized: 1) subcortical lesions from published case reports and, 2) thalamic lesions with metabolic imaging using 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose PET-CT. Functional connectivity between each lesion location and the rest of the brain was assessed using a normative connectome (n = 1000) and connections specific to CPSP were identified. Metabolic changes specific to CPSP were also identified and related to differences in lesion connectivity. Therapeutic relevance of the network was explored by testing for alignment with existing brain stimulation data and by prospectively targeting the network with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in 7 patients with CPSP.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Lesion locations causing CPSP showed a specific pattern of brain connectivity that was consistent across two independent lesion datasets (spatial r = 0.82, p &lt; 0.0001). Connectivity differences were correlated with post-lesion metabolism (r = -0.48, p &lt; 0.001). The topography of this lesion-based pain network aligned with variability in pain improvement across 12 prior neuromodulation targets and across 32 patients who received rTMS to primary motor cortex (p &lt; 0.05). Prospectively targeting this network with rTMS improved CPSP in 6/7 patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Lesions causing pain are connected to a specific brain network that shows metabolic abnormalities and promise as a neuromodulation target.</p>

To support this commitment, we aimed to estimate the number and proportion of Amsterdam HIV infections that originated within the city, from Amsterdam residents. We also aimed to estimate the proportion of recent HIV infections during the 5-year period 2014-2018 in Amsterdam that remained undiagnosed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct impact of IgG subclass on autoantibody pathogenicity in different IgG4-mediated diseases</a></h4>

              
                IgG4 is the least potent human IgG subclass for the FcγR-mediated antibody effector function. Paradoxically, IgG4 is also the dominant IgG subclass of pathogenic autoantibodies in IgG4-mediated diseases. Here we show that the IgG subclass and Fc-FcγR interaction have a distinct impact on the pathogenic function of autoantibodies in different IgG4-mediated diseases in mouse models. While IgG4 and its weak Fc-FcγR interaction have an ameliorative role in the pathogenicity of anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies isolated from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) patients, they have an unexpected exacerbating effect on anti-Dsg1 autoantibody pathogenicity in pemphigus foliaceus (PF) models. Strikingly, a non-pathogenic anti-Dsg1 antibody variant optimized for FcγR-mediated effector function can attenuate the skin lesions induced by pathogenic anti-Dsg1 antibodies by promoting the clearance of dead keratinocytes. These studies suggest that IgG effector function contributes to the clearance of autoantibody-Ag complexes, which is harmful in TTP, but beneficial in PF and may provide new therapeutic opportunity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Robust and Efficient Assessment of Potency (REAP) as a quantitative tool for dose-response curve estimation</a></h4>

              
                The median-effect equation has been widely used to describe the dose-response relationship and identify compounds that activate or inhibit specific disease targets in contemporary drug discovery. However, the experimental data often contain extreme responses, which may significantly impair the estimation accuracy and impede valid quantitative assessment in the standard estimation procedure. To improve the quantitative estimation of the dose-response relationship, we introduce a novel approach based on robust beta regression. Substantive simulation studies under various scenarios demonstrate solid evidence that the proposed approach consistently provides robust estimation for the median-effect equation, particularly when there are extreme outcome observations. Moreover, simulation studies illustrate that the proposed approach also provides a narrower confidence interval, suggesting a higher power in statistical testing. Finally, to efficiently and conveniently perform common lab data analyses, we develop a freely accessible web-based analytic tool to facilitate the quantitative implementation of the proposed approach for the scientific community.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hematopoietic plasticity mapped in Drosophila and other insects</a></h4>

              
                Hemocytes, similar to vertebrate blood cells, play important roles in insect development and immunity, but it is not well understood how they perform their tasks. New technology, in particular single-cell transcriptomic analysis in combination with <i>Drosophila</i> genetics, may now change this picture. This review aims to make sense of recently published data, focusing on <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and comparing to data from other drosophilids, the malaria mosquito, <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, and the silkworm, <i>Bombyx mori</i>. Basically, the new data support the presence of a few major classes of hemocytes: (1) a highly heterogenous and plastic class of professional phagocytes with many functions, called plasmatocytes in <i>Drosophila</i> and granular cells in other insects. (2) A conserved class of cells that control melanin deposition around parasites and wounds, called crystal cells in <i>D. melanogaster</i>, and oenocytoids in other insects. (3) A new class of cells, the primocytes, so far only identified in <i>D. melanogaster</i>. They are related to cells of the so-called posterior signaling center of the larval hematopoietic organ, which controls the hematopoiesis of other hemocytes. (4) Different kinds of specialized cells, like the lamellocytes in <i>D. melanogaster</i>, for the encapsulation of parasites. These cells undergo rapid evolution, and the homology relationships between such cells in different insects are uncertain. Lists of genes expressed in the different hemocyte classes now provide a solid ground for further investigation of function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural motifs for subtype-specific pH-sensitive gating of vertebrate otopetrin proton channels</a></h4>

              
                Otopetrin (OTOP) channels are proton-selective ion channels conserved among vertebrates and invertebrates, with no structural similarity to other ion channels. There are three vertebrate OTOP channels (OTOP1, OTOP2, and OTOP3), of which one (OTOP1) functions as a sour taste receptor. Whether extracellular protons gate OTOP channels, in addition to permeating them, was not known. Here, we compare the functional properties of the three murine OTOP channels using patch-clamp recording and cytosolic pH microfluorimetry. We find that OTOP1 and OTOP3 are both steeply activated by extracellular protons, with thresholds of pH<sub>o</sub> &lt;6.0 and 5.5, respectively, and kinetics that are pH-dependent. In contrast, OTOP2 channels are broadly active over a large pH range (pH 5 pH 10) and carry outward currents in response to extracellular alkalinization (&gt;pH 9.0). Strikingly, we could change the pH-sensitive gating of OTOP2 and OTOP3 channels by swapping extracellular linkers that connect transmembrane domains. Swaps of extracellular linkers in the N domain, comprising transmembrane domains 1–6, tended to change the relative conductance at alkaline pH of chimeric channels, while swaps within the C domain, containing transmembrane domains 7–12, tended to change the rates of OTOP3 current activation. We conclude that members of the OTOP channel family are proton-gated (acid-sensitive) proton channels and that the gating apparatus is distributed across multiple extracellular regions within both the N and C domains of the channels. In addition to the taste system, OTOP channels are expressed in the vertebrate vestibular and digestive systems. The distinct gating properties we describe may allow them to subserve varying cell-type specific functions in these and other biological systems.

                Biogeographical studies have traditionally focused on readily visible organisms, but recent technological advances are enabling analyses of the large-scale distribution of microscopic organisms, whose biogeographical patterns have long been debated. Here we assessed the global structure of plankton geography and its relation to the biological, chemical, and physical context of the ocean (the ‘seascape’) by analyzing metagenomes of plankton communities sampled across oceans during the <i>Tara</i> Oceans expedition, in light of environmental data and ocean current transport. Using a consistent approach across organismal sizes that provides unprecedented resolution to measure changes in genomic composition between communities, we report a pan-ocean, size-dependent plankton biogeography overlying regional heterogeneity. We found robust evidence for a basin-scale impact of transport by ocean currents on plankton biogeography, and on a characteristic timescale of community dynamics going beyond simple seasonality or life history transitions of plankton.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multiple UBX proteins reduce the ubiquitin threshold of the mammalian p97-UFD1-NPL4 unfoldase</a></h4>

              
                The p97 / Cdc48 ATPase and its ubiquitin receptors Ufd1-Npl4 are essential to unfold ubiquitylated proteins in many areas of eukaryotic cell biology. In yeast, Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 is controlled by a quality control mechanism, whereby substrates must be conjugated to at least five ubiquitins. Here we show that mammalian p97-UFD1-NPL4 is governed by a complex interplay between additional p97 cofactors and the number of conjugated ubiquitins. Using reconstituted assays for the disassembly of ubiquitylated CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) helicase by human p97-UFD1-NPL4, we show that the unfoldase has a high ubiquitin threshold for substrate unfolding, which can be reduced by the UBX proteins UBXN7, FAF1 or FAF2. Our data indicate that the UBX proteins function by binding to p97-UFD1-NPL4 and stabilising productive interactions between UFD1-NPL4 and K48-linked chains of at least five ubiquitins. Stimulation by UBXN7 is dependent upon known ubiquitin binding motifs, whereas FAF1 and FAF2 use a previously uncharacterised coiled-coil domain to reduce the ubiquitin threshold of p97-UFD1-NPL4. We show that deleting the <i>Ubnx7</i> and <i>Faf1</i> genes impairs CMG disassembly during S-phase and mitosis and sensitises cells to reduced ubiquitin ligase activity. These findings indicate that multiple UBX proteins are important for the efficient unfolding of ubiquitylated proteins by p97-UFD1-NPL4 in mammalian cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Full spectrum flow cytometry reveals mesenchymal heterogeneity in first trimester placentae and phenotypic convergence in culture, providing insight into the origins of placental mesenchymal stromal cells</a></h4>

              
                Single-cell technologies (RNA-sequencing, flow cytometry) are critical tools to reveal how cell heterogeneity impacts developmental pathways. The placenta is a fetal exchange organ, containing a heterogeneous mix of mesenchymal cells (fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, perivascular, and progenitor cells) . Placental mesenchymal stromal cells (pMSC) are also routinely isolated, for therapeutic and research purposes. However, our understanding of the diverse phenotypes of placental mesenchymal lineages, and their relationships remain unclear. We designed a 23-colour flow cytometry panel to assess mesenchymal heterogeneity in first-trimester human placentae. . Four distinct mesenchymal subsets were identified; CD73<sup>+</sup>CD90<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells, CD146<sup>+</sup>CD271<sup>+</sup> perivascular cells, podoplanin<sup>+</sup>CD36<sup>+</sup> stromal cells, and CD26<sup>+</sup>CD90<sup>+</sup> myofibroblasts. CD73<sup>+</sup>CD90<sup>+</sup> and podoplanin+CD36+ cells expressed markers consistent with cultured pMSCs, and were explored further. Despite their distinct ex-vivo phenotype, in culture CD73<sup>+</sup>CD90<sup>+</sup> cells and podoplanin<sup>+</sup>CD36<sup>+</sup> cells underwent phenotypic convergence, losing CD271 or CD36 expression respectively, and homogenously exhibiting a basic MSC phenotype (CD73<sup>+</sup>CD90<sup>+</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup>CD144<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup>). However, some markers (CD26, CD146) were not impacted, or differentially impacted by culture in different populations. Comparisons of cultured phenotypes to pMSCs further suggested cultured pMSCs originate from podoplanin<sup>+</sup>CD36<sup>+ </sup>cells. This highlights the importance of detailed cell phenotyping to optimise therapeutic capacity, and ensure use of relevant cells in functional assays.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Maternal H3K36 and H3K27 HMTs protect germline development via regulation of the transcription factor LIN-15B</a></h4>

              
                Maternally synthesized products play critical roles in the development of offspring. A premier example is the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> H3K36 methyltransferase MES-4, which is essential for germline survival and development in offspring. How maternal MES-4 protects the germline is not well understood, but its role in H3K36 methylation hinted that it may regulate gene expression in primordial germ cells (PGCs). We tested this hypothesis by profiling transcripts from nascent germlines (PGCs and their descendants) dissected from wild-type and <i>mes-4</i> mutant (lacking maternal and zygotic MES-4) larvae. <i>mes-4</i> nascent germlines displayed downregulation of some germline genes, upregulation of some somatic genes, and dramatic upregulation of hundreds of genes on the X chromosome. We demonstrated that upregulation of one or more genes on the X is the cause of germline death by generating and analyzing <i>mes-4</i> mutants that inherited different endowments of X chromosome(s). Intriguingly, removal of the THAP transcription factor LIN-15B from <i>mes-4</i> mutants reduced X misexpression and prevented germline death. <i>lin-15B</i> is X-linked and misexpressed in <i>mes-4</i> PGCs, identifying it as a critical target for MES-4 repression. The above findings extend to the H3K27 methyltransferase MES-2/3/6, the <i>C. elegans</i> version of polycomb repressive complex 2. We propose that maternal MES-4 and PRC2 cooperate to protect germline survival by preventing synthesis of germline-toxic products encoded by genes on the X chromosome, including the key transcription factor LIN-15B.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tension-driven multi-scale self-organisation in human iPSC-derived muscle fibers</a></h4>

              
                Human muscle is a hierarchically organised tissue with its contractile cells called myofibers packed into large myofiber bundles. Each myofiber contains periodic myofibrils built by hundreds of contractile sarcomeres that generate large mechanical forces. To better understand the mechanisms that coordinate human muscle morphogenesis from tissue to molecular scales, we adopted a simple <i>in vitro</i> system using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human myogenic precursors. When grown on an unrestricted two-dimensional substrate, developing myofibers spontaneously align and self-organise into higher-order myofiber bundles, which grow and consolidate to stable sizes. Following a transcriptional boost of sarcomeric components, myofibrils assemble into chains of periodic sarcomeres that emerge across the entire myofiber. More efficient myofiber bundling accelerates the speed of sarcomerogenesis suggesting that tension generated by bundling promotes sarcomerogenesis. We tested this hypothesis by directly probing tension and found that tension build-up precedes sarcomere assembly and increases within each assembling myofibril. Furthermore, we found that myofiber ends stably attach to other myofibers using integrin-based attachments and thus myofiber bundling coincides with stable myofiber bundle attachment <i>in vitro</i>. A failure in stable myofiber attachment results in a collapse of the myofibrils. Overall, our results strongly suggest that mechanical tension across sarcomeric components as well as between differentiating myofibers is key to coordinate the multi-scale self-organisation of muscle morphogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Global Motor Inhibition Precedes Stuttering Events</a></h4>

              
                Research points to neurofunctional differences underlying fluent speech production in stutterers and non-stutterers. There has been considerably less work focusing on the processes that underlie stuttered speech, primarily due to the difficulty of reliably eliciting stuttering in the unnatural contexts associated with neuroimaging experiments. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to test the hypothesis that stuttering events result from global motor inhibition -a "freeze" response typically characterized by increased beta power in nodes of the action-stopping network. We leveraged a novel clinical interview to develop participant-specific stimuli in order to elicit a comparable amount of stuttered and fluent trials. Twenty-nine adult stutterers participated. The paradigm included a cue prior to a go signal, which allowed us to isolate processes associated with stuttered and fluent trials prior to speech initiation. During this pre-speech time window, stuttered trials were associated with greater beta power in the right pre-supplementary motor area, a key node in the action-stopping network, compared to fluent trials. Beta power in the right pre-supplementary area was related to a clinical measure of stuttering severity. We also found that anticipated words identified independently by participants were stuttered more often than those generated by the researchers, which were based on the participants' reported anticipated sounds. This suggests that global motor inhibition results from stuttering anticipation. This study represents the largest comparison of stuttered and fluent speech to date. The findings provide a foundation for clinical trials that test the efficacy of neuromodulation on stuttering. Moreover, our study demonstrates the feasibility of using our approach for eliciting stuttering during MEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments so that the neurobiological bases of stuttered speech can be further elucidated.

                The perception and identification of faces and facial emotional expressions are critical for social communication in the daily life of all primates. Here, we investigated the neural network activated by dynamic facial expressions in awake New World common marmosets with ultra-high field fMRI at 9.4T. Our results show that dynamic facial expressions activate several areas along the occipitotemporal axis (V2/V3, V4/TEO, FST, caudal TE, rostral TE, TPO), frontal cortex (areas 45/47, 13, 8a and orbital cortex), amygdala, motion-sensitive areas, premotor area, and in the posterior lobe of the cerebellum. Negative faces increased the monkeys' respiration rates and elicited stronger responses along the occipitotemporal cortical axis, in the amygdala and in the hypothalamus. This cortico-subcortico-cerebellar network may play an important role in the perception of behaviorally relevant facial expressions that are vital for social communication in marmosets.

                Voltage-gated sodium channels located in axon initial segments (AIS) trigger action potentials (AP) and play pivotal roles in the excitability of cortical pyramidal neurons. The differential electrophysiological properties and distributions of NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 channels lead to distinct contributions to AP initiation and backpropagation. While NaV1.6 at the distal AIS promotes AP initiation and forward propagation, NaV1.2 at the proximal AIS promotes backpropagation of APs to the soma. Here, we show the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) pathway modulates persistent sodium current (INaP) generation at the AIS to increase neuronal gain and the speed of backpropagation. Since SUMO does not affect NaV1.6, these effects were attributed to SUMOylation of NaV1.2. Moreover, SUMO effects were absent in a mouse engineered to express NaV1.2-Lys38Gln channels that lack the site for SUMO linkage. Thus, SUMOylation of NaV1.2 exclusively controls INaP generation and AP backpropagation, thereby playing a prominent role in synaptic integration and plasticity.

                Inhibitory modulation of glutamatergic information processing is a prerequisite for proper network function. Among the many groups of interneurons, somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SOM-INs) seem to play an important role in the maintenance of physiological brain activity. We have previously shown that bath application of somatostatin (SOM) causes a reduction in pyramidal cell (PC) excitability. However, the mechanisms of action of the peptide on cortical synaptic circuits are still unclear. To gain further insight into the function of SOM-INs, we analyzed the effect of SOM on synaptic transmission in PCs, in SOM-INs and in layer 1 interneurons (L1-INs) of the anterior cingulate cortex. We found that SOM produced pronounced postsynaptic effects in PCs while having little or no postsynaptic effects on either IN type. Accordingly, it is proposed here, that SOM - by acting differentially on SOM-INs and L1-INs - increases spontaneous GABAergic transmission, while at the same time, decreasing spontaneous glutamatergic transmission. In addition, we show that SOM specifically modulates GABAB receptor (GABABR)-mediated synaptic transmission but has little effect on GABAA receptor-mediated (GABAAR) transmission.

                A large body of work has identified characteristic neural signatures of value-based decision-making. A core circuit has been shown to track the values of options under consideration, and the dynamics of neural activity associated with this circuit have been found to closely resemble the ramping evidence accumulation process believed to underpin goal-directed choice, most notably in the centroparietal positivity (CPP). However, recent neuroimaging studies suggest that value-based choices trigger multiple value-related neural signatures, some of which are unrelated to decision-making per se but instead reflect reflexive affective reactions to one's options. Here, we use the temporal resolution of EEG to test whether choice-independent value signals could be dissociated from well-known temporal signatures of the choice process. We show that EEG activity during value-based choice can be decomposed into distinct spatiotemporal clusters, one stimulus-locked (associated with the affective salience of a choice set) and one response-locked (associated with the difficulty of selecting the best option). We show that neither of these clusters meet the criteria for an evidence accumulation signal. Instead, and to our surprise, we found that stimulus-locked activity can mimic an evidence accumulation process when aligned to the response (as with the CPP). In this dataset and a second one that uses a more traditional perceptual decision-making task, we show that the CPP's apparent pattern of evidence accumulation disappears when stimulus-locked and response-locked signals are accounted for jointly. Collectively, our findings show that neural signatures of value can reflect choice-independent processes that when analyzed using standard approaches, can look deceptively like evidence accumulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">How subjective idea valuation energizes and guides creative idea generation</a></h4>

              
                What drives us to search for creative ideas and why does it feel good to find one? While previous studies demonstrated the positive influence of intrinsic motivation on creative abilities, how reward and subjective values play a role in creative mechanisms remains unknown. The existing framework for creativity investigation distinguishes generation and evaluation phases, and mostly aligns evaluation to cognitive control processes, without clarifying the mechanisms involved. This study proposes a new framework for creativity by 1) characterizing the role of individual preferences (how people value ideas) in creative ideation and 2) providing a computational model that implements three types of operations required for creative idea generation: knowledge exploration, candidate ideas valuation (attributing subjective values), and response selection. The findings first provide behavioral evidence demonstrating the involvement of valuation processes during idea generation: preferred ideas are provided faster. Second, valuation depends on the adequacy and originality of ideas and determines which ideas are selected. Finally, the proposed computational model correctly predicts the speed and quality of human creative responses, as well as interindividual differences in creative abilities. Altogether, this unprecedented model introduces the mechanistic role of valuation in creativity. It paves the way for a neurocomputational account of creativity mechanisms.

                The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is the hub for body sensation of both innocuous and noxious signals, yet its role in somatosensation versus pain is debated. Despite known contributions of S1 to sensory gain modulation, its causal involvement in subjective sensory experiences remains elusive. Unspecific bulk manipulations of S1 activity have not disambiguated the precise role of the S1 in nociception and pain. Here, using cell-type-specific manipulations in mouse S1 we reveal the involvement of two major cortical output neuron types in layers 5 (L5) and 6 (L6) in the perception of innocuous and noxious somatosensory signals. We find that L6 neurons can drive aversive hypersensitivity and spontaneous nocifensive behavior. L6 downstream effects revealed enhanced thalamic somatosensory responses, and in parallel, strong suppression of L5 neurons, pointing towards an anti-nociceptive function of L5 output. Indeed, targeted L5 activation reduced sensory sensitivity and normalized inflammatory allodynia, thus revealing a layer-specific and bidirectional role for S1 in modulating subjective sensory experiences.

                Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) is among the most used algorithms to perform neuroimaging meta-analysis. Since its first implementation, several thresholding procedures had been proposed, all referred to the frequentist framework, returning a rejection criterion for the null hypothesis according to the critical p-value selected. However, this is not informative in terms of probabilities of the validity of the hypotheses. Here, we describe an innovative thresholding procedure based on the concept of minimum Bayes factor (mBF). The use of the Bayesian framework allows to consider different levels of probability, each of these being equally significant. In order to simplify the translation between the common ALE practice and the proposed approach, we analised six task-fMRI/VBM datasets and determined the mBF values equivalent to the currently recommended frequentist thresholds based on Family Wise Error (FWE). Sensitivity and robustness toward spurious findings were also analyzed. Results showed that the cutoff log10(mBF)=5 is equivalent to the FWE threshold, often referred as voxel-level threshold, while the cutoff log10(mBF)=2 is equivalent to the cluster-level FWE (c-FWE) threshold. However, only in the latter case voxels spatially far from the blobs of effect in the c-FWE ALE map survived. Therefore, when using the Bayesian thresholding the cutoff log10(mBF)=5 should be preferred. However, being in the Bayesian framework, lower values are all equally significant, while suggesting weaker level of force for that hypothesis. Hence, results obtained through less conservative thresholds can be legitimately discussed without losing statistical rigor. The proposed technique adds therefore a powerful tool to the human-brain-mapping field.

                Visual stimulation of animals in the laboratory is a powerful technique for studying sensory control of complex behaviors. Since commercial displays are optimized for human vision, we established a novel display system based on custom-built modular LED panels that provides millisecond refresh, precise synchronization, customizable color combinations, and varied display configurations. This system simplifies challenging experiments. With variants of this display, we probed the speed limits of motion vision and examined the role of color vision in behavioral experiments with tethered flying Drosophila. Using 2-photon calcium imaging, we comprehensively mapped the tuning of visual projection neurons across the fly's field of view. Finally, using real-time behavior analysis, we developed low-latency interactive virtual environments and found that flying flies can independently control their navigation along two dimensions. This display system uniquely addresses most technical challenges of small animal vision experiments and is thoroughly documented for replicability.

                The magnitude of neuronal activation is commonly considered a critical factor for conscious perception of visual content. However, this dogma contrasts with the phenomenon of rapid adaptation, in which the magnitude of neuronal activation drops dramatically in a rapid manner, while the visual stimulus and the conscious experience it elicits remain stable. Here we report that the profiles of multi-site activation patterns and their relational geometry, i.e. the similarity distances between activation patterns, as revealed using iEEG recordings, are sustained during extended stimulation despite the major magnitude decrease. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that conscious perceptual content is associated with the neuronal pattern profiles and their similarity distances, rather than by the overall activation magnitude, in human visual cortex.

                Self-organized criticality is a hallmark of complex dynamic systems at phase transitions. Systems that operate at or near criticality have large-scale fluctuations or avalanches, the frequency and duration power of which are best fit with a power law revealing them to be scale-free and fractal, and such power laws are ubiquitous. It is an attractive concept in neuroscience since spiking avalanches are exhibited by neural tissue, and may underpin how minuscule events could scale up to circuits and provide adaptive psychobiological function. Much is yet to be understood about criticality in vivo in the healthy brain and in disorders such as addiction, as drugs may alter the critical state tuning to generate drug seeking and dysphoria. Thus, here a novel toolset was developed to use neural avalanches and their self-similarity, rather than power law fit slope exponents as is canonically done, to quantify criticality in a previously collected high-density electrophysiological in vivo corticostriatal dataset from a mouse model of early cocaine abstinence. During behavioral quiescence, in the prefrontal cortex but not ventral striatum of cocaine-dosed mice, it was found that critical tuning is enhanced compared to drug-free controls. Additionally, an empirical biological demonstration of complexity's theoretical correlation to criticality was shown in drug-free mice, was exponentially enhanced in drug-treated cortex, but was absent in the drug-treated striatum. As shown, quantifying criticality grants experimental support for the critical brain hypothesis and allows for statistical interpretation of inter-subject variability and development of further testable hypotheses in systems neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Model of multiple synfire chains explains cortical spatio-temporal spike patterns</a></h4>

              
                It has been postulated that information processing in the brain is based on precise temporal correlation of neural activity across populations of neurons. In a recent study we found spatio-temporal spike patterns in experimental recordings from monkey motor cortex, and here we study if those could be explained by a synfire chain (SFC) like model. The model is composed of groups of neurons connected in feed-forward manner from one group to the next with high convergence and divergence. When activated, e.g., by a current pulse to the first group, spiking activity in the SFC is synchronous within neurons of the same group and propagates from group to group. When a few neurons from different groups are recorded from such an SFC, and the SFC is repeatedly activated, we would find a spatio-temporal spike pattern repeating across trials. Here, we take the statistics of the STPs found in the experimental data from 20 sessions as a reference to compare to a simulated network. Distributions of the data we take into account include 1) the pattern sizes, i.e. the number of neurons involved in the patterns, 2) the number of patterns a single neuron is involved in, 3) the durations of the patterns, and 4) the spatial distances of the patterns across the electrode array used to record the data. For the simulations, we embed SFC(s) in an anatomical model of the respective layer of the motor cortex, defined by its height and the density of the neurons. Model parameters are the length of the SFC, the number of neurons per group, the spatial extent of each neuronal group, and the distance between subsequent groups. Given the size and reach of the Utah array electrodes, we derive the probability of recording neurons from the SFC network. An SFC is considered detected if at least two neurons from two different groups are recorded. We find that depending on the model parameters, an embedded SFC can be detected with high probability, despite the massive subsampling of the cortex by the Utah array. Furthermore, to achieve multiple membership of a neuron in different patterns, we embed multiple SFCs that overlap. The fitting of the model to the pattern data constrains the spatial SFC parameters: the chains have to be broadly distributed in space and contain many neurons per group to match the experimental results.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pregnenolone reorganizes cytoskeleton to promote neuron development via CLIP1</a></h4>

              
                Pregnenolone (P5) is a neurosteroid produced in the brain. It improves cognitive function and protects against cannabis intoxication as well as spinal cord injury. P5 activates CLIP1, which helps microtubule polymerization at its growing end; however, the significance of P5 activation of CLIP1 in the brain is still unknown. Here we examined the roles of P5 in cultured neurons and in zebrafish cerebellum. We show that P5 promotes neurite outgrowth and facilitates axon development of cultured cerebellar granule neurons. P5 also changes the morphology of axon growth cone and promotes dynamic microtubule invasion into the distal part of filopodia at the growth cone. We have used CRISPR to disrupt clip1a in zebrafish, disrupting the ability of P5 to change microtubule dynamics and growth cone morphology, as well as to reorganize cytoskeleton. In vivo, P5 accelerated cerebellum development in WT but not clip1a mutant zebrafish, and expression of exogenous CLIP1 in clip1a mutant promoted cerebellum development in response to P5. Thus, we have delineated the pathway by which P5 promotes cerebellum development by activating CLIP1 to promote microtubule dynamics leading to increased microtubule penetration into the growth cone and accelerated neurite outgrowth. This study reveals the mechanism by which P5 and CLIP1 function to promote neural development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiple Intrinsic Membrane Properties are Modulated in a Switch from Single to Dual-Network Activity</a></h4>

              
                Neural network flexibility extends to changes in neuronal participation between networks. This neuronal switching can include neurons moving between single- and dual-network activity. We previously identified an example in which bursting at a second frequency occurs due to modulation of intrinsic membrane properties instead of synaptic recruitment into a second network. However, the intrinsic properties that are modulated were not determined. Here, we use small networks in the Jonah crab (Cancer borealis) stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) to examine modulation of intrinsic properties underlying neuropeptide- (Gly1-SIFamide) elicited neuronal switching. The LPG neuron switches from exclusive participation in the fast pyloric (~1 Hz) network, due to electrical coupling, to dual-network activity which includes periodic escapes from the fast rhythm via intrinsically-generated oscillations at the slower gastric mill network frequency (~0.1 Hz). We isolated LPG from both networks using pharmacology and hyperpolarizing current injection. Gly1-SIFamide increased LPG intrinsic excitability and rebound from inhibition, and decreased spike frequency adaptation, which can all contribute to intrinsic bursting. Using ion substitution and channel blockers, we found that a hyperpolarization-activated current, a persistent sodium current, and a calcium or calcium-related current(s) appear to be primary contributors to Gly1-SIFamide-elicited LPG intrinsic bursting. However, this intrinsic bursting was more sensitive to blocking currents when LPG received rhythmic electrical coupling input from the fast network than in the isolated condition. Overall, a switch from single- to dual-network activity can involve modulation of multiple intrinsic properties, while synaptic input from a second network can shape the contributions of these properties.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">V2b neurons act via multiple targets in spinal motor networks</a></h4>

              
                Local neurons within the spinal cord guide activity of specific motor neurons and muscles for execution of different movements. These interneuron populations also interact with each other to critically influence motor output, but a systematic mapping of their connectivity has not been performed. This is especially true for connectivity in the rostrocaudal axis, along which most interneurons project long-range axons. In this study, using larval zebrafish, we mapped local and long-range connectivity of a cardinal spinal population, V2b neurons. Gata3+ V2b neurons send ipsilateral, descending neurons that inhibit their postsynaptic targets. We show that V2b neurons are active during fictive swimming, providing on cycle inhibition that mostly leads the motor burst. In addition to motor neurons, V2bs inhibit other prominent interneuron classes including V2a, V1 and other V2b neurons, but neither of two categories of dorsal horn sensory neurons. Furthermore, V2b inhibition exhibited a distinct pattern of contacts along the R-C axis, providing long-range inhibition to motor neurons and V2as but more localized innervation of inhibitory V1s. Together, these results demonstrate that V2b connectivity varies along the rostrocaudal axis according to the identity of its synaptic target. Furthermore, in conjunction with prior work, these results provide the first demonstration of reciprocal V1/V2b inhibition in axial circuits, potentially providing an ancestral template of the limb control network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Recovery of forearm and fine digit function after chronic spinal cord injury by simultaneous blockade of inhibitory matrix CSPG production and the receptor PTPσ.</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injuries, for which there are limited effective clinical treatments, result in enduring paralysis and hypoesthesia due, in part, to the inhibitory microenvironment that develops and limits regeneration/sprouting, especially during chronic stages. Recently, we discovered that targeted enzymatic modulation of the potently inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) component of the extracellular and perineuronal net (PNN) matrix via Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) can rapidly restore robust respiratory function to the previously paralyzed hemi-diaphragm after remarkably long times post-injury (up to 1.5 years) following a cervical level 2 lateral hemi-transection. Importantly, ChABC treatment at cervical level 4 in this chronic model also elicited rapid, albeit modest, improvements in upper arm function. In the present study, we sought to further optimize and elucidate the capacity for nerve sprouting and/or regeneration to restore gross as well as fine motor control of the forearm and digits at lengthy chronic stages post injury. However, instead of using ChABC, we utilized a novel and more clinically relevant systemic, non-invasive combinatorial treatment strategy designed to both reduce (via oral delivery of 4-methylumbelliferone) and overcome inhibitory CSPGs (via sub-cutaneous delivery of the PTP{sigma} CSPG receptor blocking peptide ISP) simultaneously and spatially extensively. Following a three-month upper cervical spinal hemi-lesion, we show that the combined treatment has a profound effect on functional recovery of the chronically paralyzed forelimb and paw, specifically during walking as well as precision movements of the digits. Our exciting pre-clinical findings will begin to dramatically enhance our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying functionally beneficial regenerative events occurring at chronic injury stages for clinically relevant translational benefits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A structured multivariate approach for removal of latent batch effects</a></h4>

              
                Combining data collected from multiple studies is becoming common and is advantageous to researchers to increase the reproducibility of scientific discoveries. However, at the same time, unwanted "batch effects" are commonly observed across neuroimaging data collected from multiple study sites or scanners, rendering difficulties in combining such data to obtain reliable findings. While methods for handling such unwanted variations have been proposed recently, most of them use univariate approaches which would be too simple to capture all sources of batch effects which could be represented by the batch-specific latent patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel multivariate harmonization method, called UNIFAC harmonization, for estimating and removing both explicit and latent batch effects. Our approach is based on the simultaneous dimension reduction and factorization of interlinked matrices through a penalized objective, which provides a new direction in neuroimaging research for harmonizing multivariate features across batches. Using the Social Processes Initiative in Neurobiology of the Schizophrenia (SPINS) dataset and extensive simulation studies, we show that UNIFAC harmonization performed better than the existing methods in entirely removing batch effects as well as retaining associations of interest to increase statistical power. The proposed method is publicly available as a R package.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Full-length optic nerve regeneration in the absence of genetic manipulations</a></h4>

              
                The inability of mature retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to regenerate axons after optic nerve injury can be partially reversed by manipulating cell-autonomous and/or -non autonomous factors, among which are neuroimmune interactions. We report here that preconditioning resulting from a mild lens injury (conditioning LI, cLI) prior to optic nerve damage induces far greater axon regeneration than LI or the pro-inflammatory agent zymosan after nerve injury or preconditioning with Zymosan. Unlike other instances of immune supported regeneration, cLI is unaltered by depleting mature neutrophils, T cells or blocking receptors for identified inflammation-associated growth factors (Oncomodulin, SDF1, CCL5), and is only partially diminished by suppressing peripheral monocyte recruitment. Repeated LI leads to full-length optic nerve regeneration and pharmacological removal of local resident macrophages with the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor PLX5622 enables some axons to re innervate the brain in just 6 weeks. Thus, cell non-autonomous interventions not involving genetic manipulations can induce high levels of optic nerve regeneration, paving the way to uncover potent, translatable therapeutic targets for CNS repair.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brief synaptic inhibition persistently interrupts firing of fast-spiking interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Neurons perform input-output operations that integrate synaptic inputs with intrinsic electrical properties, operations generally constrained by the brevity of synaptic events. Here we report that sustained firing of CA1 hippocampal fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs) can be persistently interrupted for up to several hundred milliseconds following brief GABAAR-mediated inhibition in vitro and in vivo. A single presynaptic neuron could interrupt PV-INs firing, occasionally with a single action potential (AP), and reliably with AP bursts. Experiments and computational modeling revealed that the persistent interruption of firing maintains neurons in a depolarized, quiescent state through a cell-autonomous mechanism. Strikingly, interrupted PV-INs are highly responsive to Schaffer collateral inputs. The persistent interruption of firing provides a disinhibitory circuit mechanism favoring spike generation in CA1 pyramidal cells. Overall, our results demonstrate that neuronal silencing can far outlast brief synaptic inhibition owing to well-tuned interplay between neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic membrane dynamics, a phenomenon impacting microcircuit function.

                The development of ultra high field (UHF) fMRI signal readout strategies and contrasts has led to the possibility of imaging the human brain in vivo and non-invasively at increasingly higher spatial resolutions of cortical layers and columns. One emergent layer-fMRI acquisition method with increasing popularity is the cerebral blood volume (CBV) sensitive sequence named vascular space occupancy (VASO). This approach has been shown to be mostly sensitive to locally-specific changes of laminar microvasculature, without unwanted biases of trans-laminar draining veins. Until now, however, VASO has not been applied in the technically challenging cortical area of the primary auditory cortex. Here, we developed a VASO imaging protocol for auditory neuroscientific applications. We describe the main challenges we encountered and the solutions we have adopted to mitigate them. With our optimized protocol, we investigate laminar responses to sounds. Finally, as proof of concept for future investigations, we map the topographic representation of frequency preference (tonotopy) in the auditory cortex.

                The olfactory system detects a vast number of odorants using hundreds of olfactory receptors (ORs), the largest group of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. Each OR is activated by specific odorous ligands. Like other GPCRs, activation of ORs may be blocked through antagonism. Recent reports highlight widespread antagonisms in odor mixtures influencing olfactory neuron activities. However, it is unclear if and how these antagonisms influence perception of odor mixtures. Here we show that odorant antagonisms at the receptor level alter odor perception. Using a large-scale heterologous expression, we first identified a set of human ORs that are activated by methanethiol and hydrogen sulfide, two extremely potent volatile sulfur malodors. We then screened odorants that block activation of these ORs and identified a set of antagonists, including {beta}-ionone. Finally, human sensory evaluation revealed that odor intensity and unpleasantness of methanethiol were decreased by {beta}-ionone. Odor intensity of {beta}-ionone itself is not correlated with the degree of suppression of malodor sensation. Suppression was also not observed when methanethiol and {beta}-ionone were simultaneously introduced to different nostrils. Together, our data supports the model that odor sensation is altered through antagonistic interactions at the level of the ORs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Drosophila glial cell atlas reveals that transcriptionally defined cell types can be morphologically diverse</a></h4>

              
                Morphology is a key defining feature of neuronal identity. Like neurons, glia display diverse morphologies, both across and within glial classes. In the Drosophila central nervous system, glia are categorized into five main classes (outer and inner surface glia, cortex glia, ensheathing glia, and astrocytes), which also show within-class morphological diversity (morphotypes). Whether morphological differences reflect underlying transcriptional heterogeneity is unclear. We analysed and validated single cell RNA sequencing data of Drosophila glia in two well-characterized tissues from distinct developmental stages, containing distinct circuit types: the embryonic ventral nerve cord (motor) and the adult optic lobes (sensory). Our analysis identified a new morphologically and transcriptionally distinct surface glial population in the ventral nerve cord. However, many glial morphotypes could not be distinguished transcriptionally, and indeed, embryonic and adult astrocytes were transcriptionally analogous despite differences in developmental stage and circuit type. While we did detect extensive within-class transcriptomic diversity for optic lobe glia, this could be explained entirely by glial residence in the most superficial neuropil (lamina) and an associated enrichment for immune-related functions. In summary, we generated the first single-cell transcriptomic atlas of glia in Drosophila, and our extensive in vivo validation suggests that morphology is not set by an intrinsic transcriptional program. Instead, we propose that glia adopt morphological and functional states in response to their local environment. This atlas will serve as a resource for the community to probe glial diversity and function.

                A special charged surface network with surface spin half particles on it, that can be arranged in topologically inequivalent ways, is introduced. It is shown that action potential-like signals can be generated in the network in response to local surface deformations of a particular kind. Signals generated in this way carry details of the deformation that create them as a form of plasticity that influences the pathways they traverse leaving a topologically stable helical array of spins: a potential memory substrate. The structure is a non transient alignment of surface spins in response to the transient magnetic field generated by the moving charges present in the action potential-like voltage signals generated since particles with spin have magnetic properties. The structure has a natural excitation frequency that may play a role in memory retrieval. Signal generation and memory storage are proposed to depend on the existence of a surface spin structure. We show that such a surface network can capture the intricate topological features of any connectome in the brain. In addition biophysical properties of such a network are examined in order to constrain predictions of how it may function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adolescent binge drinking leads to long lasting changes in cortical microcircuits</a></h4>

              
                Adolescent drug consumption has increased risks to the individual compared to consumption in adulthood, due to the likelihood of long-term and permanent behavioral and neurological adaptations. However, little is known about how adolescent alcohol consumption influences the maturation and trajectory of cortical circuit development. Here, we explore the consequences of adolescent binge drinking on somatostatin (SST) neuronal function in the prelimbic (PL) cortex. We find that adolescent drinking-in-the-dark (DID) produces sex-dependent increases in intrinsic excitability of SST neurons, persisting well into adulthood. We found a complementary reduction in pyramidal neuron excitability immediately after binge drinking; however, this hypoexcitability rebounded towards increased pyramidal neuron activity in adulthood in females, suggesting long-term homeostatic adaptations in this circuit. Together, this suggests that binge drinking during key developmental timepoints leads to permanent changes in PL microcircuitry function, which may have broad behavioral implications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatial neglect after stroke is reduced when lying inside a 3T MRI scanner</a></h4>

              
                Recently, it was discovered that the static magnetic field of an MRI scanner not only causes horizontal vestibular nystagmus in healthy individuals but, in addition, leads to a horizontal bias of spatial orienting and exploration that closely resembles the one observed in stroke patients with spatial neglect. The present study asked whether the behavioral effects of this magnetic vestibular stimulation (MVS) can be inverted and thus be used to reduce the pathological bias of stroke patients with spatial neglect. Indeed, when W.E., a patient with left-sided spatial neglect, entered the scanner with his feet first, i.e., with the magnetic field vector pointing from his head to the toes, MVS inside the scanner reduced the ipsilesionally biased distribution of overt attention and the corresponding neglect of the left parts of the search-space. Thus, an intervention as simple as lying in a 3T MRI scanner bears the potential to become an integral part of a future strategy for treating spatial neglect.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ASM-3D: An attentional search model fashioned after what andwhere/how pathways for target search in 3D environment</a></h4>

              
                We propose a biologically inspired attention model for target search in a 3D environment, which has two separate channels for object classification, analogous to the what pathway in the human visual system, and for prediction of the next location of the camera, analogous to the where pathway. We generated a 3D Cluttered Cube dataset that consists of an image on one vertical face, and clutter images on the other faces. The camera goes around each cube on a circular orbit centered on the cube and determines the identity of the image and the face on which it is located. The images pasted on the cube faces were drawn from three: MNIST digit, QuickDraw, and RGB MNIST digit datasets. The attentional input of 3 concentric cropped windows resembling the high-resolution central fovea and low-resolution periphery of the retina, flows through a Classifier Network and a Camera Position Network. The classifier network classifies the current view into one of the classes or clutter. The Camera Position network predicts the camera next position on the orbit (varying the azimuthal angle or theta). Here the camera performs one of three actions: move right, move left, or do not move. The camera motion network is trained using Q-learning where the reward is 1 if the classifier network gives the correct classification, otherwise 0. Total loss is computed by adding the mean square loss of temporal difference and cross entropy loss, and backpropagation using Adam optimizer. Results on two grayscale image datasets and one RGB image dataset show that the proposed model is successfully able to discover the desired search pattern to find the target face on the cube, and also classify the target face accurately.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Central visceral commands formatted as the slow rhythms encoded in the temporal structures of the sympathetic firing originated from the neonatal rat spinal cord in vitro</a></h4>

              
                Central sympathetic neural circuits continuously generate efferent commands to sustain rhythmic operations of their peripheral effectors. However, beyond the firing rates, in what configuration an effective visceral command is formatted by the spiking activities was largely unknown. This study used an in vitro splanchnic nerve-spinal cord preparation of the neonatal rats as an experimental model and recorded spontaneous efferent activities from single sympathetic fibers. The patterns of the fiber activities were quantitatively evaluated by a metric, the so-called local variation (Lv). Lv was derived from calculating the relative differences between adjacent interspike intervals (ISIs), and thus, described the spiking patterns from a regular spiking with Lv = 0 to that spiking in bursts with Lv >1. Along the time course, the dynamic components of Lv (dLv) displayed quasiperiodic oscillations. Continuous wavelet analysis showed that dLv oscillations registered a dominant power rhythm at ~7 mHz. This slow rhythmicity was heterogeneously altered by application of various antagonists that interrupted endogenous neurotransmitter activities mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors or GABA A receptors in the spinal cord. Thus, the oscillation of dLv manifested itself as a feature of neural network operation. On the assumption that the total power of the dLv oscillations reflects an activity status of neural network operation, the antagonist-induced change of the power fits well with a concomitant ISI change in a negative sigmoid relationship, which explains the heterogeneity of the antagonist-induced firing responses. In conclusion, dLv oscillations reflect a dynamic status of neural network operation. The slow rhythms embedded in the dLv oscillations are likely acting as an information coder and convey effective central visceral commands that can be followed by their downstream effectors.

                The default mode network (DMN) is closely associated with self-referential mental functions and its dysfunction is implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the neurophysiological properties and task-based functional organization of the rodent DMN are poorly understood, limiting its translational utility. Here, we combine fiber-photometry with fMRI and computational modeling to characterize dynamics of putative rodent DMN nodes and their interactions with the anterior insular cortex (AI) of the salience network. We reveal neuronal activity changes in AI and DMN nodes prior to fMRI-derived DMN activations and uncover cyclical transition patterns between spatiotemporal neuronal activity states. Finally, we demonstrate that salient oddball stimuli suppress the DMN and enhance AI neuronal activity, and that the AI causally inhibits the retrosplenial cortex, a prominent DMN node. These findings elucidate previously unknown properties regarding the neurobiological foundations of the rodent DMN and its modulation by salient stimuli, paving the way for future translational studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The neurocognitive role of working memory load when Pavlovian motivational control affects instrumental learning</a></h4>

              
                Humans and animals learn optimal behaviors by interacting with the environment. Research suggests that a fast, capacity-limited working memory (WM) system and a slow, incremental reinforcement learning (RL) system jointly contribute to instrumental learning. Situations that strain WM resources alter several decision-making processes and the balance between multiple decision-making systems: under WM loads, learning becomes slow and incremental, while reward prediction error (RPE) signals become stronger; the reliance on computationally efficient learning increases as WM demands are balanced against computationally costly strategies; and action selection becomes more random. Meanwhile, instrumental learning is known to interact with Pavlovian learning, a hard-wired system that motivates approach to reward and avoidance of punishment. However, the neurocognitive role of WM load during instrumental learning under Pavlovian influence remains unknown, while conflict between the two systems sometimes leads to suboptimal behavior. Thus, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study (N = 49) in which participants completed an instrumental learning task with Pavlovian-instrumental conflict (the orthogonalized go/no-go task); WM load was manipulated with dual-task conditions. Behavioral and computational modeling analyses revealed that WM load compromised learning by reducing the learning rate and increasing random choice, without affecting Pavlovian bias. Model-based fMRI analysis revealed that WM load strengthened RPE signaling in the striatum. Moreover, under WM load, the striatum showed weakened connectivity with the ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex when computing reward expectations. These results suggest that the limitation of cognitive resources by WM load decelerates instrumental learning through the weakened cooperation between WM and RL; such limitation also makes action selection more random, but it does not directly affect the balance between instrumental and Pavlovian systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Uncertain Precision: Neurobiological and Physiological Correlates of Conservative Confidence Bias</a></h4>

              
                Correctly estimating the influence of uncertainty on our decisions is a critical metacognitive faculty. However, the relationship between sensory uncertainty (or its inverse, precision), decision accuracy, and subjective confidence is currently unclear. Although some findings indicate that healthy adults exhibit an illusion of over-confidence, under-confidence in response to sensory uncertainty has also been reported. One reason for this ambiguity is that stimulus intensity and precision are typically confounded with one another, limiting the ability to assess their independent contribution to metacognitive biases. Here we report four psychophysical experiments controlling these factors, finding that healthy human participants are systematically under-confident when discriminating low-precision stimuli. This bias remains even when decision accuracy and reaction time are accounted for, indicating that a performance-independent computation partially underpins the influence of sensory precision on confidence. We further show that this influence is linked to fluctuations in arousal and individual differences in the neuroanatomy of the left superior parietal lobe and middle insula. These results illuminate the neural and physiological correlates of precision misperception in metacognition.

                Spinal cord ependymal cells have stem cell properties in mice. They surround the central canal and keep expressing spinal cord developmental transcription factors. Similar cells exist in young humans however their persistence with aging is debated. We clarified this issue by collecting 17 spinal cords from organ donors, aged between 37 and 83 years old. We examined the presence of ependymal cells using immunohistochemistry on lightly-fixed tissue. We found the presence of cells expressing the typical ependymal marker FOXJ1 in the spinal cord central region in 100% of cases. In addition, a lumen surrounded by FOXJ1+ cells was observed in half of the cases. Like in mice, these human ependymal cells maintain the expression of SOX2 and PAX6 proteins together with RFX2 a master transcriptional regulator of ciliogenesis and ARL13B, a regulatory GTPase enriched in cilia. Reminiscent of the situation observed in mice and in young human spinal cord, a fetal-like regionalization of neurodevelopmental transcription factors was observed in three donors aged over 75 years: MSX1 and ARX/FOXA2 was preferentially expressed by dorsal and ventral ependymal cells, respectively. These results provide new evidence for the persistence of ependymal cells expressing neurodevelopmental genes throughout human life. The persistence of these cells in humans opens new opportunities to regenerate the spinal cord.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activity in developing prefrontal cortex is shaped by sleep and sensory experience</a></h4>

              
                In developing rats, behavioral state exerts a profound modulatory influence on neural activity throughout the sensorimotor system, including primary motor cortex (M1). We hypothesized that similar state-dependent modulation occurs in higher-order cortical areas with which M1 forms functional connections. Here, using 8- and 12-day-old rats cycling freely between sleep and wake, we record neural activity in M1, secondary motor cortex (M2), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). At both ages in all three areas, neural activity increased during active sleep (AS) compared with wake. Regardless of behavioral state, neural activity in M2 and mPFC increased during periods when limbs were moving. This movement-related activity in M2 and mPFC, like that in M1, is driven by sensory feedback. Our results, which diverge from those of previous studies using anesthetized pups, demonstrate that AS-dependent modulation and sensory responsivity extend to prefrontal cortex. These findings expand the range of factors shaping the activity-dependent development of higher-order cortical areas.

	<p>Dyslexic children have been shown to be more creative than their non-dyslexic counterparts. They have also been shown to have an abnormal oculomotor profile while viewing targets in free space, making vergence or saccadic eye movements while reading or when viewing Op art. They show a slower deceleration of their eye movements and a difficulty in coordinating their two eyes to obtain single fused vision in depth. Interestingly, their abnormal oculo-motor profile is exacerbated while reading more difficult texts. Given these differences, we postulate that dyslexics&amp;amp;rsquo; increased creativity may be related to their different eye movement control affecting how they perceive the world. Therefore, we decided to measure adolescent dyslexics&amp;amp;rsquo; creativity, oculomotor profile, and subjective responses while they viewed three paintings by Magritte. These were chosen to stimulate the perception of hidden conceptual spaces or stimulate conflict between the perception of the figural and textural content. For the first time to our knowledge, dyslexic adolescents were demonstrated to be more creative in terms of flexibility and fluidity than their non-dyslexic peers. Subjectively, while viewing the Magritte paintings, dyslexics reported fewer conceptual spaces and fewer hidden words than their non-dyslexic peers; thus, they confabulated less than non-dyslexics. Dyslexics also demonstrated an abnormal oculomotor profile similar to those that we have shown when reading, viewing randomized targets, and while perceiving illusions of depth in Op art paintings, in that they demonstrated difficulty with disconjugation and abnormalities in their eye velocity profiles. We propose there may be a link between dyslexic increased creativity and their eye movement abnormalities. Similar to reading nonsense text, we propose that Magritte&amp;amp;rsquo;s contradictory paintings exacerbate dyslexics&amp;amp;rsquo; eye movement abnormalities. These eye movement abnormalities while viewing these particular paintings might provide a physiological signature suggesting a contribution of their unusual eye control to their higher creativity scores.</p>

	<p>Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) linked by tight junctions play important roles in cerebral ischemia. Intercellular signaling via extracellular vesicles (EVs) is an underappreciated mode of cell&amp;amp;ndash;cell crosstalk. This study aims to explore the potential function of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in BMECs&amp;amp;rsquo; secreted EVs. We subjected primary human and rat BMECs to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). EVs were enriched for RNA sequencing. A comparison of the sequencing results revealed 146 upregulated lncRNAs and 331 downregulated lncRNAs in human cells and 1215 upregulated lncRNAs and 1200 downregulated lncRNAs in rat cells. Next, we analyzed the genes that were coexpressed with the differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs on chromosomes and performed Gene Ontology (GO) and signaling pathway enrichment analyses. The results showed that the lncRNAs may play roles in apoptosis, the TNF signaling pathway, and leukocyte transendothelial migration. Next, three conserved lncRNAs between humans and rats were analyzed and confirmed using PCR. The binding proteins of these three lncRNAs in human astrocytes were identified via RNA pulldown and mass spectrometry. These proteins could regulate mRNA stability and translation. Additionally, the lentivirus was used to upregulate them in human microglial HMC3 cells. The results showed NR_002323.2 induced microglial M1 activation. Therefore, these results suggest that BMECs&amp;amp;rsquo; EVs carry the lncRNAs, which may regulate gliocyte function after cerebral ischemia.</p>

	<p>Background: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a common complication of stroke, which seriously affects the functional outcome of patients. Systemic low-grade inflammation associated with PSD has been shown to occur at several months to years, however, whether these inflammatory markers predicted PSD at an acute stage of stroke is controversial. Method: A total of 625 patients with acute ischemic stroke (219 female, 35.40%) were included in this study. PSD was diagnosed using the 17-item Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) at 7 days following discharge (7–14 days after stroke onset). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to build a prediction model for PSD at discharge. Discrimination and calibration of the model were assessed by C-index, calibration plot. Internal validation was conducted using bootstrapping validation. Results: At discharge of hospitalization, 95 patients (15.20%) were diagnosed with PSD. Multivariable logistic regression suggested that female gender (OR = 2.043, 95% CI = 1.287–3.245, p = 0.002), baseline NIHSS (OR = 1.108, 95% CI = 1.055–1.165, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and fibrinogen (OR = 1.388, 95% CI = 1.129–1.706, p = 0.002) were independent predictors for PSD at discharge. The cut-off of the fibrinogen plasma level was 3.08 g/L. These predictors were included in the nomogram. The model displayed good discrimination, with a C-index of 0.730 (95% CI = 0.683–0.777) and good calibration. Conclusion: Female gender, baseline stroke severity and a higher level of fibrinogen were independently associated with PSD at discharge. A nomogram based on these three predictors can be used to provide an individual, visual prediction of the risk probability of PSD.</p>

	<p>It is known that dyslexics present eye movement abnormalities. Previously, we have shown that eye movement abnormalities during reading or during saccade and vergence testing can predict dyslexia successfully. The current study further examines this issue focusing on eye movements during free exploration of paintings; the dataset was provided by a study in our laboratory carried by Ward and Kapoula. Machine learning (ML) classifiers were applied to eye movement features extracted by the software AIDEAL: a velocity threshold analysis reporting amplitude speed and disconjugacy of horizontal saccades. In addition, a new feature was introduced that concerns only the very short periods during which the eyes were moving, one to the left the other to the right; such periods occurred mostly during fixations between saccades; we calculated a global index of the frequency of such disconjugacy segments, of their duration and their amplitude. Such continuous evaluation of disconjugacy throughout the time series of eye movements differs from the disconjugacy feature that describes inequality of the saccade amplitude between the two eyes. The results show that both AIDEAL features, and the Disconjugacy Global Index (DGI) enable successful categorization of dyslexics from non-dyslexics, at least when applying this analysis to the specific paintings used in the present study. We suggest that this high power of predictability arises from both the content of the paintings selected and the physiologic relevance of eye movement features extracted by the AIDEAL and the DGI.</p>

	<p>Background: Stuttering is characterized by dysfluency and difficulty in speech production. Previous research has found abnormalities in the neural function of various brain areas during speech production tasks. However, the cognitive neural mechanism of stuttering has still not been fully determined. Method: Activation likelihood estimation analysis was performed to provide neural imaging evidence on neural bases by reanalyzing published studies. Results: Our analysis revealed overactivation in the bilateral posterior superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, and deactivation in the anterior superior temporal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus among the stutterers. The overactivated regions might indicate a greater demand in feedforward planning in speech production, while the deactivated regions might indicate dysfunction in the auditory feedback system among stutterers. Conclusions: Our findings provide updated and direct evidence on the multi-level impairment (feedforward and feedback systems) of stutterers during speech production and show that the corresponding neural bases were differentiated.</p>

	<p>Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a chronic neuropathic pain syndrome, similar to other chronic pains, the mechanisms of which are not fully understood. To further understand the neural mechanism of this chronic pain and its transition, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans on PHN rat models. Twelve PHN rat models were established by intraperitoneal injection of resiniferatoxin, with an additional 12 rats serving as controls. Nociceptive behavioral tests were performed on these rats and fMRI scans were performed on days 7 and 14 after modeling. Functional connection (FC) analysis was used to investigate the brain FC alterations associated with chronic pain in PHN rats, with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a seed. Nociceptive behavioral tests showed that PHN rats presented symptoms similar to those of PHN patients. FC analysis showed that compared to the control group, the PHN group showed different FC patterns on days 7 and 14. As can be seen, the brain FC alterations in the rat model of PHN changed dynamically, shifting from brain regions processing sensory information to regions processing emotions and motives.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An adapted behavioural activation intervention (DiaDeM) for people with diabetes and depression in South Asia: A feasibility study protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The burden of depression is a rapidly growing problem worldwide. Its prevalence is particularly high among individuals with chronic physical conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM), precipitating poorer health outcomes. There is a lack of evidence around treatments that can work among such groups, particularly in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). This study aims to test the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally adapted Behavioural Activation (BA) intervention (DiaDeM) for people with T2DM and depression in two LMICs in South Asia. Methods: A multicentre, randomised-controlled feasibility trial will be conducted from March 2022 to February 2023. We will recruit 128 adults from health facilities in Bangladesh and Pakistan with a diagnosis of T2DM and depression. Using a 1:1 allocation ratio, consenting individuals will be randomised to either optimised usual care or the DiaDeM intervention. The latter will involve six face-to-face or remotely delivered BA sessions conducted by non-mental health facilitators over six to twelve weeks. Participants will be followed up at three and six months post-randomisation. Feasibility outcomes include the feasibility and acceptability of recruitment and retention, the feasibility of intervention delivery and the feasibility of data collection at baseline and follow-up (including economic data). An embedded mixed-methods process evaluation will also be carried out to inform the main trial. Conclusions: BA is a low resource intervention for depression treatment that can be optimised for delivery in LMIC settings such as South Asia. The planned feasibility trial will directly inform a larger trial to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such an intervention in people with T2DM and depression. It will also contribute to the wider evidence base around BA in patients with chronic physical illnesses, with particular relevance to South Asian, as well as wider LMIC regions and populations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Observation of SARS-CoV-2 genome characteristics and clinical manifestations within eight family clusters from GH and GK clades in Jakarta, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: SARS-CoV-2 rapid mutation generates many concerning new strains. Although lockdown had been applied to contain the disease, the household remains a critical place for its transmission. This study aimed to assess the variation of SARS-CoV-2 strains and their clinical manifestations within family clusters in Jakarta, Indonesia. Method: Naso-oropharyngeal swab specimens from family clusters positive for SARS-CoV-2 were collected for whole-genome sequencing. Their baseline data, symptoms, and source of infection were recorded. The whole-genome data was then analyzed with the bioinformatics program to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 genome characteristic and submitted to GISAID for strain identification. The phylogenetic tree was built to observe the relationship between virus strain within the family cluster and its clinical manifestation. Result: This study obtained eight family clusters from twenty-two patients. Half of the cluster's source of infection was a family member who had to work at the office. The infection rate ranged from 37.5% to 100%. The phylogenetic tree showed that the same virus within a cluster could generate various clinical outcomes. Five clusters had one family member with pneumonia, while others had mild to no symptoms. Four breakthrough cases were detected in this study, which were infected by the virus from GH and GK clade.  Conclusion: Our study observed the SARS-CoV-2 transmission to the household setting through the workplace, which might become a common pathway if the pandemic status is removed. Although vaccination is expected to reduce the burden of COVID-19, adequate control measures remain essential, given that breakthrough infections are evident.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Lupeol and pristimerin do not inhibit activation of the human sperm CatSper Ca(2+)-channel [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Opposing findings have been published on the regulation of the sperm-specific Ca2+ channel CatSper (cation channel of sperm) in human sperm cells by the plant triterpenoids lupeol and pristimerin. While the original study on this topic found these triterpenoids to act as potent inhibitors of human CatSper, subsequent studies have failed to replicate such an inhibitory effect. It has been suggested that these issues could in part be due to purity issues and/or batch variation between the plant-derived extracts of lupeol and pristimerin obtained for the studies. The aim of this study was to elucidate this controversy by investigating the batches of lupeol and pristimerin used in our previous study with state-of-the-art 1H-, 13C- and 2D-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods to reveal potential purity and/or batch variation issues. When comparing the NMR-spectra obtained from 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR with previously published NMR-spectra for lupeol and pristimerin, we could confirm that both the lupeol and pristimerin batch were ≥95 % pure. These results confirm the validity of the findings in our previous study for lupeol and pristimerin, showing that lupeol and pristimerin do not inhibit activation of CatSper in human sperm. In conclusion, using 1H-, 13C- and 2D-NMR methods, we confirm that the lupeol and pristimerin batches used in our previous study were ≥95 % pure and thereby fail to identify any purity issues and/or batch variation that could explain the observed inability of lupeol and pristimerin to inhibit activation of CatSper in human sperm.

                Background: Leptomeningeal metastasis is an infrequent form of cancer expression, and it has a poor prognosis due to its torpid evolution and its challenging diagnosis. Case report: We report the case of a 68-year-old woman with rapidly progressing cognitive decline and focal epilepsy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive gyriform hypersignal in the right precentral sulcus region, without mass effect, tenuous contrast uptake, and hydrocephalus with transependymal edema. The body tomographic study was negative for solid cancer and the 18F-FDG PET-CT revealed a severe hypermetabolism in the right lung upper lobe. These findings were suggestive of lung cancer with leptomeningeal metastasis. We performed a brain biopsy, finding atypical cells in the leptomeningeal region with positive immunohistochemical staining for CK7 and negative for CK20 corresponding to lung adenocarcinoma. The patient was evaluated in the oncology service and scheduled for radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Conclusions: Focal leptomeningeal disease is an entity that should be considered as a differential diagnosis in all cases of focal leptomeningitis. Timely diagnosis and adequate cancer management can increase patient survival.

                In correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), the fluorescent images must be registered to the EM images with high precision. Due to the different contrast of EM and fluorescence images, automated correlation-based alignment is not directly possible, and registration is often done by hand using a fluorescent stain, or semi-automatically with fiducial markers. We introduce “DeepCLEM”, a fully automated CLEM registration workflow. A convolutional neural network predicts the fluorescent signal from the EM images, which is then automatically registered to the experimentally measured chromatin signal from the sample using correlation-based alignment. The complete workflow is available as a Fiji plugin and could in principle be adapted for other imaging modalities as well as for 3D stacks.

                Background: A high rate of student abuse has been reported in various studies; however, few studies substantiate the seriousness of the issue in Latin American contexts. This study aimed to characterize the abuse of university students in five Latin American countries and its association with student satisfaction.   Methods: An analytical transversal study was conducted, in which 2,141 undergraduate students from Paraguay, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama were surveyed. A validated questionnaire was applied to evaluate four types of abuse (Cronbach's Alpha: 0.90): psychological, physical, academic, and sexual. In addition, students’ perception of satisfaction of four items in the university environment (Cronbach's Alpha: 0.85) was also analyzed.   Results: It was found that the older students were, the more dissatisfied they were with “logistics” (aPR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.00-1.04; p-value; 0.014) and the top-third segment of those who perceived “sexual abuse” were more dissatisfied with the teaching provided by their universities (aPR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.00-1.52; p-value: 0.048). Moreover, those who were most dissatisfied with the agreements were part of the top-third segment of those who perceived sexual abuse (aPR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.03-1.32; p-value: 0.016) and those in the country of Panama were less dissatisfied with “agreements” (RPa: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.66-0.073; p-value<0.001). The countries of Colombia (aPR: 0.08; IC95%: 0.01-0.59; p-value: 0.014) and Panama (aPR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.52-0.64; p-value<0.001) were less dissatisfied with investigation programs.   Conclusions: The perception of ‘sexual abuse’ was the only risk factor statistically associated with dissatisfaction with teaching and agreements.

                We report a rare case of a vertebro-vertebral arteriovenous fistula (VVAVF) manifesting as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A 76-year-old female patient presented with progressive weakness, muscle atrophy, fasciculation, and preserved deep tendon reflexes in the right upper limb. Electrophysiological testing showed lower motor neuron dysfunction. The patient was suspected to have ALS, but cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed enlarged blood vessels in the spinal canal, which compressed the cervical spinal cord and nerve roots. Angiography showed a shunt from the right vertebral artery to the right intervertebral vein and the vertebral venous plexus; therefore, the patient was diagnosed with VVAVF. Transarterial embolization was performed to obliterate the shunt, and weakness in the patient’s right upper limb subsequently improved. It is worth considering VVAVF as a differential diagnosis of ALS-like diseases.

                Background: The purpose of this work is to study the prospects of using charity lotteries as a marketing tool for involving consumers and employees in charitable activities. Methods: The research methodology is based on the principles of the theory of planned behavior by Ajzen. Results: The study confirmed that behavioral intention is correlated with actual behavior. Subjective norms factors have the most significant influence on behavioral intention. Conclusions: Correlation analysis allowed us to establish a weak effect of socio-demographic characteristics (Age, Gender, Capital Status, Ownership of Home, Educational Qualification, Employment, Annual Income) on behavior. The experience of participating in the lottery in the past also turned out to be insignificant. There is reason to believe that Russian consumers' decision to participate in the charity lottery is impulsive or due to pressure from their surroundings.

                Background: A pyogenic granuloma (PG) is a common benign vascular lesion found in the oral cavity. The gold standard treatment of this lesion, comprising surgical excision and the elimination of etiological factors, cannot avoid tooth loss in the case of an aggressive pyogenic granuloma. Because of the prominent properties of 980 nm and 635 nm diode lasers in photocoagulation and photobiomodulation, we applied these wavelengths in the treatment of a large pyogenic granuloma with alveolar bone loss. Case presentation: Our objective was to use a combination of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy, photocoagulation and laser-assisted new attachment procedure (LANAP) to preserve the teeth and periodontal tissue in a case of an aggressive pyogenic granuloma. Results: The patient was a 13-year-old Thai male with a pyogenic granuloma involving the interdental papilla and lingual gingiva of the lower left first and second molars. The teeth were also displaced by the lesion. After treatment with three sessions of photocoagulation, three sessions of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy and two sessions of LANAP, the lesion was completely resolved. The periodontal status of the teeth was improved at the six-month follow-up. Conclusion: The combination of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy, photocoagulation and LANAP was able to treat an aggressive pyogenic granuloma with tooth preservation.

<p>Our work revealed that a combination treatment including ChABC, epidural cortical stimulation, and daily rehabilitation promotes increased muscle activity during grip strength while maximum voluntary contraction muscle recordings were acquired in awake behaving animals after a clinically relevant cervical contusion injury.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cervical level spinal cord injury (SCI) can severely impact upper limb muscle function, which is typically assessed in the clinic using electromyography (EMG). Here, we established novel preclinical methodology for EMG assessments of muscle function after SCI in awake freely moving animals. Adult female rats were implanted with EMG recording electrodes in bicep muscles and received bilateral cervical (C7) contusion injuries. Forelimb muscle activity was assessed by recording maximum voluntary contractions during a grip strength task and cortical motor evoked potentials in the biceps. We demonstrate that longitudinal recordings of muscle activity in the same animal are feasible over a chronic post-injury time course and provide a sensitive method for revealing post-injury changes in muscle activity. This methodology was utilized to investigate recovery of muscle function after a novel combination therapy. Cervical contused animals received intraspinal injections of a neuroplasticity-promoting agent (lentiviral-chondroitinase ABC) plus 11 weeks of cortical epidural electrical stimulation (3 h daily, 5 days/week) and behavioral rehabilitation (15 min daily, 5 days/week). Longitudinal monitoring of voluntary and evoked muscle activity revealed significantly increased muscle activity and upper limb dexterity with the combination treatment, compared to a single treatment or no treatment. Retrograde mapping of motor neurons innervating the biceps showed a predominant distribution across spinal segments C5–C8, indicating that treatment effects were likely due to neuroplastic changes in a mixture of intact and injured motor neurons. Thus, longitudinal assessments of muscle function after SCI correlate with skilled reach and grasp performance and reveal functional benefits of a novel combination therapy.</p>

                Background: Most HIV-positive adults in Kenya with prior non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) failure are currently on ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r). Dolutegravir (DTG) has shown good efficacy among treatment-experienced adults. Objective: Our study is the first to evaluate the efficacy of switching from ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) to DTG among virally suppressed adults with prior NNRTI failure and with no knowledge of susceptibility to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Methods: This open-label, randomized, active-controlled, non-inferiority trial was conducted at four sites in Kenya. Virally suppressed HIV-1 positive adults (≥ 18 years) on a second-line regimen of PI/r and 2 NRTIs were randomized (1:1) to switch to DTG or continue their pre-enrollment PI/r. The primary endpoint is proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at week 48 with a 4% non-inferiority margin. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04229290. Results: Between Feb 10 and Sep 3, 2020, 1,114 adults were screened, 795 were randomized and 791 treated (397 DTG, 394 baseline PI/r). All participants were black, 66.3% were female, median age was 46 years, and median CD4 count was 423 cells/μl. Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities at baseline included 44.6% with reduced creatinine clearance and 9.7% with elevated lipids. Conclusions: This is the first randomized trial evaluating a switch strategy from PI/r to DTG for virally suppressed adults who have previously failed NNRTI, and is expected to provide critical evidence to inform large HIV programs in sub-Saharan Africa. We found high rates of baseline laboratory abnormalities that were not detected during routine care.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Assessing mild cognitive impairment using object‐location memory in immersive virtual environments</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pathological changes in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) are found in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging. The earliest pathological accumulation of tau colocalizes with the areas of the MTL involved in object processing as part of a wider anterolateral network. Here, we sought to assess the diagnostic potential of memory for object locations in iVR environments in individuals at high risk of AD dementia (amnestic mild cognitive impairment [aMCI] <i>n</i> = 23) as compared to age-related cognitive decline. Consistent with our primary hypothesis that early AD would be associated with impaired object location, aMCI patients exhibited impaired spatial feature binding. Compared to both older (<i>n</i> = 24) and younger (<i>n</i> = 53) controls, aMCI patients, recalled object locations with significantly less accuracy (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), with a trend toward an impaired identification of the object's correct context (<i>p</i> = .05). Importantly, these findings were not explained by deficits in object recognition (<i>p</i> = .6). These deficits differentiated aMCI from controls with greater accuracy (AUC = 0.89) than the standard neuropsychological tests. Within the aMCI group, 16 had CSF biomarkers indicative of their likely AD status (MCI+ <i>n</i> = 9 vs. MCI− <i>n</i> = 7). MCI+ showed lower accuracy in the object-context association than MCI− (<i>p</i> = .03) suggesting a selective deficit in object-context binding postulated to be associated with anterior-temporal areas. MRI volumetric analysis across healthy older participants and aMCI revealed that test performance positively correlates with lateral entorhinal cortex volumes (<i>p</i> &lt; .05) and hippocampus volumes (<i>p</i> &lt; .01), consistent with their hypothesized role in binding contextual and spatial information with object identity. Our results indicate that tests relying on the anterolateral object processing stream, and in particular requiring successful binding of an object with spatial information, may aid detection of pre-dementia AD due to the underlying early spread of tau pathology.</p>

                Sustainability of research infrastructures (RIs) is a big challenge for funders, stakeholders and operators, and the development and adoption of adequate management tools is a major concern, namely tools for monitoring and evaluating their performance and impact. BioData.pt is the Portuguese Infrastructure of Biological and Portuguese node of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures "Landmark" ELIXIR. The foundations of this national research infrastructure were laid under the “Building BioData.pt” project, for four years. During this period, performance and impact indicators were collected and analysed under the light of international guidelines for assessing the performance and impact of European research infrastructures produced by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the EU-funded RI-PATHS project. The exercise shared herein showed that these frameworks can be adopted by national RIs, with the necessary adaptations, namely to reflect the national landscape and specificity of activities, and can be powerful tools in supporting the management of RIs. “Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted, counts”.

                Background: A growing body of research indicates that psychological coercive control poses a threat in academic environments. Little is known, however, about the process, the dynamics, and the phases used to impose silently a variety of non-violent assaults on students and academics. A lack of awareness of coercive intimidation and psychological coercive control obstructs a student’s path to academic achievement, which can have an impact on his or her emotional and mental well-being and diminishes the prosperity of society.   Methods: A methodological selection and review of the scientific literature, theories, and practice on psychological intimidation, coercive control, and systems thinking has been employed in this study. A comprehensive reflective analysis and critical synthesis of the relevant scientific literature were conducted to gain insight into the design of a model of psychological coercive control applicable to educational environments.   Results: This article identifies gaps in research theory and practice and examines critical issues of intimidation and psychological coercive control that is relevant to educational contexts. The article proposes a conceptual model of psychological coercive control as a direction for further research.   Conclusions: Adequate awareness, models, and training programmes in relation to coercive infiltration are missing at higher education institutions. There is an urgent need for a curriculum change that may serve to promote support systems thinking and security awareness in educational environments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Wessex Fit-4-Cancer Surgery Trial (WesFit): a protocol for a factorial-design, pragmatic randomised-controlled trial investigating the effects of a multi-modal prehabilitation programme in patients undergoing elective major intra–cavity cancer surgery</a></h4>

              
                Background: Surgical resection remains the primary curative treatment for intra-cavity cancer. Low physical fitness and psychological factors such as depression are predictive of post–operative morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay. Prolonged post-operative morbidity is associated with persistently elevated risk of premature death. We aim to investigate whether a structured, responsive exercise training programme, a psychological support programme or combined exercise and psychological support, delivered between treatment decision and major intra-cavity surgery for cancer, can reduce length of hospital stay, compared with standard care. Methods: WesFit is a pragmatic, 2x2 factorial-design, multi-centre, randomised-controlled trial, with planned recruitment of N=1560. Participants will be randomised to one of four groups. Group 1 (control) will receive usual pre-operative care, Group 2 (exercise) patients will undergo 2/3 aerobic, high-intensity interval training sessions per week supervised by personal trainers. Group 3 (psychological support) patients are offered 1 session per week at a local cancer support centre. Group 4 will receive both exercise and psychological support. All patients undergo baseline and pre-operative cardiopulmonary exercise testing, complete self-report questionnaires and will be followed up at 30 days, 12 weeks and 12 months post-operatively. Primary outcome is post-operative length-of-stay. Secondary outcomes include disability-adjusted survival at 1-year postoperatively, post-operative morbidity, and health-related quality of life. Exploratory investigations include objectively measured changes in physical fitness assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise test, disease-free and overall mortality at 1-year postoperatively, longer-term physical activity behaviour change, pre-operative radiological tumour regression, pathological tumour regression, pre and post-operative body composition analysis, health economics analysis and nutritional characterisation and its relationship to post-operative outcome. Conclusions: The WesFit trial will be a randomised controlled study investigating whether a high-intensity exercise training programme +/- psychological intervention results in improvements in clinical and patient reported outcomes in patients undergoing major inter-cavity resection of cancer.

                Background: The objective of this study was to test the validity of automated audiometry as a method of hearing examination in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Methods: This was a cross-sectional comparative study with a retrospective approach, using patient medical records. Patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were recruited based-on medical records that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria at the Pulmonology outpatient unit, then referred to the Otorhinolaryngology outpatient unit of the Dr. Soetomo Academic Medical Center. The subjects’ hearing function was measured with two different devices (automated audiometer and conventional audiometer) before being given anti-tuberculosis drug therapy (aminoglycoside injection) as ototoxicity monitoring from July to December 2019 period. Sensitivity and specificity analysis was used to assess the validity of the test. Results: A total of 36 patients (72 ears) were included. The comparison test results using the Mann-Whitney test showed that there were significant differences between automated audiometry and conventional audiometry in both ears. Analysis values were: sensitivity 80-97%, specificity 37-96%, positive predictive value 74-98%, and negative predictive value 59-96%. Conclusions: Automated audiometry is valid for use as a method of hearing examination and monitoring in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Role of transesophageal echocardiography in a patient with an initially misdiagnosed acute pulmonary embolism [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: For the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism, chest computerized tomography (CT) angiography is considered as the gold standard. However, echocardiography could be useful especially in cases of high suspicion with normal CT scan or for patient with hemodynamic instability. Case presentation: We present a case of a 47-year-old man admitted to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of respiratory failure and hemodynamic instability 24 hours after closed fracture of the right leg. Before his admission, a thoracic CT angiography was done but did not show any sign of acute pulmonary embolism. During the first hours, he presented a bad evolution with a respiratory status which failed to respond to high dose of vasopressor, oxide nitric and ventilatory support. Therefore, due to the poor echocardiographic window, transesophageal echocardiography examination was done in emergency. It revealed high-probability diagnosis of massive pulmonary embolism based on right ventricular dysfunction and the presence of thrombus in the right pulmonary artery. Anticoagulant therapy (non-fractioned heparin) was administrated immediately achieving a favorable clinical outcome with rapid withdrawal of dobutamine, nitric oxide and norepinephrine. Conclusions: This case illustrates the fundamental role of transesophageal echocardiography in a critically ill patient with shock due to high-probability pulmonary embolism. Echocardiography allows the initiation of adequate treatment without further delay.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Analysis of contact tracing surveillance for COVID-19 among healthcare workers in secondary referral hospital, Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Tracing and screening cases among healthcare workers are essential to overcome the spread of COVID-19. We held surveillance at the second-referral hospital in Surabaya, Indonesia, to inspect the associating factors of infected HCWs. Methods: From 776 HCWs, we conducted a structured retrospective review of all COVID-19-confirmed HCWs and ones having contact with COVID-19 patients between February-July 2021. We associated general characteristics (i.e age, gender, working sites, etc) of the sample with the positive cases, analyzed the vaccination status, then did bivariate and multivariate regression logistic analyses to determine related factors putting HCWs at risk for COVID-19 infection.   Results: Bivariate analysis significantly revealed that 72.86% patients had a close contact (OR = 2.61; p<0.05), with medical staffs as the most frequent source (85.71%; OR = 2.19; p=0.033), for > 15 minutes contact duration (90%; OR = 1.1; p<0.05). Healthcare workers wearing proper PPE (N-95 and face shields) were significantly less exposed to COVID-19 (OR = 0.47; p<0.05; and OR = 0.46; p<0.05). Even fully-vaccinated samples were still prone to infection. (OR=1.25; p= 0.042). Common symptoms consisted of fever, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and vomiting (p=0.025l p=0.002; p<0.05; p=0.002). Multivariate regression logistic analysis disclosed that the use of N95 masks, contact duration >15 minutes, and the vaccine were the most influential factors (aOR = 1.72. 95% CI (1.029-2.88); aOR = 3.92. 95% CI (1.75-8.78); aOR = 0.39. 95% CI (0.13-0.82 )) Conclusions: Close contact, lack of compliance in wearing N95 masks, and unvaccinated status are risk factors for COVID-19 exposure to HCWs; thus, to achieve maximum prevention of intra-hospital transmission, the use of N-95 masks, contact avoidance, and vaccination, along with immediate tracing and strict health-protocols are all compulsory.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of coffee on contralateral suppression of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Coffee is a popular non-alcoholic beverage consumed by humans across the world. It contains caffeine, which is a type of stimulant of the central nervous system. In the auditory system, it has a positive effect on auditory brainstem response and perception of speech in noise. Further, caffeine has an inhibitory effect in the cochlea, but studies have rarely investigated its effect on otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) in humans. OAEs are low-intensity sounds produced by the cochlea, which could be recorded in the ear canal. The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of coffee on transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) and contralateral suppression of TEOAE. Method: A total of 52 young adults participated in the study. A cross-over study design was used for the present investigation. The TEOAE and contralateral suppression of TEOAE were recorded before and after consumption of coffee and milk. The contralateral suppression of TEOAE was measured by presenting white noise to the contralateral ear at 40, 50, and 60 dB sound pressure level (SPL). Results: The mean amplitude of TEOAE before and after consumption of coffee was similar in both ears. Further, the mean contralateral suppression of TEOAE was slightly larger after consumption of coffee in both ears. However, the mean difference was not significant in both the ears. Conclusions: Based on the findings of present study, coffee has no significant effect on the amplitude of TEOAE and contralateral suppression of TEOAE.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Prefrontal and hippocampal theta rhythm show anxiolytic‐like changes during periaqueductal‐elicited “panic” in rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Anxiety and panic are both elicited by threat and co-occur clinically. But, at the neural level, anxiety appears to inhibit the generation of panic; and vice versa. Anxiety and panic are thought to engage more anterior (a) and mid-posterior (m) parts of the periaqueductal gray (PAG), respectively. Anxiety also engages the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. Here, we tested if mPAG but not aPAG stimulation would suppress prefrontal and hippocampal theta rhythm as do anxiolytic drugs. Twelve male rats with implanted electrodes were stimulated alternately (30 s interval) in the left PAG or right reticular formation (reticularis pontis oralis [RPO]—as a positive control) with recording in the left prelimbic cortex and left and right hippocampus. PAG stimulation was set to produce freezing and RPO to produce 7–8 Hz theta rhythm before tests lasting 10 min on each of 5 days. mPAG stimulation decreased, and aPAG increased, theta power at all sites during elicited freezing. mPAG, but not aPAG, stimulation decreased prefrontal theta frequency. Stimulation did not substantially change circuit dynamics (pairwise phase consistency and partial directed coherence). Together with previous reports, our data suggest that panic- and anxiety-control systems are mutually inhibitory, and neural separation of anxiety and panic extends down to the aPAG and mPAG, respectively. Our findings are consistent with recent proposals that fear and anxiety are controlled by parallel neural hierarchies extending from PAG to the prefrontal cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Brain connectivity predicts chronic pain in acute mild traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Previous studies have established the role of the cortico-mesolimbic and descending pain modulation systems in chronic pain prediction. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is an acute pain model where chronic pain is prevalent and complicated for prediction. In this study, we set out to study whether functional connectivity (FC) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) is predictive of pain chronification in early-acute mTBI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>To estimate FC, resting-state fMRI of 105 participants with mTBI following motor vehicle collision was acquired within 72 hours post-accident. Participants were classified according to pain ratings provided at 12-months post-collision into Chronic Pain (head/neck pain ≥ 30/100; n = 44) and Recovery (n = 61) groups, and their FC maps compared.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The Chronic Pain group exhibited reduced negative FC between NAc and a region within the primary motor cortex corresponding with the expected representation of the area of injury. A complementary pattern was also demonstrated between PAG and the primary somatosensory cortex. PAG and NAc also shared increased FC to the rACC within the Recovery group. Brain connectivity further shows high classification accuracy (AUC = .86) for future chronic pain, when combined with acute pain intensity report.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>FC features obtained shortly after mTBI predict its transition to long term chronic pain, and may reflect an underlying interaction of injury-related primary sensorimotor cortical areas with the mesolimbic and pain modulation systems. Our findings indicate a potential predictive biomarker and highlight targets for future early preventive interventions.</p>

                Liu, Tose et al. reveal that a high dose of nicotine causes behavioral aversion and reduces dopamine release in the lateral nucleus accumbens through α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on an inhibitory brainstem input. Suppressing this input to dopamine neurons prevents the reduction of dopamine release and behavioral aversion to nicotine.

                The alignment of chromosomes at the spindle midplane is important for their accurate segregation. Risteski et al. link chromosome alignment with poleward flux by showing that longer kinetochore fibers slide faster than their shorter sister fibers. This tug-of-war between sister kinetochore fibers arises from lateral interactions with bridging microtubules.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Emergence of sex-specific transcriptomes in a sexually dimorphic brain nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Friedrich et al. demonstrate extensive transcriptomic sex differences underlying the sexually dimorphic development of vocal nucleus RA in the songbird brain. They find sex-specific gene regulation linked to distinct biological processes, developmental shifts in the relative signal from sex chromosome to autosomal genes, and evidence of female-biased pro-apoptotic regulatory networks.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Medulloblastoma group 3 and 4 tumors comprise a clinically and biologically significant expression continuum reflecting human cerebellar development</a></h4>

              
                The childhood brain tumor medulloblastoma is classified into multiple DNA methylation-based subtypes. Using RNA-seq, Williamson et al. show that group 3 and group 4 tumors manifest as intermediates on a transcriptomic continuum. Position on the continuum is associated with molecular pathology and disease course. The continuum mirrors early cerebellar development, implicating cells of origin.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">SARS-CoV-2 Spike N-Terminal Domain modulates TMPRSS2-dependent viral entry and fusogenicity</a></h4>

              
                Meng et al. report that the NTD allosterically modulates S1/S2 cleavage and spike-mediated functions such as entry and cell-cell fusion in a spike context-dependent manner. These data may explain the lack of dominant SARS-CoV-2 inter-variant recombinants bearing breakpoints within spike.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory pathology in COVID-19 hamsters after TH2-biased immunization</a></h4>

              
                Ebenig et al. report vaccine associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters previously immunized with a suboptimal vaccine consisting of misfolded SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Alum-adjuvants. VAERD correlated with dysregulation of specific immune cell subsets in the lungs and could be alleviated by dexamethasone treatment.
