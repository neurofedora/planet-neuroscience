                Vaccine rollouts have been underway to combat the COVID-19 pandemic globally. Based on ongoing interviews with ten primary care physicians ‘in the field’, this paper elucidates how in practice the vaccinations were carried out in Japan in 2021. We examine what the primary care physicians did to prepare for the rollouts, what problems they faced, and how they responded to these problems. Large-scale vaccination projects are supposed to proceed smoothly and quickly, or to have what Anna Tsing calls ‘scalability’. In practice, however, they required a variety of tasks for coordination, information sharing, and promotion. Despite feeling stressed by the lack of information and exhausted by the work overload, the primary care physicians carried out the vaccinations as an important service to their patients and communities. The findings of this paper will provide valuable materials for improving future vaccine rollouts.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Seizures are a frequent symptom of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs). However, the brain regions responsible for these seizures remain unclear. To identify the brain regions causally involved in bAVM-related seizures, we retrospectively reviewed 220 patients with unruptured bAVMs. Using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) analyses, we tested whether individual brain regions were associated with unruptured bAVM-related seizures. The result revealed that unruptured bAVMs causing seizures are anatomically heterogeneous at the voxel level. Subsequently, lesion network mapping (LNM) analyses was performed to determine whether bAVMs causing seizures belonged to a distributed brain network. LNM analyses indicated that these lesions were located in a functional network characterized by connectivity to the left caudate and precuneus. Moreover, the discrimination performance of the identified seizure network was evaluated in discovery set by calculating the individualized network damage score and was tested in validation set. Based on the calculated network damage scores, patients were divided into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups. The prevalence of seizures significantly differed among the three risk categories in both discovery (<i>p</i> = .003) and validation set (<i>p</i> = .004). Finally, we calculated the percentage of voxels in the canonical resting-state networks that overlapped with the seizure-susceptible brain regions to investigate the involvement of resting-state networks. With an involvement percentage over 50%, the frontoparietal control (82.9%), limbic function (76.7%), and default mode network (69.3%) were considered to be impacted in bAVM-related seizures. Our study identified the seizure-susceptible brain regions for unruptured bAVMs, which could be a plausible neuroimaging biomarker in predicting possible seizures.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">New insights into anatomical connectivity along the anterior–posterior axis of the human hippocampus using in vivo quantitative fibre tracking</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus supports multiple cognitive functions including episodic memory. Recent work has highlighted functional differences along the anterior–posterior axis of the human hippocampus, but the neuroanatomical underpinnings of these differences remain unclear. We leveraged track-density imaging to systematically examine anatomical connectivity between the cortical mantle and the anterior–posterior axis of the <i>in vivo</i> human hippocampus. We first identified the most highly connected cortical areas and detailed the degree to which they preferentially connect along the anterior–posterior axis of the hippocampus. Then, using a tractography pipeline specifically tailored to measure the location and density of streamline endpoints within the hippocampus, we characterised where these cortical areas preferentially connect within the hippocampus. Our results provide new and detailed insights into how specific regions along the anterior–posterior axis of the hippocampus are associated with different cortical inputs/outputs and provide evidence that both gradients and circumscribed areas of dense extrinsic anatomical connectivity exist within the human hippocampus. These findings inform conceptual debates in the field and emphasise the importance of considering the hippocampus as a heterogeneous structure. Overall, our results represent a major advance in our ability to map the anatomical connectivity of the human hippocampus <i>in vivo</i> and inform our understanding of the neural architecture of hippocampal-dependent memory systems in the human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glutathione in the nucleus accumbens regulates motivation to exert reward-incentivized effort</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence is implicating mitochondrial function and metabolism in the nucleus accumbens in motivated performance. However, the brain is vulnerable to excessive oxidative insults resulting from neurometabolic processes, and whether antioxidant levels in the nucleus accumbens contribute to motivated performance is not known. Here, we identify a critical role for glutathione (GSH), the most important endogenous antioxidant in the brain, in motivation. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at ultra-high field in both male humans and rodent populations, we establish that higher accumbal GSH levels are highly predictive of better, and particularly, steady performance over time in effort-related tasks. Causality was established in <i>in vivo</i> experiments in rats that, first, showed that downregulating GSH levels through micro-injections of the GSH synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine in the nucleus accumbens impaired effort-based reward-incentivized performance. In addition, systemic treatment with the GSH precursor N-acetyl-cysteine increased accumbal GSH levels in rats and led to improved performance, potentially mediated by a cell-type-specific shift in glutamatergic inputs to accumbal medium spiny neurons. Our data indicate a close association between accumbal GSH levels and an individual’s capacity to exert reward-incentivized effort over time. They also suggest that improvement of accumbal antioxidant function may be a feasible approach to boost motivation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gene interaction perturbation network deciphers a high-resolution taxonomy in colorectal cancer</a></h4>

              
                Molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer (CRC) are currently identified via the snapshot transcriptional profiles, largely ignoring the dynamic changes of gene expressions. Conversely, biological networks remain relatively stable irrespective of time and condition. Here, we introduce an individual-specific gene interaction perturbation network-based (GIN) approach and identify six GIN subtypes (GINS1-6) with distinguishing features: (i) GINS1 (proliferative, 24%~34%), elevated proliferative activity, high tumor purity, immune-desert, <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations, and immunotherapeutic resistance; (ii) GINS2 (stromal-rich, 14%~22%), abundant fibroblasts, immune-suppressed, stem-cell-like, <i>SMAD4</i> mutations, unfavorable prognosis, high potential of recurrence and metastasis, immunotherapeutic resistance, and sensitive to fluorouracil-based chemotherapy; (iii) GINS3 (<i>KRAS</i>-inactivated, 13%~20%), high tumor purity, immune-desert, activation of <i>EGFR</i> and ephrin receptors, chromosomal instability (CIN), fewer <i>KRAS</i> mutations, <i>SMOC1</i> methylation, immunotherapeutic resistance, and sensitive to cetuximab and bevacizumab; (iv) GINS4 (mixed, 10%~19%), moderate level of stromal and immune activities, transit-amplifying-like, and <i>TMEM106A</i> methylation; (v) GINS5 (immune-activated, 12%~24%), stronger immune activation, plentiful tumor mutation and neoantigen burden, microsatellite instability and high CpG island methylator phenotype, <i>BRAF</i> mutations, favorable prognosis, and sensitive to immunotherapy and <i>PARP</i> inhibitors; (vi) GINS6, (metabolic, 5%~8%), accumulated fatty acids, enterocyte-like, and <i>BMP</i> activity. Overall, the novel high-resolution taxonomy derived from an interactome perspective could facilitate more effective management of CRC patients.

                Background: The identification of differentially expressed genes and their associated biological processes, molecular function, and cellular components are important for genetic diseases studies because they present potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Methods: In this study, we developed an o²S²PARC template representing an interactive pipeline for the gene expression data visualization and ontologies data analysis and visualization.  To demonstrate the usefulness of the tool, we performed a case study on a publicly available dataset. Results: The tool enables users to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and visualize them in a volcano plot format. The ontologies associated with the DEGs are determined and visualized in barplots. Conclusions: The “Expression data visualization” template is publicly available on the o²S²PARC platform.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Professional qualifications of medical affairs pharmaceutical physicians and other internal stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Medical affairs pharmaceutical physicians (MAPPs) have unique value to pharmaceutical companies due to their accountability for activities that benefit regulators, payors, prescribers and patients. This study assessed whether MAPPs’ specialist training and education in pharmaceutical medicine could account for this level of value by determining whether there was significant variation in education and training between MAPPs and other internal stakeholders of pharmaceutical companies. Methods: A systematic search of LinkedIn profiles from the 10 pharmaceutical companies by revenue was conducted between June and October 2021. Job title and type and year of undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications were extracted. A one-sided Mann-Whitney test assessed for differences in the total number of qualifications between MAPPs and other internal stakeholders involved in medical affairs using MAPPs as the reference group. Other internal stakeholders included medical affairs pharmacists (MAPharm), other medical affairs professionals (MAOth), and market access (MAcc), commercial (COmm) and sales professionals. Sub-group analysis determined differences in undergraduate and postgraduate education. Results: In total, 524 profiles were included. Compared to all other internal stakeholders, MAPPs had a significantly higher number of undergraduate (p < 0.001) and postgraduate (MAPharm, p = 0.003; MAOth, p = 0.004; MAcc, COmm and Sales, p < 0.001) qualifications. Additionally, MAPPs had a significantly longer time to industry than other internal stakeholders apart from MAPharm. Of those with clinical qualifications, MAPPs were almost twice as likely to have business qualifications. Conclusions: Of all internal stakeholders, MAPPs had the highest number of qualifications and the best match between expertise and the contextual demands of decision-makers in the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical companies in the UK can use these findings to clarify role boundaries and decision-making power based on the nature and level of expertise of each internal stakeholder.

                Background: Benzodiazepines and antidepressants are known to alter responses to empathic pain when used alone, however the effects of their combined use on the perspective-taking facet of empathy are unknown. In order to examine the effects of concomitant benzodiazepines and antidepressants long-term use on perspective-taking, we analyzed behavioral and neural changes on perspective-taking ability using event-related potentials. Methods: To this purpose, 13 long-term concomitant benzodiazepines and antidepressants users and 13 healthy controls performed a task designed to assess affective perspective-taking with simultaneous EEG recording. Results: The behavioral results revealed similar performance between groups. The neural results showed no significant differences between groups for the N170 and late positive potential (LPP) components. These results seem to suggest that long-term use of benzodiazepines and antidepressants together does not affect perspective-taking abilities nor the processing of related information. Conclusions: The concomitant benzodiazepines and antidepressants long-term use seem to preserve the perspective-taking ability of social cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness, survival and safety of guselkumab attending to basal characteristics in moderate-to-severe psoriatic patients: a cohort study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease which can impact quality of life. In the past decade multiple biologic treatments have been released with encouraging results. Guselkumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-23p19. Multiple randomized clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy in psoriasis, but response differences among patient subpopulations have not been extensively reported. Furthermore, patients in real life are often non-eligible for clinical trials and their responses may differ from pivotal studies. Methods: This is a retrospective, observational study of real clinical practice of patients receiving guselkumab treatment in Spain. Patients treated with guselkumab were included between February 2019 to December 2021. This study evaluates the potential differential effect of baseline demographic and disease characteristics on therapeutic responses to guselkumab. We measured effectiveness and survival by the psoriasis area and severity index, the dermatology life quality index as well as Kaplan meier curves, respectively. Categorical and quantitative variables are reported with frequencies, and with mean and standard deviation, respectively. Differences between groups in psoriasis area and severity index and dermatology life quality index, were calculated using a mixed-effects analysis. Survival was calculated using Kaplan meier curves and log-rank tests. Results: A total of 87 patients were included. In this study, our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and survival of guselkumab attending to demographic characteristics. No differences in psoriasis area and severity index or dermatology life quality index baseline values or therapeutic responses were noted at 52 weeks of follow-up among all the subgroups analysed (age, sex, psoriasis duration, body mass index, and comorbidities). A difference in drug survival was only seen between gender groups. Conclusions: Our research has demonstrated the consistency of guselkumab effectiveness across patient subgroups. No baseline features affected the effectiveness or drug survival of guselkumab, except for lower drug survival in female patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Changes in mammography screening in Ontario and Alberta following national guideline dissemination: an interrupted time series analysis [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In November 2011, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care released guidelines for screening women at average breast cancer risk. Weak recommendations (framed using GRADE methodology) were made for screening women aged 50 to 74 years every two to three years, and for not screening women aged 40 to 49 years. Methods: We conducted an interrupted time series analysis using administrative data to examine bilateral mammography use before and after a release of a national breast screening guideline. Women aged 40 to 74 years living in Ontario or Alberta from 30th November 2008 to 30th November 2014 were included. Strata included age, region of residence, neighbourhood income quintile, immigration status, and education level. Results: In both provinces, mammography use rates were lower in the post-intervention period (527 vs. 556 and 428 vs. 465/1000 women in Ontario and Alberta, respectively). In Ontario, mammography trends decreased following guideline release to align with recommendations for women aged 40 to 74 (decrease of 2.21/1000 women, SE 0.26/1000, p<0.0001). In Alberta, mammography trends decreased for women aged 40 to 49 years (3/1000 women, SE 0.32, p<0.001) and 50 to 69 (2.9/1000 women, SE 0.79, p<0.001), but did not change for women aged 70 to 74 (0.7/1000 women, SE 1.23, p=0.553). In both provinces, trends in mammography use rates were sustained for up to three years after guideline release. Conclusions: We observed a decrease in screening for women aged 40-49. Additional research to explore whether shared decision making was used to optimize guideline-concordant screening for women aged 50-74 is needed.

                Background: Indonesia's decentralization policy adopted in 1999 had implications for the programs of national ministries and agencies, including the family planning program. Since 1999, there has been a "relaxation in family planning program effort" since many districts have a low commitment to family planning. The trend of contraceptive mix in Indonesia leading to hormonal methods, especially injections, has occurred since 2007. This study aimed to describe the mixed conditions of contraception in Indonesia from 1997 to 2012 and explore the link between the availability of facilities and infrastructure with this plan. Methods: The quantitative research used was a cross-sectional design using secondary data from the Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS), and In-depth interviews were employed as the qualitative approach in this study. It was found based on the results of the quantitative analysis that the trend of contraceptive mix tilted to the injection method. Results: The qualitative study results indicate that the contraceptive mix is affected by infrastructure as the main factor. Conclusion: In conclusion, there is a close relationship between the decentralization policy and the condition of the contraceptive mix. Thus, it is recommended that the central and local governments re-prioritize family planning programs and assure the availability of supporting facilities and infrastructure.

                Background: This article examines how current jurists can deal with a juristic division of the world into abode of "Islam” and “infidelity". The success with which jurists re-evaluate this dichotomy will have major impacts on how an Islamic state interacts with non-Muslim governments on the one hand, and Muslims residing temporarily or permanently in a non-Muslim territory on the other. Methods: Here, an attempt made to review the concepts of Dar Al-Islam and Dar Al-Harb from two perspectives: that of the dialectical limits and liberalization, as discussed in secondary material such as books, research articles, and reports. Results: this paper has explored and discussed the criteria for identifying Dar Al-Islam and Dar Al-Harb in Islamic jurisprudence. Conclusions: This article analyzes the various arguments put forward to establish new ways of peaceful coexisting and maintaining healthy international connections.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Systems Biology in ELIXIR: modelling in the spotlight [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In this white paper, we describe the founding of a new ELIXIR Community - the Systems Biology Community - and its proposed future contributions to both ELIXIR and the broader community of systems biologists in Europe and worldwide. The Community believes that the infrastructure aspects of systems biology - databases, (modelling) tools and standards development, as well as training and access to cloud infrastructure - are not only appropriate components of the ELIXIR infrastructure, but will prove key components of ELIXIR’s future support of advanced biological applications and personalised medicine. By way of a series of meetings, the Community identified seven key areas for its future activities, reflecting both future needs and previous and current activities within ELIXIR Platforms and Communities. These are: overcoming barriers to the wider uptake of systems biology; linking new and existing data to systems biology models; interoperability of systems biology resources; further development and embedding of systems medicine; provisioning of modelling as a service; building and coordinating capacity building and training resources; and supporting industrial embedding of systems biology. A set of objectives for the Community has been identified under four main headline areas: Standardisation and Interoperability, Technology, Capacity Building and Training, and Industrial Embedding. These are grouped into short-term (3-year), mid-term (6-year) and long-term (10-year) objectives.

                In constant degradation of conventional sources and shifting fuel costs, has prompted research into alternate power generating options in recent years. A substantial study has been conducted in the literature to properly harvest power from green energy resources. This publication aims to provide a quick assessment of various PV Performance Characteristics on different factors (such as varying irradiation, temperature, parallel & series connection, tilt angle, shading, environment impact, and different type of PV modules), to bring all of the research activities in this field under one tent. This work resulted that the efficiency and performance of the PV system are greatly affected by module temperature, irradiation, shadow, and tilt angle. Hence, each of the characteristics of the solar PV module has been examined critically with reasons, remedies, and techniques applied. Finally, a concise review with enumerated data has been presented which lightened the pathway for new researchers working in Solar Photovoltaics.

                Background Sjögren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and inflammation of the exocrine glands, especially the lacrimal and salivary glands. Moringa oleifera (MO) leaves are rich in polyphenols and flavonoids which have antioxidant activity which is also shown when extracted with ethanol. This study aimed to probe the effect of Moringa oleifera leaf extract on malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-17 (IL-17), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and caspase-3 levels and salivary gland damage in Sjögren's syndrome mice model. Methods Thirty-two samples were divided into four treatment groups: 200 mg/kg BW MO-ethanol leaf extracts with 1.23 mg/kg BW dexamethasone group (T2), 1.23 mg/kg BW dexamethasone alone group (T1), normal control group/C- (without induction of Ro antigen (SSA) and extract of MO-ethanol), and negative group/C+ (with induction of Ro antigen (SSA) on day 42). MDA, IL-17, MMP-9, and caspase-3 levels and salivary gland epithelium damage (histopathological changes) were measured 14 days post-Ro antigen (SSA) induction. The method used to measure MDA level was Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substance (TBARS) while IL-7 and MMP-9 were ELISA. Some of the salivary gland was used for histological preparations using the paraffin method withoud Harris Hematoxylin–Eosin (HE) staining. Then for the examination of caspase-3, we used the standard procedure of immunohistochemically staining. The salivary gland epithelium damage examination used the HE staining of histological preparation. Results There were significant differences in MDA, IL-17, MMP-9, and caspase-3 levels in the group given a 200 mg/kg BW dose of MO-ethanol leaf extract compared to the control group. The administration of the extract also significantly reduced the degree of necrosis of the salivary gland epithelium. Conclusions Moringa oleifera leaf extract reduced MDA, IL-17, MMP9, and caspase-3 levels and salivary epithelial damage.

                Background: Angiosarcoma is a rare soft-tissue sarcoma that can arise in any soft-tissue structure or viscera. Only individual case reports and small series of gastrointestinal angiosarcoma have been reported in the literature. In this paper, we report the first African case of small intestine epithelioid angiosarcoma. Case report: Here, we present the case of a 66-year-old man who presented with melena and anemia. Physical examination showed the presence of two subcutaneous masses on the right and left flanks. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, duodenoscopy and jejunoscopy revealed multiple purpuric and hemorrhagic nodules and masses, some of which were bleeding. Pathological study of the ampullary formation and of a subcutaneous nodule concluded to the diagnosis of epithelioid angiosarcoma. Blood transfusions and interventional endoscopy by argan plasma coagulation were required due to a continued drop in hemoglobin. A drop in hemoglobin persisted and the patient died within 10 days. Conclusions: Angiosarcoma has a very poor prognosis due to delayed prognosis and insufficient therapeutic management. Interventional endoscopy to control bleeding can be considered in localized forms. Chemotherapy may help to prolong survival in metastatic and disseminated angiosarcoma. Further studies should be conducted to improve the prognosis.

Accurate epidemiological models require parameter estimates that account for mobility patterns and social network structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of probabilistic programming for parameter inference in these models. We consider an agent-based simulation that represents mobility networks as degree-corrected stochastic block models, whose parameters we estimate from cell phone co-location data. We then use probabilistic program inference methods to approximate the distribution over disease transmission parameters conditioned on reported cases and deaths. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting models improve the quality of fit in multiple geographies relative to baselines that do not model network topology.

                <p>by Arisa H. Oda, Miki Tamura, Kunihiko Kaneko, Kunihiro Ohta, Tetsuhiro S. Hatakeyama</p>

Cellular adaptation to stressful environments such as starvation is essential to the survival of microbial communities, but the uniform response of the cell community may lead to entire cell death or severe damage to their fitness. Here, we demonstrate an elaborate response of the yeast community against glucose depletion, in which the first adapted cells kill the latecomer cells. During glucose depletion, yeast cells release autotoxins, such as leucic acid and L-2keto-3methylvalerate, which can even kill the clonal cells of the ones producing them. Although these autotoxins were likely to induce mass suicide, some cells differentiated to adapt to the autotoxins without genetic changes. If nondifferentiated latecomers tried to invade the habitat, autotoxins damaged or killed the latecomers, but the differentiated cells could selectively survive. Phylogenetically distant fission and budding yeast shared this behavior using the same autotoxins, suggesting that latecomer killing may be the universal system of intercellular communication, which may be relevant to the evolutional transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms.

                <p>by Matthew S. J. Mangan, Friederike Gorki, Karoline Krause, Alexander Heinz, Anne Pankow, Thomas Ebert, Dieter Jahn, Karsten Hiller, Veit Hornung, Marcus Maurer, Florian I. Schmidt, Ralf Gerhard, Eicke Latz</p>

Pyrin is a cytosolic immune sensor that nucleates an inflammasome in response to inhibition of RhoA by bacterial virulence factors, triggering the release of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β. Gain-of-function mutations in the <i>MEFV</i> gene encoding Pyrin cause autoinflammatory disorders, such as familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and Pyrin-associated autoinflammation with neutrophilic dermatosis (PAAND). To precisely define the role of Pyrin in pathogen detection in human immune cells, we compared initiation and regulation of the Pyrin inflammasome response in monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM). Unlike human monocytes and murine macrophages, we determined that hMDM failed to activate Pyrin in response to known Pyrin activators <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> (<i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i>) toxins A or B (TcdA or TcdB), as well as the bile acid analogue BAA-473. The Pyrin inflammasome response was enabled in hMDM by prolonged priming with either LPS or type I or II interferons and required an increase in Pyrin expression. Notably, FMF mutations lifted the requirement for prolonged priming for Pyrin activation in hMDM, enabling Pyrin activation in the absence of additional inflammatory signals. Unexpectedly, in the absence of a Pyrin response, we found that TcdB activated the NLRP3 inflammasome in hMDM These data demonstrate that regulation of Pyrin activation in hMDM diverges from monocytes and highlights its dysregulation in FMF.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Military health and performance optimization: a circadian strategy in response to governmental policies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In 2017, USS Fitzgerald and USS John S. McCain, both guided-missile destroyers, experienced underway collisions that resulted in the deaths of 17 Sailors and degradation of national defense as two warships were removed from the frontline. This incident garnered Congress’ attention leading to numerous fatigue management policies and working groups instituted at various levels across the Department of Defense. One policy of the Department of the Navy (3120.2A; Dec 11, 2020) specifically addressed risk mitigation factors for maritime operations occurring in the overnight and early morning hours around the circadian nadir or trough in alertness and vigilance. Despite these circadian challenges that come with mission demands of military service, there are many opportunities as outlined in the Department of Navy policy to reduce and/or eliminate the performance-related risks associated with circadian misalignment. In regard to actionable systems and processes aligned with these policies, the first step is to perform a risk assessment to identify circadian-related problems that could arise in response to conducting the military training exercise or operation. The second step is to integrate a means to monitor 24-hour physiology, mitigate performance risk through fatigue countermeasures, and/or re-align the circadian timing system of military personnel to enhance sleep, manage fatigue, and optimize performance. Most importantly, the approach is not a one size fits all. Each military operation will require unique adaption (re-alignment) to the environment and each military operation may require a unique countermeasure(s).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Estimating the sample size of sham-controlled randomized controlled trials using existing evidence [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the power is often ‘reverse engineered’ based on the number of participants that can realistically be achieved. An attractive alternative is planning a new trial conditional on the available evidence; a design of particular interest in RCTs that use a sham control arm (sham-RCTs). Methods: We explore the design of sham-RCTs, the role of sequential meta-analysis and  conditional planning in a systematic review of renal sympathetic denervation for patients with arterial hypertension. The main efficacy endpoint was mean change in 24-hour systolic blood pressure. We performed sequential meta-analysis to identify the time point where the null hypothesis would be rejected in a prospective scenario. Evidence-based conditional sample size calculations were performed based on fixed-effect meta-analysis. Results: In total, six sham-RCTs (981 participants) were identified. The first RCT was considerably larger (535 participants) than those subsequently published (median sample size of 80). All trial sample sizes were calculated assuming an unrealistically large intervention effect which resulted in low power when each study is considered as a stand-alone experiment. Sequential meta-analysis provided firm evidence against the null hypothesis with the synthesis of the first four trials (755 patients, cumulative mean difference -2.75 (95%CI -4.93 to -0.58) favoring the active intervention)). Conditional planning resulted in much larger sample sizes compared to those in the original trials, due to overoptimistic expected effects made by the investigators in individual trials, and potentially a time-effect association. Conclusions: Sequential meta-analysis of sham-RCTs can reach conclusive findings earlier and hence avoid exposing patients to sham-related risks. Conditional planning of new sham-RCTs poses important challenges as many surgical/minimally invasive procedures improve over time, the intervention effect is expected to increase in new studies and this violates the underlying assumptions. Unless this is accounted for, conditional planning will not improve the design of sham-RCTs.

                Background: Drinking coffee is known to have both positive and negative aftermath on periodontal health. The current study is aiming to systematically review the impact of coffee consumption on periodontal health status. Methods: An article search was carried out in two electronic databases (PUBMED and Web of Sciences). All type of experimental and observational studies were included. The assessment of the included articles were conducted using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool. Data were analyzed qualitatively. Result: A total of 10 articles were included in this study. Most (5) of the studies discovered a negative correlation between coffee intake and periodontal health, while 4 other studies found the protective effect of daily coffee consumption against alveolar bone loss. Last, only one study found that coffee intake did not relate with periodontitis. Conclusion: The effect of coffee consumption on periodontal health was fragmented since coffee has complex components that may give either beneficial effects or negative impact on periodontal health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Risk factors and housing effect on malaria infection: A case-control study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study aims to demonstrate the different risk factors between low and high endemicity area and housing effect on malaria infection. Methods: This study is a case-control study with a ratio of 1:2 comparing low (Jambi) and high (Sumba) endemicity areas. Initial screening of malaria was done to assign cases and controls following inclusion criteria. The selected cases and controls were then assessed with a structured questionnaire in relation to risk factors of malaria infection. Additionally, to discover the impact of house type on malaria infection, a total of 72 houses was observed in a series of six weeks (between 28 June and 12 August 2018) human landing catch (HLC) observations that includes three types of houses; malaria, non-malaria, and permanent dwellings. The HLC was done indoors and outdoors for each house type each night. A weekly screening was taken to monitor the malaria infection rate of each house type. Results: Jambi and Sumba shared several similar individual and environmental risk factors. However, agricultural activity or visiting forestry areas is a protective factor for malaria infection in Jambi but is a risk factor in Sumba. The general linear mixed univariate model result indicates the difference in risk factor variables between Jambi and Sumba. The entomological survey found that only malaria houses significantly differed in the number of means collected mosquitoes compared with the other type of houses. Weekly screening found that the incidence rate of malaria houses is highest among others. Conclusion: The risk factors are inevitably crucial for malaria prevention strategy. Risk factor management needs to consider the location where the endemicity level may differ for each risk factor, and housing improvement is not a proper strategy before controlling other environmental factors.

                Background: One of the most common gastrointestinal diseases is gastric ulcer (GU). The ethanolic extract from the aerial part of Zinnia elegans was created to test its ability to protect the gastric mucosa from damage caused by ethanol in mice. Method: Zinnia elegans ethanolic extract was administrated intragastrically once daily for three days. After the final intragastric dose, gastric ulcer in mice was created on the third day using 70% ethanol. The stomach tissues were extracted to assess the severity of the gastric mucosal changes. Results: Orally administered Zinnia elegans ethanolic extract reduced the severity of stomach mucosal changes. In addition, the levels of tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), interleukin-1B (IL‐1β), and tool-like receptor (TLR4) activity in stomach tissues were all dramatically reduced after oral administration of the extract. These findings demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory properties of Zinnia elegans ethanolic extract protect against ethanol-induced stomach mucosal damage in mice. Conclusions: The results of this investigation offer some support for the creation of new treatments for stomach ulcers as an alternative to treating gastric damage brought on by alcohol consumption.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A connectomics-based taxonomy of mammals</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian taxonomies are conventionally defined by morphological traits and genetics. How species differ in terms of neural circuits and whether inter-species differences in neural circuit organization conform to these taxonomies is unknown. The main obstacle for the comparison of neural architectures have been differences in network reconstruction techniques, yielding species-specific connectomes that are not directly comparable to one another. Here we comprehensively chart connectome organization across the mammalian phylogenetic spectrum using a common reconstruction protocol. We analyze the mammalian MRI (MaMI) data set, a database that encompasses high-resolution ex vivo structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 124 species across 12 taxonomic orders and 5 superorders, collected using a unified MRI protocol. We assess similarity between species connectomes using two methods: similarity of Laplacian eigenspectra and similarity of multiscale topological features. We find greater inter-species similarities among species within the same taxonomic order, suggesting that connectome organization reflects established taxonomic relationships defined by morphology and genetics. While all connectomes retain hallmark global features and relative proportions of connection classes, inter-species variation is driven by local regional connectivity profiles. By encoding connectomes into a common frame of reference, these findings establish a foundation for investigating how neural circuits change over phylogeny, forging a link from genes to circuits to behaviour.

                Our current economic and political structures have an increasingly devastating impact on the Earth’s climate and ecosystems: we are facing a biospheric emergency, with catastrophic consequences for both humans and the natural world on which we depend. Life scientists – including biologists, medical scientists, psychologists and public health experts – have had a crucial role in documenting the impacts of this emergency, but they have failed to drive governments to take action in order to prevent the situation from getting worse. Here we, as members of the movement Scientist Rebellion, call on life scientists to re-embrace advocacy and activism – which were once hallmarks of academia – in order to highlight the urgency and necessity of systemic change across our societies. We particularly emphasise the need for scientists to engage in nonviolent civil resistance, a form of public engagement which has proven to be highly effective in social struggles throughout history.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contrasting effects of Ksr2, an obesity gene, on trabecular bone volume and bone marrow adiposity</a></h4>

              
                Pathological obesity and its complications are associated with an increased propensity for bone fractures. Humans with certain genetic polymorphisms at the kinase suppressor of ras2 (KSR2) locus develop severe early-onset obesity and type 2 diabetes. Both conditions are phenocopied in mice with <i>Ksr2</i> deleted, but whether this affects bone health remains unknown. Here we studied the bones of global <i>Ksr2</i> null mice and found that <i>Ksr2</i> negatively regulates femoral, but not vertebral, bone mass in two genetic backgrounds, while the paralogous gene, <i>Ksr1</i>, was dispensable for bone homeostasis. Mechanistically, KSR2 regulates bone formation by influencing adipocyte differentiation at the expense of osteoblasts in the bone marrow. Compared with <i>Ksr2</i>’s known role as a regulator of feeding by its function in the hypothalamus, pair-feeding and osteoblast-specific conditional deletion of <i>Ksr2</i> reveals that <i>Ksr2</i> can regulate bone formation autonomously. Despite the gains in appendicular bone mass observed in the absence of <i>Ksr2</i>, bone strength, as well as fracture healing response, remains compromised in these mice. This study highlights the interrelationship between adiposity and bone health and provides mechanistic insights into how <i>Ksr2</i>, an adiposity and diabetic gene, regulates bone metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Super-resolution imaging uncovers the nanoscopic segregation of polarity proteins in epithelia</a></h4>

              
                Epithelial tissues acquire their integrity and function through the apico-basal polarization of their constituent cells. Proteins of the PAR and Crumbs complexes are pivotal to epithelial polarization, but the mechanistic understanding of polarization is challenging to reach, largely because numerous potential interactions between these proteins and others have been found, without a clear hierarchy in importance. We identify the regionalized and segregated organization of members of the PAR and Crumbs complexes at epithelial apical junctions by imaging endogenous proteins using STED microscopy on Caco-2 cells, and human and murine intestinal samples. Proteins organize in submicrometric clusters, with PAR3 overlapping with the tight junction (TJ) while PALS1-PATJ and aPKC-PAR6β form segregated clusters that are apical of the TJ and present in an alternated pattern related to actin organization. CRB3A is also apical of the TJ and partially overlaps with other polarity proteins. Of the numerous potential interactions identified between polarity proteins, only PALS1-PATJ and aPKC-PAR6β are spatially relevant in the junctional area of mature epithelial cells, simplifying our view of how polarity proteins could cooperate to drive and maintain cell polarity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">T cell deficiency precipitates antibody evasion and emergence of neurovirulent polyomavirus</a></h4>

              
                JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a life-threatening brain disease in immunocompromised patients. Inherited and acquired T cell deficiencies are associated with PML. The incidence of PML is increasing with the introduction of new immunomodulatory agents, several of which target T cells or B cells. PML patients often carry mutations in the JCPyV VP1 capsid protein, which confer resistance to neutralizing VP1 antibodies (Ab). Polyomaviruses (PyV) are tightly species-specific; the absence of tractable animal models has handicapped understanding PyV pathogenesis. Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we found that T cell deficiency during persistent infection, in the setting of monospecific VP1 Ab, was required for outgrowth of VP1 Ab-escape viral variants. CD4 T cells were primarily responsible for limiting polyomavirus infection in the kidney, a major reservoir of persistent infection by both JCPyV and MuPyV, and checking emergence of these mutant viruses. T cells also provided a second line of defense by controlling the outgrowth of VP1 mutant viruses that evaded Ab neutralization. A virus with two capsid mutations, one conferring Ab-escape yet impaired infectivity and a second compensatory mutation, yielded a highly neurovirulent variant. These findings link T cell deficiency and evolution of Ab-escape polyomavirus VP1 variants with neuropathogenicity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Complementary evolution of coding and noncoding sequence underlies mammalian hairlessness</a></h4>

              
                Body hair is a defining mammalian characteristic, but several mammals, such as whales, naked mole-rats, and humans, have notably less hair than others. To find the genetic basis of reduced hair quantity, we used our evolutionary-rates-based method, RERconverge, to identify coding and noncoding sequences that evolve at significantly different rates in so-called hairless mammals compared to hairy mammals. Using RERconverge, we performed a genome-wide scan over 62 mammal species using 19,149 genes and 343,598 conserved noncoding regions to find genetic elements that evolve at significantly different rates in hairless mammals compared to hairy mammals. We show that these rate shifts resulted from relaxation of evolutionary constraint on hair-related sequences in hairless species. In addition to detecting known and potential novel hair-related genes, we also discovered hundreds of putative hair-related regulatory elements. Computational investigation revealed that genes and their associated noncoding regions show different evolutionary patterns and influence different aspects of hair growth and development. Many genes under accelerated evolution are associated with the structure of the hair shaft itself, while evolutionary rate shifts in noncoding regions also included the dermal papilla and matrix regions of the hair follicle that contribute to hair growth and cycling. Genes that were top-ranked for coding sequence acceleration included known hair and skin genes <i>KRT2</i>, <i>KRT35</i>, <i>PKP1</i>, and <i>PTPRM</i> that surprisingly showed no signals of evolutionary rate shifts in nearby noncoding regions. Conversely, accelerated noncoding regions are most strongly enriched near regulatory hair-related genes and microRNAs, such as <i>mir205</i>, <i>ELF3</i>, and <i>FOXC1</i>, that themselves do not show rate shifts in their protein-coding sequences. Such dichotomy highlights the interplay between the evolution of protein sequence and regulatory sequence to contribute to the emergence of a convergent phenotype.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sonic hedgehog-dependent recruitment of GABAergic interneurons into the developing visual thalamus</a></h4>

              
                Axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) play critical roles in the development of inhibitory circuits in visual thalamus. We previously reported that RGC axons signal astrocytes to induce the expression of fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15), a motogen required for GABAergic interneuron migration into visual thalamus. However, how retinal axons induce thalamic astrocytes to generate <i>Fgf15</i> and influence interneuron migration remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that impairing RGC activity had little impact on interneuron recruitment into mouse visual thalamus. Instead, our data show that retinal-derived sonic hedgehog (SHH) is essential for interneuron recruitment. Specifically, we show that thalamus-projecting RGCs express SHH and thalamic astrocytes generate downstream components of SHH signaling. Deletion of RGC-derived SHH leads to a significant decrease in <i>Fgf15</i> expression, as well as in the percentage of interneurons recruited into visual thalamus. Overall, our findings identify a morphogen-dependent neuron–astrocyte signaling mechanism essential for the migration of thalamic interneurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ultrafast simulation of large-scale neocortical microcircuitry with biophysically realistic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the activity of the mammalian brain requires an integrative knowledge of circuits at distinct scales, ranging from ion channel gating to circuit connectomics. Computational models are regularly employed to understand how multiple parameters contribute synergistically to circuit behavior. However, traditional models of anatomically and biophysically realistic neurons are computationally demanding, especially when scaled to model local circuits. To overcome this limitation, we trained several artificial neural network (ANN) architectures to model the activity of realistic multicompartmental cortical neurons. We identified an ANN architecture that accurately predicted subthreshold activity and action potential firing. The ANN could correctly generalize to previously unobserved synaptic input, including in models containing nonlinear dendritic properties. When scaled, processing times were orders of magnitude faster compared with traditional approaches, allowing for rapid parameter-space mapping in a circuit model of Rett syndrome. Thus, we present a novel ANN approach allowing for rapid, detailed network experiments using inexpensive and commonly available computational resources.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Whole-brain comparison of rodent and human brains using spatial transcriptomics</a></h4>

              
                The ever-increasing use of mouse models in preclinical neuroscience research calls for an improvement in the methods used to translate findings between mouse and human brains. Previously we showed that the brains of primates can be compared in a direct quantitative manner using a common reference space built from white matter tractography data (Rogier B. Mars et al., 2018b). Here we extend the common space approach to evaluate the similarity of mouse and human brain regions using openly accessible brain-wide transcriptomic data sets. We show that mouse-human homologous genes capture broad patterns of neuroanatomical organization, but that the resolution of cross-species correspondences can be improved using a novel supervised machine learning approach. Using this method, we demonstrate that sensorimotor subdivisions of the neocortex exhibit greater similarity between species, compared with supramodal subdivisions, and that mouse isocortical regions separate into sensorimotor and supramodal clusters based on their similarity to human cortical regions. We also find that mouse and human striatal regions are strongly conserved, with the mouse caudoputamen exhibiting an equal degree of similarity to both the human caudate and putamen.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">DNA-stimulated liquid-liquid phase separation by eukaryotic topoisomerase II modulates catalytic function</a></h4>

              
                Type II topoisomerases modulate chromosome supercoiling, condensation, and catenation by moving one double-stranded DNA segment through a transient break in a second duplex. How DNA strands are chosen and selectively passed to yield appropriate topological outcomes - e.g., decatenation vs. catenation is poorly understood. Here we show that at physiological enzyme concentrations, eukaryotic type IIA topoisomerases (topo IIs) readily coalesce into condensed bodies. DNA stimulates condensation and fluidizes these assemblies to impart liquid-like behavior. Condensation induces both budding yeast and human topo IIs to switch from DNA unlinking to active DNA catenation, and depends on an unstructured C-terminal region, the loss of which leads to high levels of knotting and reduced catenation. Our findings establish that local protein concentration and phase separation can regulate how topo II creates or dissolves DNA links, behaviors that can account for the varied roles of the enzyme in supporting transcription, replication, and chromosome compaction.

                The power of electrophysiologically measured cortical activity decays 1/fX. The slope of this decay (i.e. the spectral exponent) is modulated by various factors such as age, cognitive states or psychiatric/neurological disorders. Interestingly, a mostly parallel line of research has shown similar effects for the spectral exponent in the electrocardiogram (ECG). This raises the question whether these bodywide changes in spectral exponents are independent or if the 'cortically' measured decay in power is explained by cardiac activity captured by cortical sensors (via volume conduction). Focusing on well-established age-related changes in spectral exponents, we analyzed a total of 1282 recordings of magnetoencephalography (MEG) resting state measurements with concurrent ECG in an age-diverse sample. We show that age-related changes of the spectral exponent of neural power spectra are largely explained by cardiac activity. Our results raise concerns when interpreting aperiodic activity as 'cortical' in absence of ECG recordings.

                Novel in vitro platforms based on human neurons are needed to improve early drug testing and address the stalling drug discovery in neurological disorders. Topologically controlled circuits of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons have the potential to become such a testing system. In this work, we build in vitro co-cultured circuits of human iPSC-derived neurons and rat primary glial cells using microfabricated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) structures on microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Such circuits are created by seeding either dissociated cells or pre-aggregated spheroids at different neuron-to-glia ratios. Furthermore, an antifouling coating is developed to prevent axonal overgrowth in undesired locations of the microstructure. We assess the electrophysiological properties of different types of circuits over more than 50 days, including their stimulation-induced neural activity. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of magnesium chloride on the electrical activity of our iPSC circuits as a proof-of-concept for screening of neuroactive compounds.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Continuous automated MRS data analysis workflow for applied studies</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can non-invasively measure levels of endogenous metabolites in living tissue and is of great interest to neuroscience and clinical research. To this day, MRS data analysis workflows differ substantially between groups, frequently requiring many manual steps to be performed on individual datasets, e.g., data renaming/sorting, manual execution of analysis scripts, and manual assessment of success/failure. Manual analysis practices are a substantial barrier to wider uptake of MRS. They also increase the likelihood of human error and prevent deployment of MRS at large scale. Here, we demonstrate an end-to-end workflow for fully automated data uptake, processing, and quality review. Methods: The proposed continuous automated MRS analysis workflow integrates several recent innovations in MRS data and file storage conventions. They are efficiently deployed by a directory monitoring service that automatically triggers the following steps upon arrival of a new raw MRS dataset in a project folder: (1) conversion from proprietary manufacturer file formats into the universal format NIfTI-MRS; (2) consistent file system organization according to the data accumulation logic standard BIDS-MRS; (3) executing a command-line executable of our open-source end-to-end analysis software Osprey; (4) e-mail delivery of a quality control summary dashboard for all analysis steps. Results: The automated architecture successfully completed for a demonstration dataset. The only manual step required is to copy a raw data folder into a monitored directory. Conclusion: Continuous automated analysis of MRS data can reduce the burden of manual data analysis and quality control, particularly for non-expert users and large-scale studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Periodic neglect after frontoparietal lesions provides causal evidence for rhythmic attention sampling</a></h4>

              
                Contemporary models conceptualize spatial attention as a blinking spotlight that sequentially samples visual space. Hence, behavior fluctuates over time even in states of presumed "sustained" attention. Recent evidence suggested that rhythmic neural activity in the frontoparietal network constitutes the functional basis of rhythmic attentional sampling. However, causal evidence to support this notion remains absent. Using a lateralized spatial attention task, we addressed this issue in patients with focal lesions in the frontoparietal attention network. Our results uncovered that frontoparietal lesions introduce periodic neglect, i.e., temporally-specific behavioral deficits that were aligned with the underlying neural oscillations. Attention-guided perceptual sensitivity was on par with healthy controls during optimal phases but attenuated during the less excitable sub-cycles. Theta-dependent sampling (3 - 8 Hz) was causally dependent on prefrontal cortex, while alpha-band sampling (8 - 14 Hz) emerged from parietal areas. Collectively, our findings reveal that lesion-induced high amplitude, low frequency brain activity is not epiphenomenal, but has immediate behavioral consequences. More generally, these results provide causal evidence for the hypothesis that the functional architecture of attention is inherently rhythmic.

                Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent classic serotonergic psychedelic, which facilitates a variety of altered states of consciousness. Here we present the first meta-analysis establishing dose-response relationship estimates of the phenomenological states induced by LSD. Data extracted from articles identified by a systematic literature search following PRISMA guidelines were obtained from the Altered States Database. The psychometric data comprised ratings of subjective effects from standardized and validated questionnaires: the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D-ASC, 11-ASC) and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30). We used a meta-regression approach to obtain estimates for linear dose-response relationships of questionnaire ratings after LSD administration to healthy, highly selected study participants in controlled settings for a dosage range between 25 g and 200 g. LSD doses positively correlated with ratings on most factors and scales of the questionnaires, with strongest responses for visionary phenomena such as audio-visual synesthesia and altered imagery, followed by positively perceived ego dissolution comprising depersonalization and derealization phenomena. Measures referring to mystical experiences exhibited weak modulations by dose. The established dose-response relationships in the given range may be used as general references for future experimental and clinical research on LSD with low to moderate dosages to relate observed with expected subjective effects and to elucidate phenomenological differences between psychedelics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early-life language deprivation affects specific neural mechanisms of semantic representations</a></h4>

              
                One signature of the human brain is its ability to derive knowledge from language inputs, in addition to nonlinguistic sensory channels such as vision and touch. How does human language experience specifically modulate the way in which semantic knowledge is stored in the human brain? We investigated this question using a unique early-life language-deprivation human model: early deaf adults who are born to hearing parents and thus had delayed acquisition of any natural human language (speech or sign), with early deaf adults who acquired sign language from birth as nonlinguistic sensory experience controls. Neural responses in a meaning judgment task with 90 written words that were familiar to both groups were measured using fMRI. The early language-deprived group, compared with the deaf control group, showed reduced semantic sensitivity, in both multivariate pattern (semantic structure encoding) and univariate (abstractness effect) analyses, in the left dorsal anterior temporal lobe (dATL). These results provide positive, causal evidence that the neural semantic representation in dATL is specifically supported by language, as a unique mechanism of representing (abstract) semantic space, beyond the sensory-derived semantic representations distributed in the other cortical regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Steady state visual evoked potentials reveal a signature of the pitch-size crossmodal association in visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Crossmodal correspondences describe our tendency to associate sensory features from different modalities with each other, such as the pitch of a sound with a specific size of a visual object. While such crossmodal correspondences (or associations) have been described in many behavioural studies their neurophysiological correlates remain debated. Under the current working model of multisensory perception both a low- and a high-level account seem plausible. That is, the neurophysiological processes shaping these associations could commence in early sensory regions, or may rather emerge only later and as a result from high-level multisensory integration processes or in semantic and object identification networks. We implemented a paradigm based on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) to directly test the hypothesis that the associations between acoustic pitch and the visual features of size, hue or chromatic saturation are visible in brain activity from early visual cortices. Our results reveal a pitch-size congruency effect in the SSVEP over occipital electrodes and in the behavioural data, supporting a low-level account of this crossmodal association. For the associations between pitch and chromatic features we found no significant effects. We speculate that this signature of the pitch size association in early visual cortices reflects the successful pairing of congruent visual and acoustic object properties and may contribute to establishing causal relations between multisensory objects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bias in group-level EEG microstate analysis</a></h4>

              
                Microstate analysis is a promising technique for analyzing high-density electroencephalographic data, but there are multiple questions about methodological best practices. Here we focus on a commonly used approach to the analysis of group differences in microstate maps and the derived metrics based on those maps. Using simulations seeded on real data from healthy control subjects, we compared error rates for analyses performed using microstates derived from the entire dataset to analyses performed using microstates derived separately within each subgroup. The latter approach resulted in substantially higher type I error rates. These results suggest that even subtle differences in microstate topography can have profound effects on derived microstate metrics and that future studies using microstate analysis should take steps to mitigate this large source of error.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Non-invasive stimulation of the human striatum disrupts reinforcement learning of motor skills</a></h4>

              
                Reinforcement feedback can improve motor learning, but the underlying brain mechanisms remain unexplored. Especially, the causal contribution of specific patterns of oscillatory activity within the human striatum is unknown. To address this question, we exploited an innovative, non-invasive deep brain stimulation technique called transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) during reinforcement motor learning with concurrent neuroimaging, in a randomised, sham-controlled, double-blind study. Striatal tTIS applied at 80Hz, but not at 20Hz, abolished the benefits of reinforcement on motor learning. This effect was related to a selective modulation of neural activity within the striatum. Moreover, 80Hz, but not 20Hz, tTIS increased the neuromodulatory influence of the striatum on frontal areas involved in reinforcement motor learning. These results show for the first time that tTIS can non-invasively and selectively modulate a striatal mechanism involved in reinforcement learning, opening new horizons for the study of causal relationships between deep brain structures and human behaviour.

                The Arctic mutation, encoding E693G in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene [E22G in amyloid-beta] (Abeta)], causes dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease. Here we report the high-resolution cryo-EM structures of A beta filaments from the frontal cortex of a previously described case (A beta PParc1) with the Arctic mutation. Most filaments consist of two pairs of non-identical protofilaments that comprise residues V12-V40 (human Arctic fold A) and E11-G37 (human Arctic fold B). They have a substructure (residues F20-G37) in common with the folds of type I and type II Abeta42. When compared to the structures of wild-type Abeta42 filaments, there are subtle conformational changes in the human Arctic folds, because of the lack of a side chain at G22, which may strengthen hydrogen bonding between mutant Abeta molecules and promote filament formation. A minority of Abeta42 filaments of type II was also present, as were tau paired helical filaments. In addition, we report the cryo-EM structures of Abeta filaments with the Arctic mutation from mouse knock-in line App NL-G-F. Most filaments are made of two identical mutant protofilaments that extend from D1-G37 (murine Arctic fold). In a minority of filaments, two dimeric folds pack against each other in an anti-parallel fashion. The murine Arctic fold differs from the human Arctic folds, but shares some substructure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Upgrading Voxel-wise Encoding Model via Integrated Integration over Features and Brain Networks</a></h4>

              
                A central goal of cognitive neuroscience is to build computational models that predict and explain neural responses to sensory inputs in the cortex. Recent studies attempt to borrow the representation power of deep neural networks (DNN) to predict the brain response and suggest a correspondence between artificial and biological neural networks in their feature representations. However, each DNN instance is often specified for certain computer vision tasks which may not lead to optimal brain correspondence. On the other hand, these voxel-wise encoding models focus on predicting single voxels independently, while brain activity often demonstrates rich and dynamic structures at the population and network levels during cognitive tasks. These two important properties suggest that we can improve the prevalent voxel-wise encoding models by integrating features from DNN models and by integrating cortical network information into the models. In this work, we propose a new unified framework that addresses these two aspects through DNN feature-level ensemble learning and brain atlas-level model integration. Our proposed approach leads to superior performance over previous DNN-based encoding models in predicting whole-brain neural activity during naturalistic video perception. Furthermore, our unified framework also facilitates the investigation of the brain's neural representation mechanism by accurately predicting the neural response corresponding to complex visual concepts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Biomechanics of Finger Pad Response under Torsion</a></h4>

              
                Surface skin deformation of the finger pad during partial slippage at finger-object interfaces elicits tactile feedback. During object manipulation, torque is often present, which can cause partial slippage. Until now, studies of surface skin deformation have used stimuli sliding on rectilinear tangential trajectories. Here we studied surface skin dynamics under torsion. A custom robotic platform stimulated the finger pad with a flat transparent surface, controlling the normal forces and rotation speeds applied while monitoring the contact interface using optical imaging. We observed the characteristic pattern by which partial slips develop, starting at the periphery of the contact and propagating towards its centre, and the resulting surface strains. The 20-fold range of normal forces and angular velocities used highlights the effect of those parameters on the resulting torque and skin strains. While normal force increases the contact area, generated torque, strains, and twist angle required to reach full slip, angular velocity increases loss of contact at the periphery and strain rates (although not total strains). We also discuss the surprisingly large inter-individual variability in skin biomechanics, notably observed in the twist angle the stimulus needed to rotate before reaching full slip.

                The microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) chromosome 17q21.31 locus lies within a region of high linkage disequilibrium (LD) conferring two extended haplotypes commonly referred to as H1 and H2. The major haplotype, H1 has been genetically associated with an increased risk for multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD), APOE epsilon4-negative Alzheimer`s disease (AD) and Parkinson`s disease (PD). The mechanism causing this increased risk is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of Mild Chronic Oxidative Stress (MCOS) in neurogenin 2 (NGN2) induced neurons (iNeurons) derived from iPS (induced pluripotent stem cells) from carriers of both haplotypes. We identified that iNeurons of the H1 homozygous haplotype showed an increased susceptibility to MCOS compared to homozygous H2 carriers, leading to cell death through ferroptosis. We performed a cellular screen in H1 iNeurons using a FDA-approved Drug Library and identified candidate molecules that rescued the increased susceptibility to MCOS and prevented ferroptosis in H1 iNeurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimization of modularity during development to simplify walking control across strides</a></h4>

              
                Walking in adults seems to rely on a small number of modules allowing to reduce the number of degrees of freedom effectively regulated by the central nervous system (CNS). However, the extent to which modularity evolves during development remains unknown, particularly regarding the ability to generate several strides in an optimized manner. Here we compared the modular organization of toddlers and adults during several strides of walking. We recorded the electromyographic activity of 10 bilateral (lower limbs) muscles in adults (n=12) and toddlers (n=12) during 8 gait cycles, and used non-negative matrix factorization to model the underlying modular command. While the muscular activity of all strides could be factorized into a consistent low-dimensional modular organization in adults, significantly more computational modules were needed in toddlers to account for their greater stride-by-stride variability. Activations of these modules varied more across strides and was less parsimonious in toddlers than in adults, even when balances constrained were diminished. These findings suggest that the modular control of locomotion of adults evolves as the organism develops and practices. They also suggest that new walker can flexibly activate a higher number of modules and benefit from a higher space of possible action, which could serve motor exploration.

                Rho GTPases, among them Rac1 and Rac3, are major transducers of extracellular signals and are involved in multiple cellular processes. In cortical interneurons, the neurons that control excitation/inhibition balance of cortical circuits, Rac1 and Rac3 are essential for their development. Ablation of both, leads to a severe reduction in the numbers of mature interneurons found in the murine cortex, which is partially due to abnormal cell cycle progression of interneuron precursors and defective formation of their growth cones. Here we present new evidence that upon Rac1 and Rac3 ablation, centrosome, Golgi complex and lysosome positioning are significantly perturbed, thus affecting both interneuron migration and axon growth. Moreover, for the first time we provide evidence of altered expression and localization of the two-pore channel 2 (TPC2) voltage-gated ion channel that mediates Ca2+ release. Pharmacological inhibition of TPC2 negatively affected axonal growth and migration of interneurons. Our data taken together suggest that TPC2 contributes to the severe phenotype in axon growth initiation, extension and interneuron migration in the absence of Rac1 and Rac3.

	<p>Robot-aided rehabilitation (RAR) and non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) are the two main interventions for post-stroke rehabilitation. The efficacy of both approaches in combination has not been well established yet. The importance of coupling these interventions, which both enhance brain plasticity to promote recovery, lies in augmenting the rehabilitation potential to constrain the limitation in daily living activities and the quality of life following stroke. This review aimed to evaluate the evidence of NIBS coupled with RAR in improving rehabilitation outcomes of upper limb and gait motor impairment in adult individuals with stroke. We included 18 clinical trials in this review. All studies were highly heterogeneous concerning the technical characteristics of robotic devices and NIBS protocols. However, the studies reported a global improvement in body structure and function and activity limitation for the upper limb, which were non-significant between the active and control groups. Concerning gait training protocols, the active group outperformed the control group in improving walking capacity and recovery. According to this review, NIBS and RAR in combination are promising but not yet largely recommendable as a systematic approach for stroke rehabilitation as there is not enough data about this. Therefore, more homogenous clinical trials are required, pointing out the best characteristics of the combined therapeutic protocols.</p>

	<p>In this work, we aim to identify sensitive neurophysiological biomarkers of axonal degeneration in CIDP patients. A total of 16 CIDP patients, fulfilling the clinical and neurophysiological criteria for typical CIDP, treated with subcutaneous immunoglobulin (ScIg) (0.4 g/kg/week) were evaluated at baseline (before ScIg treatment) and after long-term treatment with ScIg (24 months) by clinical assessment scales, nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG). Conventional and non-conventional neurophysiological parameters: motor unit potential (MUP) analysis, MUP thickness and size index (SI)] and interference pattern (IP) features were evaluated after long-term treatment (24 months) and compared with a population of 16 healthy controls (HC). An increase of distal motor latency (DML) and reduced compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitude and area in CIDP patients suggest axonal damage of motor fibers, together with a significant increase of MUP amplitude, duration and area. Analysis of non-conventional MUP parameters shows no difference for MUP thickness; however, in CIDP patients, SI is increased and IP area and amplitude values are lower than HC. Despite clinical and neurophysiological improvement after ScIg treatment, neurophysiological analysis revealed axonal degeneration of motor fibers and motor unit remodeling. Correlation analysis shows that the axonal degeneration process is related to the diagnostic and therapeutic delay. MUP area and SI parameters can detect early signs of axonal degeneration, and their introduction in clinical practice may help to identify patients with the worst outcome.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modular cell type organization of cortical areas revealed by in situ sequencing</a></h4>

              
                The cortex is composed of neuronal types with diverse gene expression that are organized into specialized cortical areas. These areas, each with characteristic cytoarchitecture, connectivity, and neuronal activity, are wired into modular networks. However, it remains unclear whether cortical areas and their modular organization can be similarly defined by their transcriptomic signatures. Here we used BARseq, a high-throughput in situ sequencing technique, to interrogate the expression of 107 cell type marker genes in 1.2 million cells over a mouse forebrain hemisphere at cellular resolution. De novo clustering of gene expression in single neurons revealed transcriptomic types that were consistent with previous single-cell RNAseq studies. Within medium-grained cell types that are shared across all cortical areas, gene expression and the distribution of fine-grained cell types vary along the contours of cortical areas. The compositions of transcriptomic types are highly predictive of cortical area identity. We grouped cortical areas into modules so that areas within a module, but not across modules, had similar compositions of transcriptomic types. Strikingly, these modules match cortical subnetworks that are highly interconnected, suggesting that cortical areas that are similar in cell types are also wired together. This "wire-by-similarity" rule reflects a novel organizing principle for the connectivity of cortical areas. Our BARseq-based strategy is high-throughput and low-cost, and scaling up this approach to many animals can potentially reveal the brain-wide molecular architecture across individuals, developmental times, and disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptomic cytoarchitecture reveals principles of human neocortex organization</a></h4>

              
                Variation in cortical cytoarchitecture is the basis for histology-based definition of cortical areas, such as Brodmann areas. Single cell transcriptomics enables higher-resolution characterization of cell types in human cortex, which we used to revisit the idea of the canonical cortical microcircuit and to understand functional areal specialization. Deeply sampled single nucleus RNA-sequencing of eight cortical areas spanning cortical structural variation showed highly consistent cellular makeup for 24 coarse cell subclasses. However, proportions of excitatory neuron subclasses varied strikingly, reflecting differences in intra- and extracortical connectivity across primary sensorimotor and association cortices. Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes also showed differences in laminar organization across areas. Primary visual cortex showed dramatically different organization, including major differences in the ratios of excitatory to inhibitory neurons, expansion of layer 4 excitatory neuron types and specialized inhibitory neurons. Finally, gene expression variation in conserved neuron subclasses predicts differences in synaptic function across areas. Together these results provide a refined cellular and molecular characterization of human cortical cytoarchitecture that reflects functional connectivity and predicts areal specialization.

                The discovery that DA transients can be mapped onto the reward prediction errors in temporal difference models is a pinnacle achievement of neuroscience. Yet, there is abundant evidence that DA activity reinforces actions, suggesting it serves as an intrinsically rewarding event. These two possibilities are so conceptually intertwined that it is not surprising that they have been so far experimentally conflated. Here, using computational modeling, behavioural blocking and optogenetics, we show that stimulating VTA DA neurons promotes learning even when a natural reward and DA stimulation are held constant across the learning phases of blocking. These findings provide strong evidence in favour of the prediction error hypothesis rather than encoding the rewarding value of appetitive events.

                Over 500 noncoding genomic loci are associated with obesity. The majority of these loci reside near genes that are expressed in the hypothalamus in specific neuronal subpopulations that regulate food intake, hindering the ability to identify and functionally characterize them. Here, we carried out integrative single-cell analysis (RNA/ATAC-seq) on both mouse and human male and female hypothalamus to characterize genes and regulatory elements in specific cell subpopulations. Utilizing both transcriptome and regulome data, we identify over 30 different neuronal and non-neuronal cell subpopulations and a shared core of transcription factors that regulate cell cluster-specific genes between mice and humans. We characterize several sex-specific differentially expressed genes and the regulatory elements that control them in specific cell subpopulations. Overlapping cell-specific scATAC peaks with obesity-associated GWAS variants, identifies potential obesity-associated regulatory elements. Using reporter assays and CRISPR editing, we show that many of these sequences, including the top obesity-associated loci (FTO and MC4R), are functional enhancers whose activity is altered due to the obesity-associated variant and regulate known obesity genes. Combined, our work provides a catalog of genes and regulatory elements in hypothalamus cell subpopulations and uses obesity to showcase how integrative single-cell sequencing can identify functional variants associated with hypothalamus-related phenotypes.

                N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated calcium-permeable excitatory channels. They have attracted great interest as potential targets for the treatment of depression in recent years. NMDARs typically assemble as heterotetramers composed of two GluN1 and two alternative GluN2 (2A-2D) subunits, the latter of which endow various subtypes with diverse gating and pharmacological properties. To date, limited molecules with GluN2 specificity have been identified to show antidepressant effects. Here, we identify a compound termed YY-23 extracted from Rhizoma Anemarrhenae allosterically inhibited the channel activities of GluN2C- or GluN2D-incorporated NMDARs, an effect that was presumably influenced by the S2 segment in the ligand-binding domain of the GluN2 subunit. We found that prefrontal GluN2D-containing NMDARs were predominantly expressed at GABAergic interneurons rather than pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, we revealed that YY-23 suppressed the activity of GluN2D-containing NMDARs and GABAergic neurotransmission in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). As a consequence, this GABAergic disinhibition facilitated the excitatory transmission. Behavioural experiments showed that YY-23 acted as a rapid antidepressant in both stress-naive and stressed animal models, which was abolished in Grin2d-knockout mice. Together, our findings suggest that GluN2D-incorporated NMDARs on GABAergic interneurons might be promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of depression.

                Neural entrainment to musical rhythm is thought to underlie the perception and production of music. In aging populations, the strength of neural entrainment to rhythm has been found to be attenuated, particularly during attentive listening to auditory streams. However, previous studies on neural entrainment to rhythm and aging have often employed artificial auditory rhythms or limited pieces of recorded, naturalistic music, failing to account for the diversity of rhythmic structures found in natural music. As part of larger project assessing a novel music-based intervention for healthy aging, we investigated neural entrainment to musical rhythms in the electroencephalogram (EEG) while participants listened to self-selected musical recordings across a sample of younger and older adults. We specifically measured neural entrainment to the level of musical pulse - quantified here as the phase-locking value (PLV) - after normalizing the PLVs to detected pulse frequencies of each recording. As predicted, we observed strong neural phase-locking to musical pulse, and to the sub-harmonic and harmonic levels of musical meter. Overall, PLVs were not significantly different between older and younger adults. This preserved neural entrainment to musical pulse and rhythm could support the design of music-based interventions that aim to modulate endogenous brain activity via self-selected music for healthy cognitive aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cholinergic Interneurons Drive Motivation by Promoting Dopamine Release in the Nucleus Accumbens</a></h4>

              
                Motivation to work for potential rewards is critically dependent on dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). DA release from NAc axons can be controlled by at least two distinct mechanisms: 1) action potentials propagating from DA cell bodies in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and 2) activation of {beta}2* nicotinic receptors by local cholinergic interneurons (CINs). How CIN activity contributes to NAc DA dynamics in behaving animals remains unclear. We monitored DA release in the NAc Core of awake, unrestrained rats while simultaneously monitoring or manipulating CIN activity at the same location. CIN stimulation rapidly evoked DA release, and in contrast to slice preparations, this DA release showed no indication of short-term depression or receptor desensitization. The sound of food delivery evoked a brief joint increase in CIN population activity and DA release, with a second joint increase as rats approached the food. In an operant task, we observed fast ramps in CIN activity during approach behaviors, either to start the trial or to collect rewards. These CIN ramps co-occurred with DA release ramps, without corresponding changes in the firing of VTA DA neurons. Finally, we examined the effects of blocking CIN influence over DA release through local NAc infusion of DH{beta}E, a selective antagonist of {beta}2* nicotinic receptors. DH{beta}E dose-dependently interfered with motivated approach decisions, mimicking the effects of a DA antagonist. Our results support a key influence of CINs over motivated behavior via the local regulation of DA release.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of the cerebellum in learning to predict reward: evidence from cerebellar ataxia</a></h4>

              
                Recent findings in animals have challenged the traditional view of the cerebellum solely as the site of motor control, suggesting that the cerebellum may also be important for learning to predict reward from trial-and-error feedback. Yet, evidence for the role of the cerebellum in reward learning in humans is lacking. Moreover, open questions remain about which specific aspects of reward learning the cerebellum may contribute to. Here we address this gap through an investigation of multiple forms of reward learning in individuals with cerebellum dysfunction, represented by cerebellar ataxia cases. Nineteen participants with cerebellar ataxia and 57 age- and sex-matched healthy controls completed two separate tasks that required learning about reward contingencies from trial-and-error. To probe the selectivity of reward learning processes, the tasks differed in their underlying structure: while one task measured incremental reward learning ability alone, the other allowed participants to use an alternative learning strategy based on episodic memory alongside incremental reward learning. We found that individuals with cerebellar ataxia were profoundly impaired at reward learning from trial-and-error feedback on both tasks, but retained the ability to learn to predict reward based on episodic memory. These findings provide evidence from humans for a specific and necessary role for the cerebellum in incremental learning of reward associations based on reinforcement. More broadly, the findings suggest that alongside its role in motor learning, the cerebellum likely operates in concert with the basal ganglia to support reinforcement learning from reward.

                We have previously demonstrated that macaque monkeys can behaviorally detect a subtle optogenetic impulse delivered to their inferior temporal (IT) cortex. We have also shown that the ability to detect the cortical stimulation impulse varies depending on some characteristics of the visual images viewed at the time of brain stimulation, revealing the visual nature of the perceptual events induced by stimulation of the IT cortex. Here we systematically studied the effect of the size of viewed objects on behavioral detectability of optogenetic stimulation of the central IT cortex. Surprisingly, we found that behavioral detection of the same optogenetic impulse highly varies with the size of the viewed object images. Reduction of the object size in four steps from 8 to 1 degree of visual angle significantly decreased detection performance. These results show that identical stimulation impulses delivered to the same neural population induce variable perceptual events depending on the mere size of the objects viewed at the time of brain stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Express visuomotor responses reflect knowledge of both target location and conscious intent during reaches of different amplitudes</a></h4>

              
                When humans reach to visual targets, extremely rapid (~90 ms) bursts of activity can be observed on task-relevant proximal muscles. Such express visuomotor responses are inflexibly locked in time and space to the target and have been proposed to reflect rapid visuomotor transformations conveyed subcortically via the tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway. Previously, we showed that express visuomotor responses are sensitive to explicit cue-driven information about the target, suggesting that the express pathway can be modulated by cortical signals affording contextual pre-stimulus expectations. Here, we show that the express visuomotor system incorporates information about the veridical target-directed reaching metrics and contextual instructions during visuospatial tasks requiring different movement amplitudes. In one experiment, we recorded the activity from two shoulder muscles as participants reached toward targets that appeared at different distances. Longer hand-to-target distances led to larger and more prevalent express visuomotor responses than short-reach targets. This suggests that both the direction and distance of veridical hand-to-target reaches are encoded along the putative subcortical express pathway. In a second experiment, we modulated the movement amplitude by asking the participants to deliberately undershoot, overshoot, or stop (control) at the target. The overshoot and undershoot tasks impaired the generation of large and frequent express visuomotor responses, consistent with the inability of the express pathway to generate responses directed toward non-veridical targets (e.g. anti-reach tasks). Our findings appear to reflect strategic, cortically-driven modulation of the express visuomotor circuit to facilitate rapid and effective response initiation during target-directed actions.

	<p>The application of voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) analysis to study the central mechanism of migraine has been limited. Furthermore, little is known about inter-hemispheric functional connectivity (FC) alterations during resting state in female patients with migraine. This study aimed to investigate potential interictal VMHC impairments in migraine without aura (MwoA) patients and the relationship between connectivity alterations and clinical parameters. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data and clinical information were acquired from 43 female MwoA patients and 43 matched healthy controls. VMHC analysis was used to compare differences between these two groups, and brain regions showing significant differences were chosen as a mask to perform a seed-based FC group comparison. Subsequent correlation analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between abnormal inter-hemispheric FC and clinical data. Compared with healthy controls, female MwoA patients revealed significantly decreased VMHC in the bilateral cerebellum; cuneus; and lingual, middle occipital, precentral and postcentral gyri. Seed-based FC analysis indicated disrupted intrinsic connectivity in the cerebellum, and default mode, visual and sensorimotor network. These VMHC and FC abnormalities were negatively correlated with clinical indexes including duration of disease, migraine days and visual analogue scale. These inter-hemispheric FC impairments and correlations between abnormal VMHC and FC and clinical scores may improve our understanding of the central mechanism of female-specific migraine.</p>

	<p>This research focused on the development of an astrocyte cell model system (C6 glioma) for the assessment of molecular changes in response to cathodic passively balanced pulsed electrical stimulation at a rate of 50 Hz (60 &amp;amp;micro;s duration, 0.15 mA intensity). Cells treated with selected neurotransmitters (glutamate, adenosine, D-serine, and &amp;amp;gamma;-aminobutyric acid) were monitored (using specific fluorescent probes) for changes in levels of intracellular nitric oxide, calcium ions, and/or chloride. ES exerted an inhibitory effect on NO, increased calcium and had no effect on chloride. Using this model, cells can be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively for changes and these changes can be correlated with the putative molecular effects that electrical stimulation has on astrocytes and their role in glia-mediated diseases. This model system allows for faster and cheaper experiments than those involving animal models due to the potential to easily vary the conditions, reduce the number of variables (especially problematic in animal models), and closely monitor the cellular effects.</p>

	<p>Acoustic stimulation during sleep is believed to enhance slow waves, which are critical to memory consolidation. However, clinical trials of acoustic stimulation have yielded mixed results concerning its effectiveness in improving human memory. A few studies have implied that acoustic stimulation ameliorates the pathology of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) in mice with normal sleep. Here, we explored the effect of acoustic stimulation on 3xTgAD mice suffering from chronic sleep deprivation, as these data may shed light on the potential use of acoustic stimulation in AD patients with insomnia. Methods: Twenty-four 8-month-old 3xTgAD mice were randomly and equally divided into three groups: the normal sleep group (S group), the sleep deprivation group (SD group), and the acoustic stimulation group (AS group). During a 14-day sleep intervention, the SD and AS groups received 6 h of sleep deprivation per day, and the AS group also received acoustic stimulation in the dark phase. Then, the mice underwent Morris water maze (MWM) tests and arterial spin labelling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and were sacrificed for pathological evaluation. Results: The three groups showed similar stress levels. The S and AS groups exhibited better spatial memory, better brain perfusion, and milder amyloid &amp;amp;beta; (A&amp;amp;beta;) and tau pathology than the SD group, although no significant discrepancies were found between the S and AS groups. Conclusion: Acoustic stimulation may exert a protective effect in 3xTgAD mice by improving spatial memory, enhancing the blood supply of the brain, and reversing the contribution of chronic sleep deprivation to A&amp;amp;beta; and tau pathology to mimic the effect of normal sleep patterns.</p>

	<p>In this study, we observed the sex differences in functional brain activity in patients with recurrent depressive disorder (RDE) and assessed the correlation between abnormal functional brain activity changes and clinical symptoms. A total of 40 patients with RDE (19 male and 21 female) and 42 healthy controls (HCs) (20 male and 22 female) met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of images using regional homogeneity (ReHo) and further analysis of the correlation between abnormal brain areas and clinical symptoms of the different sexes with RDE groups were carried out. For the main effects of sex (male vs. female), there were statistically significant differences in ReHo among the four groups in the right middle temporal gyrus, right thalamus, and left posterior cerebellar lobe. For the effects of the sex-by-group interaction, there were statistically significant differences in ReHo among the four groups in the left middle frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, and right insula. Post hoc analyses showed that compared with the female RDE group, the male RDE group had decreased ReHo in the left middle frontal gyrus and right insula. In the female RDE group, the ReHo values of the left middle frontal gyrus were positively correlated with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) scores. This study provides new insights into the clinical targeting of different sexes for RDE.</p>

	<p>Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a central nervous system disease with high mortality and morbidity. Some independent factors valuable for prognosis prediction in patients with SAH are still lacking. In our earlier study, we found that PDK4 exerts a protective effect after SAH, primarily by reducing oxidative stress and neuronal death via the ROS/ASK1/p38 signaling pathway. Therefore, we investigated the changes in the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) in patients after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and analyzed the value of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PDK4 level in predicting the prognoses of patients with SAH after interventional embolization surgery. Some knee arthritis subjects who needed surgery were recruited as a control group. The results showed that PDK4 expression was elevated in the CSF of SAH patients compared with that of controls. PDK4 levels in CSF (OR = 4.525; 95% CI: 1.135&amp;amp;ndash;18.038; p = 0.032), time to surgery (OR = 0.795; 95% CI: 0.646&amp;amp;ndash;0.977; p = 0.029), and initial GCS scores (OR = 2.758; 95% CI: 0.177&amp;amp;ndash;43.106; p = 0.469) were independent prognostic risk factors for SAH patients after surgery. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed PDK4 levels in CSF had a higher predictive value. Thus, PDK4 in CSF could be an independent prognostic risk factor for SAH patients after surgery. PDK4 has the potential to serve as a new therapeutic target and biomarker for use in the diagnosis of SAH severity and the prediction of recovery.</p>

	<p>The growing number of depressive people and the overload in primary care services make it necessary to identify depressive states with easily accessible biomarkers such as mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Some studies have addressed this issue by collecting and analyzing EEG resting state in a search of appropriate features and classification methods. Traditionally, EEG resting state classification methods for depression were mainly based on linear or a combination of linear and non-linear features. We hypothesize that participants with ongoing depressive states differ from controls in complex patterns of brain dynamics that can be captured in EEG resting state data, using only nonlinear measures on a few electrodes, making it possible to develop cheap and wearable devices that could be even monitored through smartphones. To validate such a perspective, a resting-state EEG study was conducted with 50 participants, half with depressive state (DEP) and half controls (CTL). A data-driven approach was applied to select the most appropriate time window and electrodes for the EEG analyses, as suggested by Giacometti&amp;amp;#8288;, as well as the most efficient nonlinear features and classifiers, to distinguish between CTL and DEP participants. Nonlinear features showing temporo-spatial and spectral complexity were selected. The results confirmed that computing nonlinear features from a few selected electrodes in a 15 s time window are sufficient to classify DEP and CTL participants accurately. Finally, after training and testing internally the classifier, the trained machine was applied to EEG resting state data (CTL and DEP) from a publicly available database, validating the capacity of generalization of the classifier with data from different equipment, population, and environment obtaining an accuracy near 100%.</p>

                <p>Infantile striatonigral degeneration is caused by a homozygous variant of the nuclear-pore complex (NPC) gene <i>NUP62</i>, involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking. By querying sequencing-datasets of patients with dystonia and/or Leigh(-like) syndromes, we identified three unrelated individuals with biallelic variants in <i>NUP54</i>. All variants clustered in the C-terminal protein region that interacts with NUP62. Associated phenotypes were similar to those of <i>NUP62</i>-related disease, including early-onset dystonia with dysphagia, choreoathetosis, and T2-hyperintense lesions in striatum. <i>In-silico</i> and protein-biochemical studies gave further evidence for the argument that the variants were pathogenic. We expand the spectrum of NPC component-associated dystonic conditions with localized basal-ganglia abnormalities.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tobacco smoking and overweight lead to adverse health effects, which remain an important public health problem worldwide. Researches indicate overlapping pathophysiology may contribute to tobacco use disorder (TUD) and overweight, but the neurobiological interaction mechanism between the two factors is still unclear. This study used a mixed sample design, including the following four groups: (i) overweight long-term smokers (<i>n</i> = 24, age = 31.80 ± 5.70, cigarettes/day = 20.50 ± 7.89); (ii) normal weight smokers (<i>n</i> = 28, age = 31.29 ± 5.56, cigarettes/day = 16.11 ± 8.35); (iii) overweight nonsmokers (<i>n</i> = 19, age = 33.05 ± 5.60), and (iv) normal weight nonsmokers (<i>n</i> = 28, age = 31.68 ± 6.57), a total of 99 male subjects. All subjects underwent T1-weighted high-resolution MRI. We used voxel-based morphometry to compare gray matter volume (GMV) among the four groups. Then, JuSpace toolbox was used for cross-modal correlations of MRI-based modalities with nuclear imaging derived estimates, to examine specific neurotransmitter system changes underlying the two factors. Our results illustrate a significant antagonistic interaction between TUD and weight status in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and a quadratic effect of BMI on DLPFC GMV. For main effect of TUD, long-term smokers were associated with greater GMV in bilateral OFC compared with nonsmokers irrespective of weight status, and such alteration is negatively associated with pack-year and FTND scores. Furthermore, we also found GMV changes related to TUD and overweight are associated with μ-opioid receptor system and TUD-related GMV alterations are associated with noradrenaline transporter maps. This study sheds light on novel multimodal neuromechanistic about the relationship between TUD and overweight, which possibly provides hints into future treatment for the special population of comorbid TUD and overweight.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Assessing pupil size as an index of activation of subcortical ascending arousal system nuclei during rest</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulatory nuclei that are part of the ascending arousal system (AAS) play a crucial role in regulating cortical state and optimizing task performance. Pupil diameter, under constant luminance conditions, is increasingly used as an index of activity of these AAS nuclei. Indeed, task-based functional imaging studies in humans have begun to provide evidence of stimulus-driven pupil-AAS coupling. However, whether there is such a tight pupil-AAS coupling during rest is not clear. To address this question, we examined simultaneously acquired resting-state fMRI and pupil-size data from 74 participants, focusing on six AAS nuclei: the locus coeruleus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, dorsal and median raphe nuclei, and cholinergic basal forebrain. Activation in all six AAS nuclei was optimally correlated with pupil size at 0- to 2-second lags, suggesting that spontaneous pupil changes were almost immediately followed by corresponding BOLD-signal changes in the AAS. These results suggest that spontaneous changes in pupil size that occur during states of rest can be used as a noninvasive general index of activity in AAS nuclei. Importantly, the nature of pupil-AAS coupling during rest appears to be vastly different from the relatively slow canonical hemodynamic response function that has been used to characterize task-related pupil-AAS coupling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Methadone alters transcriptional programs associated with synapse formation in human cortical organoids</a></h4>

              
                Opioid use disorder (OUD) among pregnant women has become an epidemic in the United States. Pharmacological interventions for OUD involve methadone, a synthetic opioid analgesic that attenuates withdrawal symptoms and behaviors linked with maternal drug addiction. However, methadone's ability to readily accumulate in neural tissue, and cause long-term neurocognitive sequelae, has led to concerns regarding its effect on prenatal brain development. We took advantage of human cortical organoid (hCO) technology to probe how this drug impacts the earliest mechanisms giving rise to the cerebral cortex. To this end, we conducted bulk mRNA sequencing of 2-month-old hCOs derived from two cell lines that were chronically treated with a clinically relevant dose of 1M methadone for 50 days. Differential expression and gene ontology analyses revealed a robust transcriptional response to methadone associated with functional components of the synapse, the underlying extracellular matrix (ECM), and cilia. Further unsupervised co-expression network and predictive protein-protein interaction analyses demonstrated that these changes occurred in concert, centered around a regulatory axis consisting of growth factors, developmental signaling pathways, and matricellular proteins. Our results demonstrate that exposure to methadone during early cortico-genesis fundamentally alters transcriptional programs associated with synapse formation, and that these changes arise by modulating extra-synaptic molecular mechanisms in the ECM and cilia. These findings provide novel insight into methadone's putative effect on cognitive and behavioral development and a basis for improving interventions for maternal opioid addiction.

                Musical training can offset age-related decline in speech-in-noise perception. However, how lifelong musical expertise affects the functional reorganization of older brain in speech-in-noise perception has not yet been systematically investigated. Here, we address this issue by analyzing fMRI responses of older musicians, older non-musicians and, young non-musicians identifying noise-masked audiovisual syllables. First, we confirmed that older musicians outperformed older non-musicians and even equaled young non-musicians. Then, we showed that both older groups showed decreased auditory activation and increased visual activation compared to young non-musicians, while older musicians showed higher activation in speech motor regions and greater deactivation of default mode network (DMN) regions than older non-musicians. Next, we revealed that musical expertise counteracted the age-related neural dedifferentiation of speech representation, making older musicians exhibit higher neural alignment-to-young in bilateral sensorimotor areas. Finally, we disentangled that greater activation in speech motor areas and stronger deactivation in DMN regions were correlated with higher neural alignment in sensorimotor areas, which strongly predicted better performance in older adults. Together, long-term musical expertise mitigates age-related deficits in audiovisual speech-in-noise processing through enhanced compensatory scaffolding that reserves youth-like representation in sensorimotor areas. Our findings provide a comprehensive perspective on understanding age- and experience-related brain reorganization during speech perception.

                The inferior colliculus (IC) is an information processing hub that receives widespread 25 convergent projections. It contains two non-lemniscal divisions - the dorsal (DC) and lateral (LC) 26 cortices - that receive major cortical and multisensory projections. The LC in particular has 27 repeated molecular motifs that govern its input-output relationships. However, because the LC 28 is buried deep within a sulcus, it has been impossible to study by imaging, and thus difficult to 29 answer questions about its functional organization. Here, we couple two-photon microscopy with use of a microprism to reveal the first-ever sagittal views containing functional maps of the LC with cellular resolution. We used this novel approach to examine neuronal responses with respect to LC motifs, and demonstrate the LC is functionally distinct from DC. This method will not only provide new insights about the auditory system, but will also permit imaging of hidden brain regions previously un-imageable by conventional means.

                Cognition and attention arise from the adaptive coordination of neural systems in response to external and internal demands. The low-dimensional latent subspace that underlies large-scale neural dynamics and the relationships of these dynamics to cognitive and attentional states, however, are unknown. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging as human participants performed attention tasks, watched comedy sitcom episodes and an educational documentary, and rested. Whole-brain dynamics traversed a common set of latent states that spanned canonical gradients of functional brain organization, with global synchrony among functional networks modulating state transitions. Neural state dynamics were synchronized across people during engaging movie watching and aligned to narrative event structures. Neural state dynamics reflected attention fluctuations such that different states indicated engaged attention in task and naturalistic contexts whereas a common state indicated attention lapses in both contexts. Together, these results demonstrate that traversals along large-scale gradients of human brain organization reflect cognitive and attentional dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Meta-analytic evidence for a novel hierarchical model of conceptual processing</a></h4>

              
                Conceptual knowledge plays a pivotal role in human cognition. Grounded cognition theories propose that concepts consist of perceptual-motor features represented in modality-specific perceptual-motor cortices. However, it is unclear whether conceptual processing consistently engages modality-specific areas. Here, we performed an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis across 212 neuroimaging experiments on conceptual processing related to 7 perceptual-motor modalities (action, sound, visual shape, motion, color, olfaction-gustation, and emotion). We found that conceptual processing consistently engages brain regions also activated during real perceptual-motor experience of the same modalities. In addition, we identified multimodal convergence zones that are recruited for multiple modalities. In particular, the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) and posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) are engaged for three modalities: action, motion, and sound. These "trimodal" regions are surrounded by "bimodal" regions engaged for two modalities. Our findings support a novel model of the conceptual system, according to which conceptual processing relies on a hierarchical neural architecture from modality-specific to multimodal areas up to an amodal hub.

                Objective: Based on network pharmacology, the response of Qing-tong-hua-yu Decoction (QTHY) to the regulation of EGFR/MAPK signaling cascade in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was discussed and the possible mechanism of the protective effect of QTHY on the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was studied. Methods: A compound-target disease-function-pathway network was established and analyzed based on the network pharmacology approach used in Chinese medicine. The correlation, which is between effect of the components of QTHY Decoction against CI/RI with EGFR/MAPK signalling cascade response, was observed. And then the degree of neurological deficits in each group was assessed after cerebral ischemia for 2 hours and reperfusion for 3 hours, 24 hours, 3 days and 7 days. Expression levels of EGFR and p44/42MAPK in ischemic brain tissue at different time points in various groups of rats were tested by Western bolt (WB), real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: Network pharmacology analysis revealed that QTHY-mediated treatment involved 439 key targets, in which the effect of QTHY groups against CI/RI was associated with EGFR/MAPK signaling cascade. QTHY treatment reduced neurological deficit scores and improved ischemic changes in rats. In addition, QTHY promoted EGFR and p44/42MAPK expression in the SVZ through the EGFR/MAPK signaling cascade, with varying degrees of improvement at different time points. Conclusion: QTHY can better improve cerebral ischemia injury in CI / RI rats and exert the neuroprotective effect of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. This may be related to the potential of QTHY to activate the EGFR / MAPK signaling cascade, which is consistent with the results of network pharmacology analysis.

                Background: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric condition leading to significant distress and poor quality of life. Successful treatment of OCD is restricted by the limited knowledge about its pathophysiology. This study aimed to investigate the pathophysiology of OCD using electroencephalographic (EEG) event related potentials (ERP), elicited from multiple tasks to characterise disorder-related differences in underlying brain activity across multiple neural processes. Methods: ERP data were obtained from 25 OCD patients and 27 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) by recording EEG during Flanker and Go/Nogo tasks. Error-related negativity (ERN) was elicited by the Flanker task, while N200 and P300 were generated using the Go/Nogo task. Primary comparisons of the neural response amplitudes and the topographical distribution of neural activity were conducted using scalp field differences across all time points and electrodes. Results: Compared to HC, the OCD group showed altered ERP distributions. Contrasting with the previous literature on ERN and N200 topographies in OCD where fronto-central negative voltages were reported, we detected positive voltages. Additionally, the P300 was found to be less negative in the frontal regions. None of these ERP findings were associated with OCD symptom severity. Conclusions: These results indicate that individuals with OCD show altered frontal neural activity across multiple executive function related processes, supporting the frontal dysfunction theory of OCD. Furthermore, due to the lack of association between altered ERPs and OCD symptom severity, they may be considered potential candidate endophenotypes for OCD.

                The intensity of muscle contraction, and therefore movement vigour, needs to be adaptable to enable complex motor behaviors. This can be achieved by adjusting the properties of motor neurons, which form the final common pathway for all motor output from the central nervous system. Here we identify novel roles for a neuropeptide, Cocaine and Amphetamine Regulated Transcript (CART), in the control of movement vigour. We reveal distinct, but parallel mechanisms by which CART and acetylcholine, both released at C bouton synapses on motor neurons, selectively amplify the output of subtypes of motor neurons that are recruited during intense movement. We find that mice with broad genetic deletion of CART or selective elimination of acetylcholine from C boutons exhibit deficits in behavioral tasks that require higher levels of motor output. Overall, these data uncover novel spinal modulatory mechanisms that control movement vigour to support movements that require a high degree of muscle force.

                Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition with several major hallmarks, including loss of substantia nigra neurons, reduction in striatal dopaminergic function, and formation of alpha-synuclein-rich Lewy bodies. Mutations in SNCA, encoding for alpha-synuclein, are a known cause of familial PD, and the G51D mutation causes a particularly aggressive form of the condition. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to introduce the G51D mutation into the endogenous rat SNCA gene. SNCAG51D/+ and SNCAG51D/G51D rats were born in Mendelian ratios and did not exhibit any severe behavourial defects. L-3,4-dihydroxy-6-18F-fluorophenylalanine (18F-DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was used to investigate this novel rat model. Wild-type (WT), SNCAG51D/+ and SNCAG51D/G51D rats were characterised over the course of ageing (5, 11, and 16 months old) using 18F-DOPA PET imaging and kinetic modelling. We measured the influx rate constant (Ki) and effective distribution volume ratio (EDVR) of 18F-DOPA in the striatum relative to the cerebellum in WT, SNCAG51D/+ and SNCAG51D/G51D rats. A significant reduction in EDVR was observed in SNCAG51D/G51D rats at 16 months of age indicative of increased dopamine turnover. Furthermore, we observed a significant asymmetry in EDVR between the left and right striatum in aged SNCAG51D/G51D rats. The increased and asymmetric dopamine turnover observed in the striatum of aged SNCAG51D/G51D rats is similar to prodromal PD, which suggests the presence of compensatory mechanisms. SNCAG51D rats represent a novel genetic model of PD, and kinetic modelling of 18F-DOPA PET data has identified a highly relevant early disease phenotype.

	<p>Dysregulation of high-frequency neuronal oscillations has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Chronic methamphetamine (METH) use can induce psychosis similar to paranoid schizophrenia. The current study in mice aimed to determine the effect of chronic METH treatment on ongoing and evoked neuronal oscillations. C57BL/6 mice were treated with METH or vehicle control for three weeks and implanted with extradural recording electrodes. Two weeks after the last METH injection, mice underwent three EEG recording sessions to measure ongoing and auditory-evoked gamma and beta oscillatory power in response to an acute challenge with METH (2 mg/kg), the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (0.3 mg/kg), or saline control. A separate group of mice pretreated with METH showed significantly greater locomotor hyperactivity to an acute METH challenge, confirming long-term sensitisation. Chronic METH did not affect ongoing or evoked gamma or beta power. Acute MK-801 challenge reduced ongoing beta power whereas acute METH challenge significantly increased ongoing gamma power. Both MK-801 and METH challenge suppressed evoked gamma power. Chronic METH treatment did not modulate these acute drug effects. There were minor effects of chronic METH and acute METH and MK-801 on selected components of event-related potential (ERP) waves. In conclusion, chronic METH treatment did not exert neuroplastic effects on the regulation of cortical gamma oscillations in a manner consistent with schizophrenia, despite causing behavioural sensitisation.</p>

	<p>Globally, stroke is a leading cause of death and disability. The classification of motor intentions using brain activity is an important task in the rehabilitation of stroke patients using brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCIs). This paper presents a new method for model training in EEG-based BCI rehabilitation by using overlapping time windows. For this aim, three different models, a convolutional neural network (CNN), graph isomorphism network (GIN), and long short-term memory (LSTM), are used for performing the classification task of motor attempt (MA). We conducted several experiments with different time window lengths, and the results showed that the deep learning approach based on overlapping time windows achieved improvements in classification accuracy, with the LSTM combined vote-counting strategy (VS) having achieved the highest average classification accuracy of 90.3% when the window size was 70. The results verified that the overlapping time window strategy is useful for increasing the efficiency of BCI rehabilitation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cookies rich in iron (Fe), folic acid, cobalamin (vitamin B12), and antioxidants: a novel functional food potential for adolescent with anemia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Anemia is a global public health problem, including Indonesia with 32% of adolescents are anemic. This study aims to process porang flour, moringa leaves, and tempe into cookies that are high in iron (Fe), folic acid, cobalamin (vitamin B12), and antioxidants as potential functional food snacks for adolescents with anemia. Methods: This study is experimental with a completely randomized trial design (CRD) with three treatments and replications. There are three comparison formulations of a combination of porang, moringa leaves, and black soybean-based tempe; respectively F1 (91:3:3:3)%, F2 (85:3:6:6)%, and F3 (77:3:10:10)%. The cookie sample was then analyzed for water content, ash, iron, folic acid, cobalt, and antioxidant activity. The differences between the samples were analyzed based on the activity of antioxidants, iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12 (cobalamin) in data obtained from triplicates using multivariate ANOVA analysis. Results: The results of the ash and water content tests of all three cookie formulations showed values in accordance with the Indonesian National Standard (SNI) for cookie products. F3 has significantly higher iron, folic acid, and cobalt levels than F1 and F2 (p<0.05). Antioxidant activity is highest in F3, but there is no statistical difference between F2 and F3 (p>0.05). Conclusions: The combination of porang's tubers, moringa leaves, and tempe made from black soybeans, especially F3, has the potential to be used as a functional cookie processed product source of iron (Fe), folic acid, cobalamin, and antioxidants for adolescent anemia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">What is the association between common medications (indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen) and spontaneous intestinal perforations in premature infants? A systematic review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) affects very low birth weight preterm neonates and accounts for 44% of gastrointestinal perforations. Commonly used medications such as indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen for PDA closure, increases the risk of intestinal perforation. Unfortunately, the majority of the data combine SIP with those affected by necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) despite them being separate entities. This systematic review aims to explore the association between the use of common medications and SIP in the premature infant cohort independently from NEC. Methods: Our study will focus on preterm infants with exposure to either indomethacin, ibuprofen or acetaminophen where SIP is a reported outcome. A health science librarian will search Medline and Medline in Process via OVID, Embase Classic + Embase via OVID, the LILACS database, the ScIELO database and the Cochrane Library including EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Search dates for each database will be from their respective dates of inception to March 2022. All articles will undergo screening by two independent reviewers, and if selected, data extraction with risk of bias assessment by two independent reviewers. A third reviewer will settle any disagreements that may occur. Incidence of SIP will be measured as a proportion. Individual proportions will be pooled using a random effects logistic regression model. The comparative incidence of SIP by treatment group will be measured using the odds ratio. Odds ratios will be pooled using the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model for meta-analysis. PROSPERO Registration: CRD42017058603

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Burden of disease in Colombian Orinoquia, 2017 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Population health diagnoses are a fundamental tool to guide health policies and programs, and consequently, public health requirements. In this perspective, the burden of disease in inhabitants of Colombian Orinoquia is quantified for the first time. Methods: A descriptive population-based study that was based on secondary sources was carried out, which aimed at measuring the burden of the disease in the Colombian region of Orinoquia, using the simplified synthetic indicator of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of the global health estimation methodology. We used mortality records from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) and service provision records from the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Colombia, both records from the year 2017, available on the Integrated Social Protection Information System. Results: 288,740.2 DALYs occurred (95% UI 210,714.6-382,948.8), with higher reports for men (59%); group of non-communicable diseases accounted for 62.3% of DALY (179,993.6, 95% UI, 115,030.2-268,405.0), followed by external cause injuries group which contributed 24.6% (71,000.0, 95% UI, 25,638.1-134,013.1), and group of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders which contributed 13.1% (37,746.0, 95% UI, 28,048.0-50,239.7). Interpersonal violence was the primary cause specific of DALYs with 9.8% of the burden, (28,290.0, 95% UI, 7,365.1-64,208.1). Conclusions: Most DALYs in Orinoquia are produced by non-communicable diseases (NCD), largely caused by neoplasms and cardiovascular disease, which increased with age. However, when considered by specific cause of illness or injury, interpersonal violence is indicated as the main cause of DALYs, affecting mainly young men, possibly as an expression of social inequality, substance use, criminality, and insecurity. It is important to highlight that this region has been recognized as an area of armed conflict, drug trafficking, and poverty.

                Agronomic traits of plants especially those of economic or aesthetic importance are threatened by climatic and environmental factors such as climate change, biotic, and abiotic stresses. These threats are now being mitigated through the analyses of omics data like genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics. The emergence of high-throughput omics technology has led to an avalanche of plant omics data. Plant research demands novel analytical paradigms to extract and harness large plant omics data for plant improvement effectively and efficiently. Machine learning algorithms are well-suited analytical and computational approaches for the integrative analysis of large unstructured, heterogeneous datasets. This study presents an overview of omics approaches to improve plant agronomic traits and crucial curated plant genomic data sources. Furthermore, we summarize machine learning algorithms and software tools/programming packages used in plant omics research. Lastly, we discuss advancements in machine learning algorithms' applications in improving agronomic traits of economically important plants. Extensive application of machine learning would advance plant omics studies. These advancements would consequently help agricultural scientists improve economically important plants’ quality, yield, and tolerance against abiotic and biotic stresses and other plant health-threatening issues.

                Introduction Hand injuries are a recognized occupational hazard from the use of chaff cutters. With increasing mechanization of farming in our region, the burden of hand injuries is poised to increase. Methods We conducted a descriptive study of 47 patients presenting with chaff cutter hand injuries at our center in one year. Results They were predominantly male (98%) and the majority (70%) were aged between 21 and 40 years. The majority of patients who had not resumed work were those with severe injuries and those who had had an amputation. There was a positive correlation between age category and severity of injury. Discussion Chaff cutter injuries contribute considerably to hand amputations at our center. The majority of patients with severe injuries and those undergoing amputations do not return to gainful activities one year after sustaining the injury, suggesting increased dependency. Further research is paramount to identify safety features of chaff cutters in this region.

                Background: A growing population of cells accumulates mutations. A single mutation early in the growth process carries forward to all descendant cells, causing the final population to have a lot of mutant cells. When the first mutation happens later in growth, the final population typically has fewer mutants. The number of mutant cells in the final population follows the Luria-Delbrück distribution. The mathematical form of the distribution is known only from its probability generating function. For larger populations of cells, one typically uses computer simulations to estimate the distribution. Methods: This article searches for a simple approximation of the Luria-Delbrück distribution, with an explicit mathematical form that can be used easily in calculations. Results: The Fréchet distribution provides a good approximation for the Luria-Delbrück distribution for neutral mutations, which do not cause a growth rate change relative to the original cells. Conclusions: The Fréchet distribution apparently provides a good match through its description of extreme value problems for multiplicative processes such as exponential growth.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Role of RAS signaling in ovarian cancer [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The RAS family of proteins is among the most frequently mutated genes in human malignancies. In ovarian cancer (OC), the most lethal gynecological malignancy, RAS, especially KRAS mutational status at codons 12, 13, and 61, ranges from 6–65% spanning different histo-types. Normally RAS regulates several signaling pathways involved in a myriad of cellular signaling cascades mediating numerous cellular processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, invasion, and death. Aberrant activation of RAS leads to uncontrolled induction of several downstream signaling pathways such as RAF-1/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), PI3K phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT, RalGEFs, Rac/Rho, BRAF (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B), MEK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1), ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), PKB (protein kinase B) and PKC (protein kinase C) involved in cell proliferation as well as maintenance pathways thereby driving tumorigenesis and cancer cell propagation. KRAS mutation is also known to be a biomarker for poor outcome and chemoresistance in OC. As a malignancy with several histotypes showing varying histopathological characteristics, we focus on reviewing recent literature showcasing the involvement of oncogenic RAS in mediating carcinogenesis and chemoresistance in OC and its subtypes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Integration of single-cell RNA-Seq and CyTOF data characterises heterogeneity of rare cell subpopulations [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The simultaneous measurement of cellular proteins and transcriptomes of single cell data has become an exciting new possibility with the advent of highly multiplexed multi-omics methodologies. However, mass cytometry (CyTOF) is a well-established, affordable technique for the analysis of proteomic data, which is well suited for the discovery and characterisation of very rare subpopulations of cells with a wealth of publicly available datasets. Methods: We present and evaluate the multimodal integration of single cell RNA-Seq and CyTOF datasets coming from both matched and unmatched samples, using two publicly available datasets. Results: We demonstrate that the integration of well annotated CyTOF data with single cell RNA sequencing can aid in the identification and annotation of cell populations with high accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the integration can provide imputed measurements of protein markers which are comparable to the current gold standard of antibody derived tags (ADT) from CITE-Seq for both matched and unmatched datasets. Using this methodology, we identify and transcriptionally characterise a rare subpopulation of CD11c positive B cells in high resolution using publicly available data and we unravel its heterogeneity in a single cell setting without the need to sort the cells in advance, in a manner which had not been previously possible. Conclusions: This approach provides the framework for using available proteomic and transcriptomic datasets in a unified and unbiased fashion to assist ongoing and future studies of cellular characterisation and biomarker identification.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Job Search during COVID-19: How Online Mindfulness Intervention helped to Reduce Stress and Enhance the Self-esteem of the Job Seeker [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Immediately after graduation from university, college students need to make significant decisions about starting their careers or pursuing higher studies. They are also pressured to meet the expectations and demands of self, others, and the environment. Owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the aforementioned challenging decisions may become hazardous stressors for college students. Hence, the researchers intended to assist and assess the college students involved in student placements. The research goal was to investigate the impact of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on the stress and self-esteem of college students involved in student placements.  Methods: One hundred college students participating in the campus placements were selected using purposive sampling from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University in Coimbatore, India. For evaluation purposes, college students were administered the perceived stress, Rosenberg self-esteem, and Kuppuswamy socio-economic scales. Seventy-five college students were selected for the MBI process and were administered with a pre-intervention and post-intervention without a control group research design. Results: Statistical analysis including analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Bonferroni post hoc test showed a significant increase in self-esteem and a decrease in the stress of the college students involved in placements. Conclusions: Thus, the researchers recommend that policymakers create awareness, include MBI in the curriculum, and allocate funds for training ventures in educational institutions to assist college students in their challenging life journeys

                Intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring abnormalities had been reported to correlate with decreased umbilical artery base excess associated with neonatal seizures. However, we present an infant born at 35 weeks of gestation diagnosed with cerebral palsy associated with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) without fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring abnormalities, According to the summary reports of PVL cases published on the home page of the Japan Obstetric Compensation System for Cerebral Palsy (JOCSC)), the percentage of placenta previa without FHR monitoring abnormalities in the cases of PVL was 5.7% (12/209), which seemed to be higher than the total percentage of placenta previa reported in Japan (0.3-0.5%).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferring parameters of cancer evolution in chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nathan D. Lee, Ivana Bozic</p>

As a cancer develops, its cells accrue new mutations, resulting in a heterogeneous, complex genomic profile. We make use of this heterogeneity to derive simple, analytic estimates of parameters driving carcinogenesis and reconstruct the timeline of selective events following initiation of an individual cancer, where two longitudinal samples are available for sequencing. Using stochastic computer simulations of cancer growth, we show that we can accurately estimate mutation rate, time before and after a driver event occurred, and growth rates of both initiated cancer cells and subsequently appearing subclones. We demonstrate that in order to obtain accurate estimates of mutation rate and timing of events, observed mutation counts should be corrected to account for clonal mutations that occurred after the founding of the tumor, as well as sequencing coverage. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which often does not require treatment for years after diagnosis, presents an optimal system to study the untreated, natural evolution of cancer cell populations. When we apply our methodology to reconstruct the individual evolutionary histories of CLL patients, we find that the parental leukemic clone typically appears within the first fifteen years of life.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Neocortical Lewy body pathology parallels Parkinson's dementia, but not always</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate the relationship between Parkinson's disease (PD) with dementia and cortical proteinopathies in a large population of pathologically confirmed PD patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We reviewed clinical data from all patients with autopsy data seen in the Movement Disorders Center at Washington University, St. Louis between 1996 and 2019. All patients with a diagnosis of PD based on neuropathology were included. We used logistic regression and MANCOVA to investigate the relationship between neuropathology and dementia.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 165 PD patients met inclusion criteria. Among these, 128 had clinical dementia. Those with dementia had greater mean ages of motor onset and death but equivalent mean disease duration. The delay between motor symptom onset and dementia was one year or less in 14 individuals, meeting research diagnostic criteria for possible or probable dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Braak Lewy body stage was associated with diagnosis of dementia, whereas severities of Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) and small vessel pathology did not. Pathology of individuals diagnosed with DLB did not differ significantly from that of other PD patients with dementia. 6% of individuals with PD and dementia did not have neocortical Lewy bodies; 68% with PD but without dementia did have neocortical Lewy bodies.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Neocortical Lewy bodies almost always accompany dementia in PD; however, they also appear in most PD patients without dementia. In some cases, dementia may occur in PD patients without neocortical Lewy bodies, ADNC, or small vessel disease. Thus, other factors not directly related to these classic neuropathologic features may contribute to PD dementia.</p>

                van Heurck et al. identify CROCCP2, a hominid-specific gene duplicate, as a human-specific modifier of neurogenesis in the developing cerebral cortex. They find that CROCCP2 is necessary and sufficient to enhance human cortical progenitor amplification and acts by decreasing primary cilia dynamics and enhancing the mTOR pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Condensin DC loads and spreads from recruitment sites to create loop-anchored TADs in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Condensins are molecular motors that compact DNA via linear translocation. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, the X-chromosome harbors a specialized condensin that participates in dosage compensation (DC). Condensin DC is recruited to and spreads from a small number of <i>r</i>ecruitment <i>e</i>lements on the <i>X</i>-chromosome (<i>rex</i>) and is required for the formation of topologically associating domains (TADs). We take advantage of autosomes that are largely devoid of condensin DC and TADs to address how <i>rex</i> sites and condensin DC give rise to the formation of TADs. When an autosome and X-chromosome are physically fused, despite the spreading of condensin DC into the autosome, no TAD was created. Insertion of a strong <i>rex</i> on the X-chromosome results in the TAD boundary formation regardless of sequence orientation. When the same <i>rex</i> is inserted on an autosome, despite condensin DC recruitment, there was no spreading or features of a TAD. On the other hand, when a ‘<i>super rex</i>’ composed of six <i>rex</i> sites or three separate <i>rex</i> sites are inserted on an autosome, recruitment and spreading of condensin DC led to the formation of TADs. Therefore, recruitment to and spreading from <i>rex</i> sites are necessary and sufficient for recapitulating loop-anchored TADs observed on the X-chromosome. Together our data suggest a model in which <i>rex</i> sites are both loading sites and bidirectional barriers for condensin DC, a one-sided loop-extruder with movable inactive anchor.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The interpretation of computational model parameters depends on the context</a></h4>

              
                Reinforcement Learning (RL) models have revolutionized the cognitive and brain sciences, promising to explain behavior from simple conditioning to complex problem solving, to shed light on developmental and individual differences, and to anchor cognitive processes in specific brain mechanisms. However, the RL literature increasingly reveals contradictory results, which might cast doubt on these claims. We hypothesized that many contradictions arise from two commonly-held assumptions about computational model parameters that are actually often invalid: That parameters <i>generalize</i> between contexts (e.g. tasks, models) and that they capture <i>interpretable</i> (i.e. unique, distinctive) neurocognitive processes. To test this, we asked 291 participants aged 8–30 years to complete three learning tasks in one experimental session, and fitted RL models to each. We found that some parameters (exploration / decision noise) showed significant generalization: they followed similar developmental trajectories, and were reciprocally predictive between tasks. Still, generalization was significantly below the methodological ceiling. Furthermore, other parameters (learning rates, forgetting) did not show evidence of generalization, and sometimes even opposite developmental trajectories. Interpretability was low for all parameters. We conclude that the systematic study of context factors (e.g. reward stochasticity; task volatility) will be necessary to enhance the generalizability and interpretability of computational cognitive models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Optimized tight binding between the S1 segment and KCNE3 is required for the constitutively open nature of the KCNQ1-KCNE3 channel complex</a></h4>

              
                Tetrameric voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels have four identical voltage sensor domains, and they regulate channel gating. KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) is a voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel, and its auxiliary subunit KCNE proteins dramatically regulate its gating. For example, KCNE3 makes KCNQ1 a constitutively open channel at physiological voltages by affecting the voltage sensor movement. However, how KCNE proteins regulate the voltage sensor domain is largely unknown. In this study, by utilizing the KCNQ1-KCNE3-calmodulin complex structure, we thoroughly surveyed amino acid residues on KCNE3 and the S1 segment of the KCNQ1 voltage sensor facing each other. By changing the side-chain bulkiness of these interacting amino acid residues (volume scanning), we found that the distance between the S1 segment and KCNE3 is elaborately optimized to achieve the constitutive activity. In addition, we identified two pairs of KCNQ1 and KCNE3 mutants that partially restored constitutive activity by co-expression. Our work suggests that tight binding of the S1 segment and KCNE3 is crucial for controlling the voltage sensor domains.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High-resolution secretory timeline from vesicle formation at the Golgi to fusion at the plasma membrane in S. cerevisiae</a></h4>

              
                Most of the components in the yeast secretory pathway have been studied, yet a high-resolution temporal timeline of their participation is lacking. Here we define the order of acquisition, lifetime, and release of critical components involved in late secretion from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Of particular interest is the timing of the many reported effectors of the secretory vesicle Rab protein Sec4, including the myosin-V Myo2, the exocyst complex, the lgl homolog Sro7, and the small yeast-specific protein Mso1. At the trans-Golgi network (TGN) Sec4's GEF, Sec2, is recruited to Ypt31-positive compartments, quickly followed by Sec4 and Myo2 and vesicle formation. While transported to the bud tip, the entire exocyst complex, including Sec3, is assembled on to the vesicle. Before fusion, vesicles tether for 5s, during which the vesicle retains the exocyst complex and stimulates lateral recruitment of Rho3 on the plasma membrane. Sec2 and Myo2 are rapidly lost, followed by recruitment of cytosolic Sro7, and finally the SM protein Sec1, which appears for just 2 seconds prior to fusion. Perturbation experiments reveal an ordered and robust series of events during tethering that provide insights into the function of Sec4 and effector exchange.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Translational rapid ultraviolet-excited sectioning tomography for whole-organ multicolor imaging with real-time molecular staining</a></h4>

              
                Rapid multicolor three-dimensional (3D) imaging for centimeter-scale specimens with subcellular resolution remains a challenging but captivating scientific pursuit. Here, we present a fast, cost-effective, and robust multicolor whole-organ 3D imaging method assisted with ultraviolet (UV) surface excitation and vibratomy-assisted sectioning, termed translational rapid ultraviolet-excited sectioning tomography (TRUST). With an inexpensive UV light-emitting diode (UV-LED) and a color camera, TRUST achieves widefield exogenous molecular-specific fluorescence and endogenous content-rich autofluorescence imaging simultaneously while preserving low system complexity and system cost. Formalin-fixed specimens are stained layer by layer along with serial mechanical sectioning to achieve automated 3D imaging with high staining uniformity and time efficiency. 3D models of all vital organs in wild-type C57BL/6 mice with the 3D structure of their internal components (e.g., vessel network, glomeruli, and nerve tracts) can be reconstructed after imaging with TRUST to demonstrate its fast, robust, and high-content multicolor 3D imaging capability. Moreover, its potential for developmental biology has also been validated by imaging entire mouse embryos (~2 days for the embryo at the embryonic day of 15). TRUST offers a fast and cost-effective approach for high-resolution whole-organ multicolor 3D imaging while relieving researchers from the heavy sample preparation workload.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a looming public health disaster with limited interventions. Progress in therapeutic development requires a more detailed understanding of molecular pathogenesis. Most data for AD pathogenesis in humans is from standard neuropathologic assessments, e.g., neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles or biochemical measurement of a limited number of analytes related to neuropathologic features, e.g., amyloid-{beta} peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau. Standard neuropathologic evaluation is highly valuable as it provides assessment of diseases that afflict an individual brain, but it also is limited in its ability to investigate molecular pathogenesis. Modern mass spectrometry-based proteomics enable quantitative insight into the protein phenotype in brains with AD neuropathology. Careful selection of specimens enabled us to investigate protein signatures specific to autosomal dominant AD dementia (ADD), sporadic ADD with minimal comorbidities, individuals without dementia who had high histopathologic burden of AD, and cognitively normal individuals with no or minimal AD histopathologic burden. All data are deposited in the ProteomeXchange proteomic data repositories (ID: PXD034525).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Target-distractor competition modulates saccade trajectories in space and object-space</a></h4>

              
                Saccade planning and execution can be affected by a multitude of factors present in a target selection task. Recent studies have shown that the similarity between a target and nearby distractors affects the curvature of saccade trajectories, due to target-distractor competition. To further understand the nature of this competition, we varied the distance between and the similarity of complex target and distractor objects in a delayed match-to-sample task to examine their effects on saccade trajectories and better understand the underlying neural circuitry. For trials with short saccadic reaction times (SRTs) when target-distractor competition is still active, we found a robust effect of distance consistent with saccade vector averaging, whereas the effect of similarity suggested the existence of an object-based suppressive surround. At longer SRTs there was sufficient time for competition between the objects to complete and the distractor to be inhibited, which resulted in saccade trajectory deviations exhibiting the effects of a spatial suppressive surround. In terms of similarity, as the target-distractor similarity decreased, the initial saccade angle shifted towards the target, reflecting stronger distractor inhibition. There were no interactions between distance and similarity at any point in the time-course of target-distractor competition. Taken together, saccade trajectories reflect target-distractor competition that is affected independently by both spatial and object-space suppressive surrounds. The differences in saccade trajectories at short and long SRTs distinguish between active and completed decision-making processes. Thus, saccade responses are more beneficial than manual responses in studies of decision-making models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissecting the chain of information processing and its interplay with neurochemicals and fluid intelligence across development</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has highlighted the role of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in perceptual, cognitive, and motor tasks. However, the exact involvement of these neurochemical mechanisms in the chain of information processing, and across human development, are unclear. In a cross-sectional longitudinal design, we used a computational approach to dissociate cognitive, decision, and visuomotor processing in 293 individuals spanning early childhood to adulthood. We found that glutamate and GABA within the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) explained unique variance in visuomotor processing, with higher glutamate predicting poorer visuomotor processing in younger participants but better visuomotor processing in mature participants, while GABA showed the opposite pattern. These findings were functionally, neuroanatomically, and neurochemically specific, and were replicated ~1.5 years later and were generalized in two further different behavioral tasks. Using resting fMRI, we revealed that the relationship between IPS neurochemicals and visuomotor processing is mediated by functional connectivity in the visuomotor network. We then extended our findings to high-level cognitive behavior by predicting fluid intelligence performance. We showed that fluid intelligence performance is explained by IPS GABA and glutamate and is mediated by visuomotor processing, and moderated by the developmental stage. These results provide an integrative biological and psychological mechanistic explanation that links cognitive processes and neurotransmitters across human development and establishes their involvement in intelligent behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seeing our hand or a tool during visually-guided actions: different effects on the somatosensory and visual cortices</a></h4>

              
                The processing of proprioceptive information in the context of a conflict between visual and somatosensory feedbacks deteriorates motor performance. Previous studies have shown that seeing one's hand increases the weighting assigned to arm somatosensory inputs. In this light, we hypothesized that the sensory conflict, when tracing the contour of a shape with mirror-reversed vision, will be greater for participants who trace with a stylus seen in their hand (Hand group, n=17) than for participants who trace with the tip of rod without seen their hand (Tool group, n=15). Based on this hypothesis, we predicted that the tracing performance with mirror vision will be more deteriorated for the Hand group than for the Tool group, and we predicted a greater gating of somatosensory information for the Hand group to reduce the sensory conflict. The participants of both groups followed the outline of a shape in two visual conditions. Direct vision: the participants saw the hand or portion of a light 40 cm rod directly. Mirror Vision: the hand or the rod was seen through a mirror. We measured tracing performance using a digitizing tablet and the cortical activity with electroencephalography. Behavioral analyses revealed that the tracing performance of both groups was similarly impaired by mirror vision. However, contrasting the spectral content of the cortical oscillatory activity between the Mirror and Direct conditions, we observed that tracing with mirror vision resulted in significantly larger alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (15-25 Hz) powers in the somatosensory cortex for participants of the Hand group. The somatosensory alpha and beta powers did not significantly differ between Mirror and Direct vision conditions for the Tool group. For both groups, tracing with mirror vision altered the activity of the visual cortex: decreased alpha power for the Hand group, decreased alpha and beta power for the Tool group. Overall, these results suggest that seeing the hand enhanced the sensory conflict when tracing with mirror vision and that the increase of alpha and beta powers in the somatosensory cortex served to reduce the weight assigned to somatosensory information. The increased activity of the visual cortex observed for both groups in the mirror vision condition suggests greater visual processing with increased task difficulty. Finally, the fact that the participants of the Tool group did not show better tracing performance than those of the Hand group suggests that tracing deterioration resulted from a sensorimotor conflict (as opposed to a visuo-proprioceptive conflict).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robust and consistent measures of pattern separation based on information theory and demonstrated in the dentate gyrus</a></h4>

              
                Pattern separation is a valuable computational function performed by neuronal circuits, such as the dentate gyrus, where dissimilarity between inputs is increased, reducing noise and increasing the storage capacity of downstream networks. A number of different measures (such as orthogonalisation, decorrelation, or spike train distance) have been applied to quantify the process of pattern separation. However, these are known to give conclusions that can differ qualitatively depending on the choice of measure and the parameters used to calculate it. We here demonstrate that arbitrarily increasing sparsity, a noticeable feature of dentate granule cell firing and one that is believed to be key to pattern separation, typically leads to improved classical measures for pattern separation even, inappropriately, up to the point where almost all information about the inputs is lost. Standard measures therefore both cannot differentiate between pattern separation and pattern destruction, and give results that may depend on arbitrary parameter choices. We propose that techniques from information theory, in particular mutual information, transfer entropy, and redundancy, should be applied to penalise the potential for lost information (often due to increased sparsity) that is neglected by existing measures. We compare five commonly-used measures of pattern separation with three novel techniques based on information theory, showing that the latter can be applied in a principled way and provide a robust and reliable measure for comparing the pattern separation performance of different neurons and networks. We demonstrate our new measures on detailed compartmental models of individual dentate granule cells and a dentate microcircuit, and show how structural changes associated with epilepsy affect pattern separation performance. Overall, our measures solve a widely acknowledged problem in assessing the pattern separation of neural circuits such as the dentate gyrus, as well as the cerebellum and mushroom body. Finally we provide a publicly available toolbox allowing for easy analysis of pattern separation in spike train ensembles.

Author summaryThe hippocampus is a region of the brain strongly associated with spatial navigation and encoding of episodic memories. To perform these functions effectively it makes use of circuits that perform pattern separation, where redundant structure is removed from neural representations leaving only the most salient information. Pattern separation allows downstream networks to better distinguish between similar situations. Pathological changes, caused by Alzheimers, schizophrenia, or epilepsy, to the circuits that perform pattern separation are associated with reduced discriminative ability in both animal models and humans. Traditionally, pattern separation has been described alongside the downstream networks that receive the separated representations, but more recent studies have focussed on the detailed neuronal and circuit features that contribute to pattern separation alone. We here show that traditional measures of pattern separation are inappropriate in this case, as they do not give consistent conclusions when parameters are changed and can confound pattern separation with the loss of important information. We show that directly accounting for the information throughput of a pattern separation circuit can provide new measures of pattern separation that are robust and consistent, and allow for nuanced analysis of the structure-function relationship of such circuits and how this may be perturbed by pathology.

                Recent studies have suggested the glymphatic system as a solute transport pathway and waste removal mechanism in the brain. Imaging intracisternally administered tracers provides the opportunity of assessing various aspects of the glymphatic function in vivo. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI allows the evaluation of both the kinetics and spatial distribution of tracer transport throughout the brain. In this study, we investigated the impact of the molecular size of intracisternal tracers on the transport kinetics and distribution in the healthy mouse brain. Three MRI contrast agents with drastically different molecular weights (MWs): 1) Gd-DTPA (MW=661.8 Da), 2) GadoSpin (MW=200 kDa), and 3) oxygen-17 enriched water (H217O, MW=19 Da), were administered via cisterna magna infusion and their transport was dynamically assessed. Our results show that the transport of H217O was significantly faster and more extensive than the two gadolinium-based contrast agents. Time-lagged correlation analysis and clustering analysis comparing the kinetics of Gd-DTPA and H217O transport also showed different cluster patterns and lag time between different regions of the brain. Further, there were also significant differences in the transport kinetics of the three tracers to the lateral ventricles. These observations suggest the size-dependent differences in forces that drive tracer transport in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reward prediction error neurons implement an efficient code for reward</a></h4>

              
                We apply efficient coding principles to derive the optimal population of neurons to encode rewards from a distribution. Similar to this optimal population, dopaminergic reward prediction error neurons have a broad distribution of optimistically placed thresholds, neurons with higher thresholds have higher gain and the curvature of their responses depends on the threshold. Thus, these neurons may broadcast an efficient reward signal, not necessarily a reward prediction error.

                Neuronal response to nutrient availability plays an important role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and behavioral response to the environment in higher eukaryotes. However, we know little about how neuronal function is influenced by acute changes in nutrients at high resolution. Taking advantage of powerful fly genetics and the amenability of the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), we have investigated the synaptic response to acute amino acid restriction. Our findings indicate that the presence of general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) and phosphorylation of its target eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2alpha) are essential for the ability of the NMJ to maintain normal neurotransmitter output when the larvae are deprived of amino acids. Surprisingly, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which normally acts downstream of GCN2/eIF2alpha, appears dispensable in this regulation. Furthermore, we show that GCN2/eIF2alpha dependent cascade acts retrogradely from muscle back to motoneuron to adjust synaptic release. These results provide a mechanistic insight into the intricate regulation of synaptic strength through the action of GCN2 when organisms are faced with amino acid scarcity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct feedforward and feedback pathways for cell-type specific attention effects in macaque V4.</a></h4>

              
                Attention gates the flow of sensory information across brain areas. Mechanistically, attention should depend on a modulation of both feedback (FB) and feedforward (FF) projections, which terminate in distinct laminar compartments and target specific neural populations. We performed simultaneous laminar recordings from macaque V1 and V4 and identified putative fast-spiking (FS) interneurons and excitatory cells. V4 firing rates increased for both excitatory neurons and FS interneurons with attention. This increase was most prominent in superficial layers and preceded the modulations in V1 and Layer-4 of V4 in time, consistent with a FB modulation. We furthermore identified an attentional modulation of FF signaling corresponding to an increase in V1-V4 gamma-synchronization. Surprisingly, in V4, only Layer-4 FS interneurons were phase-locked to the V1 gamma rhythm, suggesting that V1-V4 gamma-synchronization may increase the signal-to-noise ratio rather than the gain of FF information transmission. Consistently, optogenetic tagging experiments in mice showed relatively strong phase-locking of PV+ and narrow-waveform SSt+ interneurons to gamma-rhythmic inputs. These findings reveal two distinct FF and FB pathways for attentional modulation with cell-type and layer-specific physiological effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different ways of evolving tool-using brains in teleosts and amniotes</a></h4>

              
                In mammals and birds, tool-using species are characterized by a high degree of encephalization with a relatively large telencephalon containing a higher proportion of total brain neurons compared to other species. Some teleost species in the wrasse family have convergently evolved tool-using abilities. In this study, we compared the brains of tool-using wrasses with various teleost species from a broad phylogenetic range. We show that in the tool-using wrasses, the telencephalon and the ventral part of the forebrain and midbrain are significantly enlarged compared to other teleost species, but do not contain a larger proportion of cells. Instead, this size difference is due to large fiber tracts connecting the dorsal part of the telencephalon (pallium) to the inferior lobe (IL), a ventral mesencephalic structure absent in amniotes. Such tracts were not present in other teleost species such as trout, zebrafish, or the Astyanax surface fish. The high degree of connectivity between the IL and the pallium in tool-using wrasses suggests that this unique teleostean structure contributes to higher-order cognitive functions. Considering how remarkably different their overall brain organization is, we conclude that, unlike in amniotes, the evolution of non telencephalic structures might have been key in the emergence of higher-order cognitive functions in teleosts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lipidomic alterations in the cerebral cortex and white matter in sporadic Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Aims: Non-targeted lipidomics analysis was conducted in post-mortem human frontal cortex area 8 (GM) and white matter of the frontal lobe centrum semi-ovale (WM) to identify lipidomes in middle-aged individuals with no neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, and cases at progressive stages of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). Methods: Lipidomic analysis using an LC-MS/MS platform was carried out in selected cases with suitable post-mortem lacking co-morbidities and concomitant brain pathologies. Complementary data were obtained using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Results: The WM shows an adaptive lipid phenotype resistant to lipid peroxidation, characterized by a lower fatty acid unsaturation, peroxidizability index, and higher ether lipid content than the GM. Changes in the lipidomic profile more marked in the WM than in GM occur in AD with disease progression. WM alterations are characterized by a decline in the content of branched fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA), diacylglycerols (DG), triacylglycerols (TG), glycerophospholipids (GP) (especially ether lipids), and sphingolipids (especially sulfatides, ceramides, and glycosphingolipids). The GM acquires a fatty acid profile prone to peroxidation in sAD, while WM reinforces its peroxidation-resistant trait. Transcriptomic data point to additional defects of peroxisomal function. Conclusions: Four functional categories are associated with the different lipid classes affected in sAD: membrane structural composition, bioenergetics, antioxidant protection, and bioactive lipids, with deleterious consequences affecting both neurons and glial cells favoring disease progression.

                The gut microbiome is emerging as an important susceptibility factor in Alzheimers disease (AD) possibly due to the increased prevalence of pro-inflammatory genera in gut microbiota of AD participants. Microbiota-mediated changes in cognition and adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), an important process for memory which is altered in AD, position the microbiota-gut-brain axis as a key regulator of AD. However, it is unknown whether gut microbiota alterations are the cause or consequence of AD symptoms. We transplanted faecal microbiota from AD participants and age-matched controls into microbiota-depleted naive adult rats and found impairments in AHN and associated memory tasks, which correlated with clinical cognitive scores. Discrete changes in the rat caecal and hippocampal metabolome were evident. Serum from AD participants also decreased neurogenesis in vitro and correlated with cognitive scores and pro-inflammatory genera. Our results reveal that the cognitive symptoms in AD may be due to alterations in gut microbiota, and that impaired neurogenesis may be a mechanistic link between altered gut microbiota and cognitive impairment in AD.

                Tactile sensation and vision are often both utilized for the exploration of objects that are within reach though it is not known whether or how these two distinct sensory systems might combine such information. Here in mice we find that stimulation of the contralateral whisker array suppresses visually evoked activity in a subarea of primary visual cortex (VISp) whose visual space covers the whisker search space. This is mediated by local fast spiking interneurons that receive a direct cortico-cortical input predominantly from layer 6 of the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (SSp-bfd). These data demonstrate functional convergence within and between two primary sensory cortical areas for multisensory object detection and recognition.

                Amongst the characteristics about information processing in the brain, observations of dynamic near-critical states have generated significant interest. However, theoretical and experimental limitations have precluded a definite answer about when and why neural criticality arises. To explore this topic, we used an in vitro neural network of cortical neurons that was trained to play a simplified game of `Pong'. We demonstrate that critical dynamics emerge when neural networks receive task-related structured sensory input, reorganizing the system to a near-critical state. Additionally, better task performance correlated with proximity to critical dynamics. However, criticality alone is insufficient for a neuronal network to demonstrate learning in the absence of additional information regarding the consequences of previous actions. These findings have compelling implications for the role of neural criticality.

                Recent studies in mice have shown that orofacial behaviors drive a large fraction of neural activity across the brain. To understand the nature and function of these signals, we need better computational models to characterize the behaviors and relate them to neural activity. Here we developed Facemap, a framework consisting of a keypoint tracking algorithm and a deep neural network encoder for predicting neural activity. We used the Facemap keypoints as input for the deep neural network to predict the activity of ~50,000 simultaneously-recorded neurons and in visual cortex we doubled the amount of explained variance compared to previous methods. Our keypoint tracking algorithm was more accurate than existing pose estimation tools, while the inference speed was several times faster, making it a powerful tool for closed-loop behavioral experiments. The Facemap tracker was easy to adapt to data from new labs, requiring as few as 10 annotated frames for near-optimal performance. We used Facemap to find that the neuronal activity clusters which were highly driven by behaviors were more spatially spread-out across cortex. We also found that the deep keypoint features inferred by the model had time-asymmetrical state dynamics that were not apparent in the raw keypoint data. In summary, Facemap provides a stepping stone towards understanding the function of the brainwide neural signals and their relation to behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A new take on model-based and model-free influences on mental effort and striatal prediction errors</a></h4>

              
                A standard assumption in neuroscience is that low-effort model-free learning is automatic and continuously employed, while more complex model-based strategies are only used when the rewards they generate are worth the additional effort. We present evidence refuting this assumption. First, we demonstrate flaws in previous reports of combined model-free and model-based reward prediction errors in the ventral striatum that likely led to spurious results. More appropriate analyses yield no evidence of a model-free prediction errors in this region. Second, we find that task instructions generating more correct model-based behaviour reduce rather than increase mental effort. This is inconsistent with cost-benefit arbitration between model-based and model-free strategies. Together, our data suggest that model-free learning may not be automatic. Instead, humans can reduce mental effort by using a model-based strategy alone rather than arbitrating between multiple strategies. Our results call for re-evaluation of the assumptions in influential theories of learning and decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-model order spatially constrained ICA reveals highly replicable group differences and consistent predictive results from fMRI data</a></h4>

              
                Brain functional networks identified from resting fMRI data have the potential to reveal biomarkers for brain disorders, but studies of complex mental illnesses such as schizophrenia (SZ) often yield mixed results across replication studies. This is likely due in part to the complexity of the disorder, the short data acquisition time, and the limited ability of the approaches for brain imaging data mining. Therefore, the use of analytic approaches which can both capture individual variability while offering comparability across analyses is highly preferred. Fully blind data-driven approaches such as independent component analysis (ICA) are hard to compare across studies, and approaches that use fixed atlas-based regions can have limited sensitivity to individual sensitivity. By contrast, spatially constrained ICA (scICA) provides a hybrid, fully automated solution that can incorporate spatial network priors while also adapting to new subjects. However, scICA has thus far only been used with a single spatial scale. In this work, we present an approach using scICA to extract subject-specific intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) from fMRI data at multiple spatial scales (ICA model orders), which also enables us to study interactions across spatial scales. We evaluate this approach using a large N (N>1,600) study of schizophrenia divided into separate validation and replication sets. A multi-scale ICN template was estimated and labeled, then used as input into spatially constrained ICA which was computed on an individual subject level. We then performed a subsequent analysis of multiscale functional network connectivity (msFNC) to evaluate the patient data, including group differences and classification. Results showed highly consistent group differences in msFNC in regions including cerebellum, thalamus, and motor/auditory networks. Importantly, multiple msFNC pairs linking different spatial scales were implicated. We also used the msFNC features as input to a classification model in cross-validated hold-out data and also in an independent test data. Visualization of predictive features was performed by evaluating their feature weights. Finally, we evaluated the relationship of the identified patterns to positive symptoms and found consistent results across datasets. The results verified the robustness of our framework in evaluating brain functional connectivity of schizophrenia at multiple spatial scales, implicated consistent and replicable brain networks, and highlighted a promising approach for leveraging resting fMRI data for brain biomarker development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dodecyl Creatine Ester Improves Cognitive Function and Identifies Drivers of Creatine Deficiency.</a></h4>

              
                Creatine transporter deficiency prevents creatine uptake into the brain, leading to mental retardation. To better understand the pathophysiology, this study focuses on the identification of biomarkers related to cognitive improvement in a Slc6a8 knockout mouse model (Slc6a8-/y) engineered to mimic the clinical features of CTD patients which have low brain creatine content. Shotgun proteomics analysis of 4,035 proteins in four different brain regions; the cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus (associated with cognitive functions) and brain stem, and muscle as a control, was performed in 24 mice. Comparisons of the protein abundance in the four brain regions between DCE-treated intranasally Slc6a8-/y mice and wild type and DCE-treated Slc6a8-/y and vehicle group identified 14 biomarkers, shedding light on the mechanism of action of DCE. Integrative bioinformatics and statistical modeling identified key proteins associated with CTD, including KIF1A and PLCB1. The abundance of these proteins in the four brain regions was significantly correlated with both the object recognition and the Y-maze tests. Functional analysis confirmed their key roles and associated molecules in CTD pathogenesis.

	<p>A unique structure of care for neurological inpatients with significant palliative care (PC) needs was established in the Department of Neurology at the Charit&amp;amp;eacute;&amp;amp;mdash;Universit&amp;amp;auml;tsmedizin Berlin in 2021: a specialized neuropalliative care (NPC) unit. After one year, we provide an overview of the concept and the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; characteristics. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of patients treated in our NPC unit between February 2021&amp;amp;ndash;February 2022. Data were extracted from medical records and PC assessment including diagnosis, mode of admission and discharge, length of stay, and palliative symptoms. Data are presented as averages with a 95% confidence interval [lower limit; upper limit] or percentage (absolute number). Results: We included 143 patients (52% (75) female, 67.9 years [65.6; 70.2]). Patients were admitted from general wards (48%; 68), their homes (22%; 32), intensive care units (16%; 23) or emergency departments (14%; 20). The main diagnoses were tumors of the nervous system (39%; 56), neurodegenerative diseases (30%; 43), neurologic complications (13%; 19) and cerebrovascular diseases (12%; 17). Complaints most frequently rated as severely to overwhelmingly burdensome were motor- or fatigue-associated problems, problems communicating, dysphagia and pain. The average length of stay was 13.7 days [12.2; 15.2]. Forty-five percent (64) of patients were discharged without further PC, 17% (24) were referred to a hospice and 13% (18) were discharged with outpatient PC. Five percent (7) were referred to neurorehabilitation and 21% (30) of patients died. Conclusions: Our NPC unit is a new model of care for neurological patients with substantial PC needs especially within the structures of a highly specialized and individualized medicine.</p>

	<p>Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) microstates reflect sub-second, quasi-stable states of brain activity. Several studies have reported alterations of microstate features in patients with schizophrenia (SZ). Based on these findings, it has been suggested that microstates may represent neurophysiological biomarkers for the classification of SZ. To explore this possibility, machine learning approaches can be employed. Bayesian optimization is a machine learning approach that selects the best-fitted machine learning model with tuned hyperparameters from existing models to improve the classification. In this proof-of-concept preliminary study based on secondary analysis, 20 microstate features were extracted from 14 SZ patients and 14 healthy controls&amp;amp;rsquo; EEG signals. These parameters were then ranked as predictors based on their importance, and an optimized machine learning approach was applied to evaluate the performance of the classification. SZ patients had altered microstate features compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, Bayesian optimization outperformed conventional multivariate analyses and showed the highest accuracy (90.93%), AUC (0.90), sensitivity (91.37%), and specificity (90.48%), with reliable results using just six microstate predictors. Altogether, in this proof-of-concept study, we showed that machine learning with Bayesian optimization can be utilized to characterize EEG microstate alterations and contribute to the classification of SZ patients.</p>

	<p>Verbal fluency impairment is common in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), but the effect of drugs on verbal fluency in PD patients has not been comprehensively evaluated. We conducted a network meta-analysis based on four online databases to compare the effect of drugs on verbal fluency in PD patients. This study was performed and reported according to PRISMA-NMA guidelines. In total, 6 out of 3707 articles (three RCTS and three cross-sectional studies) covering eight drug regimens were included (five for letter fluency, five for semantic fluency). In terms of letter fluency, the ranking of the overall efficacy of included drug regimens was: levodopa, levodopa combined with pramipexole, rotigotine, cabergoline, pramipexole, pergolide, but no drug regimen presented a significant advantage over the others. In terms of semantic fluency, the ranking of the overall efficacy of included drug regimens was: rotigotine, levodopa, cabergoline, pergolide, pramipexole, among which, levodopa alone (SMD = 0.93, 95%CI: 0.28&amp;amp;ndash;1.59) and rotigotine alone (SMD = 1.18, 95%CI: 0.28&amp;amp;ndash;2.09) were statistically superior to pramipexole, while no significant difference was identified between all the other drug regimens. Levodopa and rotigotine seem to be more appropriate choices for PD patients with verbal fluency impairment. Further study is needed to illustrate the efficacy of drugs on verbal fluency in PD patients.</p>

	<p>The paper overviews components of neurologic processing efficiencies to develop innovative methodologies and thinking to school-based applications and changes in educational leadership based on sound findings in the cognitive neurosciences applied to schools and learners. Systems science can allow us to better manage classroom-based learning and instruction on the basis of relatively easily evaluated efficiencies or inefficiencies and optimization instead of simply examining achievement. &amp;amp;ldquo;Medicalizing&amp;amp;rdquo; the learning process with concepts such as &amp;amp;ldquo;learning disability&amp;amp;rdquo; or employing grading methods such as pass-fail does little to aid in understanding the processes that learners employ to acquire, integrate, remember, and apply information learned. The paper endeavors to overview and provided reference to tools that can be employed that allow a better focus on nervous system-based strategic approaches to classroom learning.</p>

	<p>The effectiveness of early intensive interventions for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is now well-established, but there continues to be great interindividual variability in treatment response. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify putative predictors of response to two different approaches in behavioral treatment: Early Intensive Behavioral Interventions (EIBI) and the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM). Both are based upon the foundations of Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), but the former is more structured and therapist-driven, while the latter is more naturalistic and child-driven. Four databases (EmBase, PubMed, Scopus and WebOfScience) were systematically screened, and an additional search was conducted in the reference lists of relevant articles. Studies were selected if participants were children with ASD aged 12&amp;amp;ndash;48 months at intake, receiving either EIBI or ESDM treatment. For each putative predictor, p-values from different studies were combined using Fisher&amp;amp;rsquo;s method. Thirteen studies reporting on EIBI and eleven on ESDM met the inclusion criteria. A higher IQ at intake represents the strongest predictor of positive response to EIBI, while a set of social cognitive skills, including intention to communicate, receptive and expressive language, and attention to faces, most consistently predict response to ESDM. Although more research will be necessary to reach definitive conclusions, these findings begin to shed some light on patient characteristics that are predictive of preferential response to EIBI and ESDM, and may provide clinically useful information to begin personalizing treatment.</p>

	<p>Action imagery involves the mental representation of an action without overt execution, and can contribute to perspective taking, such as that required for left-right judgments in mental body rotation tasks. It has been shown that perspective (back view, front view), rotational angle (head-up, head-down), and abstractness (abstract, realistic) of the stimulus material influences speed and correctness of the judgement. The present studies investigated whether left-right judgements are more difficult on legs than on arms and whether the type of limb interacts with the other factors. Furthermore, a combined score for speed and accuracy was explored to eliminate possible tradeoffs and to obtain the best possible measure of subjects&amp;amp;rsquo; individual ability. Study 1 revealed that the front view is more difficult than the back view because it involves a vertical rotation in perspective taking. Head-down rotations are more difficult than head-up rotations because they involve a horizontal rotation in perspective taking. Furthermore, leg stimuli are more difficult than hand stimuli, particularly in head-down rotations. In Study 2, these findings were replicated in abstract stimuli as well as in realistic stimuli. In addition, perspective taking for realistic stimuli in the back view is easier than realistic stimuli in the front view or abstract stimuli (in both perspectives). We conclude that realistic stimulus material facilitates task comprehension and amplifies the effects of perspective. By replicating previous findings, the linear speed-accuracy score was shown to be a valid measure to capture performance in mental body rotations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Transcription Factor Hb9 Is Expressed in Glial Cell Lineages in the Developing Mouse Spinal Cord</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Hb9 (<I>Mnx1</I>) is a transcription factor described as a spinal cord motor neuron (MN)-specific marker and critical factor for the postmitotic specification of these cells. To date, expression of Hb9 in other cell types has not been reported. We performed a fate-mapping approach to examine distributions of Hb9-expressing cells and their progeny ("Hb9-lineage cells") within the embryonic and adult spinal cord of Hb9<sup>cre</sup>;Ai14 mice. We found that Hb9-lineage cells are distributed in a gradient of increasing abundance throughout the rostrocaudal spinal cord axis during embryonic and postnatal stages. Furthermore, although the majority of Hb9-lineage cells at cervical spinal cord levels are MNs, at more caudal levels, Hb9-lineage cells include small-diameter dorsal horn neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. In the peripheral nervous system, we observed a similar phenomenon with more abundant Hb9-lineage Schwann cells in muscles of the lower body versus upper body muscles. We cultured spinal cord progenitors <I>in vitro</I> and found that gliogenesis was increased by treatment with the caudalizing factor FGF-8B, while glial tdTomato expression was increased by treatment with both FGF-8B and GDF-11. Together, these observations suggest that early and transient expression of Hb9 in spinal cord neural progenitors may be induced by caudalizing factors such as FGF and GDF signaling. Furthermore, our work raises the possibility that early Hb9 expression may influence the development of spinal cord macroglia and Schwann cells, especially at caudal regions. Together, these findings highlight the importance of using caution when designing experiments using Hb9<sup>cre</sup> mice to perform spinal cord MN-specific manipulations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Prefrontal Cortical to Mediodorsal Thalamus Projection Neurons Regulate Posterror Adaptive Control of Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Adaptive control is the online adjustment of behavior to guide and optimize responses after errors or conflict. The neural circuits involved in monitoring and adapting behavioral performance following error are poorly understood. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a critical role in this form of control. However, these brain areas are densely connected with many other regions, and it is unknown which projections are critical for adaptive behavior. Here, we tested the involvement of four distinct dorsal and ventral prefrontal cortical projections to striatal and thalamic target areas in adaptive control. We re-analyzed data from published experiments, using trial-by-trial analyses of behavior in an operant task for attention and impulsivity. We find that male rats slow their responses and perform worse following errors. Moreover, by combining retrograde labeling and chemogenetic silencing, we find that dorsomedial prefrontal pyramidal neurons that project to the lateral nucleus of the mediodorsal thalamus (MDL) are involved in posterror performance and timing of responses, specifically with unpredictable delays until stimulus presentation. Together, these data show that dorsal medial PFC (mPFC) projection neurons targeting the lateral MDT regulate adaptive control to flexibly optimize behavioral responses in goal-directed behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Regular antenatal care visits were associated with low risk of low birth weight among newborns in Rwanda: Evidence from the 2014/2015 Rwanda Demographic Health Survey (RDHS) Data [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low birth weight (LBW) remains the global unfinished agenda in most countries of the world especially in low- and middle-income countries. LBW subsequently has harmful effects on the lifestyle, psychosocial and physiological development of the child. Although it is known that antenatal care (ANC) visits are important interventions contributing to prediction of newborn birth weight, little has been conducted on effect of ANC visits on birth weight in Rwanda. This study aimed at determining the association between regular ANC visits and risk of LBW among newborns in Rwanda. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was conducted to analyse the effects of ANC on LBW using the 2014/2015 Rwanda Demographic Health Survey. Associations of socio-demographic, socio-economic, and individual factors of the mother with LBW newborns were performed using bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: Prevalences of LBW and macrosomia were 5.8% and 17.6%, respectively. Newborns delivered from mothers attending fewer than four ANC visits were at almost three-times greater risk of having LBW [aOR=2.8; 95%CI (1.5–5.4), p=0.002] compared to those whose mothers attending four or more ANC visits. Residing in a rural area for pregnant women was significantly associated with LBW [aOR=1.1; 95%CI (0.7–1.6), p=0.008]. Maternal characteristics, such as anemia, predicted an increase in LBW [aOR=3.5; 95%CI (1.5–5.4),p<0.001]. Those who received no nutritional counseling [aOR=2.5; 95%CI (2–8.5), p<0.001] and who were not told about maternal complications [aOR=3.3; 95%CI (1.5–6.6), p=0.003] were more prone to deliver newborns with LBW than those who received them. Pregnant women who received iron and folic acid were less likely to have LBW newborns [aOR=0.5; 95%CI (0.3–0.9), p=0.015]. Conclusion: ANC visits significantly contributed to reducing the incidence of LBW. This study underscores the need for early, comprehensive, and high-quality ANC services to prevent LBW in Rwanda.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Multidisciplinary digital methodologies for documentation and preservation of immovable Archaeological heritage in the Khovd River Valley, Western Mongolia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The archaeological and ethnographic heritages of Mongolia reflect a multi-millennial continuity of typically mobile-pastoral occupations across sparsely populated, environmentally diverse landscapes, but the threats of modernisation and industrialisation to those heritages are nevertheless present and substantial. The construction of the Erdeneburen Hydroelectric Dam on the Khovd River in western Mongolia is planned to submerge hundreds of archaeological features and jeopardise at least another thousand. Methods: The Mongolian Archaeology Project: Surveying the Steppes, in collaboration with the Mongolian Institute of Archaeology, integrates a variety of digital techniques including GIS (geographic information systems), Machine Learning automated site detection, drone mapping, and Structure-from-Motion LiDAR scanning to document the endangered archaeology. This paper presents the resulting dataset of archaeological features across three different impact zones associated with the dam construction and evaluates the degree of efficacy of the initial data integration strategy through informal partner feedback and self-assessment. Results: While only approximately 20% of the documented sites fall within the planned flood zone, the remaining sites will be subjected to collateral threats such as industrial and infrastructural development that will necessitate extended monitoring, both temporally and spatially. In consideration of these results, this paper argues that a ‘responsive’ mode of heritage disaster intervention can bridge the gap between ‘reactive’ and ‘proactive’ modes, but requires development of an integrated (digital) methodology. Conclusions: The paper concludes by offering a new, more interconnected ‘transmethodology’ that addresses spatiality, sub-sampling, data reuse, and community input across multiple disciplines such as cultural heritage preservation, salvage archaeology, computer vision, and community archaeology. The authors developed this ‘transmethodology’ and the resulting workflows out of a theoretical framework that considers principles of Symmetrical Archaeology, Resilience Humanitarianism, and the CARE standard for inclusive data management (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence, causes and impacts of human trafficking in Asian countries: A scoping review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In Asian countries, human trafficking is often encountered as forced labor, forced marriage, sex trafficking, men, women, and children exploitation. This review points out how human trafficking activities are prevalent in Asian countries and also reveals different causes that are the basis of increasingly human trafficking in Asian countries such as poverty, unemployment, political uncertainty, war, natural disaster, corruption and weak policies. Human trafficking also creates huge health, physical, psychological and social implications on individuals and the overall society. Methods: The purpose of this study is to collect evidence on human trafficking in Asian countries. A scoping review methodology was used to systematically search online databases including Sage Journals Online, Wiley Online, Hein Online, Taylor & Francis Online, Web of Science, and Scopus literature to amalgamate information on this issue. For the purposes of this article, 64 studies met the inclusion criteria after searching and screening a total number of 1,278 studies. Results: The findings of this study were classified under three categories: prevalence of human trafficking in Asia, causes of human trafficking in Asia (poverty and unemployment, environmental and manmade disaster, weak policies and corruption), and impacts of human trafficking including social, health, physical, psychological impacts. Conclusion: Keeping in mind the prevalence and impacts of human trafficking, the author also recommends some meaningful and practical steps for policymakers and researchers to effectively tackle human trafficking in Asian countries.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Machine learning model to predict endophytic colonisation of rice cultivar plant tissues by Beauveria bassiana isolates and their potential as bio-control agents against rice stem borer using existing knowledge [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer revie</a></h4>

              
                Background: Finding well-known Beauveria bassiana isolates that could preserve rice crops from Sesamia calamistis (stem borer) is problematic. Another difficult task is the development of precise inoculation methods, which have been employed for their establishment as endophytes in cereal crops. This study proposed machine learning models to predict the best entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana that could directly protect rice crops against Sesamia calamistis. Methods: Data driven machine learning decisions were implemented and assessed from 60 experimental runs with nine different feature/input variables and three target/output variables following foliar spray and seed treatment inoculation method. The feature variables consisted of rice plant tissue, such as Nerica-L19, Nerica1, Nerica8, the time, and the five promising isolates Beauveria bassiana (Bb3, Bb4, Bb10, Bb21, Bb35). The target variable consisted of the number of colonised roots, stems and leaves, expressed as a percentage depending on the degree of protection after each inoculation. A data driven decision by the extreme gradient boosting regression algorithm was used to proficiently abstract the situation where there is no direct relationship between features and target variables. Results: The foliar spray inoculation method exhibited high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.99, 0.98 and 0.94 depending on the number of colonised stems, roots and leaves, respectively, while the seed treatment approach exhibited the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.91, 0.87 and 0.75, respectively. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm effectively abstracted the nonlinear relationship between the attribute variables that were taken into consideration and predicted Beauveria bassiana as a bio-pesticide for rice and perhaps other cereal stem borers. Thus, this XGBoost regression model could be used to navigate the optimization domain and reduce the development time of the biocontrol process.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Synaptic reshaping of plastic neuronal networks by periodic multichannel stimulation with single-pulse and burst stimuli</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Justus A. Kromer, Peter A. Tass</p>

Synaptic dysfunction is associated with several brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease (PD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Utilizing synaptic plasticity, brain stimulation is capable of reshaping synaptic connectivity. This may pave the way for novel therapies that specifically counteract pathological synaptic connectivity. For instance, in PD, novel multichannel coordinated reset stimulation (CRS) was designed to counteract neuronal synchrony and down-regulate pathological synaptic connectivity. CRS was shown to entail long-lasting therapeutic aftereffects in PD patients and related animal models. This is in marked contrast to conventional deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy, where PD symptoms return shortly after stimulation ceases.
In the present paper, we study synaptic reshaping by periodic multichannel stimulation (PMCS) in networks of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). During PMCS, phase-shifted periodic stimulus trains are delivered to segregated neuronal subpopulations. Harnessing STDP, PMCS leads to changes of the synaptic network structure. We found that the PMCS-induced changes of the network structure depend on both the phase lags between stimuli and the shape of individual stimuli. Single-pulse stimuli and burst stimuli with low intraburst frequency down-regulate synapses between neurons receiving stimuli simultaneously. In contrast, burst stimuli with high intraburst frequency up-regulate these synapses. We derive theoretical approximations of the stimulation-induced network structure. This enables us to formulate stimulation strategies for inducing a variety of network structures. Our results provide testable hypotheses for future pre-clinical and clinical studies and suggest that periodic multichannel stimulation may be suitable for reshaping plastic neuronal networks to counteract pathological synaptic connectivity. Furthermore, we provide novel insight on how the stimulus type may affect the long-lasting outcome of conventional DBS. This may strongly impact parameter adjustment procedures for clinical DBS, which, so far, primarily focused on acute effects of stimulation.

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was rapidly declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Early clinical symptomatology focused mainly on respiratory illnesses. However, a variety of neurological manifestations in both adults and newborns are now well-documented. To experimentally determine whether SARS-CoV-2 could replicate in and affect human brain cells, we infected iPSC-derived human brain organoids. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can productively replicate and promote death of neural cells, including cortical neurons. This phenotype was accompanied by loss of excitatory synapses in neurons. Notably, we found that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antiviral Sofosbuvir was able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and rescued these neuronal alterations in infected brain organoids. Given the urgent need for readily available antivirals, these results provide a cellular basis supporting repurposed antivirals as a strategic treatment to alleviate neurocytological defects that may underlie COVID-19- related neurological symptoms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Prophage-like gene transfer agents promote Caulobacter crescentus survival and DNA repair during stationary phase</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kevin Gozzi, Ngat T. Tran, Joshua W. Modell, Tung B. K. Le, Michael T. Laub</p>

Gene transfer agents (GTAs) are prophage-like entities found in many bacterial genomes that cannot propagate themselves and instead package approximately 5 to 15 kbp fragments of the host genome that can then be transferred to related recipient cells. Although suggested to facilitate horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the wild, no clear physiological role for GTAs has been elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that the α-proteobacterium <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> produces bona fide GTAs. The production of <i>Caulobacter</i> GTAs is tightly regulated by a newly identified transcription factor, RogA, that represses <i>gafYZ</i>, the direct activators of GTA synthesis. Cells lacking <i>rogA</i> or expressing <i>gafYZ</i> produce GTAs harboring approximately 8.3 kbp fragment of the genome that can, after cell lysis, be transferred into recipient cells. Notably, we find that GTAs promote the survival of <i>Caulobacter</i> in stationary phase and following DNA damage by providing recipient cells a template for homologous recombination-based repair. This function may be broadly conserved in other GTA-producing organisms and explain the prevalence of this unusual HGT mechanism.

                Background After the first cases of coronaviruses disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China in January 2020, the epidemic spread around the world. Few data are available from Central Africa. We conducted a study to monitor this emerging disease in Gabon, a Central Africa country. Methods In order to set up an epidemiological surveillance of COVID-19 in Gabon, we led molecular investigations on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples from the 1161 first suspected cases of COVID-19. A Reverse Ttranscriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using primers and probes targeted the E gene and polymerase gene according to the kit Tib-Molbiol. Results We diagnosed the first case of COVID-19 on March, 12 2020. Among those suspected cases, 83 were confirmed cases. There was no significant difference in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 between age groups (p = 0.14). Seventy-three percent were asymptomatic. The viral loads were significantly higher in the nasopharyngeal samples than in the oropharyngeal samples (p=0.03). There was no significant difference in viral loads between age groups (p=0.9895) and no correlation between clinical symptoms and viral loads (p=0.06042). Conclusion In conclusion, this study provides the first molecular data from Gabon concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. The data showed that most of the infected people were asymptomatic. The viral load was higher in the nasopharyngeal samples.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Analysis of the safety and immunogenicity profile of an azoximer bromide polymer-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                A systematic review of clinical trials conducted with a low-dose inactivated influenza vaccine adjuvanted by azoximer bromide (AZB, Polyoxidonium), was performed to compare vaccine reactogenicity against non-adjuvant vaccines. We also assessed whether lower amounts of antigen per viral strain in AZB-adjuvanted vaccines affected antibody responses. A robust search strategy identified scientific publications reporting 30 clinical trials, comprising data on 11,736 participants and 86 trial arms, for inclusion in the analysis. Local reaction rates (R lr) appeared to be lower in AZB-adjuvanted vaccine treatment arms versus comparator vaccine treatment arms. Post-vaccination geometric mean titres in those exposed to AZB-adjuvanted vaccine and comparator vaccine treatment arms were similar in both children and adults aged 18–60 years, implying an antigen-sparing effect by AZB. Meta‑regression analysis based on a literature search of records or reports of clinical trials featuring AZB and the inactivated subunit of influenza published between 1998–2018 was conducted online in January 2019 and updated in August 2019. This search covered trials performed between 1993 and 2016 and suggested that AZB did not contribute to vaccine reactogenicity.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Functional Neuroimaging as an Assessment Tool in Critically Ill Patients</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Little is known about residual cognitive function in the earliest stages of serious brain injury. Functional neuroimaging has yielded valuable diagnostic and prognostic information in chronic disorders of consciousness, such as the vegetative state (also termed unresponsive wakefulness syndrome). The objective of the current study was to determine if functional neuroimaging could be efficacious in the assessment of cognitive function in acute disorders of consciousness, such as coma, where decisions about the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies are often made.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A hierarchical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach assessed sound perception, speech perception, language comprehension, and covert command following in 17 critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Preserved auditory function was observed in 15 patients (88%), whereas 5 (29%) also had preserved higher-order language comprehension. Notably, one patient could willfully modulate his brain activity when instructed to do so, suggesting a level of covert conscious awareness that was entirely inconsistent with his clinical diagnosis at the time of the scan. Across patients, a positive relationship was also observed between fMRI responsivity and the level of functional recovery, such that patients with the greatest functional recovery had neural responses most similar to those observed in healthy control participants.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest that fMRI may provide important diagnostic and prognostic information beyond standard clinical assessment in acutely unresponsive patients, which may aid discussions surrounding the continuation or removal of life-sustaining therapies during the early post-injury period.
