              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09973">Nap-induced modulations of tinnitus -a cross-sectional database analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.09973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of naps on tinnitus was systematically assessed by exploring the frequency, clinical and demographic characteristics of this phenomenon. 9,724 data from two different tinnitus databases (Tinnitus Hub: $n = 6115$; Tinnitus Research Initiative (TRI): $n = 3627$) were included. After separate analysis of the databases, these results were then compared with each other. In the Tinnitus Hub survey database, a total of 31.1% reported an influence on tinnitus by taking a nap (26.9% in the TRI database), with much more frequent worsening after a nap than improvement (23.0% a little or a lot worse; TRI: 17.7% worse; 8.1% a little or a lot better; TRI: 9.2% better). The influence of napping on tinnitus was associated in both databases with other clinical features, such as the dependence of tinnitus on night quality, stress and somatosensory maneuvers. The present study confirms the clinical observation that more tinnitus sufferers report worsening after a nap than tinnitus sufferers reporting an improvement. It was consistently shown that tinnitus sufferers reporting nap-induced modulation of tinnitus also report more frequently an influence of night sleep on their tinnitus. Further clinical and polysomnographic research is warranted to better understand the interaction between sleep and tinnitus.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10161">Data Integration with Fusion Searchlight: Classifying Brain States from Resting-state fMRI</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.10161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous neural activity observed in resting-state fMRI is characterized by complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Different measures related to local and global brain connectivity and fluctuations in low-frequency amplitudes can quantify individual aspects of these neural dynamics. Even though such measures are derived from the same functional signals, they are often evaluated separately, neglecting their interrelations and potentially reducing the analysis sensitivity. In our study, we present a fusion searchlight (FuSL) framework to combine the complementary information contained in different resting-state fMRI metrics and demonstrate how this can improve the decoding of brain states. Moreover, we show how explainable AI allows us to reconstruct the differential impact of each metric on the decoding, which additionally increases spatial specificity of searchlight analysis. In general, this framework can be adapted to combine information derived from different imaging modalities or experimental conditions, offering a versatile and interpretable tool for data fusion in neuroimaging.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10062">Dynamical mean-field theory for a highly heterogeneous neural population</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.10062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale systems with inherent heterogeneity often exhibit complex dynamics that are crucial for their functional properties. However, understanding how such heterogeneity shapes these dynamics remains a significant challenge, particularly in systems with widely varying time scales. To address this, we extend Dynamical Mean Field Theory$\unicode{x2014}$a powerful framework for analyzing large-scale population dynamics$\unicode{x2014}$to systems with heterogeneous temporal properties. Using the population dynamics of a biological neural network as an example, we develop a theoretical framework that determines how inherent heterogeneity influences the critical transition point of the network. By introducing a model that incorporates graded-persistent activity$\unicode{x2014}$a property where certain neurons sustain activity over extended periods without external inputs$\unicode{x2014}$we show that neurons with extremely long timescales shift the system's transition point and expand its dynamical regime, enhancing its suitability for temporal information processing. Furthermore, we validate our framework by applying it to a system with heterogeneous adaptation, demonstrating that such heterogeneity can reduce the dynamical regime, contrary to previous simplified approximations. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for understanding the functional advantages of diversity in complex systems and offer insights applicable to a wide range of heterogeneous networks beyond neural populations.

                arXiv:2412.10211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image quality databases are used to train models for predicting subjective human perception. However, most existing databases focus on distortions commonly found in digital media and not in natural conditions. Affine transformations are particularly relevant to study, as they are among the most commonly encountered by human observers in everyday life. This Data Descriptor presents a set of human responses to suprathreshold affine image transforms (rotation, translation, scaling) and Gaussian noise as convenient reference to compare with previously existing image quality databases. The responses were measured using well established psychophysics: the Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling method. The set contains responses to 864 distorted images. The experiments involved 105 observers and more than 20000 comparisons of quadruples of images. The quality of the dataset is ensured because (a) it reproduces the classical Pi\'eron's law, (b) it reproduces classical absolute detection thresholds, and (c) it is consistent with conventional image quality databases but improves them according to Group-MAD experiments.

                arXiv:2403.18963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of new problem classes for quantum computation is an active area of research. In this paper, we introduce and solve a novel problem class related to dynamics on large-scale networks relevant to neurobiology and machine learning. Specifically, we ask if a network can sustain inherent dynamic activity beyond some arbitrary observation time or if the activity ceases through quiescence or saturation via an 'epileptic'-like state. We show that this class of problems can be formulated and structured to take advantage of quantum superposition and solved efficiently using the Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover quantum algorithms. To do so, we extend their functionality to address the unique requirements of how input (sub)sets into the algorithms must be mathematically structured while simultaneously constructing the inputs so that measurement outputs can be interpreted as meaningful properties of the network dynamics. This, in turn, allows us to answer the question we pose.

                arXiv:2412.09635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating multiple functionalities into a system poses a fascinating challenge to the field of deep learning. While the precise mechanisms by which the brain encodes and decodes information, and learns diverse skills, remain elusive, memorization undoubtedly plays a pivotal role in this process. In this article, we delve into the implementation and application of an autoencoder-inspired hippocampus network in a multi-functional system. We propose an autoencoder-based memorization method for policy function's parameters. Specifically, the encoder of the autoencoder maps policy function's parameters to a skill vector, while the decoder retrieves the parameters via this skill vector. The policy function is dynamically adjusted tailored to corresponding tasks. Henceforth, a skill vectors graph neural network is employed to represent the homeomorphic topological structure of subtasks and manage subtasks execution.

                arXiv:2412.09800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) has attracted much attention due to its excellent performance in spatio-temporal forecasting of complex systems and its ease of implementation. This paper shows that NG-RC can be encoded as a kernel ridge regression that makes training efficient and feasible even when the space of chosen polynomial features is very large. Additionally, an extension to an infinite number of covariates is possible, which makes the methodology agnostic with respect to the lags into the past that are considered as explanatory factors, as well as with respect to the number of polynomial covariates, an important hyperparameter in traditional NG-RC. We show that this approach has solid theoretical backing and good behavior based on kernel universality properties previously established in the literature. Various numerical illustrations show that these generalizations of NG-RC outperform the traditional approach in several forecasting applications.

                arXiv:2412.09853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Difference-of-Convex Algorithm (DCA) is a well-known nonconvex optimization algorithm for minimizing a nonconvex function that can be expressed as the difference of two convex ones. Many famous existing optimization algorithms, such as SGD and proximal point methods, can be viewed as special DCAs with specific DC decompositions, making it a powerful framework for optimization. On the other hand, shortcuts are a key architectural feature in modern deep neural networks, facilitating both training and optimization. We showed that the shortcut neural network gradient can be obtained by applying DCA to vanilla neural networks, networks without shortcut connections. Therefore, from the perspective of DCA, we can better understand the effectiveness of networks with shortcuts. Moreover, we proposed a new architecture called NegNet that does not fit the previous interpretation but performs on par with ResNet and can be included in the DCA framework.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09860">Brain-inspired Chaotic Graph Backpropagation for Large-scale Combinatorial Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) with unsupervised learning can solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with efficient time complexity, making them versatile for various applications. However, since this method maps the combinatorial optimization problem to the training process of a graph neural network, and the current mainstream backpropagation-based training algorithms are prone to fall into local minima, the optimization performance is still inferior to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) COP methods. To address this issue, inspired by possibly chaotic dynamics of real brain learning, we introduce a chaotic training algorithm, i.e. chaotic graph backpropagation (CGBP), which introduces a local loss function in GNN that makes the training process not only chaotic but also highly efficient. Different from existing methods, we show that the global ergodicity and pseudo-randomness of such chaotic dynamics enable CGBP to learn each optimal GNN effectively and globally, thus solving the COP efficiently. We have applied CGBP to solve various COPs, such as the maximum independent set, maximum cut, and graph coloring. Results on several large-scale benchmark datasets showcase that CGBP can outperform not only existing GNN algorithms but also SOTA methods. In addition to solving large-scale COPs, CGBP as a universal learning algorithm for GNNs, i.e. as a plug-in unit, can be easily integrated into any existing method for improving the performance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10153">EVOS: Efficient Implicit Neural Training via EVOlutionary Selector</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.10153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose EVOlutionary Selector (EVOS), an efficient training paradigm for accelerating Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Unlike conventional INR training that feeds all samples through the neural network in each iteration, our approach restricts training to strategically selected points, reducing computational overhead by eliminating redundant forward passes. Specifically, we treat each sample as an individual in an evolutionary process, where only those fittest ones survive and merit inclusion in training, adaptively evolving with the neural network dynamics. While this is conceptually similar to Evolutionary Algorithms, their distinct objectives (selection for acceleration vs. iterative solution optimization) require a fundamental redefinition of evolutionary mechanisms for our context. In response, we design sparse fitness evaluation, frequency-guided crossover, and augmented unbiased mutation to comprise EVOS. These components respectively guide sample selection with reduced computational cost, enhance performance through frequency-domain balance, and mitigate selection bias from cached evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 48%-66% reduction in training time while ensuring superior convergence without additional cost, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.

                arXiv:2412.10312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A popular end-to-end architecture for selective rationalization is the select-then-predict pipeline, comprising a generator to extract highlights fed to a predictor. Such a cooperative system suffers from suboptimal equilibrium minima due to the dominance of one of the two modules, a phenomenon known as interlocking. While several contributions aimed at addressing interlocking, they only mitigate its effect, often by introducing feature-based heuristics, sampling, and ad-hoc regularizations. We present GenSPP, the first interlocking-free architecture for selective rationalization that does not require any learning overhead, as the above-mentioned. GenSPP avoids interlocking by performing disjoint training of the generator and predictor via genetic global search. Experiments on a synthetic and a real-world benchmark show that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art competitors.

Abstract: This paper introduces KAMoE, a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework based on Gated Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (GRKAN). We propose GRKAN as an alternative to the traditional gating function, aiming to enhance efficiency and interpretability in MoE modeling. Through extensive experiments on digital asset markets and real estate valuation, we demonstrate that KAMoE consistently outperforms traditional MoE architectures across various tasks and model types. Our results show that GRKAN exhibits superior performance compared to standard Gating Residual Networks, particularly in LSTM-based models for sequential tasks. We also provide insights into the trade-offs between model complexity and performance gains in MoE and KAMoE architectures.

	<p>Objective: The etiology of multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is still debated, which is an obstacle to assessing treatment options. An analysis of the scientific literature combined with the clinical experience can suggest some avenues. Methods: The etiology of MCS and its underlying mechanisms were reviewed from the scientific literature to identify the main factors contributing to its development. The results of the studies involving biomarkers and cerebral imaging techniques on MCS subjects were compared with those performed on subjects having the comorbidities of MCS. From the scientific literature and the experience in a clinical setting in occupational and environmental medicine, distinct types of MCS were looked for, with the application of the underlying mechanisms. The potential effectiveness of available treatments was also reviewed. Results: Among many factors, unresolved emotional traumas causing chronic and acute stress reactions play an important role in the development of MCS and can be the basis for effective treatment. We identified three types of clinical presentations, called the accidental type, following a toxic exposure causing an associated emotional trauma, the associative type, following a repeated innocuous exposure in a threatening context, and the developmental type, following a traumatic childhood/adolescence causing hypervigilance and chronic stress/trauma-related disorders. We presented real cases to illustrate these types and the mechanisms behind their development, as well as effective resolution. Conclusions: MCS and its comorbidities could be treated effectively when the underlying emotional trauma(s) are targeted using trauma-focused psychotherapy and other therapies. Diagnostic criteria, principles of treatment and prevention, and avenues for research were derived from this analysis.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Dementia is a syndrome which involves cognitive and motor problems such as memory and motor control that impacts the individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life. In mental imagery (MI) technique, motor acts are mentally rehearsed without any overt body movements. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of MI on the quality of life, cognitive, and emotional status of older adults with an early stage of dementia. Methods: The present randomized controlled trial consisted of 160 participants. The sample from an Athens Day Care Center of the Alzheimer Association was randomized to (a) the MI and exercise group (intervention group, n = 55), (b) the only exercise group (1st control group, n = 52), and (c) the neither MI nor exercise group (2nd control group, n = 53). Participants engaged in a total of 24 physiotherapy sessions, each lasting approximately 45 min, scheduled twice weekly over a 12-week period. They performed three assessments: (a) one week prior to the program, (b) one and a half months, and (c) after the program. The intervention group performed a 30 min MI with exercise program content immediately following every physiotherapy exercise session. Walking While Talking Test (WWITT), the Euro-Qol 5-Dimensions 5-Level of severity scale (Euro-Qol 5D-5L scale), the Short-Form of Geriatric Depression Scale (SF-GDS), and the Short Anxiety Screening Test (SAST) were used to assess cognitive status, emotional status, and quality of life. Results: A total of 160 participants (43 men, 117 women, with MMSE M = 23.20 SD = 0.15) took part in this study in which most reported holding a university degree (n = 77), were married (n = 101), and had loss of memory as the 1st symptom of dementia (n= 117). The Friedman test revealed statistically significant differences across the three groups on (a) the WWITTmistakes (X2 = 14.95, df = 2, p = 0.001) and WWITTtime (X2 = 13.35, df = 2, p = 0.01), (b) the total Euro-Qol 5D-5L scale (X2 = 11.87.62, df = 2, p = 0.003) and quality of life on the measuring day (X2 = 25.59, df = 2, p = 0.00), (c) the SF-GDS (X2 = 6.54, df = 2, p = 0.038), and (d) the SAST (X2 = 39.907.62, df = 2, p = 0.00). The Friedman test with post hoc Wilcoxon analysis revealed that the mean scores for the intervention group and the 1st control were significantly better than the 2nd control group in many dependent variables. Conclusions: The results indicate that incorporating MI can positively influence cognitive status, emotional status, and the quality of life in older adults diagnosed with early-stage dementia.</p>

">A simple neural circuit model explains diverse types of integration kernels in perceptual decision-making</a></h4>

              
                The ability to accumulate evidence over time for deliberate decision is essential for both humans and animals. Decades of decision-making research have documented various types of integration kernels that characterize how evidence is temporally weighted. While numerous normative models have been proposed to explain these kernels, there remains a gap in circuit models that account for the complexity and heterogeneity of single neuron activities. In this study, we sought to address this gap by using low-rank neural network modeling in the context of a perceptual decision-making task. Firstly, we demonstrated that even a simple rank-one neural network model yields diverse types of integration kernels observed in human data--including primacy, recency, and non-monotonic kernels--with a performance comparable to state-of-the-art normative models such as the drift diffusion model and the divisive normalization model. Moreover, going beyond the previous normative models, this model enabled us to gain insights at two levels. At the collective level, we derived a novel explicit mechanistic expression that explains how these kernels emerge from a neural circuit. At the single neuron level, this model exhibited heterogenous single neuron response kernels, resembling the diversity observed in neurophysiological recordings. In sum, we present a simple rank-one neural circuit that reproduces diverse types of integration kernels at the collective level while simultaneously capturing complexity of single neuron responses observed experimentally.

">Assembly of a functional neuronal circuit in embryos of an ancestral metazoan is influenced by environmental signals including the microbiome</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how neural populations evolve to give rise to behavior is a major goal in neuroscience. However, the complexity of the nervous system in most invertebrates and vertebrates complicates the deciphering of underlying fundamental processes. Here, we explore the self-assembly of neural circuits in Hydra, an organism with a simple nervous system but no centralized information processing, to improve the understanding of nervous system evolution. The N4 neuronal circuit in embryos develops through activity-driven self-assembly, where neurons in distinct regions increase connectivity and synchronization. Gap junctions and vesicle-mediated communication between neuronal and non-neuronal cells drive rapid assembly, with the embryo's prospective oral region exhibiting the highest neuronal density. An artificial electrical circuit-based model demonstrates dynamic increases in synchronization over time, along with predictions for selective dynamic adaptions of connections. Environmental factors, like temperature and an absent microbiome, modify neural architecture, suggesting the existence of a certain plasticity in neural development. We propose that these fundamental features originated in the last common bilaterian ancestor, supporting the hypothesis that the basic architecture of the nervous system is universal.

">Test-retest reliability of auditory MMN measured with OPM-MEG</a></h4>

              
                In this paper, we report results from an investigation of auditory mismatch responses as measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG) based on optically pumped magnetometers (OPM). Specifically, as part of a quality control study, we examined the reliability and validity of auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) recordings, obtained with a newly installed OPM-MEG system. Based on OPM-MEG data from 30 healthy volunteers, measured twice with an established auditory MMN paradigm with frequency deviants, we examined the following questions: First, we focused on construct validity and examined whether OPM-MEG measurements of MMN responses (in terms of event-related fields, ERFs) were qualitatively comparable to previous MMN findings from studies using EEG or MEG based on superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). In particular, we examined whether significant MMN responses measured by OPM-MEG occurred in a comparable time window and showed a similar topography as in previous EEG/MEG studies of MMN. Second, we quantified test-retest reliability of MMN amplitude and latency over two separate measurement sessions. The results of our analyses show that MMN responses recorded with OPM-MEG are in good agreement with previously reported MMN results in terms of timing and topography. Furthermore, the comparison of group-level MMN topographies and timeseries shows excellent consistency across the two measurement sessions. Our quantitative test-retest reliability analyses at the sensor level indicate good reliability for MMN amplitude, but poor reliability for MMN latency. Overall, our findings suggest that OPM-MEG (i) produces comparable results as EEG and SQUID-based MEG for auditory MMN and (ii) shows good test-retest reliability for amplitude measures at the sensor level. Notably, these results were achieved in an "out of the box" state of the OPM-MEG system, shortly after installation and without further optimisation. The reason for the insufficient reliability for MMN latency we observed is currently under investigation and represents an important target for future improvements.

">Dissecting origins of wiring specificity in dense cortical connectomes</a></h4>

              
                Wiring specificity in the cortex is observed across scales from the subcellular to the network level. It describes the deviations of connectivity patterns from those expected in randomly connected networks. Understanding the origins of wiring specificity in neural networks remains difficult as a variety of generative mechanisms could have contributed to the observed connectome. To take a step forward, we propose a generative modeling framework that operates directly on dense connectome data as provided by saturated reconstructions of neural tissue. The computational framework allows testing different assumptions of synaptic specificity while accounting for anatomical constraints posed by neuron morphology, which is a known confounding source of wiring specificity. We evaluated the framework on dense reconstructions of the mouse visual and the human temporal cortex. Our template model incorporates assumptions of synaptic specificity based on cell type, single-cell identity, and subcellular compartment. Combinations of these assumptions were sufficient to model various connectivity patterns that are indicative of wiring specificity. Moreover, the identified synaptic specificity parameters showed interesting similarities between both datasets, motivating further analysis of wiring specificity across species.

">Oxytocin enhances acquisition in a social trust task in mice, whereas both oxytocin and its antagonist block trust violation learning</a></h4>

              
                The complex effects of the neurohormone oxytocin (OT) on socio-cognitive phenomena have recently been proposed to be complementary with safety learning, where a stimulus acquires safety-predicting properties when it predicts non-occurrence of an aversive event. OT may enhance saliency of safety stimuli and promote positive social behavior, such as trust, by reducing anxiety and stress. Complementary, OT may reduce the ability to modulate previously learned behaviors based on new, contradicting information. This occurs through its attenuation of prediction error (PE)--the discrepancy between expectations and actual outcomes. In the current study, we stimulated or inhibited (with antagonist cligosiban, CL) the OT system and subjected male and female mice to our social transmission of food preference (STFP) protocol to assess social safety learning. STFP is based on the observation that food neophobia of rodents is attenuated when a conspecific signals the safety of the food. We used safe food preference as putative murine homologue of human trust acquisition, and modeled trust violation (PE) using lithium chloride (LiCl)-induced food aversion after social interaction. In males, results revealed that OT enhanced trust acquisition, whereas both OT and its antagonist CL similarly blocked trust violation learning. None of the manipulations affected female behavior. Our findings highlight the complexities of OT's role in social behavior, emphasizing caution in therapeutic manipulations of this system.

">Soleus H-Reflex Up-Conditioning during Sciatic Nerve Regeneration in Rats Improves Recovery of Locomotion</a></h4>

              
                Operant conditioning of the spinal stretch reflex or its electrical analog, the H-reflex, induces plasticity in the brain and spinal cord that increases (up-conditioning) or decreases (down-conditioning) the reflex elicited by primary afferent input to the spinal motoneuron. In rats in which the sciatic nerve is transected and repaired, soleus (SOL) H-reflex up-conditioning during regeneration strengthens primary afferent reinnervation of SOL motoneurons and improves recovery of the SOL H-reflex. This suggests that H-reflex up-conditioning could improve functional recovery after nerve injury and repair. To explore this possibility, we examined the impact of SOL H-reflex up- or down-conditioning during sciatic regeneration on recovery of locomotor symmetry. Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with EMG electrodes in right SOL and a stimulating cuff on right posterior tibial nerve. After control data collection, right sciatic nerve was transected and repaired. Control EMG and H-reflex data collection continued for 20 more days. The rat was then exposed for 100 days to either: continued control data collection; SOL H-reflex up-conditioning; or SOL H-reflex down-conditioning. Locomotor EMG, H-reflex, and kinematics were assessed before nerve transection and 120 days after transection. H-reflex up-conditioning improved H-reflex recovery and also restored right/left step symmetry. H-reflex down-conditioning did not worsen H-reflex recovery or right/left step asymmetry. These results suggest that H-reflex up-conditioning might enhance functional recovery after nerve injury in humans. They also confirm previous results indicating that compensatory plasticity prevents inappropriate H-reflex conditioning (i.e., down-conditioning) from further impairing function.

">The Impact of Memory and Stress on Choice Consistency</a></h4>

              
                Choice consistency is a fundamental aspect of rational decision-making, reflecting the stability and reliability of an individual's preferences. However, real-world decision-making often deviates from this ideal, as individuals frequently make irrational or inconsistent choices in value-based decision-making. This study combined computational modeling, neuroimaging, and behavioral assessments to elucidate the mechanisms by which stress and memory affect choice consistency. Remembered items exhibited higher choice consistency compared to forgotten items. Computational modeling further indicated that the drift rate was higher, and the decision threshold lower, for remembered food items compared to forgotten ones. Stress was found to impair both choice consistency and memory retrieval, with stress-induced declines in memory accuracy positively correlating with reductions in choice reaction times. Activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during the pre-choice anticipation period was positively associated with choice consistency. Similarly, activation of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during the memory retrieval of food stimuli correlated with improved memory accuracy. These findings suggest that stress may impair choice consistency by disrupting memory retrieval processes. Overall, our study provides novel insights into the role of stress and memory in decision-making, offering a more nuanced understanding of the neural and cognitive processes that govern choice behavior.

">Episodic slow breathing in mice markedly reduces fear responses</a></h4>

              
                We sought to delineate neural mechanisms underlying the effects of controlled breathing in humans, such as in meditation or breathwork, which can reduce depression, anxiety, stress, and pain. Thus, we developed a murine model, where breathing frequency in awake mice can be substantially slowed. When done for 30 min/day for 4 weeks, these mice had significant reductions in stress-related changes in behavior compared to control mice. We conclude that slow breathing effects on emotional state are present in mice, and which cannot be attributed directly to top-down influences such as volitional or emotional control or placebo effects. Our study paves the way for investigations of the neural mechanisms underlying body-brain interactions related to the effects of controlled breathing as well as a platform for optimization of its therapeutic use for amelioration of ordinary and pathological stress and anxiety in humans.

">Cortically-mediated muscle responses to balance perturbations increase with perturbation magnitude in older adults with and without Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                We lack a clear understanding of how cortical contributions to balance are altered in aging and Parkinson's disease (PD), which limits development of rehabilitation strategies. Processes like balance control are typically mediated through brainstem circuits, with higher-order circuits becoming engaged as needed. Using reactive balance recovery, we investigated how hierarchical neural mechanisms shape balance-correcting muscle activity across task difficulty in older adults (OAs) with and without PD. We hypothesize that feedback loops involving brainstem and cortical circuits contribute to balance control, and cortical engagement increases with challenge, aging, and PD. We decomposed perturbation-evoked agonist and antagonist muscle activity into hierarchical components based on latency using neuromechanical models consisting of two feedback loops with different delays to reflect different neural conduction and processing times. Agonist muscle activity was decomposed into two components that both increased with balance challenge in both groups. The first component occurred ~120ms and the second occurred ~210ms, consistent with the latencies of brainstem and transcortical circuits, respectively. Exploratory comparisons to young adults revealed larger transcortical components in OA and PD groups at lower balance challenge levels, consistent with increased cortical involvement with aging. Antagonist muscle activity included destabilizing and stabilizing components, with the destabilizing component correlating to balance ability in OAs but not in PD. These findings demonstrate that neuromechanical models can identify changes in the hierarchical control of balance without direct brain measurements. Identifying cortical contributions during balance control may complement clinical measures of balance ability to inform balance rehabilitation and assistive devices.

">The Role of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex in Ego Dissolution and Emotional Arousal During the Psychedelic State</a></h4>

              
                Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classic serotonergic psychedelic that induces a profoundly altered conscious state. In conjunction with psychological support, it is currently being explored as a treatment for generalized anxiety disorder and depression. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is a brain region that is known to be involved in mood regulation and disorders; hypofunction in the left DLPFC is associated with depression. This study investigated the role of the DLPFC in the psycho-emotional effects of LSD with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data of healthy human participants during the acute LSD experience. In the fMRI data, we measured the correlation between changes in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the DLPFC and post-scan subjective ratings of positive mood, emotional arousal, and ego dissolution. We found significant, positive correlations between ego dissolution and functional connectivity between the left & right DLPFC, thalamus, and a higher-order visual area, the fusiform face area (FFA). Additionally, emotional arousal was significantly associated with increased connectivity between the right DLPFC, intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and the salience network (SN). A confirmational reverse analysis, in which the outputs of the original RSFC analysis were used as input seeds, substantiated the role of the right DLPFC and the aforementioned regions in both ego dissolution and emotional arousal. Subsequently, we measured the effects of LSD on directed functional connectivity in MEG data that was source-localized to the input and output regions of both the original and reverse analyses. The Granger causality (GC) analysis revealed that LSD increased information flow between two nodes of the ego dissolution network, the thalamus and the DLPFC, in the theta band, substantiating the hypothesis that disruptions in thalamic gating underlie the experience of ego dissolution. Overall, this multimodal study elucidates a role for the DLPFC in LSD-induced states of consciousness and sheds more light on the brain basis of ego dissolution.

">Computational Primitives for Cost-Benefit Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                Summary Cost-benefit decision-making is a critical process performed by all organisms, including humans. Various factors, including risk, uncertainty, age, sex, and neuropsychiatric disorders, can alter decision-making. To explore cost-benefit decision-making in humans, we developed a comprehensive task and analysis framework that presents participants with a series of approach-avoid trade-offs across a variety of contexts. With this system, we found that cost-benefit decisions in humans are made using a set of computational strategies that may be used for integrating costs and rewards, which we term decision-making primitives. We further show that these decision-making primitives are used by rodents performing a similar decision-making task. We find that utilization of these primitives in both rodents and humans shifts based on factors like hunger and sex, and that individuals use primitives differently. We additionally demonstrate that using a naturally-inspired neural network architecture generates output that overlaps with human and rodent performance over a non-constrained neural network. This novel conceptual framework, by isolating discrete decision-making primitive, has potential to help us identify how different brain regions give rise to decision-making behavior, as well as to facilitate better diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders and development of naturally-inspired artificial intelligence systems of decision-making.

">4-Phenylbutyric acid modulates Connexin 43 expression restricting murine-β-coronavirus infectivity and virus-induced demyelination</a></h4>

              
                Gap junction intercellular communication, particularly involving Connexin 43 and Connexin 47, plays a critical role in maintaining CNS homeostasis and has been implicated in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) pathology. Thus, warranting further studies in experimental animal models to understand how modulation of Cx43 expression can influence MS pathology. Intracranial infection with murine {beta}-coronavirus Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV-A59) in mice results in acute pathology characterized by high viral titers, glial activation in the brain and chronic neuroinflammatory demyelination, effectively mimicking key pathological hallmarks of MS and serving as a robust model to investigate its viral etiology. MHV-A59 infection leads to a pronounced downregulation of Cx43 during the acute phase, emphasizing its critical role in virus-induced CNS pathology. In this study, we investigated the potential of in vivo 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) administration in modulating Cx43 expression in this MHV-induced model and its consequence on chronic virus-induced demyelination. Our results reveal that 4-PBA treatment reduced acute MHV-A59 infectivity and viral spread in the brain while modulating the glial cell response, mounting host immunity. Treatment with 4-PBA effectively preserved the expression of both Cx43 and Cx47 in infected CNS cells, counteracting their infection-induced downregulation. Furthermore, MHV-A59 infection downregulated the expression of ER-resident thioredoxin family protein (ERp29), a well-known molecular chaperone of Cx43, which was rescued by 4-PBA treatment. We further validated if such downregulation of ERp29 is also evident in MS demyelinating plaques. In human MS patient-derived brain tissue, reduced Cx43 and ERp29 staining was observed in demyelinating plaques. Our studies revealed that 4-PBA treatment not only limits viral replication and spread throughout the brain but also protects the mice against severe chronic neuroinflammatory demyelination. These findings suggest that targeting Cx43 with 4-PBA holds significant therapeutic potential for addressing virus-induced neuroinflammatory demyelination and MS by preserving gap junction intercellular communication.

">Experimental Design Optimization for Brain Microstructure Imaging via Automatic Differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Accurate characterization of brain microstructure using diffusion MRI (dMRI) relies on optimal, information-rich scanning protocols. Presently, without such protocols, extensive datasets are necessary to image intricate brain microarchitecture by fitting complex biophysical models to data. This impedes full realization of dMRI's potential, particularly in time-constrained clinical scans. To tackle this, we introduce a novel framework based on the Cramer-Rao lower bound to optimize dMRI protocols for any multi-compartment biophysical models, to accurately capture features like axonal diameter index and multiple fiber orientations in a voxel. Unlike previous methods, limited in model complexity or parameter scope, our framework handles all model parameters, including water diffusivities, enhancing estimation fidelity. Leveraging automatic differentiation and parallel computing via TensorFlow, this approach systematically explores the entire parameter space for comprehensive protocol optimization. By optimizing dMRI protocols, this work stands to significantly enhance biophysical modeling accuracy, deepening our understanding of brain microstructure in health and disease.

                Dopamine loss alters the activity of neural circuits in the basal ganglia, contributing to motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease and catalepsy. Treatments that reduce basal ganglia pathophysiology alleviate motor symptoms but require maintenance. Cell-type specific interventions can reduce pathophysiology and provide sustained therapeutic benefits, but a lack of understanding of pathways involved limits translation. Here, we establish patterns of neuromodulation and electrophysiological biomarkers at the level of basal ganglia output that predict the duration of therapeutic effects. Focal activation of neurons in the ventromedial substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) engaged a gradual recovery of movement that persisted for hours after treatment, accompanied by a persistent reduction in parkinsonian pathophysiology. Global SNr inhibition, as prescribed by the classic rate model, provided only transient effects on movement and did not reverse network pathophysiology. These findings represent important steps towards developing therapeutic strategies that aim to repair, rather than simply mask, circuit dysfunction in disease.

                Muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is the key signalling molecule in neuromuscular junctions. Here we present the structures of full-length human adult receptors in complex with Fab35 in -bungarotoxin (BuTx)-bound resting states, and in acetylcholine (ACh)-bound desensitised states. In addition to identifying the conformational changes during recovery from desensitisation, we also used electrophysiology to probe the effects of eight previously unstudied AChR genetic variants found in congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) patients, revealing they cause either slow- or fast-channel CMS characterised by prolonged or abbreviated ion channel bursts. The combined kinetic and structural data offer a better understanding of both AChR state transition and the pathogenic mechanisms of disease variants.

">Exploring the relationship between GBA1 host genotype and gut microbiome in the GBA1L444P/WT mouse model: Implications for Parkinson disease pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Heterozygous variants in GBA1 are the commonest genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD) but penetrance is incomplete. GBA1 dysfunction can cause gastrointestinal disturbances and microbiome changes in preclinical models. Mounting evidence suggests that the microbiota-gut-brain axis is potentially implicated in PD pathogenesis. Whether the gut microbiome composition is influenced by host GBA1 genetics in heterozygosis has never been explored. Objectives: To evaluate whether heterozygosity for the GBA1 pathogenic L444P variant can cause perturbations in gut microbiome composition. Methods: Faecal samples collected from GBA1L444P/WT and GBA1WT/WT mice at 3 and 6 months of age were analysed through shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Results: No differences in - and {beta}-diversity were detected between genotyped groups, at either time points. Overall, we found a little variation of the gut microbiome composition and functional potential between GBA1L444P/WT and GBA1WT/WT mice over time. Conclusion: Host GBA1 genotype does not impact gut microbiome structure and composition in the presented GBA1L444P/WT mouse model. Studies investigating the effect of a second hit on gut physiology and microbiome composition could explain the partial penetrance of GBA1 variants in PD.

">Traveling waves enhance hippocampal-parahippocampal couplings in humanepisodic and working memory</a></h4>

              
                Multiple brain regions in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) are coordinated in memory processing. Traveling waves is a potential mechanism to coordinate information transfer through organizing the timing or spatiotemporal patterns of wave propagation. Based on direct human intracranial EEG recordings, we detected bidirectional hippocampal and parahippocampal traveling waves (4-10 Hz) along the posterior-anterior axis during a verbal memory task. Hippocampal traveling waves enhanced hippocampal- parahippocampal and intra-hippocampal couplings in both amplitude and phase as well as hippocampal theta phase-gamma amplitude coupling, suggesting a facilitatory role of TWs. Granger causality analysis showed asymmetric information flow, with greater predictability in the parahippocampal-to-hippocampal direction and dominant peak at the beta band (20-30 Hz). Hippocampal power and bidirectional hippocampal-parahippocampal information flow at the gamma band (35-50 Hz) showed reductions during successful memory encoding trials. These results support functional significance of frequency-specific parahippocampal-hippocampal and intra-hippocampal communications during memory encoding and retrieval.

	<p>(1) Background: Cognitive failures, including lapses in attention, memory, and executive functioning, can negatively affect daily performance and well-being. Negative and positive affectivity have been implicated in cognitive functioning, yet their relationship with cognitive failures remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of positive and negative affect on cognitive failures, using daily diary methods to examine both within-person and between-person associations in a sample of younger adults from Singapore and adults across the lifespan from the United States (US). (2) Methods: Participants (Singapore: N = 253, US: N = 1726) completed daily diaries over seven (Singapore) or eight (US) consecutive days. Multilevel modelling was used to analyse both within- and between-person relationships between affect and cognitive failures, controlling for demographic and socioeconomic variables. (3) Results: In both the Singapore and US samples, negative affect was consistently positively associated with cognitive failures at both levels (SG within-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.21, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; SG between-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.58, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; US within-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.08, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; US between-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.28, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), supporting the influence of negative affective experiences on cognitive lapses. However, positive affect showed no significant associations with daily cognitive failures in the Singapore sample (within-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.01, p = 0.683; between-person: &amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;0.04, p = 0.484) and only a between-person negative association in the US sample (within-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.02, p = 0.157; between-person: &amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;0.11, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). (4) Conclusion: These findings suggest that positive and negative affect differentially influence individual differences and intra-individual changes in daily cognitive failures among both younger and older adults.</p>

	<p>Background: Auditory&amp;amp;ndash;tactile integration is an important research area in multisensory integration. Especially in special environments (e.g., traffic noise and complex work environments), auditory&amp;amp;ndash;tactile integration is crucial for human response and decision making. We investigated the influence of attention on the temporal course and spatial distribution of auditory&amp;amp;ndash;tactile integration. Methods: Participants received auditory stimuli alone, tactile stimuli alone, and simultaneous auditory and tactile stimuli, which were randomly presented on the left or right side. For each block, participants attended to all stimuli on the designated side and detected uncommon target stimuli while ignoring all stimuli on the other side. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded via 64 scalp electrodes. Integration was quantified by comparing the response to the combined stimulus to the sum of the responses to the auditory and tactile stimuli presented separately. Results: The results demonstrated that compared to the unattended condition, integration occurred earlier and involved more brain regions in the attended condition when the stimulus was presented in the left hemispace. The unattended condition involved a more extensive range of brain regions and occurred earlier than the attended condition when the stimulus was presented in the right hemispace. Conclusions: Attention can modulate auditory&amp;amp;ndash;tactile integration and show systematic differences between the left and right hemispaces. These findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of auditory&amp;amp;ndash;tactile information processing in the human brain.</p>

	<p>Objective: This study aimed to explore longitudinal relationships between neurophysiological biomarkers and upper limb motor function recovery in stroke patients, focusing on electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) metrics. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study analyzed neurophysiological, clinical, and demographic data from 102 stroke patients enrolled in the DEFINE cohort. We investigated the associations between baseline and post-intervention changes in the EEG theta/alpha ratio (TAR) and TMS metrics with upper limb motor functionality, assessed using the outcomes of five tests: the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Handgrip Strength Test (HST), Pinch Strength Test (PST), Finger Tapping Test (FTT), and Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT). Results: Our multivariate models identified that a higher baseline TAR in the lesioned hemisphere was consistently associated with poorer motor outcomes across all five assessments. Conversely, a higher improvement in the TAR was positively associated with improvements in FMA and 9HPT. Additionally, an increased TMS motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude in the non-lesioned hemisphere correlated with greater FMA-diff, while a lower TMS Short Intracortical Inhibition (SICI) in the non-lesioned hemisphere was linked to better PST improvements. These findings suggest the potential of the TAR and TMS metrics as biomarkers for predicting motor recovery in stroke patients. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the significance of the TAR in the lesioned hemisphere as a predictor of motor function recovery post-stroke and also a potential signature for compensatory oscillations. The observed relationships between the TAR and motor improvements, as well as the associations with TMS metrics, underscore the potential of these neurophysiological measures in guiding personalized rehabilitation strategies for stroke patients.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Chronic pain is a highly debilitating condition that differs by type, prevalence, and severity between men and women. To uncover the molecular underpinnings of these differences, it is critical to analyze the transcriptomes of spinal cord pain-processing networks for both sexes. Despite several recently published single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) studies on the function and composition of the mouse spinal cord, a gene expression analysis investigating the differences between males and females has yet to be performed. Here, we combined data from three different large-scale snRNA-seq studies, which used sex-identified adult mice. Using SeqSeek, we classified more than 37,000 unique viable cells within predicted cell types with the use of machine learning. We then utilized DESeq2 to identify significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between males and females in a variety of cell populations, including superficial dorsal horn (SDH) neurons. We found a large number of DEGs between males and females in all cells, in neurons, and in SDH neurons of the mouse spinal cord, with a greater level of differential expression in inhibitory SDH neurons compared to excitatory SDH neurons. The results of these analyses are available on an open-source web-app: <a target="_blank"

Lastly, we used gene set enrichment analysis to identify sex-enriched pathways from our previously identified DEGs. Through this, we have identified specific genetic players within the rodent spinal cord that diverge between males and females, which may underlie reported sex differences in spinal nociceptive mechanisms and pain processing.</p>

                Zhou et al. show that high environmental temperature triggers a preventive immune response in C. elegans via the ER UPR, distinct from pathogen invasion requiring the mitochondrial UPR. This activation leads to ribosome biogenesis suppression and oleic acid accumulation, subsequently activating the PMK-1/p38 pathway and highlighting ER-nucleolus crosstalk in innate immunity and lifespan.

                Cavalleri et al. show that in Arabidopsis roots, the accumulation of MP and MP11ir splicing isoform is post-translationally regulated. MP is stable in high-auxin tissues, whereas interaction with AUX/IAAs causes its degradation at low auxin levels. MP isoforms are required to ensure correct root development and sensitivity to auxin.

">M102, a combined NRF2 and HSF-1 activator for neuroprotection in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</a></h4>

              
                Abstract: M102 is a central nervous system (CNS) penetrant small molecule electrophile which activates in vivo the NFE2-related factor 2 antioxidant response element (NRF2-ARE) pathway, as well as transcription of heat-shock element (HSE) associated genes. In the TDP-43Q331K transgenic mouse model of ALS dosed subcutaneously at 5mg/kg OD or 2.5mg/kg BD with M102, significant improvements in compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude of hind limb muscles and gait parameters were observed at 6 months of age, with associated target engagement. An oral dose response study of M102 in SOD1G93A transgenic mice showed a dose-dependent improvement in the CMAP of hindlimb muscles which correlated with preservation of lumbar spinal motor neurons at the same time point. These data enabled prediction of human efficacious exposures and doses, which were well within the safety margin predicted from Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology studies. A parallel program of work in vitro showed that M102 rescued motor neuron survival in co-culture with patient-derived astrocytes from sporadic, C9orf72 and SOD1 cases. Markers of oxidative stress, as well as indices of TDP-43 proteinopathy were also reduced by exposure to M102 in these in vitro models. This comprehensive package of preclinical efficacy data across two mouse models as well as patient-derived astrocyte toxicity assays, provides a strong rationale for clinical evaluation of M102 in ALS patients. Combined with the development of target engagement biomarkers and the completed preclinical toxicology package, a clear translational pathway to testing in ALS patients has been developed.

	<p>Objectives: Dementia is becoming a major health problem in the world, and chronic brain ischemia is an established important risk factor in predisposing this disease. Astrocytes, as one major part of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB), are activated during chronic cerebral blood flow hypoperfusion. Reactive astrocytes have been classified into phenotype pro-inflammatory type A1 or neuroprotective type A2. However, the specific subtype change of astrocyte and the mechanisms of chronic brain ischemia are still unknown. Methods: In order to depict the phenotype changes and their possible roles during this process, a rat bilateral common carotid artery occlusion model (BCAO) was employed in the present study. Meanwhile, the signaling pathways that possibly regulate these changes were investigated as well. Results: After four-week occlusion, astrocytes in the cortex of BCAO rats were shown to be the A2 phenotype, identified by the significant up-regulation of S100a10 accompanied by the down-regulation of Connexin 43 (CX43) protein. Next, we established in vitro hypoxia models, which were set up by stimulating primary astrocyte cultures from rat cortex with cobalt chloride, low glucose, or/and fibrinogen. Consistent with in vivo data, the cultured astrocytes also transformed into the A2 phenotype with the up-regulation of S100a10 and the down-regulation of CX43. In order to explore the mechanism of CX43 protein changes, C6 astrocyte cells were handled in both hypoxia and low-glucose stimulus, in which decreased pERK and pJNK expression were found. Conclusions: In conclusion, our data suggest that in chronic cerebral ischemia conditions, the gradual ischemic insults could promote the transformation of astrocytes into A2 type instead of A1 type, and the phosphorylation of CX43 was negatively regulated by the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK. Also, our data could provide some new evidence of how to leverage the endogenous astrocytes phenotype changes during CNS injury by promoting them to be &amp;amp;ldquo;protector&amp;amp;rdquo; and not &amp;amp;ldquo;culprit&amp;amp;rdquo;.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCIs) are a rapidly developing technology that captures and transmits brain signals to external sources, allowing the user control of devices such as prosthetics. BCI technology offers the potential to restore physical capabilities in the body and change how we interact and communicate with computers and each other. While BCI technology has existed for decades, recent developments have caused the technology to generate a host of ethical issues and discussions in both academic and public circles. Given that media representation has the potential to shape public perception and policy, it is necessary to evaluate the space that these issues take in public discourse. Methods: We conducted a rapid review of media articles in English discussing ethical issues of BCI technology from 2013 to 2024 as indexed by LexisNexis. Our searches yielded 675 articles, with a final sample containing 182 articles. We assessed the themes of the articles and coded them based on the ethical issues discussed, ethical frameworks, recommendations, tone, and application of technology. Results: Our results showed a marked rise in interest in media articles over time, signaling an increased focus on this topic. The majority of articles adopted a balanced or neutral tone when discussing BCIs and focused on ethical issues regarding privacy, autonomy, and regulation. Conclusions: Current discussion of ethical issues reflects growing news coverage of companies such as Neuralink, and reveals a mounting distrust of BCI technology. The growing recognition of ethical considerations in BCI highlights the importance of ethical discourse in shaping the future of the field.</p>

	<p>Background: Currently, there is a need for approaches to understand and manage the multidimensional autism spectrum and quantify its heterogeneity. The diagnosis is based on behaviors observed in two key dimensions, social communication and repetitive, restricted behaviors, alongside the identification of required support levels. However, it is now recognized that additional modifiers, such as language abilities, IQ, and comorbidities, are essential for a more comprehensive assessment of the complex clinical presentations and clinical trajectories in autistic individuals. Different approaches have been used to identify autism subgroups based on the genetic and clinical heterogeneity, recognizing the importance of autistic behaviors and the assessment of modifiers. While valuable, these methods are limited in their ability to evaluate a specific individual in relation to a normative reference sample of autistic individuals. A quantitative score based on axes of phenotypic variability could be useful to compare individuals, evaluate the homogeneity of subgroups, and follow trajectories of an individual or a specific group. Here we propose an approach by (i) combining measures of phenotype variability that contribute to clinical presentation and could impact different trajectories in autistic persons and (ii) using it with normative modeling to assess the clinical heterogeneity of a specific individual. Methods: Using phenotypic data available in a comprehensive reference sample, the Simons Simplex Collection (n = 2744 individuals), we performed principal component analysis (PCA) to find components of phenotypic variability. Features that contribute to clinical heterogeneity and could impact trajectories in autistic people were assessed by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Cognitive assessment was estimated by the Total Intelligence Quotient (IQ). Results: Three PCs embedded 72% of the normative sample variance. PCA-projected dimensions supported normative modeling where a multivariate normal distribution was used to calculate percentiles. A Multidimensional General Functionality Score (MGFS) to evaluate new prospective single subjects was developed based on percentiles. Conclusions: Our approach proposes a basis for comparing individuals, or one individual at two or more times and evaluating homogeneity in phenotypic clinical presentation and possibly guides research sample selection for clinical trials.</p>

                <p>Increasing data suggest a crucial relationship between glycolipid metabolic disorder and neuropsychiatric injury. The aim of this study is to investigate the behavioral performance changes and neuropathological injuries in mice challenged with high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ). The glucose metabolism indicators and behavioral performance were detected. The mRNA expression of IL-1&beta;, IL-6, TNF-&alpha;, ocln, zo-1, and clnds and protein expression of APP, p-Tau, p-IRS1, p-AKT, p-ERK, and TREM1/2 were measured. The fluorescence intensities of MAP-2, NeuN, APP, p-Tau, GFAP, and IBA-1 were observed. The results showed that combination of HFD and STZ/I.P. could induce glucose metabolic turmoil and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropsychiatric dysfunction in mice, as indicated by the increased concentrations of fasting blood glucose and impaired learning and memory ability. Moreover, the model mice presented increased levels of APP, p-Tau, p-IRS1, TREM2, IL-1&beta;, IL-6, TNF-&alpha;, ocln, zo-1, and clnds; decreased levels of p-AKT, p-ERK, and TREM1; and neuron damage and the hyperactivation of astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampus as compared with control mice. Only male mice were used in this study. Although AD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are distinct pathologies, our results suggested that combination of HFD and STZ/I.P., a widely used T2DM modeling method, could successfully induce AD-like behavioral impairments and neuropathological injuries in mice; the mechanism might be involved with neuroinflammation and its associated dysfunction of IRS1/AKT/ERK signaling pathway. Our findings further support the potential overlap between T2DM and AD pathophysiology, providing insight into the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of these diseases.</p>

                <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication, cognitive rigidity, and atypical sensory processing. Recent studies suggest that the basal ganglia, specifically the striatum (NSt), plays an important role in ASD. While striatal interneurons, including cholinergic (ChAT<sup>+</sup>) and parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) GABAergic neurons, have been described to be altered in animal models of ASD, their specific contribution remains elusive. Here, we combined behavioral, anatomical, and electrophysiological quantifications to explore if interneuron balance could be implicated in atypical sensory processing in cortical and striatal somatosensory regions of rats subjected to a valproic acid (VPA) model of ASD. We found that VPA animals showed a significant decrease in the number of ChAT<sup>+</sup> and PV<sup>+</sup> cells in multiple regions (including the sensorimotor region) of the NSt. We also observed significantly different sensory-evoked responses at the single-neuron and population levels in both striatal and cortical regions, as well as corticostriatal interactions. Therefore, selective elimination of striatal PV<sup>+</sup> neurons only partially recapitulated the effects of VPA, indicating that the mechanisms behind the VPA phenotype are much more complex than the elimination of a particular neural subpopulation. Our results indicate that VPA exposure induced significant histological changes in ChAT<sup>+</sup> and PV<sup>+</sup> cells accompanied by atypical sensory-evoked corticostriatal population dynamics that could partially explain the sensory processing differences associated with ASD.</p>

                <p>by Karim G. Habashy, Benjamin D. Evans, Dan F. M. Goodman, Jeffrey S. Bowers</p>

Brains have evolved diverse neurons with varying morphologies and dynamics that impact temporal information processing. In contrast, most neural network models use homogeneous units that vary only in spatial parameters (weights and biases). To explore the importance of temporal parameters, we trained spiking neural networks on tasks with varying temporal complexity, holding different parameter subsets constant. We found that adapting conduction delays is crucial for solving all test conditions under tight resource constraints. Remarkably, these tasks can be solved using only temporal parameters (delays and time constants) with constant weights. In more complex spatio-temporal tasks, an adaptable bursting parameter was essential. Overall, allowing adaptation of both temporal and spatial parameters enhances network robustness to noise, a vital feature for biological brains and neuromorphic computing systems. Our findings suggest that rich and adaptable dynamics may be the key for solving temporally structured tasks efficiently in evolving organisms, which would help explain the diverse physiological properties of biological neurons.

                <p>by Pengyu Liu, Jacob Lusk, Nataša Jonoska, Mariel Vázquez</p>

R-loops are a class of non-canonical nucleic acid structures that typically form during transcription when the nascent RNA hybridizes the DNA template strand, leaving the non-template DNA strand unpaired. These structures are abundant in nature and play important physiological and pathological roles. Recent research shows that DNA sequence and topology affect R-loops, yet it remains unclear how these and other factors contribute to R-loop formation. In this work, we investigate the link between nascent RNA folding and the formation of R-loops. We introduce tree-polynomials, a new class of representations of RNA secondary structures. A tree-polynomial representation consists of a rooted tree associated with an RNA secondary structure together with a polynomial that is uniquely identified with the rooted tree. Tree-polynomials enable accurate, interpretable and efficient data analysis of RNA secondary structures without pseudoknots. We develop a computational pipeline for investigating and predicting R-loop formation from a genomic sequence. The pipeline obtains nascent RNA secondary structures from a co-transcriptional RNA folding software, and computes the tree-polynomial representations of the structures. By applying this pipeline to plasmid sequences that contain R-loop forming genes, we establish a strong correlation between the coefficient sums of tree-polynomials and the experimental probability of R-loop formation. Such strong correlation indicates that the pipeline can be used for accurate R-loop prediction. Furthermore, the interpretability of tree-polynomials allows us to characterize the features of RNA secondary structure associated with R-loop formation. In particular, we identify that branches with short stems separated by bulges and interior loops are associated with R-loops.

In the era of precision medicine, it is necessary to understand heterogeneity among patients with complex diseases to improve personalized prevention and management strategies. Here, we introduce ClustAll, a Bioconductor package designed for unsupervised patient stratification using clinical data. ClustAll is based on the previously validated methodology ClustAll, a clustering framework that effectively handles intricacies in clinical data, including mixed data types, missing values, and collinearity. Additionally, ClustAll stands out in its ability to identify multiple patient stratifications within the same population while ensuring their robustness. The updated implementation of ClustAll features S4 classes, parallel computing for enhanced computational efficiency, and user-friendly tools for exploring and comparing stratifications against clinical phenotypes. The performance of ClustAll has been validated using two public clinical datasets, confirming its effectiveness in patient stratification and highlighting its potential impact on clinical management. In summary, ClustAll is a powerful tool for patient stratification in personalized medicine.

Mosquito-related diseases pose a significant threat to global public health, necessitating efficient and accurate mosquito classification for effective surveillance and control. This work presents an innovative approach to mosquito classification by leveraging state-of-the-art vision transformers and open-set learning techniques. A novel framework has been introduced that integrates Transformer-based deep learning models with comprehensive data augmentation and preprocessing methods, enabling robust and precise identification of ten mosquito species. The Swin Transformer model achieves the best performance for traditional closed-set learning with 99.60% accuracy and 0.996 F1 score. The lightweight MobileViT technique attains an almost equivalent accuracy of 98.90% with significantly reduced parameters and model complexities. Next, the applied deep learning models’ adaptability and generalizability in a static environment have been enhanced by using new classes of data samples during the inference stage that have not been included in the training set. The proposed framework’s ability to handle unseen classes like insects similar to mosquitoes, even humans, through open-set learning further enhances its practical applicability employing the OpenMax technique and Weibull distribution. The traditional CNN model, Xception, outperforms the latest transformer with higher accuracy and F1 score for open-set learning. The study’s findings highlight the transformative potential of advanced deep-learning architectures in entomology, providing a strong groundwork for future research and development in mosquito surveillance and vector control. The implications of this work extend beyond mosquito classification, offering valuable insights for broader ecological and environmental monitoring applications.

                <p>by Emine Celiker, Charlie Woodrow, Òscar Guadayol, Leonidas-Romanos Davranoglou, Christian M. Schlepütz, Beth Mortimer, Graham K. Taylor, Stuart Humphries, Fernando Montealegre-Z</p>

Mammalian hearing operates on three basic steps: 1) sound capturing, 2) impedance conversion, and 3) frequency analysis. While these canonical steps are vital for acoustic communication and survival in mammals, they are not unique to them. An equivalent mechanism has been described for katydids (Insecta), and it is unique to this group among invertebrates. The katydid inner ear resembles an uncoiled cochlea, and has a length less than 1 mm. Their inner ears contain a hearing organ, <i>crista acustica</i>, which holds tonotopically arranged sensory cells for frequency mapping via travelling waves. The <i>crista acustica</i> is located on a curved triangular surface formed by the dorsal wall of the ear canal. While empirical recordings show tonotopic vibrations in the katydid inner ear for frequency analysis, the biophysical mechanism leading to tonotopy remains elusive due to the small size and complexity of the hearing organ. In this study, robust numerical simulations are developed for an <i>in silico</i> investigation of this process. Simulations are based on the precise katydid inner ear geometry obtained by synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography, and empirically determined inner ear fluid properties for an accurate representation of the underlying mechanism. We demonstrate that the triangular structure below the hearing organ drives the tonotopy and travelling waves in the inner ear, and thus has an equivalent role to the mammalian basilar membrane. This reveals a stronger analogy between the inner ear basic mechanical networks of two organisms with ancient evolutionary differences and independent phylogenetic histories.

                <p>by Victor Geadah, Stefan Horoi, Giancarlo Kerg, Guy Wolf, Guillaume Lajoie</p>

Neurons in the brain have rich and adaptive input-output properties. Features such as heterogeneous f-I curves and spike frequency adaptation are known to place single neurons in optimal coding regimes when facing changing stimuli. Yet, it is still unclear how brain circuits exploit single-neuron flexibility, and how network-level requirements may have shaped such cellular function. To answer this question, a multi-scaled approach is needed where the computations of single neurons and neural circuits must be considered as a complete system. In this work, we use artificial neural networks to systematically investigate single-neuron input-output adaptive mechanisms, optimized in an end-to-end fashion. Throughout the optimization process, each neuron has the liberty to modify its nonlinear activation function parametrized to mimic f-I curves of biological neurons, either by learning an individual static function or via a learned and shared adaptation mechanism to modify activation functions in real-time during a task. We find that such adaptive networks show much-improved robustness to noise and changes in input statistics. Using tools from dynamical systems theory, we analyze the role of these emergent single-neuron properties and argue that neural diversity and adaptation play an active regularization role, enabling neural circuits to optimally propagate information across time. Finally, we outline similarities between these optimized solutions and known coding strategies found in biological neurons, such as gain scaling and fractional order differentiation/integration.

                <p>by Jorin Overwiening, Federico Tesler, Domenico Guarino, Alain Destexhe</p>

The thalamus is the brain’s central relay station, orchestrating sensory processing and cognitive functions. However, how thalamic function depends on internal and external states, is not well understood. A comprehensive understanding would necessitate the integration of single cell dynamics with their collective behavior at population level. For this we propose a biologically realistic mean-field model of the thalamus, describing thalamocortical relay neurons (TC) and thalamic reticular neurons (RE). We perform a multi-scale study of thalamic responsiveness and its dependence on cell and brain states. Building upon existing single-cell experiments we show that: (1) Awake and sleep-like states can be defined via the absence/presence of the neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh), which controls bursting in TC and RE. (2) Thalamic response to sensory stimuli is linear in awake state and becomes nonlinear in sleep state, while cortical input generates nonlinear response in both awake and sleep state. (3) Stimulus response is controlled by cortical input, which suppresses responsiveness in awake state while it ‘wakes-up’ the thalamus in sleep state promoting a linear response. (4) Synaptic noise induces a global linear responsiveness, diminishing the difference in response between thalamic states. Finally, the model replicates spindle oscillations within a sleep-like state, exhibiting a qualitative change in activity and responsiveness. The development of this thalamic mean-field model provides a new tool for incorporating detailed thalamic dynamics in large scale brain simulations.

                <p>by Tina Lenče, Johannes Sulzer, Kilian Andress, Anne-Sophie Gribling-Burrer, Vanessa Lamm-Schmidt, Lars Barquist, Redmond P. Smyth, Franziska Faber</p>

Bacterial noncoding RNAs fulfill a variety of cellular functions as catalysts, as scaffolds in protein complexes or as regulators of gene expression. They often exhibit complex tertiary structures that are a key determinant of their biochemical function. Here, we characterize the structured “<i>raiA</i> motif” RNA from <i>Clostridioides difficile</i>, which is conserved in more than 2,500 bacterial species from the phyla Bacillota and Actinomycetota. We show that its transcript abundance and stability in exponentially growing bacteria rivals that of ribosomal RNAs. Deletion of the “<i>raiA</i> motif” RNA is associated with delayed transition into stationary phase, and changes in stationary phase pathways such as spore formation, hence we rename it ModT (modulator of transition phase). Mechanistically, we show that ModT-mediated changes in cellular cyclic di-GMP levels are linked to the pronounced sporulation defect in the <i>modT</i> mutant. Importantly, we show that expression profiles and isoform patterns of ModT are conserved in <i>Clostridium perfringens</i> and <i>Paeniclostridium sordellii</i>, and that these orthologs can functionally complement ModT in <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i>. Chemical structure probing of ModT in vivo reveals dynamic refolding and provides initial evidence for a potential association of ModT with proteins. In summary, our findings indicate that ModT fulfills a conserved role in regulating growth transitions in bacteria and provide a crucial step towards delineating its molecular mechanism.

                Background Aromatic hydrocarbons such as Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene and Xylene (BTEX), give us an environmental challenge. They can be degraded by strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, through emulsification (rhl genes) and biodegradation processes. The BTEX tolerance genes (mlaABCD) may be present in it. The aim of this research was to evaluate, through comparative genomics, the genes of the rhl and mla systems in six strains isolated from hydrocarbon polluted environments. Methods This study examines six Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated sites in Peru. Each strain shows capabilities like hydrocarbon degradation and heavy metal tolerance. After DNA extraction, sequencing, and quality-controlled assembly, functional genome annotation was performed using BAKTA. Comparative analysis included high-quality Pseudomonas genomes from RefSeq, with ANI metrics to assess genetic similarity. A phylogenetic tree, built from core gene alignment, reveals evolutionary connections and was visualized with iTOL. Results Results showed that all strains had a double copy of the rhlB gene, arranged in the same organization, with rhlABRI genes always adjacent in a 3′-5′ direction. However, rhlG varied in position and orientation among strains, often near rhlC. The C1BHIC5 strain had only one copy of the rhlB gene, and the 3′ – 5 orientation of the rhlG gene was the exception. Most strains had two copies of mlaA, mlaFEDC, and mlaEFD genes for toluene tolerance, with diverse orientations across strains. High synteny was noted within mla gene blocks. Compared to Pseudomonas putida, where mla genes are positioned between murA and ppcD with an additional toluene tolerance gene (ttg2D), strains of P. aeruginosa strains display a similar yet distinct gene arrangement. Conclusions In conclusion, the presence of the rhlABC genes in all the strains analyzed and the BTEX tolerance genes allowed us to understand the great ability of P. aeruginosa to survive in polluted environments.

                Introduction We examined the predictors of tobacco smoking initiation considering factors such as age, gender, pocket money, exposure to smoke in public outdoor places, anti-tobacco media, smoking parents, smoking teachers, and smoking friends among adolescents in Indonesia. Methods Using data from the 2014–2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey grades 7–12, data from 9,655 teenagers were analyzed. The research used the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) questionnaire. The analysis used univariate, chi-square and logistic regression with the STATA application version 15. Results In total, 9655 adolescent respondents participated. Multivariate tests indicated that teenagers aged 13-15 years (AOR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.08-1.66) and teenagers aged> 15 years (AOR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.25-2.17), teenagers who were male (AOR: 13.99, 95% CI: 11.11-17.63), teenagers who were exposed to cigarette smoke in public places outside the room (AOR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.74-2.29), teenagers who had never seen anti-tobacco messages in the mass media (AOR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02-1.48), Teenagers who had parents who smoke (AOR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.08-1.46), teenagers who saw teachers smoking in the school area (AOR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.18-1.71), and teenagers who accepted offers of cigarettes from friends (AOR: 15.11, 95% CI: 10.33-22.11). Conclusion The initiation of tobacco smoking among teenagers in Indonesia can be predicted by various factors such as age, gender, exposure to smoke in outdoor public places, exposure to anti-tobacco media, and influence of parents, teachers, and friends.

                Background In broiler farming, vaccination against Newcastle disease (ND) is essential. Nonetheless, during the post-vaccination phase, production may be negatively impacted by mycotoxin contamination in feed. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of toxin binders on antibody titer and large intestine histopathology after ND vaccination in broiler with aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and ochratoxin A (OTA) toxication. Methods A total of 20 broilers were randomly assigned into 4 groups with 5 replications i.e. (C-) broiler groups with basal feed, (C+) broiler groups with AFB1 and OTA feed contamination, (T1) and (T2) broiler groups with exposed AFB1, OTA, and toxin binders as feed additives with dose 1.1 g/kg and 1.6 g/kg feed, respectively. ND vaccination was carried out on day 7 and 21. Antibody titers were evaluated from serum samples of broiler on days 14, 28, and 35 for further hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. Histopathology of the cecum and colon organs was evaluated using HE staining on day 36. HI test and histological scoring were analyzed using the One-Way ANOVA, followed by Duncan’s test with a p < 0.05 in SPSS v.26 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results As a result, histopathological improvement of the cecum and colon was reported based on mucosal rupture, hemorrhage and necrosis on day 35. An increase in the mean antibody titer compared to days 14 and 28 was observed on day 35, with significant changes observed in serum samples based on the C+ group, which was significantly different from the C- and T2 groups (p < 0.05). Conclusions This study revealed that toxin binder dose of 1.6 g/kg can increase antibody titer and histopathology of cecum and colon in broiler chickens after ND vaccination fed with mycotoxin-contaminated feed.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hypothesis that the hippocampal theta rhythm consists of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) was critical for understanding the theta rhythm. The dominant views in the early 1980s were that intracellularly recorded theta consisted of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) with little participation by IPSPs, and that IPSPs generated a closed monopolar field in the hippocampus. I (Leung) conceived of a new model for generation of the hippocampal theta rhythm, with theta-rhythmic IPSPs as an essential component, and thus sought to reinvestigate the relation between theta and IPSPs quantitatively with intracellular and extracellular recordings. The intracellular recordings were performed by Leung and Yim in the laboratory of Kris Krnjević at McGill University. Using protocols of passing steady-state holding currents and injection of chloride ions, the intracellular theta and IPSP in a CA1 neuron typically showed the same reversal potential and correlated change in amplitude. Low-intensity stimulation of the alveus evoked an antidromic action potential in CA1 neurons, identifying them as pyramidal cells with output axons in the alveus, which then activated a feedback IPSP with almost no excitatory component. Theta-rhythmic somatic inhibition, together with phase-shifted theta-rhythmic distal apical dendritic excitation were proposed as the two dipoles that generate a gradual extracellular theta phase shift in the CA1 apical dendritic layer. The distal apical excitation driven by the entorhinal cortex was proposed to be atropine-resistant and dominated during walking in rats. Other than serving a conventional role in limiting excitation, rhythmic proximal inhibition and distal dendritic excitation provide varying phasic modulation along the soma-dendritic axis of pyramidal cells, resulting in theta phase-dependent synaptic plasticity and gamma oscillations, which are likely involved in cognitive processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23665?af=R">Pursuing Synaptic Plasticity From Cortex to LTP in the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Here I describe how an interest in synaptic plasticity took me from a PhD at McGill, where I worked on activity-dependent plasticity in the responses of single units in the association cortex of anesthetized cats, to a collaboration with Terje Lømo in Per Andersen's laboratory in Oslo in 1968–9. There we followed up on Lømo's discovery of LTP, published as an abstract in 1966, to produce the first detailed description of the phenomenon. Later, in London, Tony Gardner-Medwin and I showed that LTP lasting for days could be obtained in the awake rabbit. The two papers were published together in the <i>Journal of Physiology</i> in 1973. I relate how difficulties in replicating our results in English rabbits, and the failure of the first attempts to obtain LTP in slices of the dentate gyrus, led to my abandoning work on LTP for a few years, returning to the fray in the late 1970s through a collaboration with Graham Goddard at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Swelling, stiffness, and pain in synovial joints are primary hallmarks of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Hyperactivity of nociceptors and excessive release of inflammatory factors and pain mediators play a crucial role, with emerging data suggesting extensive remodelling and plasticity of joint innervations. Herein, we review structural, functional, and molecular alterations in sensory and autonomic axons wiring arthritic joints and revisit mechanisms implicated in the sensitization of nociceptors, leading to chronic pain. Sprouting and reorganization of sensory and autonomic fibers with the invasion of ectopic branches into surrounding inflamed tissues are associated with the upregulation of pain markers. These changes are frequently complemented by a phenotypic switch of sensory and autonomic profiles and activation of silent axons, inferring homeostatic adjustments and reprogramming of innervations. Identifying critical molecular players and neurobiological mechanisms underpinning the rewiring and sensitization of joints is likely to elucidate causatives of neuroinflammation and chronic pain, assisting in finding new therapeutic targets and opportunities for interventions.

                Early host defense eliminates many viruses before infections are established while clearing others so they remain subclinical or cause only mild disease. Paludan et al. put forward a criteria-based working hypothesis proposing “microbe- and inflammation-restricting mechanisms” as central mediators of the early cellular host defense against virus infections.

                Zhang et al. reveal that TBK1 is succinylated at K38, K154, and K692, inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and IRF signaling pathways in macrophages during sepsis. This process is regulated by the desuccinylase SIRT5, highlighting a potential strategy for negatively regulating macrophage-related inflammatory responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98584">Caspar specifies primordial germ cell count and identity in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Repurposing of pleiotropic factors during execution of diverse cellular processes has emerged as a regulatory paradigm. Embryonic development in metazoans is controlled by maternal factors deposited in the egg during oogenesis. Here, we explore maternal role(s) of Caspar (Casp), the <i>Drosophila</i> orthologue of human Fas-associated factor-1 (FAF1) originally implicated in host-defense as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling. Maternal loss of either Casp or it’s protein partner, transitional endoplasmic reticulum 94 (TER94) leads to partial embryonic lethality correlated with aberrant centrosome behavior, cytoskeletal abnormalities, and defective gastrulation. Although ubiquitously distributed, both proteins are enriched in the primordial germ cells (PGCs), and in keeping with the centrosome problems, mutant embryos display a significant reduction in the PGC count. Moreover, the total number of pole buds is directly proportional to the level of Casp. Consistently, it’s ‘loss’ and ‘gain’ results in respective reduction and increase in the Oskar protein levels, the master determinant of PGC fate. To elucidate this regulatory loop, we analyzed several known components of mid-blastula transition and identify the translational repressor Smaug, a zygotic regulator of germ cell specification, as a potential critical target. We present a detailed structure-function analysis of Casp aimed at understanding its novel involvement during PGC development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98016">CCDC113 stabilizes sperm axoneme and head-tail coupling apparatus to ensure male fertility</a></h4>

              
                The structural integrity of the sperm is crucial for male fertility, defects in sperm head-tail linkage and flagellar axoneme are associated with acephalic spermatozoa syndrome (ASS) and the multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF). Notably, impaired head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA) often accompanies defects in the flagellum structure, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we identified an evolutionarily conserved coiled-coil domain-containing (CCDC) protein, CCDC113, and found the disruption of CCDC113 produced spermatozoa with disorganized sperm flagella and HTCA, which caused male infertility. Further analysis revealed that CCDC113 could bind to CFAP57 and CFAP91, and function as an adaptor protein for the connection of radial spokes, nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), and doublet microtubules (DMTs) in the sperm axoneme. Moreover, CCDC113 was identified as a structural component of HTCA, collaborating with SUN5 and CENTLEIN to connect sperm head to tail during spermiogenesis. Together, our studies reveal that CCDC113 serve as a critical hub for sperm axoneme and HTCA stabilization in mice, providing insights into the potential pathogenesis of infertility associated with human <i>CCDC113</i> mutations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98081">A human forebrain organoid model reveals the essential function of GTF2IRD1-TTR-ERK axis for the neurodevelopmental deficits of Williams syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Williams syndrome (WS; OMIM#194050) is a rare disorder, which is caused by the microdeletion of one copy of 25–27 genes, and WS patients display diverse neuronal deficits. Although remarkable progresses have been achieved, the mechanisms for these distinct deficits are still largely unknown. Here, we have shown that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in WS forebrain organoids display abnormal proliferation and differentiation capabilities, and synapse formation. Genes with altered expression are related to neuronal development and neurogenesis. Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis revealed 13 clusters in healthy control and WS organoids. WS organoids show an aberrant generation of excitatory neurons. Mechanistically, the expression of transthyretin (TTR) are remarkably decreased in WS forebrain organoids. We have found that GTF2IRD1 encoded by one WS associated gene <i>GTF2IRD1</i> binds to <i>TTR</i> promoter regions and regulates the expression of <i>TTR</i>. In addition, exogenous TTR can activate ERK signaling and rescue neurogenic deficits of WS forebrain organoids. <i>Gtf2ird1</i>-deficient mice display similar neurodevelopmental deficits as observed in WS organoids. Collectively, our study reveals critical function of GTF2IRD1 in regulating neurodevelopment of WS forebrain organoids and mice through regulating TTR-ERK pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98250">Single-cell transcriptomics of vomeronasal neuroepithelium reveals a differential endoplasmic reticulum environment amongst neuronal subtypes</a></h4>

              
                Specialized chemosensory signals elicit innate social behaviors in individuals of several vertebrate species, a process that is mediated via the accessory olfactory system (AOS). The AOS comprising the peripheral sensory vomeronasal organ has evolved elaborate molecular and cellular mechanisms to detect chemo signals. To gain insight into the cell types, developmental gene expression patterns, and functional differences amongst neurons, we performed single-cell transcriptomics of the mouse vomeronasal sensory epithelium. Our analysis reveals diverse cell types with gene expression patterns specific to each, which we made available as a searchable web resource accessed from <a href="https://www.scvnoexplorer.com">https://www.scvnoexplorer.com</a>. Pseudo-time developmental analysis indicates that neurons originating from common progenitors diverge in their gene expression during maturation with transient and persistent transcription factor expression at critical branch points. Comparative analysis across two of the major neuronal subtypes that express divergent GPCR families and the G-protein subunits Gnai2 or Gnao1, reveals significantly higher expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associated genes within Gnao1 neurons. In addition<b>,</b> differences in ER content and prevalence of cubic membrane ER ultrastructure revealed by electron microscopy, indicate fundamental differences in ER function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93518">Fluid mechanics of luminal transport in actively contracting endoplasmic reticulum</a></h4>

              
                The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the largest cellular compartment, harbours the machinery for the biogenesis of secretory proteins and lipids, calcium storage/mobilisation, and detoxification. It is shaped as layered membranous sheets interconnected with a network of tubules extending throughout the cell. Understanding the influence of the ER morphology dynamics on molecular transport may offer clues to rationalising neuro-pathologies caused by ER morphogen mutations. It remains unclear, however, how the ER facilitates its intra-luminal mobility and homogenises its content. It has been recently proposed that intra-luminal transport may be enabled by active contractions of ER tubules. To surmount the barriers to empirical studies of the minuscule spatial and temporal scales relevant to ER nanofluidics, here we exploit the principles of viscous fluid dynamics to generate a theoretical physical model emulating in silico the content motion in actively contracting nanoscopic tubular networks. The computational model reveals the luminal particle speeds, and their impact in facilitating active transport, of the active contractile behaviour of the different ER components along various time–space parameters. The results of the model indicate that reproducing transport with velocities similar to those reported experimentally in single-particle tracking would require unrealistically high values of tubule contraction site length and rate. Considering further nanofluidic scenarios, we show that width contractions of the ER’s flat domains (perinuclear sheets) generate local flows with only a short-range effect on luminal transport. Only contractions of peripheral sheets can reproduce experimental measurements, provided they are able to contract fast enough.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101269">Human birth tissue products as a non-opioid medicine to inhibit post-surgical pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain after surgery causes significant suffering. Opioid analgesics cause severe side effects and accidental death. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid therapies for managing post-surgical pain. Local application of Clarix Flo (FLO), a human amniotic membrane (AM) product, attenuated established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity without exhibiting known side effects of opioid use in mice. This effect was achieved through direct inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways. We further purified the major matrix component, the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 (HC-HA/PTX3) from human AM that has greater purity and water solubility than FLO. HC-HA/PTX3 replicated FLO-induced neuronal and pain inhibition. Mechanistically, HC-HA/PTX3-induced cytoskeleton rearrangements to inhibit sodium current and high-voltage activated calcium current on nociceptive DRG neurons, suggesting it is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. Moreover, we unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93168">Ciliary length regulation by intraflagellar transport in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                How cells regulate the size of their organelles remains a fundamental question in cell biology. Cilia, with their simple structure and surface localization, provide an ideal model for investigating organelle size control. However, most studies on cilia length regulation are primarily performed on several single-celled organisms. In contrast, the mechanism of length regulation in cilia across diverse cell types within multicellular organisms remains a mystery. Similar to humans, zebrafish contain diverse types of cilia with variable lengths. Taking advantage of the transparency of zebrafish embryos, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into intraflagellar transport (IFT), an essential process for ciliogenesis. By generating a transgenic line carrying Ift88-GFP transgene, we observed IFT in multiple types of cilia with varying lengths. Remarkably, cilia exhibited variable IFT speeds in different cell types, with longer cilia exhibiting faster IFT speeds. This increased IFT speed in longer cilia is likely not due to changes in common factors that regulate IFT, such as motor selection, BBSome proteins, or tubulin modification. Interestingly, longer cilia in the ear cristae tend to form larger IFT compared to shorter spinal cord cilia. Reducing the size of IFT particles by knocking down Ift88 slowed IFT speed and resulted in the formation of shorter cilia. Our study proposes an intriguing model of cilia length regulation via controlling IFT speed through the modulation of the size of the IFT complex. This discovery may provide further insights into our understanding of how organelle size is regulated in higher vertebrates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90419">Genetic inactivation of zinc transporter SLC39A5 improves liver function and hyperglycemia in obesogenic settings</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have revealed a role for zinc in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Randomized placebo-controlled zinc supplementation trials have demonstrated improved glycemic traits in patients with type II diabetes (T2D). Moreover, rare loss-of-function variants in the zinc efflux transporter <i>SLC30A8</i> reduce T2D risk. Despite this accumulated evidence, a mechanistic understanding of how zinc influences systemic glucose homeostasis and consequently T2D risk remains unclear. To further explore the relationship between zinc and metabolic traits, we searched the exome database of the Regeneron Genetics Center-Geisinger Health System DiscovEHR cohort for genes that regulate zinc levels and associate with changes in metabolic traits. We then explored our main finding using in vitro and in vivo models. We identified rare loss-of-function (LOF) variants (MAF &lt;1%) in <i>Solute Carrier Family 39, Member 5</i> (<i>SLC39A5</i>) associated with increased circulating zinc (p=4.9 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). Trans-ancestry meta-analysis across four studies exhibited a nominal association of <i>SLC39A5</i> LOF variants with decreased T2D risk. To explore the mechanisms underlying these associations, we generated mice lacking <i>Slc39a5. Slc39a5<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice display improved liver function and reduced hyperglycemia when challenged with congenital or diet-induced obesity. These improvements result from elevated hepatic zinc levels and concomitant activation of hepatic AMPK and AKT signaling, in part due to zinc-mediated inhibition of hepatic protein phosphatase activity. Furthermore, under conditions of diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), <i>Slc39a5<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice display significantly attenuated fibrosis and inflammation. Taken together, these results suggest SLC39A5 as a potential therapeutic target for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) due to metabolic derangements including T2D.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93764">Cell-autonomous timing drives the vertebrate segmentation clock’s wave pattern</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic and sequential segmentation of the growing vertebrate body relies on the segmentation clock, a multi-cellular oscillating genetic network. The clock is visible as tissue-level kinematic waves of gene expression that travel through the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and arrest at the position of each forming segment. Here, we test how this hallmark wave pattern is driven by culturing single maturing PSM cells. We compare their cell-autonomous oscillatory and arrest dynamics to those we observe in the embryo at cellular resolution, finding similarity in the relative slowing of oscillations and arrest in concert with differentiation. This shows that cell-extrinsic signals are not required by the cells to instruct the developmental program underlying the wave pattern. We show that a cell-autonomous timing activity initiates during cell exit from the tailbud, then runs down in the anterior-ward cell flow in the PSM, thereby using elapsed time to provide positional information to the clock. Exogenous FGF lengthens the duration of the cell-intrinsic timer, indicating extrinsic factors in the embryo may regulate the segmentation clock via the timer. In sum, our work suggests that a noisy cell-autonomous, intrinsic timer drives the slowing and arrest of oscillations underlying the wave pattern, while extrinsic factors in the embryo tune this timer’s duration and precision. This is a new insight into the balance of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms driving tissue patterning in development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96691">Estradiol elicits distinct firing patterns in arcuate nucleus kisspeptin neurons of females through altering ion channel conductances</a></h4>

              
                Hypothalamic kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons are vital for pubertal development and reproduction. Arcuate nucleus Kiss1 (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) neurons are responsible for the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). In females, the behavior of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, expressing Kiss1, neurokinin B (NKB), and dynorphin (Dyn), varies throughout the ovarian cycle. Studies indicate that 17β-estradiol (E2) reduces peptide expression but increases <i>Slc17a6</i> (<i>Vglut2</i>) mRNA and glutamate neurotransmission in these neurons, suggesting a shift from peptidergic to glutamatergic signaling. To investigate this shift, we combined transcriptomics, electrophysiology, and mathematical modeling. Our results demonstrate that E2 treatment upregulates the mRNA expression of voltage-activated calcium channels, elevating the whole-cell calcium current that contributes to high-frequency burst firing. Additionally, E2 treatment decreased the mRNA levels of canonical transient receptor potential (TPRC) 5 and G protein-coupled K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channels. When <i>Trpc5</i> channels in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons were deleted using CRISPR/SaCas9, the slow excitatory postsynaptic potential was eliminated. Our data enabled us to formulate a biophysically realistic mathematical model of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, suggesting that E2 modifies ionic conductances in these neurons, enabling the transition from high-frequency synchronous firing through NKB-driven activation of TRPC5 channels to a short bursting mode facilitating glutamate release. In a low E2 milieu, synchronous firing of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons drives pulsatile release of GnRH, while the transition to burst firing with high, preovulatory levels of E2 would facilitate the GnRH surge through its glutamatergic synaptic connection to preoptic Kiss1 neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86978">Key epigenetic and signaling factors in the formation and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier</a></h4>

              
                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls the movement of molecules into and out of the central nervous system (CNS). Since a functional BBB forms by mouse embryonic day E15.5, we reasoned that gene cohorts expressed in CNS endothelial cells (EC) at E13.5 contribute to BBB formation. In contrast, adult gene signatures reflect BBB maintenance mechanisms. Supporting this hypothesis, transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct cohorts of EC genes involved in BBB formation and maintenance. Here, we demonstrate that epigenetic regulator’s histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) control EC gene expression for BBB development and prevent Wnt/β-catenin (Wnt) target genes from being expressed in adult CNS ECs. Low Wnt activity during development modifies BBB genes epigenetically for the formation of functional BBB. As a Class-I HDAC inhibitor induces adult CNS ECs to regain Wnt activity and BBB genetic signatures that support BBB formation, our results inform strategies to promote BBB repair.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90296">Projection neurons are necessary for the maintenance of the mouse olfactory circuit</a></h4>

              
                The assembly and maintenance of neural circuits is crucial for proper brain function. Although the assembly of brain circuits has been extensively studied, much less is understood about the mechanisms controlling their maintenance as animals mature. In the olfactory system, the axons of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing the same odor receptor converge into discrete synaptic structures of the olfactory bulb (OB) called glomeruli, forming a stereotypic odor map. The OB projection neurons, called mitral and tufted cells (M/Ts), have a single dendrite that branches into a single glomerulus, where they make synapses with OSNs. We used a genetic method to progressively eliminate the vast majority of M/T cells in early postnatal mice, and observed that the assembly of the OB bulb circuits proceeded normally. However, as the animals became adults the apical dendrite of remaining M/Ts grew multiple branches that innervated several glomeruli, and OSNs expressing single odor receptors projected their axons into multiple glomeruli, disrupting the olfactory sensory map. Moreover, ablating the M/Ts in adult animals also resulted in similar structural changes in the projections of remaining M/Ts and axons from OSNs. Interestingly, the ability of these mice to detect odors was relatively preserved despite only having 1–5% of projection neurons transmitting odorant information to the brain, and having highly disrupted circuits in the OB. These results indicate that a reduced number of projection neurons does not affect the normal assembly of the olfactory circuit, but induces structural instability of the olfactory circuitry of adult animals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96821">Amoeboid cells undergo durotaxis with soft end polarized NMIIA</a></h4>

              
                Cell migration towards stiff substrates has been coined as durotaxis and implicated in development, wound healing, and cancer, where complex interplays between immune and non-immune cells are present. Compared to the emerging mechanisms underlying the strongly adhesive mesenchymal durotaxis, little is known about whether immune cells - migrating in amoeboid mode - could follow mechanical cues. Here, we develop an imaging-based confined migration device with a stiffness gradient. By tracking live cell trajectory and analyzing the directionality of T cells and neutrophils, we observe that amoeboid cells can durotax. We further delineate the underlying mechanism to involve non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) polarization towards the soft-matrix-side but may not require differential actin flow up- or down-stiffness gradient. Using the protista <i>Dictyostelium</i>, we demonstrate the evolutionary conservation of amoeboid durotaxis. Finally, these experimental phenomena are theoretically captured by an active gel model capable of mechanosensing. Collectively, these results may shed new lights on immune surveillance and recently identified confined migration of cancer cells, within the mechanically inhomogeneous tumor microenvironment or the inflamed fibrotic tissues.

">Dopamine regulates the membrane potential and glycine release of AII amacrine cells via D1-like receptor modulation of gap junction coupling.</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine plays a pivotal role in adjusting the flow of information across the retina as luminance changes from night to day. Here we show, under dim photopic conditions, that both dopamine and a D1-like receptor (D1R) agonist hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential (Vm) of AII amacrine cells (AII-ACs). Surprisingly, in the presence of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic blockers that isolate glycinergic synapses, D1R agonists are without effect. However, a D1R antagonist depolarized Vm and reduced the input resistance of AII-ACs in wild type mice, but not in Cx36-/- mice. Accordingly, D1R antagonists enhanced tonic glycinergic transmission to type-2 OFF-cone bipolar cells (OFF-CBCs). D1Rs thus adjust the Vm and excitability of AII-ACs and, thereby, the level of glycine release to OFF-CBCs by regulating gap junction coupling with ON cone bipolar cells. Our findings provide insights into how the retina may use dopamine to adapt crossover inhibitory microcircuits during changes in luminance.

">A role for fibroblast and mural cell subsets in models of neuropathic pain.</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain is a particularly intractable type of chronic pain that can result from physical nerve damage due to surgery or entrapment. Here, we present data which suggest that a particular subclass of fibroblast and mural cells may be implicated in the sensory neuron dysfunction that is characteristic of this pain state.

In a mouse model of traumatic painful neuropathy, we used RNA sequencing, cell sorting and nerve tissue clearing to study mesenchymal lineage cells. We show that Pdgfrb+ fibroblasts and mural cells are increased in number for at least two months post-nerve damage and express high levels of known and putative pro-algesic mediators, which are further upregulated in neuropathy.

We go on to demonstrate that a human nerve pericyte line releases a selection of these pro-algesic mediators at protein level. Moreover, conditioned media from stimulated human pericytes induces intra-cellular changes in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived sensory neurons; these changes (phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3) have been previously linked to sensory neuron activation.

In summary, our data indicate that mesenchymal cell abnormalities should be considered when developing novel strategies to tackle neuropathic pain.

">Classification of Visual Imagery and Imagined Speech EEG based Brain Computer Interfaces using 1D Convolutional Neural Network</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCI) utilising electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are a current popular, affordable and accessible method for establishing communication paths between the mind and external devices. However, the challenges faced are inter-subject variability, BCI illiteracy and poor machine learning decoding performance. Two emerging intuitive mental paradigms, Visual Imagery (VI) and Imagined Speech (IS) show promise to optimise the development of non-invasive BCIs, which involves the extraction of corresponding neural patterns during the imagined tasks. This study took a comprehensive user-centric approach to build on the current foundation of knowledge on VI and IS EEG-BCIs utilising an adapted 1D-CNN to optimise the classification decoding performance. Twenty healthy participants were assessed for their ability to visualise imagery in their minds and performed the VI and IS mental paradigms in two class conditions "push" and "relax". It was shown that alpha and beta suppression was observed during the "push" condition of VI compared to the "relax" condition, and those that scored higher in the VVIQ had better VI classification accuracy than those who did not. The adapted 1D-CNN model performed well for classification between the two classes "push" and "relax" at 89.3% and 77.87% performance accuracy for VI and IS, respectively. These findings contribute to the current body of work on VI BCI, that it is a dynamic and plausible option compared to standard BCI paradigms, and VI BCI illiteracy could potentially be controlled by VVIQ. It also demonstrated the potential of the 1D-CNN model in classification of VI and IS EEG-BCIs.

">Motor imagery and execution activate similar finger representations that are spatially consistent over time</a></h4>

              
                Finger representations in the sensorimotor cortex can be activated even in the absence of somatosensory input or motor output through mere top-down processes, such as motor imagery. While executed finger movements activate finger representations in the primary sensorimotor cortex that are spatially consistent over time within participants, the stability of top-down activated finger representations remains largely unexplored. Given the increasing use of top-down activated sensorimotor representations to both plan implantation of and control brain-computer interfaces, it is crucial to understand the stability of these representations. Here, we investigated the spatial consistency, and thereby reliability, of finger representations activated through motor imagery in the primary somatosensory and primary motor cortex over time. To assess this, participants performed imagined and executed individual finger movements in two 3T fMRI sessions that were ~2 weeks apart. We observed highly consistent univariate finger-selective activity clusters and multivariate vertex-wise activity patterns within participants over time in both the motor imagery and motor execution task. Using a multivariate across-task decoding approach, we further found that motor execution and motor imagery activate similar finger representations in both the primary somatosensory and primary motor cortex. This demonstrates that motor imagery can be used to identify finger representations related to movement execution. Our findings not only validate the use of top-down processes for brain-computer interface planning and control, but also open up new opportunities for the development of sensorimotor training interventions that do not rely on overt movements.

                We quantify cellular- and circuit-resolution neural network dynamics following therapeutically relevant doses of the psychedelic psilocybin. Using chronically implanted Neuropixels probes, we recorded local field potentials (LFP) alongside action potentials from hundreds of neurons spanning infralimbic, prelimbic and cingulate subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex of freely-behaving adult rats. Psilocybin (0.3mg/kg or 1mg/kg i.p.) unmasked 100Hz high frequency oscillations that were most pronounced within the infralimbic cortex, persisted for approximately 1h post-injection and were accompanied by decreased net pyramidal cell firing rates and reduced signal complexity. These acute effects were more prominent during resting behaviour than during a sustained attention task. LFP 1-, 2- and 6-days post-psilocybin showed gradually-emerging increases in beta and low-gamma (20-60Hz) power, specific to the infralimbic cortex. These findings reveal features of psychedelic action not readily detectable in human brain imaging, implicating infralimbic network oscillations as potential biomarkers of psychedelic-induced network plasticity over multi-day timescales.

                Pathogenic coding mutations are prevalent in human neuronal transcription factors (TFs) but how they disrupt development is poorly understood. Lmx1b is a master transcriptional regulator of postmitotic Pet1 neurons that give rise to mature serotonin (5-HT) neurons; over two hundred pathogenic heterozygous mutations have been discovered in human LMX1B, yet their impact on brain development has not been investigated. Here, we developed mouse models with different LMX1B DNA-binding missense mutations. Missense heterozygosity broadly altered Pet1 neuron transcriptomes, but expression changes converged on axon and synapse genes. Missense heterozygosity effected highly specific deficits in the postnatal maturation of forebrain serotonin axon arbors, primarily in the hippocampus and motor cortex, which was associated with spatial memory defects. Digital genomic footprinting (DGF) revealed that missense heterozygosity caused complete loss of Lmx1b motif protection and chromatin accessibility at sites enriched for a distal active enhancer/active promoter histone signature and homeodomain binding motifs; at other bound Lmx1b motifs, varying levels of losses, gains or no change in motif binding and accessibility were found. The spectrum of footprint changes was strongly associated with synapse and axon genes. Further, Lmx1b missense heterozygosity caused wide disruption of Lmx1b-dependent GRNs comprising diverse TFs expressed in Pet1 neurons. These findings reveal an unanticipated continuum of Lmx1b missense-forced perturbations on Pet1 neuron regulatory element TF binding and accessibility. Our work illustrates the power of DGF for gaining unique insight into how TF missense mutations interfere with developing neuronal GRNs.

                Serotonin plays a prominent role in neurodevelopment, regulating processes from cell division to synaptic connectivity. Clinical studies suggest that alterations in serotonin signalling such as genetic polymorphisms or antidepressant exposure during pregnancy are risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders. However, an understanding of how dysfunctional neuromodulation alters systems level activity over neocortical development is lacking. Here, we use a longitudinal imaging approach to investigate how genetics, pharmacology, and aversive experience disrupt state-dependent serotonin signalling with pathological consequences for sensory processing. We find that all three factors lead to increased neocortical serotonin levels during the initial postnatal period. Genetic deletion of the serotonin transporter or antidepressant dosing results in a switch from hypo- to hyper-cortical activity that arises as a consequence of altered cortical GABAergic microcircuitry. However, the trajectories of these manipulations differ with postnatal exposure to antidepressants having effects on adult sensory encoding. The latter is not seen in the genetic model despite a similar early phenotype, and a distinct influence of maternal genotype on the development of supragranular layers. These results reveal the dynamics and critical nature of serotonin signalling during perinatal life; pharmacological targeting of which can have profound life-long consequences for cognitive development of the offspring.

">GABA, Glutamate dynamics and BOLD observed during cognitive processing in psychosis patients with hallucinatory traits</a></h4>

              
                The perception of a voice in the absence of an external auditory source - an auditory verbal hallucination - is a characteristic symptom of schizophrenia. To better understand this phenomenon requires integration of findings across behavioural, functional, and neurochemical levels. We address this with a locally adapted MEGA-PRESS sequence incorporating interleaved unsuppressed water acquisitions, allowing concurrent assessment of behaviour, blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional changes, Glutamate+Glutamine (Glx), and GABA, synchronised with a cognitive (flanker) task. We acquired data from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of 51 patients with psychosis (predominantly schizophrenia spectrum disorder) and hallucinations, matched to healthy controls. Consistent with the notion of an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance, we hypothesized differential effects for Glx and GABA between groups, and aberrant dynamics in response to task. Results showed impaired task performance, lower baseline Glx and positive association between Glx and BOLD in patients, contrasting a negative correlation in healthy controls. Task-related increases in Glx were observed in both groups, with no significant difference between groups. No significant effects were observed for GABA. These findings suggest that a putative excitatory/inhibitory imbalance affecting inhibitory control in the ACC is primarily observed as tonic, baseline glutamate differences, rather than GABAergic effects or aberrant dynamics in relation to a task.

">Human Hippocampal Theta Oscillations Organise Distance to Goal Coding</a></h4>

              
                The rodent hippocampal local field potential is dominated by 6-12 Hz theta oscillations during active behaviour that are strongly implicated in spatial coding and memory function across species. Invasive electrophysiology in both rodents and humans has shown increases in hippocampal theta power immediately before the onset of translational movement that persists throughout subsequent motion, and the magnitude of this increase correlates with the distance subsequently travelled. Using non-invasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) and an abstract navigation task, we observed increased theta power during both spatial planning and subsequent navigation. Importantly, theta power in the right hippocampus covaried with subsequent path distance during planning, only when participants were aware of the distance to their goal. During subsequent navigation, hippocampal theta power decreased dynamically as participants approached the goal, only when they were aware of how far they still needed to travel. In addition, theta phase during navigation modulated 70-140 Hz fast gamma amplitude in the entorhinal cortex while traversing novel paths; and 30-70 Hz slow gamma amplitude in the right hippocampus while traversing previously experienced paths. In both cases, theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling increased with proximity to the goal during navigation, consistent with the hypothesis that sequences of upcoming locations were represented by gamma bursts occurring at successive theta phases. In sum, these findings are consistent with the proposed role of hippocampal theta oscillation in flexible planning and goal-directed spatial navigation across mammalian species.

">Single neuron diversity supports area functional specialization along the visual cortical pathways</a></h4>

              
                Humans and other primates have specialized visual pathways composed of interconnected cortical areas. The input area V1 contains neurons that encode basic visual features, whereas downstream in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) neurons acquire tuning for novel complex feature associations. It has been assumed that each cortical area is composed of repeatable neuronal subtypes, and variations in synaptic strength and connectivity patterns underlie functional specialization. Here we test the hypothesis that diversity in the intrinsic make-up of single neurons contributes to area specialization along the visual pathways. We measured morphological and electrophysiological properties of single neurons in areas V1 and LPFC of marmosets. Excitatory neurons in LPFC were larger, less excitable, and fired broader spikes than V1 neurons. Some inhibitory fast spiking interneurons in the LPFC had longer axons and fired spikes with longer latencies and a more depolarized action potential trough than in V1. Intrinsic bursting was found in subpopulations of both excitatory and inhibitory LPFC but not V1 neurons. The latter may favour temporal summation of spikes and therefore enhanced synaptic plasticity in LPFC relative to V1. Our results show that specialization within the primate visual system permeates the most basic processing level, the single neuron.

">Data-driven synapse classification reveals a logic of glutamate receptor composition</a></h4>

              
                The rich diversity of synapses facilitates the capacity of neural circuits to transmit, process and store information. Here, we used multiplex super-resolution proteometric imaging through array tomography to define features of single synapses in the adult mouse neocortex. We find that glutamatergic synapses cluster into subclasses that parallel the distinct biochemical and functional categories of receptor subunits: GluA1/4, GluA2/3 and GluN1/GluN2B. Two of these subclasses align with physiological expectations based on synaptic plasticity: large AMPAR-rich synapses may represent potentiated synapses, whereas small NMDAR-rich synapses suggest "silent" synapses. The NMDA receptor content of large synapses correlates with spine neck diameter, and thus the potential for coupling to the parent dendrite. Conjugate array tomography's rigorous registration of immunofluorescence with electron microscopy provides validation for future super-resolution imaging studies in other systems. No barriers prevent generalization of this approach to other species, laying a foundation for future studies of human disorders and therapeutics.

">Investigating cerebellar control in slow gait adaptations: Insights from predictive simulations of split-belt walking</a></h4>

              
                During split-belt treadmill walking, neurotypical humans exhibit slow adaptations, characterized by a gradual decrease in step length asymmetry, whereas individuals with cerebellar damage do not show these motor adaptations. We used a neuromusculoskeletal model to better understand individual aspects of the underlying neural control. Specifically, we extended a spinal reflex model by adding a supraspinal layer, representing the cerebellum and its main function of error-driven motor adaptation. The cerebellum, based on the mismatch between an internal prediction and the actual motor outcome, can modulate spinal motor commands within the simulation. Using this model, we investigated the effect of an isolated adaptation of gait timing parameters, in our case the beginning of the liftoff phase. We created 80 s predictive simulations of the model walking on a split-belt treadmill with a 2:1 belt-speed ratio, and evaluated the results by comparing spatiotemporal parameters and kinematics with literature. The simulations exhibited adaptation patterns similar to those observed in human experiments. Specifically, the step length symmetry decreased from an initial asymmetric level toward the baseline, driven primarily by adaptations in the fast step length, while the individual joint kinematics remained similar. The adaptations affected the spatial and temporal domains, represented by a change in the center of oscillation difference and limb phasing. Our findings suggest that reflex gains do not necessarily need to be adapted to achieve changes in step length asymmetry and that, unlike what had been inferred from experiments, the same neural mechanism might account for adaptations in the spatial and temporal domains at different rates. Our simulations demonstrated distinct adaptation patterns corresponding to slow and fast learning behaviors, as reported in the literature, through modifications of a single cerebellar parameter, the adaptation rate. The framework can be extended to test different hypotheses about motor control and adaptations during continuous perturbation tasks.

	<p>The current standard of care for brain tumor management includes maximal safe surgical resection followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Recent advances in image-guided surgical techniques have enhanced the precision of tumor resections, yet there remains a critical need for innovative technologies to further improve patient outcomes. Techniques such as fluorescence image-guided neurosurgery in combination with stereotactic radiosurgery have improved outcomes for patients with brain tumors. In this article for Brain Science&amp;amp;rsquo;s Special Issue Recent Advances in Translational Neuro-Oncology, we review the use of image-guided neurosurgery and stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of brain tumors. In addition, we summarize the emerging use of theranostic nanoparticles for the delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies to enable the neurosurgeon to perform more precise surgical resections in the operating room, to specifically target the delivery of existing and novel treatments to tumor cells, and to augment the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery. These innovative translational tools will allow neurosurgeons, neuro-oncologists, and radiation oncologists to go &amp;amp;ldquo;beyond the knife&amp;amp;rdquo; to improve the survival of brain tumor patients.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: A multimodal brain age estimation model could provide enhanced insights into brain aging. However, effectively integrating multimodal neuroimaging data to enhance the accuracy of brain age estimation remains a challenging task. Methods: In this study, we developed an innovative data fusion technique employing a low-rank tensor fusion algorithm, tailored specifically for deep learning-based frameworks aimed at brain age estimation. Specifically, we utilized structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to extract spatial&amp;amp;ndash;temporal brain features with different properties. These features were fused using the low-rank tensor algorithm and employed as predictors for estimating brain age. Results: Our prediction model achieved a desirable prediction accuracy on the independent test samples, demonstrating its robust performance. Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that the low-rank tensor fusion algorithm has the potential to effectively integrate multimodal data into deep learning frameworks for estimating brain age.</p>

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive disease of both upper motor neurons (UMNs) and lower motor neurons (LMNs) leading invariably to decline in motor function. The clinical exam is foundational to the diagnosis of the disease, and ordinal severity scales are used to track its progression. However, the lack of objective biomarkers of disease classification and progression delay clinical trial enrollment, muddle inclusion criteria, and limit accurate assessment of drug efficacy. Ultimately, biomarker evidence of therapeutic target engagement will support, and perhaps supplant, more traditional clinical trial outcome measures. Electrophysiology tools including nerve conduction study and electromyography (EMG) have already been established as diagnostic biomarkers of LMN degeneration in ALS. Additional understanding of the motor manifestations of disease is provided by motor unit number estimation, electrical impedance myography, and single-fiber EMG techniques. Dysfunction of UMN and non-motor brain areas is being increasingly assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation, high-density electroencephalography, and magnetoencephalography; less common autonomic and sensory nervous system dysfunction in ALS can also be characterized. Although most of these techniques are used to explore the underlying disease mechanisms of ALS in research settings, they have the potential on a broader scale to noninvasively identify disease subtypes, predict progression rates, and assess physiologic engagement of experimental therapies.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: To examine the relationships between state affect and sleep health at within- and between-person levels among health science students. Methods: A correlational design was used and 54 health science students were included. The participants completed baseline and 7-day ambulatory assessments in a free-living setting. Daily sleep and affect were measured using the Consensus Sleep Diary and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Mixed-effect models were used to examine the effects of affect on sleep health. Results: The participants were 19.8 (SD, 0.6) years and 92.6% were females. Approximately 40% had poor sleep quality. Controlling for the potential confounders (e.g., age, sex, and bedtime procrastination), higher within-person negative affect predicted shorter sleep duration, lower sleep efficiency, longer sleep onset latency, and less feeling rested. Higher between-person negative affect predicted shorter sleep duration. Higher within-person positive affect predicted longer sleep onset latency. Higher within- and between-person positive affect predicted more feeling rested. Conclusions: Negative affect was most consistently associated with sleep health at the individual level. Affect regulation should be considered when delivering personalized interventions targeting sleep health among health science students.</p>

                <p>Although most adults in the United States will drink alcohol in their life, only ~6% will go on to develop an alcohol use disorder (AUD). While a great deal of work has furthered our understanding of the cycle of addiction, it remains unclear why certain people transition to disordered drinking. Altered activity in regions implicated in AUDs, like the basolateral amygdala (BLA), has been suggested to play a role in the pathophysiology of AUDs, but how these networks contribute to alcohol misuse remains unclear. Here we investigated how the impact of alcohol on the BLA network relates to alcohol exposure. We first examined the effect of acute ethanol administration on the BLA and frontal cortical networks and the relationship with subsequent voluntary ethanol consumption using the Intermittent Access paradigm. In addition, we recorded network activity from the BLA and frontal cortex throughout the Drinking-in-the-Dark-Multiple Scheduled Access paradigm to assess the impact of voluntary alcohol consumption on network states during binge and abstinence periods. Finally, we investigated the impact of acute withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure on BLA and frontal cortex network states using the Chronic Intermittent Ethanol (vapor) paradigm. We demonstrate that across paradigms, ethanol alters low gamma band (40&ndash;70&nbsp;Hz) oscillations and remarkably correlates with the extent of future voluntary ethanol consumption in the IA paradigm. These data suggest that BLA network states play a role in the mechanisms influencing voluntary alcohol intake.</p>

                <p>Maintaining concentration on demanding cognitive tasks, such as vigilance (VG) and working memory (WM) tasks, is crucial for successful task completion. Previous research suggests that internal concentration maintenance fluctuates, potentially declining to suboptimal states, which can influence trial-by-trial performance in these tasks. However, the timescale of such alertness maintenance, as indicated by slow changes in pupil diameter, has not been thoroughly investigated. This study explored whether "pupil trends"&mdash;which selectively signal suboptimal tonic alertness maintenance at various timescales&mdash;negatively correlate with trial-by-trial performance in VG and WM tasks. Using the psychomotor vigilance task (VG) and the visual&ndash;spatial two-back task (WM), we found that human pupil trends lasting over 10&nbsp;s were significantly higher in trials with longer reaction times, indicating poorer performance, compared with shorter reaction time trials, which indicated better performance. The attention network test further validated that these slow trends reflect suboptimal states related to (tonic) alertness maintenance rather than suboptimal performance specific to VG and WM tasks, which is more associated with (phasic) responses to instantaneous interference. These findings highlight the potential role of detecting and compensating for nonoptimal states in VG and WM performance, significantly beyond the 10&nbsp;s timescale. Additionally, the findings suggest the possibility of estimating human concentration during various visual tasks, even when rapid pupil changes occur due to luminance fluctuations.</p>

                Introduction Spontaneous tendon ruptures in end stage kidney disease patients have the potential to cause long- term morbidity, and timely intervention is required to prevent complications that can severely affect the functional status of the patient. Case presentation A series of six tendons (two triceps tendons and two bilateral patellar tendons) in three patients with ESKD undergoing hemodialysis is discussed in this case series. Patients were aged 61, 44 and 26 years, and on hemodialysis for 5, 10 and 5 years, respectively. Conclusion End -stage kidney disease is associated with a multitude of physiological changes, and the musculoskeletal system is no exception to this. Spontaneous tendon rupture is a multifactorial complication of ESKD, with serious implications for mobility and quality of life. As a result, these patients require a multifaceted approach to ensure optimum results and an early return to activity. We report a series of 6 spontaneous tendon ruptures in 3 patients with ESKD at our institution. We would like to outline the methods of repair for each case and further attempt to assess biochemical parameters that may have contributed to the disease process.

                <p>by Yutong Sun, Peng Qiu</p>

When analyzing scRNA-seq data containing heterogeneous cell populations, an important task is to select informative marker genes to distinguish various cell clusters and annotate the clusters with biologically meaningful cell types. In existing analysis methods and pipelines, marker genes are typically identified using a one-vs-all strategy, examining differential expression between one cell cluster versus the combination of all other cell clusters. However, this strategy applied to cell clusters belonging to closely related cell types often generates overlapping marker genes, which capture the common signature of closely related cell clusters but provide limited information for distinguishing them. To address the limitations of the one-vs-all strategy, we propose a hierarchical marker gene selection strategy that groups similar cell clusters and selects marker genes in a hierarchical manner. This strategy is able to improve the accuracy and interpretability of cell type identification in single-cell RNA-seq data.

Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) polymorphisms modify the risk of Alzheimer’s disease with ApoE4 strongly increasing and ApoE2 modestly decreasing risk relative to the control ApoE3. To investigate how ApoE isoforms alter risk, we measured changes in proteome homeostasis in transgenic mice expressing a human ApoE gene (isoform 2, 3, or 4). The regulation of each protein’s homeostasis is observed by measuring turnover rate and abundance for that protein. We identified 4849 proteins and tested for ApoE isoform-dependent changes in the homeostatic regulation of ~2700 ontologies. In the brain, we found that ApoE4 and ApoE2 both lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins relative to the wild-type control ApoE3. In ApoE4 mice, lack of cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins suggests that dysregulation of proteasome and autophagy is reducing protein quality. In ApoE2, proteins of the mitochondrial matrix and the membrane, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, had a similar increase in degradation which suggests coordinated replacement of the entire organelle. In the liver we did not observe these changes suggesting that the ApoE-effect on proteostasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues. Our findings underscore the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover rates to decipher proteome regulatory mechanisms and their potential role in biology.

The local field potential (LFP), the low-frequency part of the extracellular potential, reflects transmembrane currents in the vicinity of the recording electrode. Thought mainly to stem from currents caused by synaptic input, it provides information about neural activity complementary to that of spikes, the output of neurons. However, the many neural sources contributing to the LFP, and likewise the derived current source density (CSD), can often make it challenging to interpret. Efforts to improve its interpretability have included the application of statistical decomposition tools like principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) to disentangle the contributions from different neural sources. However, their underlying assumptions of, respectively, orthogonality and statistical independence are not always valid for the various processes or pathways generating LFP. Here, we expand upon and validate a decomposition algorithm named Laminar Population Analysis (LPA), which is based on physiological rather than statistical assumptions. LPA utilizes the multiunit activity (MUA) and LFP jointly to uncover the contributions of different populations to the LFP. To perform the validation of LPA, we used data simulated with the large-scale, biophysically detailed model of mouse V1 developed by the Allen Institute. We find that LPA can identify laminar positions within V1 and the temporal profiles of laminar population firing rates from the MUA. We also find that LPA can estimate the salient current sinks and sources generated by feedforward input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), recurrent activity in V1, and feedback input from the lateromedial (LM) area of visual cortex. LPA identifies and distinguishes these contributions with a greater accuracy than the alternative statistical decomposition methods, PCA and ICA. The contributions from different cortical layers within V1 could however not be robustly separated and identified with LPA. This is likely due to substantial synchrony in population firing rates across layers, which may be reduced with other stimulus protocols in the future. Lastly, we also demonstrate the application of LPA on experimentally recorded MUA and LFP from 24 animals in the publicly available Visual Coding dataset. Our results suggest that LPA can be used both as a method to estimate positions of laminar populations and to uncover salient features in LFP/CSD contributions from different populations.

The interaction between cancer cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a pivotal role in tumour progression. While the extracellular degradation of ECM proteins has been well characterised, ECM endocytosis and its impact on cancer cell progression, migration, and metastasis is poorly understood. ECM internalisation is increased in invasive breast cancer cells, suggesting it may support invasiveness. However, current high-throughput approaches mainly focus on cells grown on plastic in 2D, making it difficult to apply these to the study of ECM dynamics. Here, we developed a high-content screening assay to study ECM uptake, based on the of use automated ECM coating for the generation of highly homogeneous ECM a pH-sensitive dye to image ECM trafficking in live cells. We identified that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, MAP3K1 and MAPK11 (p38β), and the protein phosphatase 2 (PP2) subunit PPP2R1A were required for the internalisation of ECM-bound α2β1 integrin. Mechanistically, we show that down-regulation of the sodium/proton exchanger 1 (NHE1), an established macropinocytosis regulator and a target of p38, mediated ECM macropinocytosis. Moreover, disruption of α2 integrin, MAP3K1, MAPK11, PPP2R1A, and NHE1-mediated ECM internalisation significantly impaired cancer cell migration and invasion in 2D and 3D culture systems. Of note, integrin-bound ECM was targeted for lysosomal degradation, which was required for cell migration on cell-derived matrices. Finally, α2β1 integrin and MAP3K1 expression were significantly up-regulated in pancreatic tumours and correlated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Strikingly, MAP3K1, MAPK11, PPP2R1A, and α2 integrin expression were higher in chemotherapy-resistant tumours in breast cancer patients. Our results identified the α2β1 integrin/p38 signalling axis as a novel regulator of ECM endocytosis, which drives invasive migration and tumour progression, demonstrating that our high-content screening approach has the capability of identifying novel regulators of cancer cell invasion.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The mandate for this special issue of Hippocampus was to provide a few examples of one's own work in a relatively personal context. Accordingly, I will discuss some of my own work here, but will also provide a broader arc of ideas and discoveries within which the efforts of myself and many others have taken place. This history begins with the associationists, who proposed that the human mind could be understood, in part, as a compounding of simple associations between contiguously occurring items and events. This idea was taken up by the behaviorist traditions, which made significant progress toward refining this simple idea. Subsequently, as interest turned toward neural mechanisms, Donald Hebb provided a foundational proposal for how synaptic changes could provide for this associative learning. The associationist view was, however, challenged by gestaltists who took a more wholistic, cognitive approach. Stunning support was provided for Tolman's cognitive map idea with the discovery of place cells in the hippocampus, and the subsequent treatise provided in O'Keefe and Nadel's <i>The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map</i>. I propose that, ultimately, this associationist versus cognitive debate was settled by the development of the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) approach, which incorporated Hebbian synapses into large, neural-like networks, which could accomplish complex cognitive tasks. My own work took place within the framework provided by O'Keefe and Nadel. One aspect of my work followed Jim Ranck's discovery of Head Direction cells. Tad Blair and others in my lab traced a brainstem circuit, which we proposed could explain the origins of the directional code. In other work, I investigated cells in the subicular region. These provided a contrast to the hippocampal place cells in that each subicular cell kept the same spatial pattern across different environments, whereas the hippocampal cells formed a different map for each context.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Glutamatergic dentate gyrus (DG) mossy cells (MCs) innervate the primary DG cell type, granule cells (GCs). Numerous MC synapses are on GC proximal dendrites in the inner molecular layer (IML). However, field recordings of the GC excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSPs) have not been used to study this pathway selectively. Here we describe methods to selectively activate MC axons in the IML using mice with Cre recombinase expressed in MCs. Slices were made after injecting adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in the DG. In these slices, we show that fEPSPs could be recorded reliably in the IML in response to optogenetic stimulation of MC axons. Furthermore, fEPSPs were widespread across the septotemporal axis. However, fEPSPs were relatively weak because they were small in amplitude and did not elicit a significant population spike in GCs. They also showed little paired pulse facilitation. We confirmed the extracellular findings with patch clamp recordings of GCs despite different recording chambers and other differences in methods. Together the results provide a simple method for studying MC activation of GCs and add to the evidence that this input is normally weak but widespread across the GC population.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides unique insights into the brain and neurological diseases. However, the potential of CSF flow cytometry applied on a large scale remains unknown.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used data-driven approaches to analyze paired CSF and blood flow cytometry measurements from 8,790 patients (discovery cohort) and CSF only data from 3,201 patients (validation cohort) collected across neurological diseases in a real-world setting.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In somatoform controls (n = 788), activation of T cells increased with age in both CSF and blood, whereas double negative blood T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup>) decreased with age. A machine learning model of CSF and blood immune cells defined immune age, which correlated strongly with true biological age (<i>r</i> = 0.71). Classifying all diseases solely based on the CSF/blood parameters in 8,790 patients resulted in clusters of 4 disease categories: healthy, autoimmune, meningoencephalitis, and neurodegenerative. This clustering was validated in an analytically independent test dataset (8,790 patients) and in a temporally independent cohort (3,201 patients). Patients with multiple sclerosis were more likely to have progressive disease when assigned to the neurodegeneration cluster and to have lower disability in the autoimmune cluster. Patients with dementia in the neurodegeneration cluster showed more severe disease progression. Flow cytometry helped differentiate dementia from controls, thereby enhancing the diagnostic power of routine CSF diagnostics.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Flow cytometry of CSF and blood thus identifies site-specific aging patterns and disease-overarching patterns of neurodegeneration. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>When I began my career, I had no idea that much of it would center around the hippocampus. Here I discuss some of the history of how this happened. I briefly mention my early undergraduate life and the problems it posed for getting into graduate school. I describe the unique circumstances that led me to Allan Wagner's laboratory and changed my career trajectory. My path to the hippocampus began with a decision to study memory development. This led to a collaboration with Rob Sutherland that produced the configural theory of the hippocampus. The idea was that the hippocampus facilitated the construction of representations of the co-occurring stimulus elements currently experienced by the organism. Thus, if two elements, A and B, occurred together, a representation, AB, could be constructed that could be discriminated from its elements, A and B. This idea was partially correct, but we missed an important property of the hippocampal system that was recognized by O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978 that is, that the hippocampus is an unmotivated, rapid learning system. Randy O'Reilly and I addressed this issue in what we called conjunctive representation theory and put forth a detailed cortical-hippocampus computational theory to explain how this could work I later realized that our ideas were remarkably like Tim Teyler's indexing theory of how the hippocampal system supports memory. At a Park City meeting, a chance encounter with Tim (whom I had never met) resulted in the opportunity to write a paper with Tim updating the indexing theory, It is my favorite theoretical paper.</p>

                The lateral thalamus (LT) receives input from primary sensory nuclei and responds to multimodal stimuli. The LT is also involved in regulating innate and social behaviors through its projections to cortical and limbic networks. However, the importance of multisensory processing within the LT in modulating behavioral output has not been explicitly addressed. Here, we discuss recent findings primarily from rodent studies that extend the classical view of the LT as a passive relay, by underscoring its involvement in associating multimodal features and encoding the salience, valence, and social relevance of sensory signals. We propose that the primary function of the LT is to integrate sensory and non-sensory aspects of multisensory input to gate naturalistic behaviors.

                Across studied vertebrates, the medial amygdala (MeA) is a central hub for relaying sensory information with social and/or survival relevance to downstream nuclei such as the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) and the hypothalamus. MeA-driven behaviors, such as mating, aggression, parenting, and predator avoidance are processed by different molecularly defined inhibitory and excitatory neuronal output populations. Work over the past two decades has deciphered how diverse MeA neurons arise from embryonic development, revealing contributions from multiple telencephalic and diencephalic progenitor domains. Here, we first provide a brief overview of current findings regarding the role of the MeA in social behaviors, followed by a deeper dive into current knowledge of how this complex structure is specified during development. We outline a conceptual model of MeA formation that has emerged based on these findings. We further postulate how embryonic developmental programming of the MeA may inform later emergence of stereotypical circuitry governing hardwired behaviors.

                Grin et al. discover that 3CLpro and nucleocapsid protein are released by unconventional secretion from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells through caspase-activated GSDMD and GSDME pores. 3CLpro inactivates GSDMD to prevent excessive pore formation and pyroptosis. Extracellular 3CLpro retains proteolytic activity in human serum, dampens platelet activation, and inactivates IFN-λ1.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96338">A systematic review and meta-analysis of eyespot anti-predator mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Eyespot patterns have evolved in many prey species. These patterns were traditionally explained by the eye mimicry hypothesis, which proposes that eyespots resembling vertebrate eyes function as predator avoidance. However, it is possible that eyespots do not mimic eyes: according to the conspicuousness hypothesis, eyespots are just one form of vivid signals where only conspicuousness matters. They might work simply through neophobia or unfamiliarity, without necessarily implying aposematism or the unprofitability to potential predators. To test these hypotheses and explore factors influencing predators’ responses, we conducted a meta-analysis with 33 empirical papers that focused on bird responses to both real lepidopterans and artificial targets with conspicuous patterns (i.e. eyespots and non-eyespots). Supporting the latter hypothesis, the results showed no clear difference in predator avoidance efficacy between eyespots and non-eyespots. When comparing geometric pattern characteristics, bigger pattern sizes and smaller numbers of patterns were more effective in preventing avian predation. This finding indicates that single concentric patterns have stronger deterring effects than paired ones. Taken together, our study supports the conspicuousness hypothesis more than the eye mimicry hypothesis. Due to the number and species coverage of published studies so far, the generalisability of our conclusion may be limited. The findings highlight that pattern conspicuousness is key to eliciting avian avoidance responses, shedding a different light on this classic example of signal evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97552">The evolutionary history of the ancient weevil family Belidae (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) reveals the marks of Gondwana breakup and major floristic turnovers, including the rise of angiosperms</a></h4>

              
                The rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic marked major transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. To elucidate how contemporary trophic interactions were influenced by host plant shifts and palaeogeographical events, we integrated molecular data with information from the fossil record to construct a time tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the beetle family Belidae. Our analyses indicate that crown-group Belidae originated approximately 138 Ma ago in Gondwana, associated with Pinopsida (conifer) host plants, with larvae likely developing in dead/decaying branches. Belids tracked their host plants as major plate movements occurred during Gondwana’s breakup, surviving on distant, disjunct landmasses. Some belids shifted to Angiospermae and Cycadopsida when and where conifers declined, evolving new trophic interactions, including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms. Extant radiations of belids in the genera <i>Rhinotia</i> (Australian region) and <i>Proterhinus</i> (Hawaiian Islands) have relatively recent origins.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98277">Marcks and Marcks-like 1 proteins promote spinal cord development and regeneration in Xenopus</a></h4>

              
                Marcks and Marcksl1 are abundant proteins that shuttle between the cytoplasm and membrane to modulate multiple cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics, proliferation, and secretion. Here, we performed loss- and gain-of-function experiments in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> to reveal the novel roles of these proteins in spinal cord development and regeneration. We show that Marcks and Marcksl1 have partly redundant functions and are required for normal neurite formation and proliferation of neuro-glial progenitors during embryonic spinal cord development and for its regeneration during tadpole stages. Rescue experiments in Marcks and Marcksl1 loss-of-function animals further suggested that some of the functions of Marcks and Marcksl1 in the spinal cord are mediated by phospholipid signaling. Taken together, these findings identify Marcks and Marcksl1 as critical new players in spinal cord development and regeneration and suggest new pathways to be targeted for therapeutic stimulation of spinal cord regeneration in human patients.
