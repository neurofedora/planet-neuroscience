              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23608?af=R">In vivo structural connectivity of the reward system along the hippocampal long axis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent work has identified a critical role for the hippocampus in reward-sensitive behaviors, including motivated memory, reinforcement learning, and decision-making. Animal histology and human functional neuroimaging have shown that brain regions involved in reward processing and motivation are more interconnected with the ventral/anterior hippocampus. However, direct evidence examining gradients of structural connectivity between reward regions and the hippocampus in humans is lacking. The present study used diffusion MRI (dMRI) and probabilistic tractography to quantify the structural connectivity of the hippocampus with key reward processing regions in vivo. Using a large sample of subjects (<i>N</i> = 628) from the human connectome dMRI data release, we found that connectivity profiles with the hippocampus varied widely between different regions of the reward circuit. While the dopaminergic midbrain (ventral tegmental area) showed stronger connectivity with the anterior versus posterior hippocampus, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex showed stronger connectivity with the posterior hippocampus. The limbic (ventral) striatum demonstrated a more homogeneous connectivity profile along the hippocampal long axis. This is the first study to generate a probabilistic atlas of the hippocampal structural connectivity with reward-related networks, which is essential to investigating how these circuits contribute to normative adaptive behavior and maladaptive behaviors in psychiatric illness. These findings describe nuanced structural connectivity that sets the foundation to better understand how the hippocampus influences reward-guided behavior in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23607?af=R">The well‐worn route revisited: Striatal and hippocampal system contributions to familiar route navigation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Classic research has shown a division in the neuroanatomical structures that support flexible (e.g., short-cutting) and habitual (e.g., familiar route following) navigational behavior, with hippocampal–caudate systems associated with the former and putamen systems with the latter. There is, however, disagreement about whether the neural structures involved in navigation process particular forms of spatial information, such as associations between constellations of cues forming a cognitive map, versus single landmark-action associations, or alternatively, perform particular reinforcement learning algorithms that allow the use of different spatial strategies, so-called model-based (flexible) or model-free (habitual) forms of learning. We sought to test these theories by asking participants (<i>N</i> = 24) to navigate within a virtual environment through a previously learned, 9-junction route with distinctive landmarks at each junction while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a series of probe trials, we distinguished knowledge of individual landmark-action associations along the route versus knowledge of the correct <i>sequence</i> of landmark-action associations, either by having absent landmarks, or “out-of-sequence” landmarks. Under a map-based perspective, sequence knowledge would not require hippocampal systems, because there are no constellations of cues available for cognitive map formation. Within a learning-based model, however, responding based on knowledge of sequence <i>would</i> require hippocampal systems because prior context has to be utilized. We found that hippocampal–caudate systems were more active in probes requiring sequence knowledge, supporting the learning-based model. However, we also found greater putamen activation in probes where navigation based purely on sequence memory could be planned, supporting models of putamen function that emphasize its role in action sequencing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23609?af=R">AMPA and NMDA receptors in dentate gyrus mediate memory for sucrose in two port discrimination task</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although the phenomenon of memory formation and recall associated with the use of psychotropic drugs has been extensively studied, mechanisms underlying memories for natural reward have not been clarified. Herein, we test the hypothesis that glutamatergic receptors in the dentate gyrus play a role in memories associated with sucrose. We used pellet self-administration protocol to generate memories in two-port nose-poke discrimination task using male Wistar rats. During non-rewarded probe trial, the conditioned animals readily discriminated the active port versus inactive port and showed massive increase in mRNA expression of AMPA receptor subunit genes (gria2, gria3) as well as c-Fos protein in the DG. Access to sweet pellet further enhanced c-Fos expression in the DG. However, animals pre-treated with AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX (intra-DG), on exposure to operant chamber (no pellet), showed decreased discrimination as well as c-Fos expression. We suggest that AMPA receptors in DG mediate recall and consolidation of memories associated with sucrose consumption. CNQX pre-treated animals, if presented with sweet pellet on nose poke, exhibited high discrimination index coupled with increased c-Fos expression. In these CNQX treated rats, the DI was again decreased following administration of NMDA receptor antagonist AP5. We suggest that, although AMPA receptors are blocked, the access to sweet pellet may induce surge of glutamate in the DG, which in turn may reinstate memories via activation of erstwhile silent synapses in NMDA dependant manner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23610?af=R">A comparison of hippocampal and retrosplenial cortical spatial and contextual firing patterns</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus (HPC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) are key components of the brain's memory and navigation systems. Lesions of either region produce profound deficits in spatial cognition and HPC neurons exhibit well-known spatial firing patterns (place fields). Recent studies have also identified an array of navigation-related firing patterns in the RSC. However, there has been little work comparing the response properties and information coding mechanisms of these two brain regions. In the present study, we examined the firing patterns of HPC and RSC neurons in two tasks which are commonly used to study spatial cognition in rodents, open field foraging with an environmental context manipulation and continuous T-maze alternation. We found striking similarities in the kinds of spatial and contextual information encoded by these two brain regions. Neurons in both regions carried information about the rat's current spatial location, trajectories and goal locations, and both regions reliably differentiated the contexts. However, we also found several key differences. For example, information about head direction was a prominent component of RSC representations but was only weakly encoded in the HPC. The two regions also used different coding schemes, even when they encoded the same kind of information. As expected, the HPC employed a sparse coding scheme characterized by compact, high contrast place fields, and information about spatial location was the dominant component of HPC representations. RSC firing patterns were more consistent with a distributed coding scheme. Instead of compact place fields, RSC neurons exhibited broad, but reliable, spatial and directional tuning, and they typically carried information about multiple navigational variables. The observed similarities highlight the closely related functions of the HPC and RSC, whereas the differences in information types and coding schemes suggest that these two regions likely make somewhat different contributions to spatial cognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0244-23.2024?rss=1">Experiencing an Elongated Limb in Virtual Reality Modifies the Tactile Distance Perception of the Corresponding Real Limb</a></h4>

              
                <p>In measurement, a reference frame is needed to compare the measured object to something already known. This raises the neuroscientific question of which reference frame is used by humans when exploring the environment. Previous studies suggested that, in touch, the body employed as measuring tool also serves as reference frame. Indeed, an artificial modification of the perceived dimensions of the body changes the tactile perception of external object dimensions. However, it is unknown if such a change in tactile perception would occur when the body schema is modified through the illusion of owning a limb altered in size. Therefore, employing a virtual hand illusion paradigm with an elongated forearm of different lengths, we systematically tested the subjective perception of distance between two points [tactile distance perception (TDP) task] on the corresponding real forearm following the illusion. Thus, the TDP task is used as a proxy to gauge changes in the body schema. Embodiment of the virtual arm was found significantly greater after the synchronous visuotactile stimulation condition compared with the asynchronous one, and the forearm elongation significantly increased the TDP. However, we did not find any link between the visuotactile-induced ownership over the elongated arm and TDP variation, suggesting that vision plays the main role in the modification of the body schema. Additionally, significant effect of elongation found on TDP but not on proprioception suggests that these are affected differently by body schema modifications. These findings confirm the body schema malleability and its role as a reference frame in touch.</p>

                <p>Essential tremor (ET), a movement disorder characterized by involuntary oscillations of the limbs during movement, remains to date not well understood. It has been recently suggested that the tremor originates from impaired delay compensation, affecting movement representation and online control. Here we tested this hypothesis directly with 24 ET patients (14 female; 10 male) and 28 neurologically intact (NI) human volunteers (17 female; 11 male) in an upper limb postural perturbation task. After maintaining their hand in a visual target, participants experienced perturbations of unpredictable direction and magnitude and were instructed to counter the perturbation and steer their hand back to the starting position. In comparison with NI volunteers, ET patients&rsquo; early muscular responses (short and long-latency responses, 20&ndash;50 and 50&ndash;100&nbsp;ms, respectively) were preserved or even slightly increased. However, they exhibited perturbation-dependent deficits when stopping and stabilizing their hand in the final target supporting the hypothesis that the tremor was generated by the feedback controller. We show in a computational model that errors in delay compensation accumulating over time produced the same small increase in initial feedback response followed by oscillations that scaled with the perturbation magnitude as observed in ET population. Our experimental results therefore validate the computational hypothesis that inaccurate delay compensation in long-latency pathways could be the origin of the tremor.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/25/e0158242024?rss=1">Thalamocortical Dynamics during Rapid Eye Movement Sleep in the Mouse Somatosensory Pathway</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, also referred to as paradoxical sleep for the striking resemblance of its electroencephalogram (EEG) to the one observed in wakefulness, is characterized by the occurrence of transient events such as limb twitches or facial and rapid eye movements. Here, we investigated the local activity of the primary somatosensory or barrel cortex (S1) in naturally sleeping head-fixed male mice during REM. Through local field potential recordings, we uncovered local appearances of spindle waves in the barrel cortex during REM concomitant with strong delta power, challenging the view of a wakefulness-like activity in REM. We further performed extra- and intracellular recordings of thalamic cells in head-fixed mice. Our data show high-frequency thalamic bursts of spikes and subthreshold spindle oscillations in approximately half of the neurons of the ventral posterior medial nucleus which further confirmed the thalamic origin of local cortical spindles in S1 in REM. Cortical spindle oscillations were suppressed, while thalamus spike firing increased, associated with rapid mouse whisker movements and S1 cortical activity transitioned to an activated state. During REM, the sensory thalamus and barrel cortex therefore alternate between high (wake-like) and low (non-REM sleep-like) activation states, potentially providing a neuronal substrate for mnemonic processes occurring during this paradoxical sleep stage.</p>

                <p>Even in the absence of specific sensory input or a behavioral task, the brain produces structured patterns of activity. This organized activity is modulated by changes in arousal. Here, we use wide-field voltage imaging to establish how arousal relates to cortical network voltage and hemodynamic activity in spontaneously behaving head-fixed male and female mice expressing the voltage-sensitive fluorescent FRET sensor Butterfly 1.2. We find that global voltage and hemodynamic signals are both positively correlated with changes in arousal with a maximum correlation of 0.5 and 0.25, respectively, at a time lag of 0&nbsp;s. We next show that arousal influences distinct cortical regions for both voltage and hemodynamic signals. These include a broad positive correlation across most sensory-motor cortices extending posteriorly to the primary visual cortex observed in both signals. In contrast, activity in the prefrontal cortex is positively correlated to changes in arousal for the voltage signal while it is a slight net negative correlation observed in the hemodynamic signal. Additionally, we show that coherence between voltage and hemodynamic signals relative to arousal is strongest for slow frequencies below 0.15&nbsp;Hz and is near zero for frequencies &gt;1&nbsp;Hz. We finally show that coupling patterns are dependent on the behavioral state of the animal with correlations being driven by periods of increased orofacial movement. Our results indicate that while hemodynamic signals show strong relations to behavior and arousal, these relations are distinct from those observed by voltage activity.</p>

                <p>Vertebrate vision begins with light absorption by rod and cone photoreceptors, which transmit signals from their synaptic terminals to second-order neurons: bipolar and horizontal cells. In mouse rods, there is a single presynaptic ribbon-type active zone at which the release of glutamate occurs tonically in the dark. This tonic glutamatergic signaling requires continuous exo- and endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. At conventional synapses, endocytosis commonly requires dynamins: GTPases encoded by three genes (<I>Dnm1&ndash;3</I>), which perform membrane scission. Disrupting endocytosis by dynamin deletions impairs transmission at conventional synapses, but the impact of disrupting endocytosis and the role(s) of specific dynamin isoforms at rod ribbon synapses are understood incompletely. Here, we used cell-specific knock-outs (KOs) of the neuron-specific <I>Dnm1</I> and <I>Dnm3</I> to investigate the functional roles of dynamin isoforms in rod photoreceptors in mice of either sex. Analysis of synaptic protein expression, synapse ultrastructure, and retinal function via electroretinograms (ERGs) showed that dynamins 1 and 3 act redundantly and are essential for supporting the structural and functional integrity of rod ribbon synapses. Single <I>Dnm3</I> KO showed no phenotype, and single <I>Dnm1</I> KO only modestly reduced synaptic vesicle density without affecting vesicle size and overall synapse integrity, whereas double <I>Dnm1/Dnm3</I> KO impaired vesicle endocytosis profoundly, causing enlarged vesicles, reduced vesicle density, reduced ERG responses, synaptic terminal degeneration, and disassembly and degeneration of postsynaptic processes. Concurrently, cone function remained intact. These results show the fundamental redundancy of dynamins 1 and 3 in regulating the structure and function of rod ribbon synapses.</p>

                <p>Research on selective attention has largely focused on the enhancement of behaviorally important information, with less focus on the suppression of distracting information. Enhancement and suppression can operate through a push&ndash;pull relationship attributable to competitive interactions among neural populations. There has been considerable debate, however, regarding (1) whether suppression can be voluntarily deployed, independent of enhancement, and (2) whether voluntary deployment of suppression is associated with neural processes occurring prior to the distractor onset. Here, we investigated the interplay between pre- and post-distractor neural processes, while male and female human subjects performed a visual search task with a cue that indicated the location of an upcoming distractor. We utilized two established EEG markers of suppression: the distractor positivity (P<SUB>D</SUB>) and alpha power (~8&ndash;15&nbsp;Hz). The P<SUB>D</SUB>&mdash;a component of event-related potentials&mdash;has been linked with successful distractor suppression, and increased alpha power has been linked with attenuated sensory processing. Cueing the location of an upcoming distractor speeded responses and led to an earlier P<SUB>D</SUB>, consistent with earlier suppression due to strategic use of a spatial cue. In comparison, higher predistractor alpha power contralateral to distractors led to a later P<SUB>D</SUB>, consistent with later suppression. Lower alpha power contralateral to distractors instead led to distractor-related attentional capture. Lateralization of alpha power was not linked to the spatial cue. This observation, combined with differences in the timing of suppression&mdash;as indexed by earlier and later P<SUB>D</SUB> components&mdash;demonstrates that cue-related, voluntary suppression can occur separate from alpha-related gating of sensory processing.</p>

                <p>Attentional control over sensory processing has been linked to neural alpha oscillations and related inhibition of cerebral cortex. Despite the wide consensus on the functional relevance of alpha oscillations for attention, precise neural mechanisms of how alpha oscillations shape perception and how this top-down modulation is implemented in cortical networks remain unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that alpha oscillations in frontal eye fields (FEFs) are causally involved in the top-down regulation of visual processing in humans (male and female). We applied sham-controlled, intermittent transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over bilateral FEF at either 10&nbsp;Hz (alpha) or 40&nbsp;Hz (gamma) to manipulate attentional preparation in a visual discrimination task. Under each stimulation condition, we measured psychometric functions for contrast perception and introduced a novel linear mixed modeling approach for statistical control of neurosensory side effects of the electric stimulation. tACS at alpha frequency reduced the slope of the psychometric function, resulting in improved subthreshold and impaired superthreshold contrast perception. Side effects on the psychometric functions were complex and showed large interindividual variability. Controlling for the impact of side effects on the psychometric parameters by using covariates in the linear mixed model analysis reduced this variability and strengthened the perceptual effect. We propose that alpha tACS over FEF mimicked a state of endogenous attention by strengthening a fronto-occipitoparietal network in the alpha band. We speculate that this network modulation enhanced phasic gating in occipitoparietal cortex leading to increased variability of single-trial psychometric thresholds, measurable as a reduction of psychometric slope.</p>

                <p>Decreased neuronal specificity of the brain in response to cognitive demands (i.e., neural dedifferentiation) has been implicated in age-related cognitive decline. Investigations into functional connectivity analogs of these processes have focused primarily on measuring segregation of nonoverlapping networks at rest. Here, we used an edge-centric network approach to derive entropy, a measure of specialization, from spatially overlapping communities during cognitive task fMRI. Using Human Connectome Project Lifespan data (713 participants, 36&ndash;100&nbsp;years old, 55.7% female), we characterized a pattern of nodal despecialization differentially affecting the medial temporal lobe and limbic, visual, and subcortical systems. At the whole-brain level, global entropy moderated declines in fluid cognition across the lifespan and uniquely covaried with age when controlling for the network segregation metric modularity. Importantly, relationships between both metrics (entropy and modularity) and fluid cognition were age dependent, although entropy's relationship with cognition was specific to older adults. These results suggest entropy is a potentially important metric for examining how neurological processes in aging affect functional specialization at the nodal, network, and whole-brain level.</p>

                <p>Inhibitory neurons embedded within mammalian neural circuits shape breathing, walking, and other rhythmic motor behaviors. At the core of the neural circuit controlling breathing is the preBo&#x0308;tzinger Complex (preBo&#x0308;tC), where GABAergic (GAD1/2<sup>+</sup>) and glycinergic (GlyT2<sup>+</sup>) neurons are functionally and anatomically intercalated among glutamatergic Dbx1-derived (Dbx1<sup>+</sup>) neurons that generate rhythmic inspiratory drive. The roles of these preBo&#x0308;tC inhibitory neurons in breathing remain unclear. We first characterized the spatial distribution of molecularly defined preBo&#x0308;tC inhibitory subpopulations in male and female neonatal double reporter mice expressing either tdTomato or EGFP in GlyT2<sup>+</sup>, GAD1<sup>+</sup>, or GAD2<sup>+</sup> neurons. We found that the majority of preBo&#x0308;tC inhibitory neurons expressed both GlyT2 and GAD2 while a much smaller subpopulation also expressed GAD1. To determine the functional role of these subpopulations, we used holographic photostimulation, a patterned illumination technique, in rhythmically active medullary slices from neonatal Dbx1<sup>tdTomato</sup>;GlyT2<sup>EGFP</sup> and Dbx1<sup>tdTomato</sup>;GAD1<sup>EGFP</sup> double reporter mice of either sex. Stimulation of 4 or 8 preBo&#x0308;tC GlyT2<sup>+</sup> neurons during endogenous rhythm prolonged the interburst interval in a phase-dependent manner and increased the latency to burst initiation when bursts were evoked by stimulation of Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons. In contrast, stimulation of 4 or 8 preBo&#x0308;tC GAD1<sup>+</sup> neurons did not affect interburst interval or latency to burst initiation. Instead, photoactivation of GAD1<sup>+</sup> neurons during the inspiratory burst prolonged endogenous and evoked burst duration and decreased evoked burst amplitude. We conclude that GlyT2<sup>+</sup>/GAD2<sup>+</sup> neurons modulate breathing rhythm by delaying burst initiation while a smaller GAD1<sup>+</sup> subpopulation shapes inspiratory patterning by altering burst duration and amplitude.</p>

                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of seniors in the United States. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is widely used to study neurophysiology in AD and its prodromal condition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The intrinsic neural timescale (INT), which can be estimated through the magnitude of the autocorrelation of neural signals from rs-fMRI, is thought to quantify the duration that neural information is stored in a local circuit. Such heterogeneity of the timescales forms a basis of the brain functional hierarchy and captures an aspect of circuit dynamics relevant to excitation/inhibition balance, which is broadly relevant for cognitive functions. Given that, we applied rs-fMRI to test whether distinct changes of INT at different hierarchies are present in people with MCI, those progressing to AD (called Converter), and AD patients of both sexes. Linear mixed-effect model was implemented to detect altered hierarchical gradients across populations followed by pairwise comparisons to identify regional differences. High similarities between AD and Converter were observed. Specifically, the inferior temporal, caudate, and pallidum areas exhibit significant alterations in both AD and Converter. Distinct INT-related pathological changes in MCI and AD were found. For AD/Converter, neural information is stored for a longer time in lower hierarchical areas, while higher levels of hierarchy seem to be preferentially impaired in MCI leading to a less pronounced hierarchical gradient. These results inform that the INT holds great potential as an additional measure for AD prediction, even a stable biomarker for clinical diagnosis.</p>

                <p>Superagers are elderly individuals with the memory ability of people 30 years younger and provide evidence that age-related cognitive decline is not inevitable. In a sample of 64 superagers (mean age, 81.9; 59% women) and 55 typical older adults (mean age, 82.4; 64% women) from the Vallecas Project, we studied, cross-sectionally and longitudinally over 5&nbsp;years with yearly follow-ups, the global cerebral white matter status as well as region-specific white matter microstructure assessment derived from diffusivity measures. Superagers and typical older adults showed no difference in global white matter health (total white matter volume, Fazekas score, and lesions volume) cross-sectionally or longitudinally. However, analyses of diffusion parameters revealed the better white matter microstructure in superagers than in typical older adults. Cross-sectional differences showed higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in superagers mostly in frontal fibers and lower mean diffusivity (MD) in most white matter tracts, expressed as an anteroposterior gradient with greater group differences in anterior tracts. FA decrease over time is slower in superagers than in typical older adults in all white matter tracts assessed, which is mirrored by MD increases over time being slower in superagers than in typical older adults in all white matter tracts except for the corticospinal tract, the uncinate fasciculus, and the forceps minor. The better preservation of white matter microstructure in superagers relative to typical older adults supports resistance to age-related brain structural changes as a mechanism underpinning the remarkable memory capacity of superagers, while their regional aging pattern is in line with the last-in-first-out hypothesis.</p>

                <p>Hexanucleotide repeat expansions within the gene <I>C9ORF72</I> are the most common cause of the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This disease-causing expansion leads to a reduction in C9ORF72 expression levels in patients, suggesting loss of C9ORF72 function could contribute to disease. To further understand the consequences of C9ORF72 deficiency in vivo, we generated a <I>c9orf72</I> mutant zebrafish line. Analysis of the adult female spinal cords revealed no appreciable neurodegenerative pathology such as loss of motor neurons or increased levels of neuroinflammation. However, detailed examination of adult female <I>c9orf72<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> retinas showed prominent neurodegenerative features, including a decrease in retinal thickness, gliosis, and an overall reduction in neurons of all subtypes. Analysis of rod and cone cells within the photoreceptor layer showed a disturbance in their outer segment structure and rhodopsin mislocalization from rod outer segments to their cell bodies and synaptic terminals. Thus, C9ORF72 may play a previously unappreciated role in retinal homeostasis and suggests C9ORF72 deficiency can induce tissue specific neuronal loss.</p>

                <p>The olfactory tubercle (TUB), also called the tubular striatum, receives direct input from the olfactory bulb and, along with the nucleus accumbens, is one of the two principal components of the ventral striatum. As a key component of the reward system, the ventral striatum is involved in feeding behavior, but the vast majority of research on this structure has focused on the nucleus accumbens, leaving the TUB's role in feeding behavior understudied. Given the importance of olfaction in food seeking and consumption, olfactory input to the striatum should be an important contributor to motivated feeding behavior. Yet the TUB is vastly understudied in humans, with very little understanding of its structural organization and connectivity. In this study, we analyzed macrostructural variations between the TUB and the whole brain and explored the relationship between TUB structural pathways and feeding behavior, using body mass index (BMI) as a proxy in females and males. We identified a unique structural covariance between the TUB and the periaqueductal gray (PAG), which has recently been implicated in the suppression of feeding. We further show that the integrity of the white matter tract between the two regions is negatively correlated with BMI. Our findings highlight a potential role for the TUB&ndash;PAG pathway in the regulation of feeding behavior in humans.</p>

                Background The significance of innovative work behavior is growing as organizations strive to maintain their competitiveness by hiring freelancer employees. This study aimed to examine how absorptive capability mediates the connections between job motivation, transformational leadership, and innovation work behavior in freelancers working in the oil and gas industry. Methods A quantitative methodology was employed through an online questionnaire, using a random sampling strategy involving 250 respondents. Furthermore, data analysis was performed using structural equation modelling. Results The findings indicate that job motivation and transformational leadership did not have a direct impact on innovation work behavior. However, they did have an indirect beneficial influence mediated by absorptive capability. This study revealed that absorptive skills play a vital role in facilitating the translation of job drive and transformational leadership into innovative work behaviors. Conclusions The practical consequences involve firms embracing transformational leadership and establishing training programs to enhance employees' absorptive potential, thereby promoting innovation. Ultimately, cultivating absorptive skills is crucial for leadership styles and motivational elements to be evident in innovative work behaviors.

                Background Patients treated in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) departments benefit from global and multidisciplinary long-term care. The study of satisfaction represents an important element in the evaluation of the quality of the healthcare provided. The aim of this study is to assess the level of satisfaction of patients treated in the PM&R department of Sahloul university hospital of Sousse Tunisia as well as the associated factors during the year 2020. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study, including patients treated in the hospitalization and the outpatient units of the PM&R department. Monnin and Perneger scale validated in Arabic was used to measure satisfaction in its different dimensions. Medical data were completed from patients’ records. Results A total of 240 patients were included in our study. The level of satisfaction was significantly higher with the admission procedures for inpatients compared to outpatients (87.9% vs. 60.0%, p<0.001). Regarding the global assessment, 82.1% of patients were satisfied. Multivariate analysis showed that for administrative procedures, consultation for outpatients was a factor of dissatisfaction (aOR=0.18, p<0.001). Patients’ physiotherapy treatment during the Covid-19 period was negatively associated with satisfaction for logistics (aOR= 0.44, p=0.011) and for the global assessment of health care provided in our department (aOR= 0.46, p=0.04). Conclusion Our study showed overall good levels of satisfaction in the department of PM&R of Sahloul. However, more studies should follow to determine other factors that can influence satisfaction.

                Background Lassa fever is an endemic and immediately notifiable disease in Liberia, and one laboratory confirmed case constitutes an outbreak. We described the epidemiological characteristics and hospital outcome of Lassa fever cases hospitalized during the 2022-2023 outbreak in Liberia. Methods A cohort study was conducted using routine Lassa fever surveillance data from the 2022-2023 outbreak in Liberia. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data and log binomial regression to assess the association between epidemiological characteristics and mortality. Results A total of 439 suspected Lassa fever cases were reported. The median age was 22 (interquartile range: 10-33) years and 233 (53%) were women. The median number of days between symptom onset and admission was 4 (IQR 2-7). Of the 439 cases, 416 (95%) were tested for Lassa fever and 138 were confirmed with 33% positivity rate. The majority, 290 (69%), of confirmed cases were <30 years, 78 (57%) were females, and 81 (59%) were reported during the dry season (October – March). Contact with rodents, 94 (68%), was the commonest mode of exposure. Fever, 128 (93%), malaise, 121 (88%), headache, 114 (83%) and myalgia, 114 (83%) were the most common clinical characteristics. There were 83 (19%) deaths among hospitalized suspected Lassa fever cases - 42 deaths (15%) among 278 individuals who tested negative and 41 among confirmed cases with 30% case fatality rate (CFR). The highest CFR was recorded among those aged 40-49 years, 8 (67%) and those aged≥50, 5 (63%). There was no significant association between epidemiological characteristics and Lassa fever mortality. Conclusions The outbreak highlighted a high disease burden of Lassa fever with young adults disproportionately infected, and substantial mortality, even among those who tested negative for the virus. This underscores the urgent need for preventive measures like vaccines and health education campaigns.

                Introduction Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a severe condition that causes severe pain and emotional distress in the brain. It can significantly impact the quality of a person's life and lead to daily withdrawal and emotional instability. Despite extensive research, there is still a need for comprehensive bibliometric studies to understand the literature on TN. This study is particularly important as there are no existing bibliometric studies on TN on Scopus, providing new opportunities for research and innovation in TN treatment. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords “trigeminal neuralgia”, current and therapy. Data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis Results The research trend found are documents by year, most global cited document, most relevant sources, factorial map of the documents with the highest contributes, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by affiliation, documents by subject area, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, cluster analysis, and qualitative analysis. Conclusions The study focuses on trigeminal neuralgia, a topic of research and a recent topic involving periferal nerve stimulation and the use of karbamazepin, a new topic in the field of therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-659/v1?src=rss">Marital Bargaining and Assortative Matching on Fertility Preference : Evidence based on Cross-sectional Data in China [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Despite the relaxation of fertility restrictions, China’s birth rate continues to decline. The Universal Two-Child Policy encourages couples to consider having a second child, often leading to a bargaining process between spouses with differing preferences. Additionally, the skewed sex ratio has increased Chinese women’s bargaining power, highlighting the importance of analyzing fertility decisions through marital bargaining. Methods This paper investigates second-child fertility decisions using data from the 2018 China Family Panel Studies and employs Ordinary Least Squares regression. The study examines assortative matching based on fertility preferences and uses the 2020 provincial-level sex ratio for individuals aged 20–39 as a proxy for women’s bargaining power in the marriage market. Results The study shows that achieving consensus on having a second child requires cooperation between spouses, particularly when their fertility preferences differ. The study also reveals that marriage matching is not random; individuals are more likely to partner with those who share the same second-child preference. Additionally, women with greater bargaining power positively influence their husbands’ desired family size, a correlation not observed in males. Conclusion The study concludes that second-child fertility decisions in China are significantly influenced by marital bargaining and the increased bargaining power of women due to the skewed sex ratio. Cooperation between spouses with differing fertility preferences is crucial for reaching a consensus on having a second child.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the central pacemaker for mammalian circadian rhythms. As such, this ensemble of cell-autonomous neuronal oscillators with divergent periods must maintain coordinated oscillations. To investigate ultrastructural features enabling such synchronization, 805 coronal ultrathin sections of mouse SCN tissue were imaged with electron microscopy and aligned into a volumetric stack, from which selected neurons within the SCN core were reconstructed <i>in silico</i>. We found that clustered SCN core neurons were physically connected to each other via multiple large soma-to-soma plate-like contacts. In some cases, a sliver of a glial process was interleaved. These contacts were large, covering on average ∼21% of apposing neuronal somata. It is possible that contacts may be the electrophysiological substrate for synchronization between SCN neurons. Such plate-like contacts may explain why the synchronization of SCN neurons is maintained even when chemical synaptic transmission or electrical synaptic transmission via gap junctions is blocked. Such ephaptic contact-mediated synchronization among nearby neurons may therefore contribute to the wave-like oscillations of circadian core clock genes and calcium signals observed in the SCN.</p>
<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>Three-dimensional reconstruction of SCN tissue via serial electron microscopy revealed a novel structural feature of SCN neurons that may account for interneuronal synchronization that persists even when the predominant mechanisms of neuronal communication are blocked. We found that SCN core neurons are connected by multiple soma–soma contact specializations, ultrastructural elements that could enable synchronization of tightly packed neurons organized in clustered networks. This extensive network of plate-like soma–soma contacts among clustered SCN neurons may provide insight into how ∼20,000 autonomous neuronal oscillators with a broad range of intrinsic periods remain synchronized in the absence of ordinary communication modalities, thereby conferring the resilience required for the SCN to function as the mammalian circadian pacemaker.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This work attempted to clarify the interaction of cognition and pain sensitization during a paradigm of Temporal Summation of Second Pain (TSSP). We analyzed pain ratings and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity obtained from 21 healthy participants during the presentation of four experimental conditions that differed in the manipulation of attention to painful stimuli or working memory load (Attention to hand &amp; TSSP; 0-back &amp; TSSP (low cognitive load); 2-back &amp; TSSP (high cognitive load); 2-back (without pain)). We found that the TSSP was reduced when the attention was diverted and the cognitive load increased, and this reduction was accompanied by higher midfrontal theta activity and lower posterior alpha and central beta activity. Although it is well established that TSSP is a phenomenon that occurs at the spinal level, here we show that it is also affected by supraspinal attentional mechanisms. Delivery of painful repeated stimuli did not affect the performance of the 2-back task but was associated with smaller amplitudes of attentional event-related potentials (ERPs) after standard stimuli (not the target). The study of brain activity during TSSP allowed to clarify the role of top-down attentional modulation in pain sensitization processes. Results contribute to a better understanding of cognitive dysfunction in pain conditions and reinforce the use of therapeutic strategies based on distracting attention away from pain.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)—the sudden and unexplained death of a seemingly healthy infant, &lt;1 year old—may be associated with abnormalities in the brain regions that underlie breathing and arousal during sleep. While post-mortem studies suggest abnormalities in SIDS infants' brainstems, there are no studies of these infants' brainstem function before death. One way to assess the function of the brainstem is with auditory brainstem response (ABR), a routine hearing-screening method that noninvasively measures the brainstem's response to sound. We hypothesize that anomalies in newborns' ABR measures may predict SIDS. Indeed, previous studies identified abnormalities in ABR characteristics in small samples of near-miss SIDS infants hospitalized for infant apnea syndrome. However, there is a need to examine the ABRs of infants who died of SIDS. Therefore, in the current study, we propose integrating two secondary datasets to examine newborns' ABRs (<i>N</i> = 156,972), including those who later died of SIDS (<i>n</i> = ~42; .27 out of every 1000 infants), using existing archived records of neonatal ABR results from a sample of newborns born in Florida. We hypothesize that infants who die from SIDS are more likely than non-SIDS infants to have abnormal ABRs as newborns. Understanding the association between SIDS and ABR may facilitate more accurate identification of an infant's risk for SIDS at birth, enabling increased monitoring, which may facilitate interventions and improve survivorship.</p>

                In this issue of Neuron, Biswas et al. demonstrate the roles of glutamatergic neuronal activity in the regulation of angiogenesis and retinal vascular endothelial barrier maturation using three different knockout mouse models. Their findings shed light on how aberrant glutamatergic activity can impact neural vascular function and barrier integrity.

                In this issue of Neuron, Kochan et al. report that enhanced mitochondrial fusion is essential for the heightened synaptic plasticity in adult-born neurons during the critical period, thus supporting their competition with neurons of similar age for survival.

                The dynamic suppression of threat-related behavior as a function of environmental constraint is critical for survival in mammals, yet the neurobiological underpinnings remain largely unknown. In this issue of Neuron, Wang et al. identified prefrontal dynorphin-expressing neurons as key elements for tracking threat-related behavioral states and regulating fear suppression.

                Larry Young, the self-described “guy who spends his days thinking about love and bonding in terms of biochemical reactions in localized circuits of the brain” (The Chemistry Between Us1), passed away, too early, in March 2024. He was a brilliant scientist who used prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) and other rodents to pioneer a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin act in the mammalian brain to mediate affiliative behaviors. He was also so much more—to his family, his field, his trainees and colleagues, and the larger world with whom he so skillfully communicated his complex studies that have illuminated how the social brain works.

                We present open-source tools for three-dimensional (3D) analysis of photographs of dissected slices of human brains, which are routinely acquired in brain banks but seldom used for quantitative analysis. Our tools can: (1) 3D reconstruct a volume from the photographs and, optionally, a surface scan; and (2) produce a high-resolution 3D segmentation into 11 brain regions per hemisphere (22 in total), independently of the slice thickness. Our tools can be used as a substitute for ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which requires access to an MRI scanner, ex vivo scanning expertise, and considerable ﬁnancial resources. We tested our tools on synthetic and real data from two NIH Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers. The results show that our methodology yields accurate 3D reconstructions, segmentations, and volumetric measurements that are highly correlated to those from MRI. Our method also detects expected diﬀerences between <i>post mortem</i> conﬁrmed Alzheimer’s disease cases and controls. The tools are available in our widespread neuroimaging suite ‘FreeSurfer’ (<a href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/PhotoTools">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/PhotoTools</a>).

                Spinal pain affects individuals of all ages and is the most common musculoskeletal problem globally. Its clinical management remains a challenge as the underlying mechanisms leading to it are still unclear. Here, we report that significantly increased numbers of senescent osteoclasts (SnOCs) are observed in mouse models of spinal hypersensitivity, like lumbar spine instability (LSI) or aging, compared to controls. The larger population of SnOCs is associated with induced sensory nerve innervation, as well as the growth of H-type vessels, in the porous endplate. We show that deletion of senescent cells by administration of the senolytic drug Navitoclax (ABT263) results in significantly less spinal hypersensitivity, spinal degeneration, porosity of the endplate, sensory nerve innervation, and H-type vessel growth in the endplate. We also show that there is significantly increased SnOC-mediated secretion of Netrin-1 and NGF, two well-established sensory nerve growth factors, compared to non-senescent OCs. These findings suggest that pharmacological elimination of SnOCs may be a potent therapy to treat spinal pain.

                The chemical composition of foods is complex, variable, and dependent on many factors. This has a major impact on nutrition research as it foundationally aﬀects our ability to adequately assess the actual intake of nutrients and other compounds. In spite of this, accurate data on nutrient intake are key for investigating the associations and causal relationships between intake, health, and disease risk at the service of developing evidence-based dietary guidance that enables improvements in population health. Here, we exemplify the importance of this challenge by investigating the impact of food content variability on nutrition research using three bioactives as model: ﬂavan-3-ols, (–)-epicatechin, and nitrate. Our results show that common approaches aimed at addressing the high compositional variability of even the same foods impede the accurate assessment of nutrient intake generally. This suggests that the results of many nutrition studies using food composition data are potentially unreliable and carry greater limitations than commonly appreciated, consequently resulting in dietary recommendations with signiﬁcant limitations and unreliable impact on public health. Thus, current challenges related to nutrient intake assessments need to be addressed and mitigated by the development of improved dietary assessment methods involving the use of nutritional biomarkers.

                Microbes strongly affect invasive plant growth. However, how phyllosphere and rhizosphere soil microbes distinctively affect seedling mortality and growth of invaders across ontogeny under varying soil nutrient levels remains unclear. In this study, we used the invader <i>Ageratina adenophora</i> to evaluate these effects. We found that higher proportions of potential pathogens were detected in core microbial taxa in leaf litter than rhizosphere soil and thus leaf inoculation had more adverse effects on seed germination and seedling survival than soil inoculation. Microbial inoculation at different growth stages altered the microbial community and functions of seedlings, and earlier inoculation had a more adverse effect on seedling survival and growth. The soil nutrient level did not affect microbe-mediated seedling growth and the relative abundance of the microbial community and functions involved in seedling growth. The effects of some microbial genera on seedling survival are distinct from those on growth. Moreover, the <i>A. adenophora</i> seedling-killing effects of fungal strains isolated from dead seedlings by non-sterile leaf inoculation exhibited significant phylogenetic signals, by which strains of <i>Allophoma</i> and <i>Alternaria</i> generally caused high seedling mortality. Our study stresses the essential role of <i>A. adenophora</i> litter microbes in population establishment by regulating seedling density and growth.

                Extrachromosomal DNA is a common cause of oncogene amplification in cancer. The non-chromosomal inheritance of ecDNA enables tumors to rapidly evolve, contributing to treatment resistance and poor outcome for patients. The transcriptional context in which ecDNAs arise and progress, including chromosomally-driven transcription, is incompletely understood. We examined gene expression patterns of 870 tumors of varied histological types, to identify transcriptional correlates of ecDNA. Here, we show that ecDNA-containing tumors impact four major biological processes. Specifically, ecDNA-containing tumors up-regulate DNA damage and repair, cell cycle control, and mitotic processes, but down-regulate global immune regulation pathways. Taken together, these results suggest profound alterations in gene regulation in ecDNA-containing tumors, shedding light on molecular processes that give rise to their development and progression.

">Spine loss in depression impairs dendritic signal integration in human cortical microcircuit models</a></h4>

              
                Major depressive disorder (depression) is associated with altered dendritic structure and function in excitatory cortical pyramidal neurons, due to decreased inhibition from somatostatin interneurons and loss of spines and associated synapses, as indicated in postmortem human studies. Dendrites play an important role in signal processing as they receive the majority of synaptic inputs and exhibit nonlinear properties including backpropagating action potentials and dendritic Na+ spikes that enhance the computational power of the neuron. However, it is currently unclear how depression-related dendritic changes impact the integration of signals. Here, we expanded our previous data-driven detailed computational models of human cortical microcircuits in health and depression to include active dendritic properties that enable backpropagating action potentials as measured in human neurons, and spine loss in depression in terms of synapse loss and altered intrinsic property. We show that spine loss dampens signal response and thus results in a larger impairment of cortical function such as signal detection than due to reduced somatostatin interneuron inhibition alone. We further show that the altered intrinsic properties due to spine loss abolish nonlinear dendritic integration of signals and impair recurrent microcircuit activity. Our study thus mechanistically links cellular changes in depression to impaired dendritic processing in human cortical microcircuits.

                Coordinated activity of basolateral amygdala (BLA) GABAergic interneurons (INs) and glutamatergic principal cells (PCs) is critical for associative learning, however the microcircuit organization-function relationships of distinct IN classes remain uncertain. Here, we show somatostatin (SOM) INs provide inhibition onto, and are excited by, local PCs, whereas vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) INs are driven by extrinsic afferents. Parvalbumin (PV) INs inhibit PCs and are activated by local and extrinsic inputs. Thus, SOM and VIP INs exhibit complementary roles in feedback and feedforward inhibition, respectively, while PV INs contribute to both microcircuit motifs. Functionally, each IN subtype reveals unique activity patterns across fear- and extinction learning with SOM and VIP INs showing most divergent characteristics, and PV INs display an intermediate phenotype parallelling synaptic data. Finally, SOM and PV INs dynamically track behavioral state transitions across learning. These data provide insight into the synaptic microcircuit organization-function relationships of distinct BLA IN classes.

">A failure to discriminate social from non-social touch at the circuit level may underlie social avoidance in autism</a></h4>

              
                Social touch is critical for communication and to impart emotions and intentions. However, certain autistic individuals experience aversion to social touch, especially when it is unwanted. We used a novel social touch assay and Neuropixels probes to compare neural responses to social vs. non-social interactions in three relevant brain regions: vibrissal somatosensory cortex, tail of striatum, and basolateral amygdala. We find that wild type (WT) mice showed aversion to repeated presentations of an inanimate object but not of another mouse. Cortical neurons cared most about touch context (social vs. object) and showed a preference for social interactions, while striatal neurons changed their preference depending on whether mice could choose or not to interact. Amygdalar and striatal neurons were preferentially modulated by forced object touch, which was the most aversive. In contrast, the Fmr1 knockout (KO) model of autism found social and non-social interactions equally aversive and displayed more aversive facial expressions to social touch when it invaded their personal space. Importantly, when Fmr1 KO mice could choose to interact, neurons in all three regions did not discriminate social valence. Thus, a failure to differentially encode social from non-social stimuli at the circuit level may underlie social avoidance in autism.

                Reward cues are often ambiguous; what is good in one context is not necessarily good in another context. To solve this ambiguity, animals form hierarchical associations in which the context acts as a gatekeeper in the retrieval of the appropriate cue-evoked memory, ensuring context-appropriate behavior. These hierarchical associative structures also influence future learning by promoting the formation of new context-dependent associations (leading to the inference of context-dependency for new associations). The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the dorsal hippocampus (DH) are both proposed to encode a "cognitive map" that includes the representation of hierarchical, context-dependent, associations. However the causal role of the OFC and DH in the different functional properties of hierarchical associations remains controversial. Here we used chemogenetic inactivations, in rats, to examine the role of OFC and DH in 1) the contextual regulation of performance, and 2) the contextual learning bias conferred by hierarchical associations. We show that OFC is required for both manifestations of hierarchical associations. In contrast, DH contribution appears limited to the contextual learning bias. This study provides novel insight into the different functional properties of context-dependent hierarchical associations, and establishes the OFC as a critical orchestrator of these different contextual effects.

">A computational approach to understanding effort-based decision-making in depression</a></h4>

              
                Background: Motivational dysfunction is a core feature of depression, and can have debilitating effects on everyday function. However, it is unclear which disrupted cognitive processes underlie impaired motivation, and whether impairments persist following remission. Decision-making concerning exerting effort to collect rewards offers a promising framework for understanding motivation, especially when examined with computational tools which can offer precise quantification of latent processes. Methods: Effort-based decision-making was assessed using the Apple Gathering Task, in which participants decide whether to exert effort via a grip-force device to obtain varying levels of reward; effort levels were individually calibrated and varied parametrically. We present a comprehensive computational analysis of decision-making, initially validating our model in healthy volunteers (N=67), before applying it in a case-control study including current (N=41) and remitted (N=46) unmedicated depressed individuals, and healthy volunteers with (N=36) and without (N=57) a family history of depression. Results: Four fundamental computational mechanisms that drive patterns of effort-based decisions, which replicated across samples, were identified: an overall bias to accept effort challenges; reward sensitivity; and linear and quadratic effort sensitivity. Traditional model-agnostic analyses showed that both depressed groups showed lower willingness to exert effort. In contrast with previous findings, computational analysis revealed that this difference was driven by lower effort acceptance bias, but not altered effort or reward sensitivity. Conclusions: This work provides insight into the computational mechanisms underlying motivational dysfunction in depression. Lower willingness to exert effort could represent a trait-like factor contributing to symptoms, and might represent a fruitful target for treatment and prevention.

                Multimodal neuroimaging allows for non-invasive examination of human brain structure and function across multiple scales. Precision neuroimaging builds upon this foundation, enabling the mapping of brain structure, function, and connectivity patterns with high fidelity in single individuals. Ultra-high field (UHF) neuroimaging, operating at magnetic field strengths of 7 Tesla or higher, increases signal-to-noise ratio and offers even higher spatial resolution. Here, we provide a multimodal Precision Neuroimaging and Connectomics (PNI) dataset, utilizing UHF 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ten healthy individuals underwent a comprehensive MRI protocol, including T1 relaxometry, magnetization transfer imaging, T2*-weighted imaging, diffusion MRI, and multi-state functional MRI paradigms, aggregated across three imaging sessions. Alongside anonymized raw imaging data, we release cortex-wide connectomes from different modalities across multiple parcellation scales, and supply gradients that compactly characterize spatial patterning of cortical organization. Our precision imaging dataset will advance our understanding of structure-function relationships in the individual human brain and is publicly available via the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/mhq3f/) and the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform data portal (https://portal.conp.ca).

	<p>(1) Background: Neurodynamic tests are recommended for the diagnosis of entrapment neuropathies such as carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). However, their association with clinical variables in severe patients or patients with associated comorbidities is poorly documented. This study aims to analyze the association between the mechanosensitivity of the median nerve and symptoms, function and psycho-social variables in moderate and severe carpal tunnel syndrome patients with comorbidities; (2) Methods: Correlational study. In total, 42 pre-surgical patients (24 females; 59.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.7 years) included in the Spanish Public Healthcare System with an electrodiagnostic of CTS were selected. Sociodemographic variables and clinical features (symptoms, function, sensitivity and quality of life evaluated with the 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36) and the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-sleep) were recorded. Upper Limb Neurodynamic Test 1 was used to evaluate neural mechanosensitivity; (3) Results: The 81% had a severe CTS and 78.6% had some comorbidity. The average time from the first medical visit to the surgeon&amp;amp;rsquo;s visit was 365.5 days. Median nerve mechanosensitivity correlated weakly with the SF-36 subscale, General Health, (Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s rho = 0.367) and MOS sleep scale, Awaken Short of Breath or with headache dimension (Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s rho = &amp;amp;minus;0.353) and moderately with SF-36 subscale, Social Functioning (Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s rho = 0.553); (4) Conclusions: No associations were observed for median nerve mechanosensitivity, except for quality of life and sleep. Both social determinants and clinical variables should be considered when examining and treating these patients.</p>

	<p>Post-stroke cognitive impairment is a common and disabling condition with few effective therapeutic options. After stroke, neural reorganization and other neuroplastic processes occur in response to ischemic injury, which can result in clinical improvement through spontaneous recovery. Neuromodulation through transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising intervention to augment underlying neuroplasticity in order to improve cognitive function. This form of neuromodulation leverages mechanisms of neuroplasticity post-stroke to optimize neural reorganization and improve function. In this review, we summarize the current state of cognitive neurorehabilitation post-stroke, the practical features of tDCS, its uses in stroke-related cognitive impairment across cognitive domains, and special considerations for the use of tDCS in the post-stroke patient population.</p>

	<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the cerebrovascular disease with the highest disability and mortality rates, causing severe damage to the health of patients and imposing a significant socioeconomic burden. Aging stands as a foremost risk factor for ICH, with a significant escalation in ICH incidence within the elderly demographic, highlighting a close association between ICH and aging. In recent years, with the acceleration of the &amp;amp;ldquo;aging society&amp;amp;rdquo; trend, exploring the intricate relationship between aging and ICH has become increasingly urgent and worthy of in-depth attention. We have summarized the characteristics of ICH in the elderly, reviewing how aging influences the onset and development of ICH by examining its etiology and the mechanisms of damage via ICH. Additionally, we explored the potential impacts of ICH on accelerated aging, including its effects on cognitive abilities, quality of life, and lifespan. This review aims to reveal the connection between aging and ICH, providing new ideas and insights for future ICH research.</p>

	<p> Cerebral intraparenchymal hemorrhage due to electrode implantation (CIPHEI) is a rare but serious complication of deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. This study retrospectively investigated a large single-center cohort of DBS implantations to calculate the frequency of CIPHEI and identify patient- and procedure-related risk factors for CIPHEI and their potential interactions. We analyzed all DBS implantations between January 2013 and December 2021 in a generalized linear model for binomial responses using bias reduction to account for sparse sampling of CIPHEIs. As potential risk factors, we considered age, gender, history of arterial hypertension, level of invasivity, types of micro/macroelectrodes, and implanted DBS electrodes. If available, postoperative coagulation and platelet function were exploratorily assessed in CIPHEI patients. We identified 17 CIPHEI cases across 839 electrode implantations in 435 included procedures in 418 patients (3.9%). Exploration and cross-validation analyses revealed that the three-way interaction of older age (above 60 years), high invasivity (i.e., use of combined micro/macroelectrodes), and implantation of directional DBS electrodes accounted for 82.4% of the CIPHEI cases. Acquired platelet dysfunction was present only in one CIPHEI case. The findings at our center suggested implantation of directional DBS electrodes as a new potential risk factor, while known risks of older age and high invasivity were confirmed. However, CIPHEI risk is not driven by the three factors alone but by their combined presence. The contributions of the three factors to CIPHEI are hence not independent, suggesting that potentially modifiable procedural risks should be carefully evaluated when planning DBS surgery in patients at risk.</p>

	<p>Correct classification of irritability is extremely important to assess prognosis and treatment indications of juvenile mood disorders. We assessed factors associated with low versus high parent- and self-rated irritability using the affective reactivity index (ARI) in a sample of 289 adolescents diagnosed with a bipolar or a major depressive disorder. Bivariate analyses were followed by multilinear logistic regression model. Factors significantly and independently associated with high versus low parent-rated ARI score were: more severe emotional dysregulation and bipolar disorders diagnosis. Factors significantly and independently associated with high versus low self-rated ARI score were: lower children depression rating scale (CDRS-R) difficulty of having fun item score, greater children depression inventory (CDI-2) self-report score, more severe emotional dysregulation, and greater CDRS-R appetite disturbance item score. High parent-rated irritability was strictly related with a bipolar disorder diagnosis, whereas high youth-rated irritability was related to depressive phenotype characterized by appetite/food-intake dysregulation, mood lability, and less anhedonia and apathy.</p>

                <p>The paralaminar nucleus of the amygdala (PL) comprises neurons that exhibit delayed maturation. PL neurons are born during gestation but mature during adolescent ages, differentiating into excitatory neurons. These late-maturing PL neurons contribute to the increase in size and cell number of the amygdala between birth and adulthood. However, the function of the PL upon maturation is unknown, as the region has only recently begun to be characterized in detail. In this study, we investigated key defining features of the adult mouse PL; the intrinsic morpho-electric properties of its neurons, and its input and output circuit connectivity. We identify two subtypes of excitatory neurons in the PL based on unsupervised clustering of electrophysiological properties. These subtypes are defined by differential action potential firing properties and dendritic architecture, suggesting divergent functional roles. We further uncover major axonal inputs to the adult PL from the main olfactory network and basolateral amygdala. We also find that axonal outputs from the PL project reciprocally to these inputs and to diverse targets including the amygdala, frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. Thus, the adult mouse PL is centrally placed to play a major role in the integration of olfactory sensory information, to coordinate affective and autonomic behavioral responses to salient odor stimuli.</p>

                <p>The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a hub of diverse afferent and efferent projections thought to be involved in associative learning. RSC shows early pathology in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which impairs associative learning. To understand and develop therapies for diseases such as AD, animal models are essential. Given the importance of human RSC in object-location associative learning and the success of object-location associative paradigms in human studies and in the clinic, it would be of considerable value to establish a translational model of object-location learning for the rodent. For this reason, we sought to test the role of RSC in object-location learning in male rats using the object-location paired-associates learning (PAL) touchscreen task. First, increased cFos immunoreactivity was observed in granular RSC following PAL training when compared with extended pretraining controls. Following this, RSC lesions following PAL acquisition were used to explore the necessity of the RSC in object-location associative learning and memory and two tasks involving only one modality: trial-unique nonmatching-to-location for spatial working memory and pairwise visual discrimination/reversal. RSC lesions impaired both memory for learned paired-associates and learning of new object-location associations but did not affect performance in either the spatial or visual single-modality tasks. These findings provide evidence that RSC is necessary for object-location learning and less so for learning and memory involving the individual modalities therein.</p>

                Introduction Gastroparesis is a condition characterized by the accumulation of bile salts. It is prevalent globally, with a global prevalence of 0.9% and 1.3% in individuals with diabetes. New techniques for diagnosing gastroparesis, such as bile salt titration and nitric oxide sulfate, can improve patient care. However, simptomatic control is needed to increase gastric salts, reduce inflammation, and control potential diseases. Gastroparesis can cause complications like weight loss, malnutrition, and gastrointestinal changes that cannot be predicted. Neurological techniques like gyroscope stimulation and endoscopy (G-POEM) can help diagnose refractive gastroparesis. Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial in addressing gastroparesis issues, and bibliometric research is essential for finding effective new treatments. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords neuroaid. Data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results The research trend found are documents by year, most relevant sources, factorial map of the most cited documents, factorial map of The documents with the highest contributes, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by subject area, documents by affiliation, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, cluster analysis, topic dendogram, and country collaboration map. Conclusions The study on gastroparesis identifies key themes such as diet modification, glucose control, and medication therapy. It also discusses the role of Cajal in smooth muscle concentration, common causes of gastroparesis, and transcutaneous stimulation. The study also explores motorcycle themes, such as the vagus nerve, and emerging themes like devices and electronics. Basic themes include gastrointestinal disorders, neuromodulation, patients, diabetes, and gastric electrical stimulation. Management involves multidisciplinary approaches, lifestyle changes, medication therapy, and bedtime interventions.

                Background This study aims to gain insight into the effect of banks’ financial performance on their market performance. We conceptualized the research subject on the assumption that the financial performance of an organization is the most important criterion for triggering movement in its stock price. We explored various models and parameters to evaluate financial performance of banks and found CAMELS being one of the most comprehensive and appropriate model. We considered share price growth of banks to measure their stock market performance Methods We collected financial and stock market data pertaining to 32 listed Indian banks for the period 2018 to 2022. The study has employed multiple linear regression analysis of panel data for evaluating the relationship between independent and dependent variables. We adopted panel regression for data analysis and used the Prais- Winsten regression with panel corrected standard errors, as the data suffers from contemporaneous cross-sectional correlation. Results The results show that net non-performing assets, net interest margins, and return on capital have a significant negative impact on share price growth. The capital adequacy ratio and the current and savings account deposit ratios have a positive insignificant impact. The liquid asset-to-total asset ratio has a negative, insignificant impact. The coefficient of determination indicates that the share price growth of banks is more dependent on other factors which are not included in the regression analysis of this study. Conclusion This study helps investors and bankers understand the limited impact of financial parameters on banks’stock prices and to look for other parameters which explain the stock price movement better.

                Background This study focused on evaluating the diversity and richness of the edaphic macrofauna in eight banana farms in the western zone of Nicaragua. Methods The sampling design was random and descriptive, it was divided into two phases, the first was the collection of the sample, and the second was the classification, coding, and storage of the extracted macrofauna populations. The sampling method employed included the extraction of soil and litter samples. Soil samples were collected using a wooden frame (monolith), with each sample weighing approximately 1 kilogram and taken from a depth of 0.20 cm. Litter samples were collected from the soil surface. A total of 80 samples were collected, with 40 soil samples and 50 litter samples obtained across the 8 plantain farms. Results The results showed that the relative abundance of biodiversity was higher in the 0–20 cm soil depth stratum than in the branch and leaf biomass strata. The values of the diversity indices of Simpson's Dominance, Shanon, Margalef, and Equity were in the normal range, with a tendency towards low diversity. Likewise, in the richness of species, the Dominance or most abundant genus were earthworms (Oligochaeta) and Hymenoptera (Solenopsis, Leptothorax, Camponotus, Pheidole), indicating the directly proportional relationship, that is to say, that the greater the number of earthworms the production increases and the greater the number of Hymenoptera it decreases, confirmed with the Pearson correlation coefficient with a reliability of 95%. Conclusions It was concluded that based on the estimates of the diversity indicators, two detritivore genus (earthworms and Hymenoptera) were the ones with the more dominance, being important in the production of the banana agrosystem due to the decomposition of organic matter and its nutritional contribution to the plant. We observed a direct correlation with earthworms and an indirect relationship with Hymenoptera.

                Background Sustaining a ‘fit-for-purpose’ health workforce requires a better understanding of the health care worker cadres that are affected during pandemics and their outcomes. In hospitalized health care workers with confirmed COVID-19 between March 2020 and May 2023 in Liberia, we determined the hospitalization and case fatality rates, type of health care worker cadres affected, their demographic and clinical characteristics and hospital exit outcomes. Methods This was a cohort study using routine data extracted from hospitalization forms for health care workers in 24 designated COVID-19 treatment facilities in Liberia. Results Of the 424 health care workers with COVID-19, hospitalization rates progressively declined between 2020 and 2023, with the highest rates in 2020 (24/1,000 health care workers) and 2021 (14/1,000 health care workers). Case fatality was 2% in both 2020 and 2021 with no deaths thereafter. Among those hospitalized, the highest proportions were nursing cadres with 191(45%), physicians with 63 (15%) and laboratory technicians with 42 (10%). The most frequent reported site for COVID-19 infection was the health facility (326, 89%). COVID-19 vaccination coverage in health care workers was 20%. The majority (91%) of hospitalizations were for mild symptomatic infections. Even in referral centres (n-52), 18 (35%) were for mild infections. Of the 424 who were hospitalized, 412 (97%) recovered, 9 (2%) died and 3 (1%) either left against medical advice or absconded. Of the nine deaths, none were vaccinated, seven had moderate-to-severe disease but were not referred to specialized COVID-19 treatment centers. Conclusions The hospitalized health care workers for COVID-19 were predominantly clinical and laboratory personnel who were mostly unvaccinated, and health facilities were hot-spots for contracting infections. The triage and referral system was weak with unnecessary hospitalization of mild infections. This study provides useful insights for outbreak preparedness including priority vaccination and improving health care worker safety in Liberia.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic placed immense strain on global health systems and healthcare workers (HCWs). This study aimed to analyze the epidemiological profiles and outcomes of HCWs hospitalized for COVID-19 across five sub-Saharan African countries. Methods This was a cohort study using secondary data collected between January 30, 2020, and December 31, 2022, as part of the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium study. The study population consisted of HCWs who were hospitalized due to clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Demographic and clinical characteristics and case management were summarized using proportions or medians and interquartile ranges. Factors associated with risk of mortality among HCWs were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for age and sex. Results Findings showed that South Africa recorded a lower percentage (2.4%) of patients who were HCWs compared to Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, and Malawi. Overall, many HCWs were aged ≥50 years and the majority were females (66.8%). In three of the five countries, however, the majority of the HCWs were <39 years old and were males. Antibiotics were the most commonly used medical treatments across three countries (Ghana, 67.8%; Guinea, 97.3%; Malawi, 80%), while antimalarials were commonly used in Guinea (87.8%) and Ghana (30.4%). Guinea and South Africa reported deaths with case-fatality rates varying from 22% in March 2020 to 1.4% in February 2022. Risk factors for mortality included age over 50 years, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. Conclusions Our study underscores the critical need for continuous protection and enhanced readiness for HCWs, particularly during epidemics and pandemics. Strengthening infection prevention and control measures and focusing on vulnerable groups such as older and female HCWs are essential for mitigating the impact of future health crises. Further research is required to fully comprehend the implications of these findings.

                Background Sustainability in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which engage heavily in manufacturing provides them with an essential platform for implementing environmental strategy, which is aimed at reducing environmental damage and promoting environmental protection. This study aims to examine the impact of the reduction in resource use, the greening of processes and products on environmental strategy and the mediating role of green employee behaviour. Methods Primary data gathered with the help of questionnaires from employees of SMEs manufacturing in developing countries, Pakistan. The research gathered data from 211 participants by applying a pre-tested instrumental questionnaire and structural equation modelling (SEM) for data analysis. Results The results confirmed all direct effects, including a reduction in resource use, the greening of processes and products and green employee behaviour of environmental strategies in small and medium manufacturing firms. Also, confirmed partial mediation effect of green employee behavior between greening of processes and products and environmental strategy. Conclusion The current study clearly showed the need for programs and infrastructures that support resource reduction and greening businesses in SMEs. Companies’ implementation of green processes and technologies allows SMEs to take an environmentally responsible stand and become part of the movement toward sustainability. The research stresses the importance of green employee conduct as a mediator, the central point being the individual employee being engaged and aware of the subject and willing to participate in environmentally friendly practices. Therefore, small and medium enterprises should enlighten their staff to practice green behaviour, give them what they need and empower them to be change drivers that will trigger sustainability throughout the organisations.

                Background Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women worldwide and is a well-known cause for cancer mortality in females. COX-2 (cyclooxygenase) plays a vital role in development of some human cancers such as lung, colon and breast. It is a potent enzyme that is important for the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. These prostaglandins mediate cellular proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis which contributes to carcinogenesis. Overexpression of COX-2 has been detected in several malignancies including breast cancer. COX-2 overexpression is regarded as a poor prognostic marker of breast cancer. The present study will aim to study the immunohistochemical expression of COX-2 in breast cancer and compare it with known histopathological parameters thus assessing its prognostic value. Methods This will be an observational study conducted in the Department of Pathology, JNMC, Wardha (Sawangi). Radical mastectomy specimens will be studied for COX-2 expression by immunohistochemistry in patients diagnosed with breast carcinoma. COX-2 expression will be quantified as immunohistochemical score and results will be correlated with various histopathological parameters. Results The expected result of our study will suggest an association of COX-2 expression to the factors associated with poor prognosis in breast carcinoma. A positive correlation is expected between larger tumor size, positive lymph node status, higher T stage and N stage and lymphovascular invasion. Conclusions Conclusions will be drawn from the obtained results of the immunohistochemical study by using COX-2- for detection of overexpression of COX-2 when evaluated with TNM staging, histological grading and molecular types of breast cancer.

                Background The apple peel is one of the byproducts of apple beverage production that is still underutilized. While considerable information regarding apple peel extract is available, its utilization remains limited. Yet, apple peel contains numerous bioactive components that offer various health benefits. Based on this, information regarding the bioactive components in apple peel and their health potential is required. Methods The research consisted of two stages, namely Stage 1, which involved in silico analysis of the bioactive content in apples and predicted the potential of ant nests using the Structural Activity Relationship (SAR) approach Pass Online. In Stage 2, in vitro analysis of apple peel extraction as a natural antioxidant source was conducted using treatment time radiation (3 minutes, 6 minutes, 9 minutes, and 12 minutes). The extract was characterized based on phenolic, flavonoid, antioxidant activity, quercetin, and functional groups using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Results Stage 1: gave results that several bioactive were identified such as chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, phloridzin, catechin, hyperoside, quercitrin, quercetin, and pectin. Based on SAR, the bioactive compounds have functional potential as anti-inflammatory, lipid metabolism regulators, free radical scavengers, lipid peroxidase inhibitors, antihypercholesterolemic, and insulin promoters. Stage 2: Radiation times of the MAE method had a significant effect (P<0.05) on the phenolic content, and antioxidant activity and was highly significant (P<0.01) on the flavonoid content of Malus sylvestris. Radiation time for 12 minutes of MAE gave higher phenolic, flavonoid, and antioxidant activity of Malus sylvestris peel extract. The IR spectra of the Malus sylvestris extract increased as the radiation time increased. Conclusions The optimum radiation time was at 12 minutes with the result of phenolic content at 14.73 mg GAE/g, flavonoid content at 29,62 ppm, antioxidant activity at 95,09%, and the IR spectra at 1031.92 cm−1, 1390.68 cm−1, 2833.43 cm−1, 2945.3 cm−1, 3346.5 cm−1, 3354.21 cm−1.

                Background: Contributing factors for improved survival of human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (h-AMSCs) cultured through hypoxia preconditioning, in example apoptosis inhibition involving BCL2 and HSP27 expression, trigger signal expression (VEGF), SCF expression, OCT-4 expression, and CD44+ expression. The objective if this study was to explain the mechanism and role of hypoxic preconditioning and the optimal duration of hypoxic preconditioning exposure to improve survival of h-AMSCs. Methods: An experimental laboratory explorative study (in vitro) with hypoxic preconditioning in h-AMSCs cultures. This research was conducted through four stages. First, isolation of h-AMSCs culture from adipose tissue of patients. Second, the characterization of h-AMSCs from adipose tissue by phenotype (flowcytometry) through CD44+, CD90+ and CD45-expression before being pre-conditioned for hypoxic treatment. Third, the hypoxic preconditioning in h-AMSCs culture (in vitro) was performed with an oxygen concentration of 1% for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Fourth, observation of survival from h-AMSCs culture was tested on the role of CD44+, VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, BCL2, HSP27 with Flowcytometry and apoptotic inhibition by Tunnel Assay method. Results: The result of regression test showed that time difference had an effect on VEGF expression (p<0.001;β=-0.482) and hypoxia condition also influenced VEGF expression (p<0.001;β=0.774). The result of path analysis showed that SCF had effect on OCT-4 expression (p<0.001; β=0.985). The regression test results showed that time effects on HSP27 expression (p<0.001; β=0.398) and hypoxia precondition also affects HSP27 expression (p<0.001; β=0.847). Pathway analysis showed that BCL2 expression inhibited apoptosis (p=0.030; β=-0.442) and HSP27 expression also inhibited apoptosis (p<0,001;β=-0.487). Conclusion: Hypoxic preconditioning of h-AMSC culture has proven to increase the expression of VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, and BCL2 and HSP27. This study demonstrated and explained the existence of a new mechanism of increased h-AMSC survival in cultures with hypoxic preconditioning (O2 1%) via VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, BCL2, and HSP 27.

                Background: NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 are members of the neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinases (NTRK) family, which encode TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC receptors, respectively. Hematologic cancers are also linked to point mutations in the NTRK gene's kinase domain. Trk fusions are the most common genetic change associated with oncogenic activity in Trk-driven liquid tumors. Thus, point mutations in NTRK genes may also play a role in tumorigenesis. The structural and functional effect of mutations in Trk-B & Trk-C proteins remains unclear. Methods: In this research, Homology (threading-based approach) modeling and the all-atom molecular dynamics simulations approaches are applied to examine the structural and functional behavior of native and mutant Trk-B and Trk-C proteins at the molecular level. Results: The result of this study reveals how the mutations in Trk-B (A203T & R458G) and Trk-C (E176D & L449F) proteins lost their stability and native conformations. The Trk-B mutant A203T became more flexible than the native protein, whereas the R458G mutation became more rigid than the native conformation of the Trk-B protein. Also, the Trk-C mutations (E176D & L449F) become more rigid compared to the native structure. Conclusions: This structural transition may interrupt the function of Trk-B and Trk-C proteins. Observing the impact of NTRK-2/3 gene alterations at the atomic level could aid in discovering a viable treatment for Trk-related leukemias.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-651/v1?src=rss">Public perception of wireless power transfer safety [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology has changed how energy is distributed, allowing power to be transmitted without using wires. Despite being used in devices like cell phones, electric cars, and medical devices; people are worried about the safety and health effects of wireless power transfer. Methods Here this concern research work has used a survey method to gather information from a diverse group of people, focusing on various demographic factors and educational aspects. The research has analysed the knowledge of people regarding the application of wireless power transfer (WPT) technology. Further it has accumulated the safety aspects of using it in public or private places. However, the concerns of propel perspectives basing on their age, gender or other factors about safety of WPT is inducted within this survey. Results the finding from the survey within this research has demonstrated that many people are not much aware of WPT technologies, and some are worried about safety aspects of this concern technology within public places. From this result it has been seen that groups considering the age, education and gender has different perspective regarding the application and safety of WPT. The results have shown that people need to be taught more about it and to be made more aware of it. In addition, survey has showed that about 38% of respondent has some concerns about WPT technologies, which means that a significant number of people know about it. Conclusions From this analysis it has been interpreted that it is important to talk about safety worries and false facts about WPT. This concern paper has the potential to develop awareness about this technology. However, it is expected that future studies should look at more types of people and explore their personal experiences to figure out why people have different opinions about WPT.

Alpha oscillations play a vital role in managing the brain’s resources, inhibiting neural activity as a function of their phase and amplitude, and are changed in many brain disorders. Developing minimally invasive tools to modulate alpha activity and identifying the parameters that determine its response to exogenous modulators is essential for the implementation of focussed interventions. We introduce Alpha Closed-Loop Auditory Stimulation (αCLAS) as an EEG-based method to modulate and investigate these brain rhythms in humans with specificity and selectivity, using targeted auditory stimulation. Across a series of independent experiments, we demonstrate that αCLAS alters alpha power, frequency, and connectivity in a phase, amplitude, and topography-dependent manner. Using single-pulse-αCLAS, we show that the effects of auditory stimuli on alpha oscillations can be explained within the theoretical framework of oscillator theory and a phase-reset mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate the functional relevance of our approach by showing that αCLAS can interfere with sleep onset dynamics in a phase-dependent manner.

                Background This work was focused on measuring environmental inefficiency in Mexican dairy farms, considering climate change variables related to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) and planetary geomagnetic activity. Methods The applied methodology measures the eco-efficiency of Mexican dairy farms using the empirical application of a stochastic frontier model of the bioeconomy. The productive sector of the bioeconomy studied was the eco-intensification of the livestock production system (dairies). The environmental inefficiency effect was assumed to be a distribution-independent truncation of a normal distribution with constant variance, while the mean was a linear environmental function of the observable variable. Results The results showed that the coefficients of the frontier model were highly significant, highlighting the investment in livestock (50%). The inefficiency model had an impact on climate variation with greenhouse gas emissions CH4 (1.96%). The results of the environmental technical efficiency in geometric average were 81.28%. The producers that reached the border with a technical efficiency equal to 1 are the references for the rest, marking the relative technical efficiency. Conclusions It was concluded that the coefficients in the model were very significant, showing the level of investment in livestock (50%). The low-performance model estimates the impact of climate change on GHG emissions CH4 (1.96%) explaining the trend of increasing GHG emissions, keeping in view that the management of food and cattle during the study period were affected by summer feeding, which allowed considering the activity of GHG emissions. According to the results, the geometric mean environmental performance of engineering is 81.28%.

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6ce62caa-4181-41c8-ad51-6f7017d48ac1/ana27008-toc-0001-m.png"
     alt="Head-to-Head Comparison of Tau and Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography Visual Reads for Differential Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Disorders: An International, Multicenter Study"/>
<p>Accuracy of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is compared between amyloid-PET visual reads and tau-PET visual reads with either medial temporal lobe binding (tau-MTL+) or with posterolateral temporal or extra-temporal cortical binding (tau-CTX+) as the minimum threshold for an AD tau positive scan. Amyloid- and tau-PET visual reads have similar sensitivity and specificity for detecting AD in cognitively impaired participants. Tau-CTX+ increases specificity for AD, but with significant loss of sensitivity for mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-AD). Tau-MTL+ increases sensitivity for AD, but there is lower specificity for MCI-AD.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We compared the accuracy of amyloid and [<sup>18</sup>F]Flortaucipir (FTP) tau positron emission tomography (PET) visual reads for distinguishing patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia with fluid biomarker support of Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants with FTP-PET, amyloid-PET, and diagnosis of dementia-AD (n = 102), MCI-AD (n = 41), non-AD diseases (n = 76), and controls (n = 20) were included. AD status was determined independent of PET by cerebrospinal fluid or plasma biomarkers. The mean age was 66.9 years, and 44.8% were women. Three readers interpreted scans blindly and independently. Amyloid-PET was classified as positive/negative using tracer-specific criteria. FTP-PET was classified as positive with medial temporal lobe (MTL) binding as the minimum uptake indicating AD tau (tau-MTL+), positive with posterolateral temporal or extratemporal cortical binding in an AD-like pattern (tau-CTX+), or negative. The majority of scan interpretations were used to calculate diagnostic accuracy of visual reads in detecting MCI/dementia with fluid biomarker support for AD (MCI/dementia-AD).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Sensitivity of amyloid-PET for MCI/dementia-AD was 95.8% (95% confidence interval 91.1–98.4%), which was comparable to tau-CTX+ 92.3% (86.7–96.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.67) and tau-MTL+ 97.2% (93.0–99.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.27). Specificity of amyloid-PET for biomarker-negative healthy and disease controls was 84.4% (75.5–91.0%), which was like tau-CTX+ 88.5% (80.4–94.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.34), and trended toward being higher than tau-MTL+ 75.0% (65.1–83.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.08). Tau-CTX+ had higher specificity than tau-MTL+ (<i>p</i> = 0.0002), but sensitivity was lower (<i>p</i> = 0.02), driven by decreased sensitivity for MCI-AD (80.5% [65.1–91.2] vs. 95.1% [83.5–99.4], <i>p</i> = 0.03).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Amyloid- and tau-PET visual reads have similar sensitivity/specificity for detecting AD in cognitively impaired patients. Visual tau-PET interpretations requiring cortical binding outside MTL increase specificity, but lower sensitivity for MCI-AD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27005?af=R">Cerebral Glucose Metabolism Is a Valuable Predictor of Survival in Patients with Lewy Body Diseases</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Patients with Lewy body diseases have an increased risk of dementia, which is a significant predictor for survival. Posterior cortical hypometabolism on [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) precedes the development of dementia by years. We therefore examined the prognostic value of cerebral glucose metabolism for survival.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkinson's disease with dementia, or dementia with Lewy bodies who underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET. Regional cerebral metabolism of each patient was analyzed by determining the expression of the PD-related cognitive pattern (<i>Z</i>-score) and by visual PET rating. We analyzed the predictive value of PET for overall survival using Cox regression analyses (age- and sex-corrected) and calculated prognostic indices for the best model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Glucose metabolism was a significant predictor of survival in 259 included patients (n = 118 events; hazard ratio: 1.4 [1.2–1.6] per <i>Z</i>-score; hazard ratio: 1.8 [1.5–2.2] per visual PET rating score; both <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Risk stratification with visual PET rating scores yielded a median survival of 4.8, 6.8, and 12.9 years for patients with severe, moderate, and mild posterior cortical hypometabolism (median survival not reached for normal cortical metabolism). Stratification into 5 groups based on the prognostic index revealed 10-year survival rates of 94.1%, 78.3%, 34.7%, 0.0%, and 0.0%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Regional cerebral glucose metabolism is a significant predictor of survival in Lewy body diseases and may allow an earlier survival prediction than the clinical milestone “dementia.” Thus, [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET may improve the basis for therapy decisions, especially for invasive therapeutic procedures like deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether plasma phosphorylated-Tau181 (pTau181) could be used as a diagnostic biomarker of concurrent Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) or amyloidosis alone, as well as a prognostic, monitoring, and susceptibility/risk biomarker for clinical outcomes in Lewy body disease (LBD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 565 participants: 94 LBD with normal cognition, 83 LBD with abnormal cognition, 114 with Alzheimer's disease, and 274 cognitively normal. Plasma pTau181 levels were measured with the Lumipulse <i>G</i> platform. Diagnostic accuracy for concurrent ADNC and amyloidosis was assessed with Receiver Operating Characteristic curves in a subset of participants with CSF pTau181/Aβ42, and CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 or amyloid-β PET, respectively. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine the associations between baseline and longitudinal plasma pTau181 levels and clinical outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Plasma pTau181 predicted concurrent ADNC and amyloidosis in LBD with abnormal cognition with 87% and 72% accuracy, respectively. In LBD patients with abnormal cognition, higher baseline plasma pTau181 was associated with worse baseline MoCA and CDR-SB, as well as accelerated decline in CDR-SB. Additionally, in this group, rapid increases in plasma pTau181 over 3 years predicted a faster decline in CDR-SB and memory. In LBD patients with normal cognition, there was no association between baseline or longitudinal plasma pTau181 levels and clinical outcomes; however, elevated pTau181 at baseline increased the risk of conversion to cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that plasma pTau181 is a promising biomarker for concurrent ADNC and amyloidosis in LBD. Furthermore, plasma pTau181 holds potential as a prognostic, monitoring, and susceptibility/risk biomarker, predicting disease progression in LBD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                While many core biological processes are conserved across species, the human brain has evolved with unique capacities. Current understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms that endow human traits as well as associated vulnerabilities remains limited. However, emerging data have illuminated species divergence in DNA elements and genome organization, in molecular, morphological, and functional features of conserved neural cell types, as well as temporal differences in brain development. Here, we summarize recent data on unique features of the human brain and their complex implications for the study and treatment of brain diseases. We also consider key outstanding questions in the field and discuss the technologies and foundational knowledge that will be required to accelerate understanding of human neurobiology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89712">Fine-tuning spatial-temporal dynamics and surface receptor expression support plasma cell-intrinsic longevity</a></h4>

              
                Durable serological memory following vaccination is critically dependent on the production and survival of long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). Yet, the factors that control LLPC specification and survival remain poorly resolved. Using intravital two-photon imaging, we find that in contrast to most plasma cells (PCs) in the bone marrow (BM), LLPCs are uniquely sessile and organized into clusters that are dependent on APRIL, an important survival factor. Using deep, bulk RNA sequencing, and surface protein flow-based phenotyping, we find that LLPCs express a unique transcriptome and phenotype compared to bulk PCs, fine-tuning expression of key cell surface molecules, CD93, CD81, CXCR4, CD326, CD44, and CD48, important for adhesion and homing. Conditional deletion of <i>Cxcr4</i> in PCs following immunization leads to rapid mobilization from the BM, reduced survival of antigen-specific PCs, and ultimately accelerated decay of antibody titer. In naïve mice, the endogenous LLPCs BCR repertoire exhibits reduced diversity, reduced somatic mutations, and increased public clones and IgM isotypes, particularly in young mice, suggesting LLPC specification is non-random. As mice age, the BM PC compartment becomes enriched in LLPCs, which may outcompete and limit entry of new PCs into the LLPC niche and pool.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95814">Structural analysis of the dynamic ribosome-translocon complex</a></h4>

              
                The protein translocon at the endoplasmic reticulum comprises the Sec61 translocation channel and numerous accessory factors that collectively facilitate the biogenesis of secretory and membrane proteins. Here, we leveraged recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and structure prediction to derive insights into several novel configurations of the ribosome-translocon complex. We show how a transmembrane domain (TMD) in a looped configuration passes through the Sec61 lateral gate during membrane insertion; how a nascent chain can bind and constrain the conformation of ribosomal protein uL22; and how the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex can adjust its position during different stages of protein biogenesis. Most unexpectedly, we find that a large proportion of translocon complexes contains RAMP4 intercalated into Sec61’s lateral gate, widening Sec61’s central pore and contributing to its hydrophilic interior. These structures lead to mechanistic hypotheses for translocon function and highlight a remarkably plastic machinery whose conformations and composition adjust dynamically to its diverse range of substrates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96138">Structural features of heteromeric channels composed of CALHM2 and CALHM4 paralogs</a></h4>

              
                The CALHM proteins constitute a family of large pore channels that contains six closely related paralogs in humans. Two family members, CALHM1 and 3, have been associated with the release of ATP during taste sensation. Both proteins form heteromeric channels that activate at positive potential and decreased extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Although the structures of several family members displayed large oligomeric organizations of different size, their function has in most cases remained elusive. Our previous study has identified the paralogs CALHM2, 4 and, 6 to be highly expressed in the placenta and defined their structural properties as membrane proteins exhibiting features of large pore channels with unknown activation properties (Drożdżyk et al., 2020). Here, we investigated whether these placental paralogs would form heteromers and characterized heteromeric complexes consisting of CALHM2 and CALHM4 subunits using specific binders as fiducial markers. Both proteins assemble with different stoichiometries with the largest population containing CALHM2 as the predominant component. In these oligomers, the subunits segregate and reside in their preferred conformation found in homomeric channels. Our study has thus revealed the properties that govern the formation of CALHM heteromers in a process of potential relevance in a cellular context.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95980">Tribbles1 is host protective during in vivo mycobacterial infection</a></h4>

              
                Tuberculosis is a major global health problem and is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. There is a pressing need for new treatments that circumvent emerging antibiotic resistance. <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> parasitises macrophages, reprogramming them to establish a niche in which to proliferate, therefore macrophage manipulation is a potential host-directed therapy if druggable molecular targets could be identified. The pseudokinase Tribbles1 (Trib1) regulates multiple innate immune processes and inflammatory profiles making it a potential drug target in infections. Trib1 controls macrophage function, cytokine production, and macrophage polarisation. Despite wide-ranging effects on leukocyte biology, data exploring the roles of Tribbles in infection in vivo are limited. Here, we identify that human Tribbles1 is expressed in monocytes and is upregulated at the transcript level after stimulation with mycobacterial antigen. To investigate the mechanistic roles of Tribbles in the host response to mycobacteria in vivo, we used a zebrafish <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i> (Mm) infection tuberculosis model. Zebrafish Tribbles family members were characterised and shown to have substantial mRNA and protein sequence homology to their human orthologues. <i>trib1</i> overexpression was host-protective against Mm infection, reducing burden by approximately 50%. Conversely, <i>trib1</i> knockdown/knockout exhibited increased infection. Mechanistically, <i>trib1</i> overexpression significantly increased the levels of proinflammatory factors <i>il-1β</i> and nitric oxide. The host-protective effect of <i>trib1</i> was found to be dependent on the E3 ubiquitin kinase Cop1. These findings highlight the importance of Trib1 and Cop1 as immune regulators during infection in vivo and suggest that enhancing macrophage TRIB1 levels may provide a tractable therapeutic intervention to improve bacterial infection outcomes in tuberculosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87912">A dual function of the IDA peptide in regulating cell separation and modulating plant immunity at the molecular level</a></h4>

              
                The abscission of floral organs and emergence of lateral roots in <i>Arabidopsis</i> is regulated by the peptide ligand inflorescence deficient in abscission (IDA) and the receptor protein kinases HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-like 2 (HSL2). During these cell separation processes, the plant induces defense-associated genes to protect against pathogen invasion. However, the molecular coordination between abscission and immunity has not been thoroughly explored. Here, we show that IDA induces a release of cytosolic calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and apoplastic production of reactive oxygen species, which are signatures of early defense responses. In addition, we find that IDA promotes late defense responses by the transcriptional upregulation of genes known to be involved in immunity. When comparing the IDA induced early immune responses to known immune responses, such as those elicited by flagellin22 treatment, we observe both similarities and differences. We propose a molecular mechanism by which IDA promotes signatures of an immune response in cells destined for separation to guard them from pathogen attack.

                The DNA damage response is critical for maintaining genome integrity and is commonly disrupted in the development of cancer. PPM1D (protein phosphatase Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent 1D) is a master negative regulator of the response; gain-of-function mutations and amplifications of <i>PPM1D</i> are found across several human cancers making it a relevant pharmacological target. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 screening to identify synthetic-lethal dependencies of <i>PPM1D,</i> uncovering superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) as a potential target for <i>PPM1D</i>-mutant cells. We revealed a dysregulated redox landscape characterized by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and a compromised response to oxidative stress in <i>PPM1D</i>-mutant cells. Altogether, our results demonstrate a role for SOD1 in the survival of <i>PPM1D</i>-mutant leukemia cells and highlight a new potential therapeutic strategy against <i>PPM1D</i>-mutant cancers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89794">Diffusive lensing as a mechanism of intracellular transport and compartmentalization</a></h4>

              
                While inhomogeneous diffusivity has been identified as a ubiquitous feature of the cellular interior, its implications for particle mobility and concentration at different length scales remain largely unexplored. In this work, we use agent-based simulations of diffusion to investigate how heterogeneous diffusivity affects the movement and concentration of diffusing particles. We propose that a nonequilibrium mode of membrane-less compartmentalization arising from the convergence of diffusive trajectories into low-diffusive sinks, which we call ‘diffusive lensing,’ is relevant for living systems. Our work highlights the phenomenon of diffusive lensing as a potentially key driver of mesoscale dynamics in the cytoplasm, with possible far-reaching implications for biochemical processes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91597">Optimal transport for automatic alignment of untargeted metabolomic data</a></h4>

              
                Untargeted metabolomic profiling through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) measures a vast array of metabolites within biospecimens, advancing drug development, disease diagnosis, and risk prediction. However, the low throughput of LC-MS poses a major challenge for biomarker discovery, annotation, and experimental comparison, necessitating the merging of multiple datasets. Current data pooling methods encounter practical limitations due to their vulnerability to data variations and hyperparameter dependence. Here, we introduce GromovMatcher, a flexible and user-friendly algorithm that automatically combines LC-MS datasets using optimal transport. By capitalizing on feature intensity correlation structures, GromovMatcher delivers superior alignment accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches. This algorithm scales to thousands of features requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning. Manually curated datasets for validating alignment algorithms are limited in the field of untargeted metabolomics, and hence we develop a dataset split procedure to generate pairs of validation datasets to test the alignments produced by GromovMatcher and other methods. Applying our method to experimental patient studies of liver and pancreatic cancer, we discover shared metabolic features related to patient alcohol intake, demonstrating how GromovMatcher facilitates the search for biomarkers associated with lifestyle risk factors linked to several cancer types.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95898">ASAR lncRNAs control DNA replication timing through interactions with multiple hnRNP/RNA binding proteins</a></h4>

              
                ASARs are a family of very-long noncoding RNAs that control replication timing on individual human autosomes, and are essential for chromosome stability. The eight known ASAR lncRNAs remain closely associated with their parent chromosomes. Analysis of RNA-protein interaction data (from ENCODE) revealed numerous RBPs with significant interactions with multiple ASAR lncRNAs, with several hnRNPs as abundant interactors. An ~7 kb domain within the <i>ASAR6-141</i> lncRNA shows a striking density of RBP interaction sites. Genetic deletion and ectopic integration assays indicate that this ~7 kb RNA binding protein domain contains functional sequences for controlling replication timing of entire chromosomes in cis. shRNA-mediated depletion of 10 different RNA binding proteins, including HNRNPA1, HNRNPC, HNRNPL, HNRNPM, HNRNPU, or HNRNPUL1, results in dissociation of ASAR lncRNAs from their chromosome territories, and disrupts the synchronous replication that occurs on all autosome pairs, recapitulating the effect of individual ASAR knockouts on a genome-wide scale. Our results further demonstrate the role that ASARs play during the temporal order of genome-wide replication, and we propose that ASARs function as essential RNA scaffolds for the assembly of hnRNP complexes that help maintain the structural integrity of each mammalian chromosome.

">Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation over the Posterior Parietal Cortex Increases Non-target Retrieval during Visual Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                Accurate visual working memory (VWM) requires precise content-context binding. Previous studies have revealed a close relationship between the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and feature binding during VWM, this study further examined their causal relationship through three transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) experiments. In Experiment 1 (N = 57), participants underwent three sessions of tDCS separately, including PPC stimulation, occipital cortex stimulation, and sham stimulation, and completed a series of delayed estimation tasks for orientations before and after stimulation. Results showed that tDCS over PPC selectively prolonged recall response time (RT) and increased the probability of non-target responses (a.k.a. failure of feature binding). In Experiment 2 (N = 29), combining metacognition estimation during the task, we further investigated whether the effects of PPC stimulation on RT and increased probability of non-target responses were attributed to more mis-binding (i.e., participants self-reported "remembered" in non-target responses) or informed guessing (participants self-reported "forgotten" in non-target responses). We replicated the main findings in Experiment 1, and we also observed greater tDCS effects of PPC on RT in informed guessing trials than mis-binding trials while comparable effects on non-target response rates in these two types of trials. In Experiment 3 (N = 28), we then examined whether the effects of tDCS over PPC specifically influenced the memory retrieval process by using a change detection task. We found that PPC stimulation did not influence the recognition RT or accuracy. Together, this study provides causal evidence supporting the involvement of PPC in feature binding during VWM retrieval.

">Adolescent maturation of cortical excitation-inhibition balance based on individualized biophysical network modeling</a></h4>

              
                The balance of excitation and inhibition is a key functional property of cortical microcircuits which changes through the lifespan. Adolescence is considered a crucial period for the maturation of excitation-inhibition balance. This has been primarily observed in animal studies, yet human in vivo evidence on adolescent maturation of the excitation-inhibition balance at the individual level is limited. Here, we developed an individualized in vivo marker of regional excitation-inhibition balance in human adolescents, estimated using large-scale simulations of biophysical network models fitted to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from two independent cross-sectional (N = 752) and longitudinal (N = 149) cohorts. We found a widespread relative increase of inhibition in association cortices paralleled by a relative age-related increase of excitation, or lack of change, in sensorimotor areas across both datasets. This developmental pattern co-aligned with multiscale markers of sensorimotor-association differentiation. The spatial pattern of excitation-inhibition development in adolescence was robust to inter-individual variability of structural connectomes and modeling configurations. Notably, we found that alternative simulation-based markers of excitation-inhibition balance show a variable sensitivity to maturational change. Taken together, our study highlights an increase of inhibition during adolescence in association areas using cross sectional and longitudinal data, and provides a robust computational framework to estimate microcircuit maturation in vivo at the individual level.

">Functional segregation of conversational production and comprehension when using word predictability</a></h4>

              
                The extent to which the language production and comprehension systems overlap remains debated. We address this debate using a dataset where participants engaged in unscripted conversations, while scanned with fMRI. Word predictability was hypothesized to rely on different processes, depending on whether the word was uttered or heard. We employed the information-theoretic measure of surprisal (the negative log probability of a word occurring, given the preceding context) as a parametric modulator, controlling for the word's overall frequency. The results for production surprisal revealed activation in the left superior and inferior frontal gyri and motor areas. A large bilateral cluster in the posterior part of the medial prefrontal cortex extended from the supplementary motor area to the anterior cingulate cortex. The results for comprehension surprisal replicated findings from non-conversational contexts, showing involvement of the bilateral superior temporal gyrus/sulcus, presumably supporting bottom-up processes for prediction error detection. Importantly, no overlap in the neural infrastructure of production and comprehension was observed, suggesting that word predictability processes in production and comprehension differ. We suggest that while the comprehension system handles prediction errors, the production system minimizes these errors through adaptation, all to achieve successful communication.

">The transcriptomic and spatial organization of telencephalic GABAergic neuronal types</a></h4>

              
                The telencephalon of the mammalian brain comprises multiple regions and circuit pathways that play adaptive and integrative roles in a variety of brain functions. There is a wide array of GABAergic neurons in the telencephalon; they play a multitude of circuit functions, and dysfunction of these neurons has been implicated in diverse brain disorders. In this study, we conducted a systematic and in-depth analysis of the transcriptomic and spatial organization of GABAergic neuronal types in all regions of the mouse telencephalon and their developmental origins. This was accomplished by utilizing 611,423 single-cell transcriptomes from the comprehensive and high-resolution transcriptomic and spatial cell type atlas for the adult whole mouse brain we have generated, supplemented with an additional single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset containing 99,438 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes collected from the pre- and postnatal developing mouse brain. We present a hierarchically organized adult telencephalic GABAergic neuronal cell type taxonomy of 7 classes, 52 subclasses, 284 supertypes, and 1,051 clusters, as well as a corresponding developmental taxonomy of 450 clusters across different ages. Detailed charting efforts reveal extraordinary complexity where relationships among cell types reflect both spatial locations and developmental origins. Transcriptomically and developmentally related cell types can often be found in distant and diverse brain regions indicating that long-distance migration and dispersion is a common characteristic of nearly all classes of telencephalic GABAergic neurons. Additionally, we find various spatial dimensions of both discrete and continuous variations among related cell types that are correlated with gene expression gradients. Lastly, we find that cortical, striatal and some pallidal GABAergic neurons undergo extensive postnatal diversification, whereas septal and most pallidal GABAergic neuronal types emerge simultaneously during the embryonic stage with limited postnatal diversification. Overall, the telencephalic GABAergic cell type taxonomy can serve as a foundational reference for molecular, structural and functional studies of cell types and circuits by the entire community.

">Theta-burst stimulation over primary somatosensory cortex modulates tactile acuity of tongue</a></h4>

              
                Background: Emerging studies in humans have established the modulatory effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over primary somatosensory cortex (S1) on somatosensory cortex activity and perception. However, to date, research in this area has primarily focused on the hand and fingers, leaving a gap in our understanding of the modulatory effects of rTMS on somatosensory perception of the orofacial system and speech articulators. Objective: The present study aimed to examine the effects of different types of theta-burst stimulation-continuous TBS (cTBS), intermittent TBS (iTBS), or sham-over the tongue representation of left S1 on tactile acuity of the tongue. Methods: In a repeated-measures design, fifteen volunteers participated in four separate sessions, where cTBS, iTBS, sham, or no stimulation was applied over the tongue representation of left S1. Effects of TBS were measured on both temporal and spatial perceptual acuity of tongue using a custom vibrotactile stimulator. Results: CTBS significantly impaired spatial amplitude threshold at the time window of 16-30 minutes after stimulation, while iTBS improved it at the same time window. The effect of iTBS, however, was smaller than cTBS. In contrast, neither cTBS nor iTBS had any effect on the temporal discrimination threshold. Conclusions: The current study establishes the validity of using TBS to modulate somatosensory perception of the orofacial system. Directly modifying somatosensation in the orofacial system has the potential to benefit clinical populations with abnormal tactile acuity, improve our understanding of the role of sensory systems in speech production, and enhance speech motor learning and rehabilitation.

">A network correspondence toolbox for quantitative evaluation of novel neuroimaging results</a></h4>

              
                Decades of neuroscience research has shown that macroscale brain dynamics can be reliably decomposed into a subset of large-scale functional networks, but the specific spatial topographies of these networks and the names used to describe them can vary across studies. Such discordance has hampered interpretation and convergence of research findings across the field. To address this problem, we have developed the Network Correspondence Toolbox (NCT) to permit researchers to examine and report spatial correspondence between their novel neuroimaging results and sixteen widely used functional brain atlases, consistent with recommended reporting standards developed by the Organization for Human Brain Mapping. The atlases included in the toolbox show some topographical convergence for specific networks, such as those labeled as default or visual. Network naming varies across atlases, particularly for networks spanning frontoparietal association cortices. For this reason, quantitative comparison with multiple atlases is recommended to benchmark novel neuroimaging findings. We provide several exemplar demonstrations using the Human Connectome Project task fMRI results and UK Biobank independent component analysis maps to illustrate how researchers can use the NCT to report their own findings through quantitative evaluation against multiple published atlases. The NCT provides a convenient means for computing Dice coefficients with spin test permutations to determine the magnitude and statistical significance of correspondence among user-defined maps and existing atlas labels. The NCT also includes functionality to incorporate additional atlases in the future. The adoption of the NCT will make it easier for network neuroscience researchers to report their findings in a standardized manner, thus aiding reproducibility and facilitating comparisons between studies to produce interdisciplinary insights.

">Reelin marks cocaine-activated striatal ensembles, promotes neuronal excitability, and regulates cocaine reward</a></h4>

              
                Drugs of abuse activate defined neuronal ensembles in brain reward structures such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which are thought to promote the enduring synaptic, circuit, and behavioral consequences of drug exposure. While the molecular and cellular effects arising from experience with drugs like cocaine are increasingly well understood, the mechanisms that sculpt NAc ensemble participation are largely unknown. Here, we leveraged unbiased single-nucleus transcriptional profiling to identify expression of the secreted glycoprotein Reelin (encoded by the Reln gene) as a marker of cocaine-activated neuronal ensembles within the rat NAc. Multiplexed in situ detection confirmed selective expression of the immediate early gene Fos in Reln+ neurons after cocaine experience, and also revealed enrichment of Reln mRNA in Drd1+ medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in both the rat and human brain. Using a novel CRISPR interference strategy enabling selective Reln knockdown in the adult NAc, we observed altered expression of genes linked to calcium signaling, emergence of a transcriptional trajectory consistent with loss of cocaine sensitivity, and a striking decrease in MSN intrinsic excitability. At the behavioral level, loss of Reln prevented cocaine locomotor sensitization, abolished cocaine place preference memory, and decreased cocaine self-administration behavior. Together, these results identify Reelin as a critical mechanistic link between ensemble participation and cocaine-induced behavioral adaptations.

">Age-dependent H3K9 trimethylation by dSetdb1 impairs mitochondrial UPR leading to degeneration of olfactory neurons and loss of olfactory function in Drosophila.</a></h4>

              
                Aging is characterized by a decline in essential sensory functions, including olfaction, which is crucial for environmental interaction and survival. This decline is often paralleled by the cellular accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, particularly detrimental in post-mitotic cells such as neurons. Mitochondrial stress triggers the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRMT), a pathway that activates mitochondrial chaperones and antioxidant enzymes. Critical to the efficacy of the UPRMT is the cellular chromatin state, influenced by the methylation of lysine 9 on histone 3 (H3K9). While it has been observed that the UPRMT response can diminish with an increase in H3K9 methylation, its direct impact on age-related neurodegenerative processes, especially in the context of olfactory function, has not been clearly established. Using Drosophila, we demonstrate that an age-dependent increase in H3K9 trimethylation by the methyltransferase dSetdb1 reduces the activation capacity of the UPRMT in olfactory projection neurons leading to neurodegeneration and loss of olfactory function. Age-related neuronal degeneration was associated with morphological alterations in mitochondria and an increase in reactive oxygen species levels. Importantly, forced demethylation of H3K9 through knockdown of dSetdb1 in olfactory projection neurons restored the UPRMT activation capacity in aged flies, and suppressed age-related mitochondrial morphological abnormalities. This in turn prevented age-associated neuronal degeneration and rescued age-dependent loss of olfactory function. Our findings highlight the effect of age-related epigenetic changes on the response capacity of the UPRMT, impacting neuronal integrity and function. Moreover, they suggest a potential therapeutic role for UPRMT regulators in age-related neurodegeneration and loss of olfactory function.

">Social threat alters the behavioral structure of social motivation and reshapes functional brain connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic social experiences redefine socially motivated behaviors to enhance safety and survival. Although many brain regions have been implicated in signaling a social threat, the mechanisms by which global neural networks regulate such motivated behaviors remain unclear. To address this issue, we first combined traditional and modern behavioral tracking techniques in mice to assess both approach and avoidance, as well as sub-second behavioral changes, during a social threat learning task. We were able to identify previously undescribed body and tail movements during social threat learning and recognition that demonstrate unique alterations into the behavioral structure of social motivation. We then utilized inter-regional correlation analysis of brain activity after a mouse recognizes a social threat to explore functional communication amongst brain regions implicated in social motivation. Broad brain activity changes were observed within the nucleus accumbens, the paraventricular thalamus, the ventromedial hypothalamus, and the nucleus of reuniens. Inter-regional correlation analysis revealed a reshaping of the functional connectivity across the brain when mice recognize a social threat. Altogether, these findings suggest that reshaping of functional brain connectivity may be necessary to alter the behavioral structure of social motivation when a social threat is encountered.

">Rapid rebalancing of co-tuned ensemble activity in the auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Sensory information is represented by small neuronal ensembles in sensory cortices. Neuronal activity shows high trial-by-trial variability in that repeated presentation of the same stimulus, e. g., multiple presentations of the same sound activate differing ensembles in the auditory cortex (AC). How the differing ensembles interact to selectively activate to process incoming sound inputs with reduced energy is unknown. Efficient processing of complex acoustic signals requires that these sparsely distributed neuronal ensembles actively interact in order to provide a constant percept. Here, we probe interactions within and across ensembles by combining in vivo 2-photon Ca2+ imaging and holographic optogenetic stimulation to study how increased activity of single cells level affects the cortical network. We stimulated a small number of neurons sharing the same frequency preference alongside the presentation of a target pure tone, further increasing their tone-evoked activity. We found that other non-stimulated co-tuned neurons decreased their tone-evoked activity while non co-tuned neurons were unaffected. This shows that co-tuned ensembles communicated and balanced their total activity across the network. The rebalanced activity due to external stimulation remained constant. These effects suggest that co-tuned ensembles in AC interact and rapidly rebalance their activity to maintain encoding homeostasis, and that the rebalanced network is persistent.

">Event structure sculpts neural population dynamics in the lateral entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Our experience of the world is a continuous stream of events which must be segmented and organized simultaneously at multiple timescales. The neural mechanisms underlying this process remain unknown. Here, we simultaneously recorded many hundreds of neurons in the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) of freely behaving rats as we manipulated event structure at multiple timescales. During foraging as well as during sleep, population activity drifted continuously and unidirectionally along a one-dimensional manifold. Boundaries between events were associated with discrete shifts in state space, suggesting that LEC dynamics directly reflect event segmentation. During tasks with a recurring temporal structure, activity traveled additionally in directions orthogonal to the flow of drift, enabling the LEC population to multiplex event information across different timescales. Taken together, these results identify a hierarchically organized neural coding scheme for segmenting and organizing events in time.

	<p>Alcohol misuse is associated with altered punishment and reward processing. Here, we investigated neural network responses to reward and punishment and the molecular profiles of the connectivity features predicting alcohol use severity in young adults. We curated the Human Connectome Project data and employed connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) to examine how functional connectivity (FC) features during wins and losses are associated with alcohol use severity, quantified by Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism, in 981 young adults. We combined the CPM findings and the JuSpace toolbox to characterize the molecular profiles of the network connectivity features of alcohol use severity. The connectomics predicting alcohol use severity appeared specific, comprising less than 0.12% of all features, including medial frontal, motor/sensory, and cerebellum/brainstem networks during punishment processing and medial frontal, fronto-parietal, and motor/sensory networks during reward processing. Spatial correlation analyses showed that these networks were associated predominantly with serotonergic and GABAa signaling. To conclude, a distinct pattern of network connectivity predicted alcohol use severity in young adult drinkers. These &amp;amp;ldquo;neural fingerprints&amp;amp;rdquo; elucidate how alcohol misuse impacts the brain and provide evidence of new targets for future intervention.</p>

	<p>While recent advancements have been made towards a better understanding of the involvement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the context of cognitive control, the exact mechanism is still not fully understood. Successful behavior requires the correct detection of goal-relevant cues and resisting irrelevant distractions. Frontal parietal networks have been implicated as important for maintaining cognitive control in the face of distraction. The present study investigated the role of gamma-band power in distraction resistance and frontoparietal networks, as its increase is linked to cholinergic activity. We examined changes in gamma activity and their relationship to frontoparietal top&amp;amp;ndash;down modulation for distractor challenges and to bottom&amp;amp;ndash;up distractor processing. Healthy young adults were tested using a modified version of the distractor condition sustained attention task (dSAT) while wearing an EEG. The modified distractor was designed so that oscillatory activities could be entrained to it, and the strength of entrainment was used to assess the degree of distraction. Increased top&amp;amp;ndash;down control during the distractor challenge increased gamma power in the left parietal regions rather than the right prefrontal regions predicted from rodent studies. Specifically, left parietal gamma power increased in response to distraction where the amount of this increase was negatively correlated with the neural activity reflecting bottom&amp;amp;ndash;up distractor processing in the visual area. Variability in gamma power in right prefrontal regions was associated with increased response time variability during distraction. This may suggest that the right prefrontal region may contribute to the signaling needed for top&amp;amp;ndash;down control rather than its implementation.</p>

                Background Congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) is a well-known diagnosis among physiotherapists specializing in pediatric care, especially when working with infants. However, knowledge of bilateral torticollis is limited. The purpose of this article was to describe how bilateral torticollis may present itself clinically. Case One infant with CMT with sternocleidomastoid tumor (SMT) on the right side, and some limitation in rotation towards the right side and in lateral flexion towards the left side, i.e, the muscle on the right side was shortened. While sitting with support, he tilted the head to the left and was stronger in the lateral flexors on the left side which fit well with a postural left-sided torticollis (PT). The other infant had bilateral muscular torticollis (MT), the sternocleidomastoid muscle thickened bilaterally, and both active and passive rotations were affected. The head was held in flexion, and active rotation was severely limited to both sides. For both cases the therapeutic interventions were to gain a normal range of motion (ROM) and a good posture of the head. Conclusions CMT can appear in different ways and may be bilateral. Both infants gained good ROM and better head position, however case I still needs some training. To gain more knowledge about bilateral CMT, we should follow these cases over a longer period of time. It is important to communicate and discuss our experiences with each other to understand rare cases of CMT.

                Introduction Treating the early phase of schizophrenia is crucial for preventing further episodes and improving quality of life, functioning, and social inclusion. Pharmacotherapies are first-line treatments, but have limitations. There is consensus on the need for non-pharmacological interventions for individuals in the early phase of schizophrenia. Several psychological interventions have shown promising effects; however, their comparative effectiveness remains largely unknown. To address this issue, a network meta-analysis will be performed. We aim to develop a hierarchy of existing psychological treatments concerning their efficacy and tolerability, which will inform treatment guidelines. Protocol Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating psychological interventions for first-episode psychosis, first-episode schizophrenia, or early phase schizophrenia will be included. The primary outcome will be overall schizophrenia symptoms (measured up to 6 and 12 months, and at the longest follow-up) and relapse as a co-primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are premature discontinuation; change in positive, negative, and depressive symptoms of schizophrenia; response; quality of life; overall functioning; satisfaction with care; adherence; adverse events; and mortality. The study selection and data extraction are performed by two independent reviewers. We will assess the risk of bias of each study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2 and evaluate the confidence in the results using Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to explore heterogeneity and assess the robustness of our findings. Discussion This systematic review and network meta-analysis aims to compare multiple existing psychological interventions, establishing which are best for symptom reduction, relapse prevention, and other important outcomes in early phase schizophrenia. Our results may provide practical guidance concerning the most effective psychological intervention to reduce symptom severity and the societal burden associated with the disorder.

                Background Physical activity is the second largest contributor to our total daily energy expenditure (EE). Uncovering ways to increase EE during activity could yield new approaches to treat obesity. The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) regulates body weight by modulating muscle metabolism and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. The VMH also mediates behavioral responses to predator threat. While the VMH is a potential mediator of metabolic responses to predator threat, the mechanisms are unknown. Methods and Results Exposing rats to predator odor (PO) exposure causes a rapid increase in skeletal muscle thermogenesis that peaks between 20-30 min and dissipates to baseline by 4 hr. This thermogenic response is associated with weight loss and increased EE even when controlling for physical activity. To probe potential targets of PO-induced metabolic responses in the VMH, we first performed qPCR for genes known to be involved in brain regulation of muscle metabolism using VMH samples from rats exposed to PO or control odor for either 30 min or 4 hr. Next, to uncover novel, relevant genes, we performed RNA-sequencing on VMH samples of rats exposed to either PO or control odor for 20 min. qPCR results show that after 4 hr of PO exposure, Bdnf and Sirt1 expression were increased. RNA-sequencing analyses further identified 245 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that showed at least 1.5-fold change in expression due to PO exposure. Functional and Gene Ontology annotation showed that pathways related to immune response, oxidative stress, and synaptic plasticity were overrepresented among these DEGs. Discussion Taken together, these findings suggest that acute PO exposure induces both rapid and delayed changes in VMH gene expression that likely have downstream metabolic consequences.

                Background Preterm birth, which is child delivery before 37 weeks of pregnancy, is the primary cause of perinatal mortality worldwide. Preterm birth remains a major public health challenge in Rwanda, affecting approximately 13.8% of birth. The World Health Organization estimates that 15 million babies are born prematurely each year. While the association between periodontitis and preterm deliveries is increasingly recognized, little is known about this link in Rwanda. This policy brief aims to bridge this knowledge gap by presenting the findings of a recent study investigating the prevalence of periodontitis among pregnant women in Rwanda and its association with preterm deliveries. This policy brief also aims to inform and guide decision making towards incorporating periodontal screening into the antenatal care package in Rwanda. This has the potential to improve pregnancy outcomes and contribute to improved oral health in the future. Policy outcome and Implications Contemporary evidence has shown a six-fold increased risk of preterm delivery for women with periodontitis in Rwanda, with a concerningly high prevalence (60%) among pregnant women. Additionally, nurses working in antenatal clinics displayed insufficient knowledge about gum disease. Actionable recommendations The adoption of basic periodontal screening within existing antenatal care packages is recommended. This, coupled with nurse training and public awareness campaigns, can empower women and healthcare professionals to prioritize oral health for better pregnancy outcomes. Conclusions Integrating periodontal screening into antenatal care has the potential to significantly reduce preterm deliveries and contribute to a healthier future generation in Rwanda.

                Background Oral bronchodilators may be used as an adjunctive treatment, especially in patients with uncontrolled asthma or poor inhaler technique. This study aimed to determine the differences in asthma symptoms and bronchodilator effect between oral doxofylline and oral procaterol in adults with asthma. Methods A crossover randomized controlled trial was conducted. Asthmatic patients aged 18 years or older with stable inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-agonists (ICS/LABA) treatment were included. Each patient received 2 weeks of treatment with either doxofylline or procaterol followed by a 1-week washout period and 2 weeks of treatment with the other drug. Asthma symptoms were assessed using the Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5) scores, pulmonary function was assessed by spirometry with bronchodilator testing, and adverse events were recorded. Results A total of 21 patients were randomly allocated to either the doxofylline or procaterol groups. The mean age of the patients was 53.0±14.8 years. ACQ-5 scores were 1.4±1.1. After two weeks of treatment, the ACQ-5 scores and all pulmonary function parameters were not significantly different between the two groups (P>0.05). However, significant improvements in ACQ-5 scores were found in both groups (mean change: -0.381± 0.740, P=0.029 and -0.476± 0.873, P=0.021 for the doxofylline and procaterol groups, respectively). None of the patients experienced asthma exacerbations. Conclusions Doxofylline and procaterol can improve asthma symptoms, although they cannot enhance lung function. These oral bronchodilators might be used as an add-on therapy in asthmatic patients with persistent symptoms despite treatment with an ICS/LABA combination.

                Background The prevalence of depression among adolescents is an increasing global problem, including in Bangladesh as well. This cross-sectional data was collected to examine the physiological and psychological risk factors for depression among college-going adolescents in Bangladesh. Methodology Simple random sampling was employed as a sampling technique during the study period from May 2022 to August 2022. In the survey, a total of 1919 college-going adolescents were included through a Google-based questionnaire platform. The survey included socio-demographic characteristics and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) questions. Before starting the survey, the questionnaire was translated and pre-tested in Bengali. To assess the dataset's feasibility and effectiveness, the pre-testing was done with a total of 43 adolescents. The questionnaire was revised several times before the final study to ensure it satisfied all standards. Conclusion This dataset may be valuable for researchers investigating the relationship between academic performance, psychological well-being, and other socio-demographic characteristics. To get a deeper understanding of the broader framework, policymakers may find it advantageous to enact policies that are specifically tailored to meet the needs and preferences of adolescents

                Abstract* Introduction Colopleural fistulas are rare and generally correspond to thoracic empyema alongside an acute abdomen. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential to prevent recurrence of thoracic empyema. Case presentation An 18-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with dyspnea and abdominal pain. The patient had a history of a left diaphragmatic hernia repair. Physical examination revealed signs of left-sided pleural effusion and abdominal pain. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a left lung empyema with a suspected connection to the intra-abdominal cavity through the diaphragm. Colopleural fistula and diverticulosis were confirmed by colonoscopy. Subsequently, primary resection, transverse-descending anastomosis, and fistula suturing were performed, accompanied by empyema evacuation through thoracotomy and diverting colostomy. Clinical Discussion Colopleural fistula is an incredibly rare phenomenon that can result from diaphragmatic injury, malignancies, perforated diverticulosis, or colonic/pulmonary infections. The management of a colopleural fistula depends on anatomical, clinical, and other factors. Diverticulitis is usually treated using antibiotics and other conservative therapies. Diverticular disease usually requires surgery if there is perforation, progressive signs of sepsis or peritonitis, fistula, or failure of conservative treatment. A surgical procedure was performed in this case because of empyema arising from a colopleural fistula formation caused by diverticulosis. Conclusion Primary colon resection, colon anastomosis, fistula suturing, and decortication thoracotomy were shown to effectively treat colopleural fistula.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-642/v1?src=rss">Evaluation of centralised and decentralised models of care during the 2020 Ebola Virus Disease outbreak in Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo: A brief report [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Traditionally in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), centralised Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) have been set exclusively for Ebola virus disease (EVD) case management during outbreaks. During the 2020 EVD outbreak in DRC’s Equateur Province, existing health centres were equipped as decentralised treatment centres (DTC) to improve access for patients with suspected EVD. Between ETCs and DTCs, we compared the time from symptom onset to admission and diagnosis among patients with suspected EVD. Methods This was a cohort study based on analysis of a line-list containing demographic and clinical information of patients with suspected EVD admitted to any EVD health facility during the outbreak. Results Of 2359 patients with suspected EVD, 363 (15%) were first admitted to a DTC. Of 1996 EVD-suspected patients initially admitted to an ETC, 72 (4%) were confirmed as EVD-positive. Of 363 EVD-suspected patients initially admitted to a DTC, 6 (2%) were confirmed and managed as EVD-positive in the DTC. Among all EVD-suspected patients, the median (interquartile range) duration between symptom onset and admission was 2 (1-4) days in a DTC compared to 4 (2-7) days in an ETC (p<0.001). Similarly, time from symptom onset to admission was significantly shorter among EVD-suspected patients ultimately diagnosed as EVD-negative. Conclusions Since <5% of the EVD-suspected patients admitted were eventually diagnosed with EVD, there is a need for better screening to optimise resource utilization and outbreak control. Only one in seven EVD-suspected patients were admitted to a DTC first, as the DTCs were piloted in a limited and phased manner. However, there is a case to be made for considering decentralized care especially in remote and hard-to-reach areas in places like the DRC to facilitate early access to care, contain viral shedding by patients with EVD and ensure no disrupted provision of non-EVD services.

                Background The nursing workforce is crucial in healthcare systems worldwide and contributes to community well-being. also, Nurses experience numerous psychological, social, emotional, and behavioral shocks and challenges in their work. In Jordan, 43% of doctors and nurses suffer from high levels of burnout, around 55% experience high levels of emotional exhaustion, and 33% of doctors and nurses suffer from high levels of psychological pressure and job stress. Others found that 70% of nurses experience stress. these issues can be reduced by practicing self-care and psychological flow which impact in work-related tasks which are important in effectively addressing occupational stress healthily and soundly. This study aims to determine predictive ability of self-care and psychological flow in occupational stress among nurses Methods This study follows the quantitative technique. sample consisting of 476 nurses in Amman Jordan was chosen. Three scales were developed to meet the study objectives: Occupational stress scale, Self-care scale, and psychological flow scale. Results The study results indicate that self-care and psychological flow levels were low, while the occupational stress level was high. Also, there are a predictive ability of self-care and psychological flow in occupational stress among nurses. Conclusions This study shows that of self-care and psychological flow predict occupational stress among nurses, which helps us to manage the occupational stress among them by giving them self-care and psychological flow practices and healing time.

                <p>Animals use a combination of eye movements to track moving objects. These different eye movements need to be coordinated for successful tracking, requiring interactions between the systems involved. Here, we study the interaction between the saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movement systems in marmosets. Using a single-target pursuit task, we show that saccades cause an enhancement in pursuit following a saccade. Using a two-target pursuit task, we show that this enhancement in pursuit is selective toward the motion of the target selected by the saccade, irrespective of any biases in pursuit prior to the saccade. These experiments highlight the similarities in the functioning of saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movement systems across primates.</p>

                <p>Viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), use respiratory epithelial cells as an entry point for infection. Within the nasal cavity, the olfactory epithelium (OE) is particularly sensitive to infections which may lead to olfactory dysfunction. In patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019, deficits in olfaction have been characterized as a distinctive symptom. Here, we used the K18hACE2 mice to study the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and inflammation in the olfactory system (OS) after 7&nbsp;d of infection. In the OE, we found that SARS-CoV-2 selectively targeted the supporting/sustentacular cells (SCs) and macrophages from the lamina propria. In the brain, SARS-CoV-2 infected some microglial cells in the olfactory bulb (OB), and there was a widespread infection of projection neurons in the OB, piriform cortex (PC), and tubular striatum (TuS). Inflammation, indicated by both elevated numbers and morphologically activated IBA1<sup>+</sup> cells (monocyte/macrophage lineages), was preferentially increased in the OE septum, while it was homogeneously distributed throughout the layers of the OB, PC, and TuS. Myelinated OS axonal tracts, the lateral olfactory tract, and the anterior commissure, exhibited decreased levels of 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase, indicative of myelin defects. Collectively, our work supports the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infected SC and macrophages in the OE and, centrally, microglia and subpopulations of OS neurons. The observed inflammation throughout the OS areas and central myelin defects may account for the long-lasting olfactory deficit.</p>

The genes were mined from a complete genome sequence of strain BD163 isolated from potato in Tshwane, South Africa. This work is an effort to collate knowledge on P. brasiliense which has become a worldwide pathogen of potatoes and other vegetables such as tomato. Histidine kinases of P. brasiliense can be targets of bacterial control agents to limit the growth, spread and pathogenicity of P. brasiliense. Methods The whole genome sequence of strain BD163 of P. brasiliense deposited on www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov was downloaded, and individual kinase genes were searched and listed with their properties, namely, locus tag, protein accession number and annotation. Conclusions This is the only compilation of histidine kinase genes for P. brasiliense.

                Background Building Metagenome–Assembled Genomes (MAGs) from highly complex metagenomics datasets encompasses a series of steps covering from cleaning the sequences, assembling them to finally group them into bins. Along the process, multiple tools aimed to assess the quality and integrity of each MAG are implemented. Nonetheless, even when incorporated within end–to–end pipelines, the outputs of these pieces of software must be visualized and analyzed manually lacking integration in a complete framework. Methods We developed a Nextflow pipeline (MAGFlow) for estimating the quality of MAGs through a wide variety of approaches (BUSCO, CheckM2, GUNC and QUAST), as well as for annotating taxonomically the metagenomes using GTDB-Tk2. MAGFlow is coupled to a Python–Dash application (BIgMAG) that displays the concatenated outcomes from the tools included by MAGFlow, highlighting the most important metrics in a single interactive environment along with a comparison/clustering of the input data. Results By using MAGFlow/BIgMAG, the user will be able to benchmark the MAGs obtained through different workflows or establish the quality of the MAGs belonging to different samples following the divide and rule methodology. Conclusions MAGFlow/BIgMAG represents a unique tool that integrates state-of-the-art tools to study different quality metrics and extract visually as much information as possible from a wide range of genome features.

                Background Lectins are carbohydrate-binding protein domains. The C-type lectin designates a requirement for calcium for binding. Proteins contain C-type lectin domains that have a diverse range of functions, including cell-cell adhesion, immune response to pathogens, and apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the characters of LvCTL-encoding genes from white-leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) in Central Vietnam. Methods Two PCR products (LvCTL3 and LvCTL4) were cloned and sequenced. The structure and characterization of LvCTL proteins were predicted using bioinformatics tools. Results The results showed that the LvCTL3 gene was 444 nucleotides in length and 98.87% similar to the published LvCTL3 gene (accession number: KF156943). The polypeptide sequence had 147 amino acids, which were 97.28% identical to the reference sequence (AGV68681) and the LvCTL4 gene had a length of 417 nucleotides and homology of 99.52% compared to the published gene (KM387560). The deduced polypeptide sequence had 138 amino acids, and was 100% similar to the reference sequence (AKA64754). The LvCTL3 had a molecular weight of 16.91 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.66, while LvCTL4 had 15.75 and 4.58 kDa, respectively. The structure prediction results showed that LvCTL3 and LvCTL4 had one domain (CTLD), LvCTL3 had two α helices and nine β sheets, and LvCTL4 had two α helices and eight β sheets. Conclusions Our results provide essential information for the heterologous expression and biosynthesis production of C-type lectins.

                Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor clinical outcomes. Hence cost-effective drugs with fewer side effects as a standard supportive therapy might yield substantial advantages in efficacy and safety. Kadukkai maathirai (KM) is being used as a supplement in hepatocellular carcinoma. We evaluated whether KM has any preventive action on cancer progression in diethyl nitrosamine (DEN) - induced HCC in rats. Methods DEN was injected to produce HCC in rats, which was confirmed after 16 weeks. All the rats were orally administered KM for 4 weeks. Hepatoprotective potential (serum AST, ALT, ALP, Bilirubin) and anticancer efficacy (body weight, nodule count, tumor progression by histopathology, expression of GSTM1 by Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and In-silico analysis of phytoconstituents against β catenin and LRP analysis were evaluated. Results KM prevented cancer progression against DEN-induced HCC by an increase in GSTM1, a phase II detoxifying enzyme. It significantly reversed altered nodule count, relative liver weight, body weight, and histopathological features of HCC. In silico analysis of phytoconstituents of KM showed that they modulate the intracellular transcription process by inhibiting the armadillo repeat region of β catenin. Conclusions Our results elucidate the potential of KM as a supplement in HCC by reducing nodule count, protecting the liver from further damage, GSTM1 expression, and inhibiting armadillo repeat region of β catenin.

                Alien hand syndrome (AHS) is a rare neurological phenomenon first described by Van Vleuten over a century ago. The most widely recognized variants in literature are frontal, callosal, and posterior AHS. AHS due to the corpus callosum lesion can occur alone or as part of callosal disconnection syndrome (CDS). This report presents a unique CDS case manifesting clinical features from all three AHS variants, resulting from an extensive corpus callosum infarct. Our patient exhibited various clinical features from the three AHS variants, which include grasping, groping, and difficulty releasing objects from the hand (anterior); intermanual conflict (callosal); arm levitation, mild hemiparesis, and hemisensory loss (posterior). Additionally, the extensive disruption of the corpus callosal fibers produced neurological manifestations of CDS, such as cognitive impairment, ideomotor and constructional apraxia, behavioral disorder, and transcortical motor aphasia. We employed a range of rehabilitation interventions, such as mirror box therapy, limb restraint strategy, verbal cue training, cognitive behavioral therapy, bimanual hand training, speech and language therapy, and pharmacological treatment with clonazepam. The patient showed almost complete resolution of CDS and AHS features by nine months post-stroke Our case report highlights distinctive clinical variations of AHS and the challenging correlation between clinical manifestations and neuroanatomical substrates. Future studies are necessary to explore the intricate neural connections and the precise function of the corpus callosum. This can be achieved by combining comprehensive neuropsychological testing with diffusion tensor tractography studies. It is also essential to develop a validated tool to standardize AHS assessment. Finally, the scarcity of evidence in rehabilitation interventions necessitates further studies to address the wide knowledge gap in AHS and CDS management.

                <p>by Jack M. O’Shea, Peter Doerner, Annis Richardson, Christopher W. Wood</p>

Periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) are bacterial proteins commonly used as scaffolds for substrate-detecting biosensors. In these biosensors, effector proteins (for example fluorescent proteins) are inserted into a PBP such that the effector protein’s output changes upon PBP-substate binding. The insertion site is often determined by comparison of PBP <i>apo</i>/<i>holo</i> crystal structures, but random insertion libraries have shown that this can miss the best sites. Here, we present a PBP biosensor design method based on residue contact analysis from molecular dynamics. This computational method identifies the best previously known insertion sites in the maltose binding PBP, and suggests further previously unknown sites. We experimentally characterise fluorescent protein insertions at these new sites, finding they too give functional biosensors. Furthermore, our method is sufficiently flexible to both suggest insertion sites compatible with a variety of effector proteins, and be applied to binding proteins beyond PBPs.

                <p>by Zijian Wang, Jan Hasenauer, Yannik Schälte</p>

Amortized simulation-based neural posterior estimation provides a novel machine learning based approach for solving parameter estimation problems. It has been shown to be computationally efficient and able to handle complex models and data sets. Yet, the available approach cannot handle the in experimental studies ubiquitous case of missing data, and might provide incorrect posterior estimates. In this work, we discuss various ways of encoding missing data and integrate them into the training and inference process. We implement the approaches in the BayesFlow methodology, an amortized estimation framework based on invertible neural networks, and evaluate their performance on multiple test problems. We find that an approach in which the data vector is augmented with binary indicators of presence or absence of values performs the most robustly. Indeed, it improved the performance also for the simpler problem of data sets with variable length. Accordingly, we demonstrate that amortized simulation-based inference approaches are applicable even with missing data, and we provide a guideline for their handling, which is relevant for a broad spectrum of applications.

                <p>by Natanael Spisak, Marc de Manuel, William Milligan, Guy Sella, Molly Przeworski</p>

The rates at which mutations accumulate across human cell types vary. To identify causes of this variation, mutations are often decomposed into a combination of the single-base substitution (SBS) “signatures” observed in germline, soma, and tumors, with the idea that each signature corresponds to one or a small number of underlying mutagenic processes. Two such signatures turn out to be ubiquitous across cell types: SBS signature 1, which consists primarily of transitions at methylated CpG sites thought to be caused by spontaneous deamination, and the more diffuse SBS signature 5, which is of unknown etiology. In cancers, the number of mutations attributed to these 2 signatures accumulates linearly with age of diagnosis, and thus the signatures have been termed “clock-like.” To better understand this clock-like behavior, we develop a mathematical model that includes DNA replication errors, unrepaired damage, and damage repaired incorrectly. We show that mutational signatures can exhibit clock-like behavior because cell divisions occur at a constant rate and/or because damage rates remain constant over time, and that these distinct sources can be teased apart by comparing cell lineages that divide at different rates. With this goal in mind, we analyze the rate of accumulation of mutations in multiple cell types, including soma as well as male and female germline. We find no detectable increase in SBS signature 1 mutations in neurons and only a very weak increase in mutations assigned to the female germline, but a significant increase with time in rapidly dividing cells, suggesting that SBS signature 1 is driven by rounds of DNA replication occurring at a relatively fixed rate. In contrast, SBS signature 5 increases with time in all cell types, including postmitotic ones, indicating that it accumulates independently of cell divisions; this observation points to errors in DNA repair as the key underlying mechanism. Thus, the 2 “clock-like” signatures observed across cell types likely have distinct origins, one set by rates of cell division, the other by damage rates.

                Background "324C+1D” movements are key techniques and winning factors in Wushu competitions. It is necessary for scientific training to analyze the kinematic characteristics of “324C+1D” by using the method of sports biomechanics. Methods In this study, 3D high-speed camera and 3D motion analysis software were used to study “324C+1D” completed by three Chinese wushu first-level athletes, and the kinematic characteristics of this movement were obtained. Results The run-up speed of completing the “324C+1D” is not high; The lift Angle of the center of gravity is close to 90°. The vertical height of the center of gravity is significantly higher than the vertical height of the center of gravity when landing, and the vertical moving distance of the center of gravity in the lifting stage is significantly less than the vertical moving distance of the center of gravity in the descending stage. The vertical height of the center of gravity at departure is significantly higher than that at landing. Conclusions In the take-off stage, increase the twisting Angle of shoulders and hips, speed up the swing arm speed and squat speed of the center of gravity in the vertical direction, and shorten the take-off time. Increase the vertical speed of the center of gravity before the patting foot and the vertical moving distance between the center of gravity lifting stage and the descending stage, extend the air time, accelerate the swing speed of the right leg, move the foot patting time forward to the rapid rising stage of the center of gravity lifting, accelerate the rotational angular speed of the shoulder shaft in the air stage and improve the strength of the leg, which is conducive to the athletes to complete the movement.

                Background Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (Chittodvega) is one among many types of mental disorders explained in Ayurveda. It can be defined as a Chitta (mind) + Udvega (anxiety)= Chittodvega- Anxious status of a mind. Celastrus paniculatus also known as Jyotishmati. stimulates and improves the digestive fire and metabolism at a cellular level (Jatharagni and Majja dhatwagni). It can be correlated to GAD. GAD is characterized by feelings of threat, restlessness, irritability, sleep disturbance, and tension, and symptoms such as palpitations, dry mouth, and sweating. It affects women more frequently than men and prevalence rates are high in midlife (prevalence in females over age 35: 10%) and older subjects. In modern medicine the first-line psychological and pharmaceutical treatments are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline (SNRIs). Aim and objectives To evaluate the comparative efficacy of Jyotishmati versus sertraline in the management of Chittodvega. Methods In this randomized active controlled double blind equivalence trial a total of 70 patients will be enrolled and divided into two equal groups. Patients between 20–50 years age of either gender having symptoms of Chittodvega and a Hamilton anxiety rating (HAM-A) scale score less than 24 (i.e., mild to moderate) will be selected for the study. In Group A, sertraline capsules 25 mg for first 7 days and then dose increased to 50 mg at bedtime for next 53 days and in Group B Jyotishmati Capsules 500 mg will be given twice a day after food with water for 60 days. Result and observation The patients will be assessed on the HAM-A scale, serum cortisol and WHO Quality of Life on day 0, 30, 60 and 90 and data will be analyzed using paired and unpaired t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables to evaluate whether treatments are equivalent.

                Introduction The commonest type of malignancy in the head and neck region is oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Brandwein provided a risk model that includes scores for the following three factors: worst invasion pattern, lymphocytic host response and perineural invasion. This risk model accounts for overall survival and local recurrence. p53 is considered to be one of the most significant prognostic markers. Objectives To assess and correlate Brandwein-Gensler criteria with p53 immunoexpression in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Methods In this study, a total of 80 samples will be included from histopathologically diagnosed OSCC patients will be taken for the study. H&E-stained slides of all cases will be evaluated using Brandwein-Gensler criteria and then immunostaining will be done for p53 immunoexpression. A correlation between Brandwein-Gensler criteria and p53 immunoexpression will be determined. The present study will assess and correlate Brandwein-Gensler criteria with p53 immunoexpression. If the Brandwein-Gensler criteria score increases, the intensity of p53 immunoexpression will also increase. Conclusions We hypothesize that Brandwein-Gensler criteria may be significantly correlated with p53 immunoexpression in OSCC.

                Rapid eye movement sleep (REMs) is characterized by activated electroencephalogram (EEG) and muscle atonia, accompanied by vivid dreams. REMs is homeostatically regulated, ensuring that any loss of REMs is compensated by a subsequent increase in its amount. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the homeostatic control of REMs are largely unknown. Here, we show that GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus (POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons) are crucial for the homeostatic regulation of REMs in mice. POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons are most active during REMs, and inhibiting them specifically decreases REMs. REMs restriction leads to an increased number and amplitude of calcium transients in POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons, reflecting the accumulation of REMs pressure. Inhibiting POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons during REMs restriction blocked the subsequent rebound of REMs. Our findings reveal a hypothalamic circuit whose activity mirrors the buildup of homeostatic REMs pressure during restriction and that is required for the ensuing rebound in REMs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91999">Expression of modified FcγRI enables myeloid cells to elicit robust tumor-specific cytotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Despite the central role of T cells in tumor immunity, attempts to harness their cytotoxic capacity as a therapy have met limited efficacy, partially as a result of the suppressive microenvironment which limits their migration and activation. In contrast, myeloid cells massively infiltrate tumors and are well adapted to survive these harsh conditions. While they are equipped with cell-killing abilities, they often adopt an immunosuppressive phenotype upon migration to tumors. Therefore, the questions of how to modify their activation programming against cancer, and what signaling cascades should be activated in myeloid cells to elicit their cytotoxicity have remained unclear. Here, we found that activation of IgM-induced signaling in murine myeloid cells results in secretion of lytic granules and massive tumor cell death. These findings open venues for designing novel immunotherapy by equipping monocytes with chimeric receptors that target tumor antigens and consequently, signal through IgM receptor. Nonetheless, we found that myeloid cells do not express the antibody-derived portion used to recognize the tumor antigen due to the induction of an ER stress response. To overcome this limitation, we designed chimeric receptors that are based on the high-affinity FcγRI for IgG. Incubation of macrophages expressing these receptors along with tumor-binding IgG induced massive tumor cell killing and secretion of reactive oxygen species and Granzyme B. Overall, this work highlights the challenges involved in genetically reprogramming the signaling in myeloid cells and provides a framework for endowing myeloid cells with antigen-specific cytotoxicity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89918">Structural characterization of ligand binding and pH-specific enzymatic activity of mouse Acidic Mammalian Chitinase</a></h4>

              
                Chitin is an abundant biopolymer and pathogen-associated molecular pattern that stimulates a host innate immune response. Mammals express chitin-binding and chitin-degrading proteins to remove chitin from the body. One of these proteins, Acidic Mammalian Chitinase (AMCase), is an enzyme known for its ability to function under acidic conditions in the stomach but is also active in tissues with more neutral pHs, such as the lung. Here, we used a combination of biochemical, structural, and computational modeling approaches to examine how the mouse homolog (mAMCase) can act in both acidic and neutral environments. We measured kinetic properties of mAMCase activity across a broad pH range, quantifying its unusual dual activity optima at pH 2 and 7. We also solved high-resolution crystal structures of mAMCase in complex with oligomeric GlcNAcn, the building block of chitin, where we identified extensive conformational ligand heterogeneity. Leveraging these data, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations that suggest how a key catalytic residue could be protonated via distinct mechanisms in each of the two environmental pH ranges. These results integrate structural, biochemical, and computational approaches to deliver a more complete understanding of the catalytic mechanism governing mAMCase activity at different pH. Engineering proteins with tunable pH optima may provide new opportunities to develop improved enzyme variants, including AMCase, for therapeutic purposes in chitin degradation.

">Cardiometabolic health, cortical thickness, and neurotransmitter systems: a large-scale multivariate study</a></h4>

              
                There is a recognized link between risk factors for non-communicable diseases and brain health. However, the specific effects that they have on brain health are still poorly understood, preventing its implementation in clinical practice. For instance, the association between such risk factors and cortical thickness (CT) has been primarily explored using univariate/bivariate methods and global/lobar measures of CT and has yielded inconsistent results. In this work, we aim to study the relationship between risk factors for non-communicable diseases and CT. In addition, we adopt a systems-level perspective to understand such relationship, by integrating several brain features including brain structure and function as well as neurotransmitter systems. Here, we analyzed latent dimensions linking a broad set of risk factors for non-communicable diseases to parcel-wise CT across the whole cortex (including raw, proportional, and brain size-corrected measures). We used a multivariate approach (regularized canonical correlation analysis (RCCA)) embedded in a machine learning framework that allows to capture inter-individual variability and to assess the generalizability of the model. The brain patterns (captured in association with risk factors) were characterized from a multi-level perspective, by comparing them with patterns of brain structure, function, and neurotransmitter systems. Analyses were performed separately in women (n=3685, 46-81 years) and in age-matched men (n=3685, 46-81 years) to avoid sex-bias on the results. We found one significant latent dimension (women: rrange=0.25-0.30, p=0.005-0.005; men: rrange=0.31-0.34, p=0.005-0.005), capturing variability in cardiometabolic health, including physical activity, body morphology/composition, basal metabolic rate, and blood pressure. This cardiometabolic health dimension was linked to a CT axis of inter-individual variability from the insula and cingulate cortex to occipital and parietal areas. Interestingly, this brain pattern was associated with the binding potentials of several neurotransmitter systems, including serotoninergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic systems. Of note, this latent dimension was similar across sexes and across CT measures (raw, proportional, and brain-size corrected). We observed a robust, multi-level and multivariate link between cardiometabolic health, CT, and neurotransmitter systems. These findings support the urgency of further investigation into the interaction between brain health and physical health and contributes to the challenge to the classical conceptualization of neuropsychiatric and physical illnesses as categorical entities. Therefore, regular monitoring of cardiometabolic risk factors may reduce their adverse effects on brain health and prevent the development of brain diseases.

">The spatial layout of antagonistic brain regions are explicable based on geometric principles</a></h4>

              
                Brain activity emerges in a dynamic landscape of regional increases and decreases that span the cortex. Increases in activity during a cognitive task are often assumed to reflect the processing of task-relevant information, while reductions can be interpreted as suppression of irrelevant activity to facilitate task goals. Here, we explore the relationship between task-induced increases and decreases in activity from a geometric perspective. Using a technique known as kriging, developed in earth sciences, we examined whether the spatial organisation of brain regions showing positive activity could be predicted based on the spatial layout of regions showing activity decreases (and vice versa). Consistent with this hypothesis we established the spatial distribution of regions showing reductions in activity could predict (i) regions showing task-relevant increases in activity in both groups of humans and single individuals; (ii) patterns of neural activity captured by calcium imaging in mice; and, (iii) showed a high degree of generalisability across task contexts. Our analysis, therefore, establishes that antagonistic relationships between brain regions are topographically determined, a spatial analog for the well documented anti-correlation between brain systems over time.

">Differential Effects of Haloperidol on Neural Oscillations During Wakefulness and Sleep</a></h4>

              
                The electrical activity of the brain, characterized by its frequency components, reflects a complex interplay between periodic (oscillatory) and aperiodic components. These components are associated with various neurophysiological processes, such as the excitation-inhibition balance (aperiodic activity) or interregional communication (oscillatory activity). However, we do not fully understand whether these components are truly independent or if different neuromodulators modulate them in different ways. The dopaminergic system has a critical role for cognition and motivation, being a potential modulator of these power spectrum components. To improve our understanding of these questions, we investigated the differential effects of this system on these components using electrocorticogram recordings in cats, which show clear oscillations and aperiodic 1/f activity. Specifically, we focused on the effects of haloperidol (a D2 receptor antagonist) on oscillatory and aperiodic dynamics during wakefulness and sleep. By parameterizing the power spectrum into these two components, our findings reveal a state-dependent modulation of oscillatory activity by the D2 receptor across the brain. Surprisingly, aperiodic activity was not significantly affected and exhibited inconsistent changes across the brain. This suggests a nuanced interplay between neuromodulation and the distinct components of brain oscillations, providing insights into the selective regulation of oscillatory dynamics in awake states.

">Synchronicity transitions determine connection fluctuations in a model of coupled oscillators with plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Sleep and rest are crucial for knowledge reorganization and creativity. During these periods, synapses between neurons are plastically altered and neuronal activities are collectively synchronized, accompanied by large differences in excitation-inhibition (EI) balance. These processes are assumed to be dissimilar from the learning process during task engagement. The detailed mechanism of how synchronized neuronal activities modify neural circuits via plasticity has yet to be fully understood. The Kuramoto model is utilized to study the collective synchronization of oscillators, including neurons. We previously proposed the EI-Kuramoto model, in which the EI balance was implemented in the Kuramoto model. The model alters its synchronicity based on the EI balance of the interaction strength. In this study, we developed this EI-Kuramoto model by implementing plasticity, leading to the plastic EI-Kuramoto (pEI-Kuramoto) model. Models with high inhibition displayed desynchronized dynamics and consistent connection strengths. Models with low inhibition exhibited bistable dynamics between synchronized and desynchronized states and fluctuation of interaction strengths in middle strength connections, while the strongest connections remained stable. These results, stabilizing a few strong connections and fluctuating the other connections in low inhibition conditions, could facilitate knowledge abstraction and reorganization. Our findings shed light on how varying inhibitory effects influence network stability and coupling, offering deeper insights into synaptic networks and knowledge reshaping.

">Posterior parietal cortex maps progress along routes sharing the same meta-structure</a></h4>

              
                Neurons of posterior parietal cortex were recorded as rats performed a working memory task within a network of intersecting paths. The specific routes utilized in task performance provided opportunity to contrast responses of posterior parietal cortex sub-populations to linear and angular velocity with more complex responses that map route progress. We found evidence for the presence of posterior parietal cortex neurons that generalize in their firing patterns across routes having the same shape but opposite action series. The results indicate that posterior parietal cortex has the capacity to generalize the mapping of route progress independent of the specific actions taken to move through those routes. We suggest that such encoding can form the basis for learning the meta-structural organization of a non-random path network structure, such as that commonly found in cities.

">The UPRER governs the cell-specific response of human dopaminergic neurons to mitochondrial stress</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be central to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. The preferential vulnerability of dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta to mitochondrial stress may underlie their massive degeneration and the occurrence of motor symptoms. Using LUHMES-derived DA neurons, we demonstrated that inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain resulted in a severe alteration of mitochondrial turnover, pushing the balance towards mitochondrial loss, a reduction of the maturation status of the DA population and an increased proportion of apoptotic cells. PERK-mediated Unfolded Protein Response of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (UPRER) emerged as the key coordinator of the stress response, governing the inactivation of the mitochondrial UPR (UPRmt), the initiation of mitophagy and the cell-specific expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Importantly, we discovered novel lncRNAs specifically expressed in human DA neurons upon stress. Among them, we showed that lnc-SLC6A15-5 contributes to the resumption of translation after mitochondrial stress.

">Adolescent Alcohol Exposure Promotes Mechanical Allodynia and Alters Synaptic Function at Inputs from the Basolateral Amgydala to the Prelimbic Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Binge drinking is common among adolescents despite mounting evidence linking it to various adverse health outcomes that includes heightened pain perception. The prelimbic (PrL) cortex is vulnerable to insults from adolescent alcohol exposure and receives input from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) while sending projections to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) - two brain regions implicated in nociception. In this study, adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure was carried out in male and female rats using a vapor inhalation procedure. Mechanical and thermal sensitivity, assessed throughout adolescence and into adulthood, revealed that AIE exposure induced protracted mechanical allodynia in both male and female rats. However, a carrageenan inflammatory paw pain challenge in adult rats revealed that AIE did not further augment carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia. To investigate synaptic function at BLA inputs onto defined populations of PrL neurons, retrobeads and viral labelling were combined with optogenetics and slice electrophysiology. Recordings from retrobead labelled cells in the PrL revealed AIE reduced BLA driven feedforward inhibition of neurons projecting from the PrL to the vlPAG (PrLPAG neurons), resulting in augmented excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and increased intrinsic excitability. Consistent with this finding, recordings from virally tagged PrL parvalbumin interneurons (PVINs) demonstrated that AIE exposure reduced both E/I balance at BLA inputs onto PVINs and PVIN intrinsic excitability when assessed in adulthood. These findings provide compelling evidence that AIE and acute pain alter synaptic function and intrinsic excitability within a prefrontal nociceptive circuit.

">Static and Dynamic Cross-Network Functional Connectivity Shows Elevated Entropy in Schizophrenia Patients</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia (SZ) patients exhibit abnormal static and dynamic functional connectivity across various brain domains. We present a novel approach based on static and dynamic inter-network connectivity entropy (ICE), which represents the entropy of a given network's connectivity to all the other brain networks. This novel approach enables the investigation of how connectivity strength is heterogeneously distributed across available targets in both SZ patients and healthy controls. We analyzed fMRI data from 151 schizophrenia patients and demographically matched 160 healthy controls. Our assessment encompassed both static and dynamic ICE, revealing significant differences in the heterogeneity of connectivity levels across available brain networks between SZ patients and healthy controls (HC). These networks are associated with subcortical (SC), auditory (AUD), sensorimotor (SM), visual (VIS), cognitive control (CC), default mode network (DMN) and cerebellar (CB) functional brain domains. Elevated ICE observed in individuals with SZ suggests that patients exhibit significantly higher randomness in the distribution of time-varying connectivity strength across functional regions from each source network, compared to healthy control group. C-means fuzzy clustering analysis of functional ICE correlation matrices revealed that SZ patients exhibit significantly higher occupancy weights in clusters with weak, low-scale functional entropy correlation, while the control group shows greater occupancy weights in clusters with strong, large-scale functional entropy correlation. k-means clustering analysis on time-indexed ICE vectors revealed that cluster with highest ICE have higher occupancy rates in SZ patients whereas clusters characterized by lowest ICE have larger occupancy rates for control group. Furthermore, our dynamic ICE approach revealed that it appears healthy for a brain to primarily circulate through complex, less structured connectivity patterns, with occasional transitions into more focused patterns. However, individuals with SZ seem to struggle with transiently attaining these more focused and structured connectivity patterns. Proposed ICE measure presents a novel framework for gaining deeper insights into understanding mechanisms of healthy and disease brain states and a substantial step forward in the developing advanced methods of diagnostics of mental health conditions.

">A bottom-up approach identifies the antipsychotic and antineoplastic trifluoperazine and the ribose derivative deoxytubercidin as novel microglial phagocytosis inhibitors.</a></h4>

              
                Phagocytosis is an indispensable function of microglia, the brain professional phagocytes. Microglia are particularly efficient phagocytosing cells that undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) in physiological conditions. However, mounting evidence suggests microglial phagocytosis dysfunction in multiple brain disorders. These observations prompted us to search for phagocytosis modulators (enhancers or inhibitors) with therapeutic potential. We used a bottom-up strategy that consisted on the identification of phagocytosis modulators using phenotypic high throughput screenings (HTSs) in cell culture and validation in organotypic cultures and in vivo. We performed two complementary HTS campagnes: at Achucarro, we used primary cultures of mouse microglia and compounds of the Prestwick Chemical Library; at Roche, we used human iPSC derived macrophage-like cells and a proprietary chemo-genomic library with 2,200 compounds with known mechanism-of-action. Next, we validated the more robust compounds using hippocampal organotypic cultures and identified two hits: trifluoperazine, a dopaminergic and adrenergic antagonist used as an antipsychotic and antineoplastic; and deoxytubercidin, a ribose derivative. Finally, we tested whether these compounds were able to modulate phagocytosis of apoptotic newborn cells in the adult hippocampal neurogenic niche in vivo by administering them into the mouse hippocampus using osmotic minipumps. We confirmed that both trifluoperazine and deoxytubercidin have anti-phagocytic activity in vivo, and validated our bottom-up strategy to identify novel phagocytosis modulators. These results show that chemical libraries with anotated mechanism of action are an starting point for the pharmacological modulation of microglia in drug discovery projects aiming at the therapeutic manipulation of phagocytosis in brain diseases.

">Consistent neural representation of valence in watching and recall conditions</a></h4>

              
                Recall is an act of elicitation of emotions similar to those emotions previously experienced. Unlike the past experiences where external sensory stimuli triggered emotions, recall does not require external sensory stimuli. This difference is pertinent to the key debate in affective representation, addressing whether the representation of valence is consistent across modalities (modality-general) or dependent on modalities (modality-specific). This study aimed to verify neural representations of valence irrespective of the presence of external sensory stimuli. Using neuroimaging data from video watching and recall (Chen et al., 2017) and behavioral data for valence ratings (Kim et al., 2020), a searchlight analysis was conducted with cross-participant regression-based decoding across the presence and absence of external stimuli. Multidimensional scaling was employed as a validation analysis of the results. The searchlight analysis revealed the right middle temporal and inferior temporal gyrus as well as the left fusiform gyrus. The validation analysis further exhibited significant consistent neural representations of valence in the inferior temporal gyrus and the left fusiform gyrus. This study identified the brain regions where valence is consistently represented, regardless of the presence of external sensory stimuli. These findings contribute to debate in affective representations, by comparing conditions utilized little in prior, suggesting the inferior temporal gyrus is related to representations of valence irrespective of the presence and absence of external visual stimuli.

">Disruption of the CRF1 receptor eliminates morphine-induced sociability deficits and firing of oxytocinergic neurons in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Substance-induced social behavior deficits dramatically worsen the clinical outcome of substance use disorders; yet, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the role for the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRF1) in the acute sociability deficits induced by morphine and the related activity of oxytocin (OXY)- and arginine-vasopressin (AVP)-expressing neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). For this purpose, we used both the CRF1 receptor-preferring antagonist compound antalarmin and the genetic mouse model of CRF1 receptor-deficiency. Antalarmin completely abolished sociability deficits induced by morphine in male, but not in female, C57BL/6J mice. Accordingly, genetic CRF1 receptor-deficiency eliminated morphine-induced sociability deficits in male mice. Ex vivo electrophysiology studies showed that antalarmin also eliminated morphine-induced firing of PVN neurons in male, but not in female, C57BL/6J mice. Likewise, genetic CRF1 receptor-deficiency reduced morphine-induced firing of PVN neurons in a CRF1 gene expression-dependent manner. The electrophysiology results consistently mirrored the behavioral results, indicating a link between morphine-induced PVN activity and sociability deficits. Interestingly, in male mice antalarmin abolished morphine-induced firing in neurons co-expressing OXY and AVP, but not in neurons expressing only AVP. In contrast, in female mice antalarmin did not affect morphine-induced firing of neurons co-expressing OXY and AVP or only OXY, indicating a selective sex-specific role for the CRF1 receptor in opiate-induced PVN OXY activity. The present findings demonstrate a major, sex-linked, role for the CRF1 receptor in sociability deficits and related brain alterations induced by morphine, suggesting new therapeutic strategy for opiate use disorders.

">Steering From the Rear: Coordination of Central Pattern Generators Underlying Navigation by Ascending Interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how animals coordinate movements to achieve goals is a fundamental pursuit in neuroscience. Here we explore how neurons that reside in posterior lower-order regions of a locomotor system and project to anterior higher-order regions influence steering and navigation. We characterized the anatomy and functional role of a population of ascending interneurons in the ventral nerve cord of Drosophila larvae. Through electron microscopy reconstructions and light microscopy, we determined that the cholinergic 19f cells receive input primarily from premotor interneurons and synapse upon a diverse array of postsynaptic targets within the anterior segments including other 19f cells. Calcium imaging of 19f activity in isolated CNS preparations in relation to motor neurons revealed that 19f neurons are recruited into most larval motor programmes. 19f activity lags behind motor neuron activity and as a population, the cells encode spatio-temporal patterns of locomotor activity in the larval CNS. Optogenetic manipulations of 19f cell activity in isolated CNS preparations revealed that they coordinate the activity of central pattern generators underlying exploratory headsweeps and forward locomotion in a context and location specific manner. In behaving animals, activating 19f cells suppressed exploratory headsweeps and slowed forward locomotion, while inhibition of 19f activity potentiated headsweeps, slowing forward movement. Inhibiting activity in 19f cells ultimately affected the ability of larvae to remain in the vicinity of an odor source during an olfactory navigation task. Overall, our findings provide insights into how ascending interneurons monitor motor activity and shape interactions amongst rhythm generators underlying complex navigational tasks.

">Balancing complexity, performance and plausibility to meta learn plasticity rules in recurrent spiking networks.</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity is a key player in the brain's life-long learning abilities. However, due to experimental limitations, the mechanistic link between synaptic plasticity rules and the network-level computations they enable remain opaque. Here we use evolutionary strategies (ES) to meta-learn local co-active plasticity rules in large recurrent spiking networks, using parameterizations of increasing complexity. We discover rules that robustly stabilize network dynamics for all four synapse types acting in isolation (E-to-E, E-to-I, I-to-E and I-to-I). More complex functions such as familiarity detection can also be included in the search constraints. However, our meta-learning strategy begins to fail for co-active rules of increasing complexity, as it is challenging to devise loss functions that effectively constrain network dynamics to plausible solutions a priori. Moreover, in line with previous work, we can find multiple degenerate solutions with identical network behaviour. As a local optimization strategy, ES provides one solution at a time and makes exploration of this degeneracy cumbersome. Regardless, we can glean the interdependecies of various plasticity parameters by considering the covariance matrix learned alongside the optimal rule with ES. Our work provides a proof of principle for the success of machine-learning-guided discovery of plasticity rules in large spiking networks, and points at the necessity of more elaborate search strategies going forward.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27002?af=R">Mutations in CLCN6 as a Novel Genetic Cause of Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore the pathogenesis of <i>CLCN6</i>-related disease and to assess whether its Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-exchange activity is crucial for the biological role of ClC-6.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed whole-exome sequencing on a girl with development delay, intractable epilepsy, behavioral abnormities, retinal dysfunction, progressive brain atrophy, suggestive of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). We generated and analyzed the first knock-in mouse model of a patient variant (p.E200A) and compared it with a <i>Clcn6</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mouse model. Additional functional tests were performed with heterologous expression of mutant ClC-6.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified a de novo heterozygous p.E200A variant in the proband. Expression of disease-causing ClC-6<sup>E200A</sup> or ClC-6<sup>Y553C</sup> mutants blocked autophagic flux and activated transcription factors EB (TFEB) and E3 (TFE3), leading to autophagic vesicle and cholesterol accumulation. Such alterations were absent with a transport-deficient ClC-6<sup>E267A</sup> mutant. <i>Clcn6</i>
<sup>E200A/+</sup> mice developed severe neurodegeneration with typical features of NCLs. Mutant ClC-6<sup>E200A</sup>, but not loss of ClC-6 in <i>Clcn6</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mice, increased lysosomal biogenesis by suppressing mTORC1-TFEB signaling, blocked autophagic flux through impairing lysosomal function, and increased apoptosis. Carbohydrate and lipid deposits accumulated in <i>Clcn6</i>
<sup>E200A/+</sup> brain, while only lipid storage was found in <i>Clcn6</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> brain. Lysosome dysfunction, autophagy defects, and gliosis were early pathogenic events preceding neuron loss.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>CLCN6</i> is a novel genetic cause of NCLs, highlighting the importance of considering <i>CLCN6</i> mutations in the diagnostic workup for molecularly undefined forms of NCLs. Uncoupling of Cl<sup>−</sup> transport from H<sup>+</sup> countertransport in the E200A mutant has a dominant effect on the autophagic/lysosomal pathway. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to assess the impact of time to endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) on clinical outcomes in the DAWN trial, while also exploring the potential effect modification of mode of stroke onset on this relationship.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The association between every 1-h treatment delay with 90-day functional independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0–2), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and 90-day mortality was explored in the overall population and in three modes of onset subgroups (wake-up vs. witnessed vs. unwitnessed).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Out of the 205 patients, 98 (47.8%) and 107 (52.2%) presented in the 6 to 12 hours and 12 to 24 hours time window, respectively. Considering all three modes of onset together, there was no statistically significant association between time last seen well to randomization with either functional independence or mortality at 90 days in either the endovascular thrombectomy (mRS 0–2 1-hour delay OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.93–1.24; mRS 6 OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.65–1.03) or medical management (mRS 0–2 1-hour delay OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.80–1.14; mRS 6 1-hour delay OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.79–1.09) groups. Moreover, there was no significant interaction between treatment effect and time (<i>p</i> = 0.439 and <i>p</i> = 0.421 for mRS 0–2 and 6, respectively). However, within the thrombectomy group, the models that tested the association between time last seen well to successful reperfusion (modified Treatment in Cerebral Infarction ≥2b) and 90-day functional independence showed a significant interaction with mode of presentation (<i>p</i> = 0.013). This appeared to be driven by a nominally positive slope for both witnessed and unwitnessed strokes versus a significantly (<i>p</i> = 0.018) negative slope in wake-up patients. There was no association between treatment times and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Mode of onset modifies the effect of time to reperfusion on thrombectomy outcomes, and should be considered when exploring different treatment paradigms in the extended window. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

	<p>This study explored the role of sensorimotor simulation in modulating the stress response in individuals exposed to stressful digital simulated interviews. Participants were assigned to two different versions of a Digital Social Stress Test: a simulated version with a dynamic&amp;amp;ndash;realistic examining committee (Dyn-DSST) and a version with a static examining committee (Stat-DSST). During interview preparation, behavioral indices reflecting stress regulation and resistance, response times, and electroencephalographic (EEG) and autonomic indices were collected. Higher regulation scores were found for the Stat-DSST group compared to the Dyn-DSST group, probably induced by the presence of limited external sensory input in time and space, perceived as less stressful. The EEG results revealed a distinct contribution of the low- and high-frequency bands for both groups. Dyn-DSST required greater cognitive regulation effort due to the presence of a continuous flow of information, which can enhance sensory and motor activation in the brain. The SCR increased in the Dyn-DSST group compared to the Stat-DSST group, reflecting greater emotional involvement in the Dyn-DSST group and reduced sensory stimulation in the static version. In conclusion, the results suggest that sensorimotor simulation impacts the stress response differently in dynamic interviews compared to static ones, with distinct profiles based on behavioral, EEG, and autonomic measures.</p>

	<p>Melancholia is a major and severe subtype of depression, with only limited data regarding its association with neurological phenomena. To extend the current understanding of how particular aspects of melancholia are correlated with brain activity, electroencephalographic data were collected from 100 adults (44 males and 56 females, all aged 18 y or more) and investigated for the association between symptoms of melancholia and the ratios of alpha/beta activity and theta/beta activity at parietal&amp;amp;ndash;occipital EEG sites PO1 and PO2. The results indicate differences in these associations according to the depressive status of participants and the particular symptom of melancholia. Depressed participants exhibited meaningfully direct correlations between alpha/beta and theta/beta activity and the feeling that &amp;amp;ldquo;Others would be better off if I was dead&amp;amp;rdquo; at PO1, whereas non-depressed participants had significant inverse correlations between theta/beta activity and &amp;amp;ldquo;Feeling useless and not needed&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;I find it hard to make decisions&amp;amp;rdquo; at PO1. The results are discussed in terms of the relative levels of fast-wave (beta) versus slow-wave (alpha, theta) activity exhibited by depressed and non-depressed participants in the parietal&amp;amp;ndash;occipital region and the cognitive activities that are relevant to that region.</p>

	<p>This study examines the impact of response and semantic inhibition on scientific reasoning using fNIRS data from 30 students (15 male, 15 female). Utilizing Go/Nogo and Stroop-like tasks within a modified speeded-reasoning task, it was found that inhibition significantly influences scientific reasoning. Specifically, slower responses and lower accuracy on incongruent statements were linked to increased activity in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). The research shows that both DLPFC and pre-SMA are associated with overcoming misconceptions in scientific reasoning. The findings suggest that understanding inhibitory mechanisms can enhance educational strategies to improve critical thinking and scientific literacy.</p>

	<p>Although previous behavioral studies have associated reactive aggression (RA) and proactive aggression (PA) with traditional masculinity, further investigation is needed into the traditional masculinity-linked neuroanatomical characteristics of RA and PA. This study analyzed the traditional masculinity-by-aggression interaction in 705 participants (350 men) by measuring grey matter volume (GMV). We have expanded on previous studies and found that traditional masculinity was not associated with RA and PA when not controlled for traditional femininity. However, the association appeared when controlling for it. Furthermore, we found significant traditional masculinity-by-RA interactions on the GMV in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus, a region known to be involved in cognitive control. When traditional masculinity scores were 1 standard deviation above the mean, there was a positive correlation between RA and the GMV in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus. Conversely, when traditional masculinity scores were 1 standard deviation below the mean, there was a negative correlation between RA and the GMV in the region. However, no traditional masculinity-linked neuroanatomical characteristics of PA were found. The results indicated that individuals with high/low traditional masculinity perceived RA as a different outcome (gain or loss) of self-control. The results supported an opportunity to develop prevention or intervention strategies for RA.</p>

                Circular RNAs (circRNAs), once thought to be a result of splicing errors, have been found to be involved in various molecular processes and the pathology of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, circRNA expression was found to be altered by lifestyle habits, such as smoking cigarettes. Past studies have revealed that the rate of smoking remains high in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this study, we isolated total RNA from uninfected T-cells that have been exposed to cigarette smoke and compared the expression levels of circRNAs to those of T-cells that were not exposed to cigarette smoke. We identified certain circRNAs that were upregulated or downregulated in T-cells when exposed to cigarette smoke. These data indicate that the study of circRNAs is warranted within the context of HIV.

                Background Physical restraints (PRs) are frequently used in adult critical care units to protect staff and prevent self-harm, despite the fact that they represent significant safety risks. Restraint complications may have an impact on the patient’s long- and short-term outcomes. This integrative review aimed to meticulously evaluate existing evidence pertaining to physical restraint practices in adult critical care settings. The review was specifically geared towards examining the prevalence of PR, identifying influential factors, elucidating the role of nurses in PR implementation, exploring nurses’ experiences in caring for patients under restraint, and scrutinizing the complications associated with PR application Method This integrative review included the studies published between January 2009 and December 2019 and the literature search was conducted in July 2020. The databases searched included EBSCOhost, Ovid, ProQuest, PubMed, Wiley Online Library, SCOPUS, and ScienceDirect. The keywords included in the search were restraint, critical care, intensive care, ICU, mechanical ventilation, intubation, nursing, and experience. A checklist based on the CASP checklist and the JBI Critical Appraisal Tool was used to assess the methodological quality. Results The findings were evaluated and summarized into seven key topics after twenty-one publications were found to be evaluated. i) High prevalence of PR application in adult critical care unit; ii) determinants of PR applications; iii) types of PR in adult critical care units; iv) decision maker of PR; v) moral and ethical dilemma in PR application; vi) awareness and guidelines for PR applications; vii) common complications and use of sedation, analgesics, antipsychotic drugs in PR application. Conclusion The number of days PR is used is related to the risk of an adverse event. In order to standardize nursing practice, ICU nurses require greater training on the ideas of PR use. Evidence-based recommendations will assist critical care nurses in making the best judgments possible concerning the use of PR.

                Background The risk of recurrence after nephrectomy for primary clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is estimated in daily practice solely based on clinical criteria. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic relevance of common somatic mutations with respect to tumor aggressiveness and outcomes of ccRCC patients after definitive treatment. Methods Primary tumors from 37 patients with ccRCC who underwent radical nephrectomy were analyzed for presence of somatic mutations using a 15-gene targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. Associations to histopathologic characteristics and outcomes were investigated in the study cohort (n=37) and validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ccRCC cohort (n=451). Results VHL was the most frequently mutated gene (51%), followed by PBRM1 (27%), BAP1 (13%), SETD2 (13%), KDM5C (5%), ATM (5%), MTOR (5%), and PTEN (3%). One-third of patients did not have any somatic mutations within the 15-gene panel. The vast majority of tumors harboring no mutations at all or VHL-only mutations (51%) were more frequently of smaller size (pT1-2) and earlier stage (I/II), whereas presence of any other gene mutations in various combinations with or without VHL was enriched in larger (pT3) and higher stage tumors (III) (p=0.02). No recurrences were noted in patients with unmutated tumors or VHL-only mutations as opposed to three relapses in patients with non-VHL somatic mutations (p=0.06). Presence of somatic mutations in PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2, KDM5C, ATM, MTOR, or PTEN genes in 451 TCGA ccRCC patients was associated with a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) compared to those with unaltered tumors (q=0.01). Conclusions Preliminary findings from this ongoing study support the prognostic value of non-VHL mutations including PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2, KDM5C, ATM, MTOR, and PTEN in primary ccRCC tumors as surrogates of earlier recurrence and potential selection for adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0476-23.2024?rss=1">Facilitating the Sharing of Electrophysiology Data Analysis Results Through In-Depth Provenance Capture</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientific research demands reproducibility and transparency, particularly in data-intensive fields like electrophysiology. Electrophysiology data are typically analyzed using scripts that generate output files, including figures. Handling these results poses several challenges due to the complexity and iterative nature of the analysis process. These stem from the difficulty to discern the analysis steps, parameters, and data flow from the results, making knowledge transfer and findability challenging in collaborative settings. Provenance information tracks data lineage and processes applied to it, and provenance capture during the execution of an analysis script can address those challenges. We present Alpaca (Automated Lightweight Provenance Capture), a tool that captures fine-grained provenance information with minimal user intervention when running data analysis pipelines implemented in Python scripts. Alpaca records inputs, outputs, and function parameters and structures information according to the W3C PROV standard. We demonstrate the tool using a realistic use case involving multichannel local field potential recordings of a neurophysiological experiment, highlighting how the tool makes result details known in a standardized manner in order to address the challenges of the analysis process. Ultimately, using Alpaca will help to represent results according to the FAIR principles, which will improve research reproducibility and facilitate sharing the results of data analyses.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0511-23.2024?rss=1">Individualized Closed-Loop Acoustic Stimulation Suggests an Alpha Phase Dependence of Sound Evoked and Induced Brain Activity Measured with EEG Recordings</a></h4>

              
                <p>Following repetitive visual stimulation, post hoc phase analysis finds that visually evoked response magnitudes vary with the cortical alpha oscillation phase that temporally coincides with sensory stimulus. This approach has not successfully revealed an alpha phase dependence for auditory evoked or induced responses. Here, we test the feasibility of tracking alpha with scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and play sounds phase-locked to individualized alpha phases in real-time using a novel end-point corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT) algorithm implemented on a research device. Based on prior work, we hypothesize that sound-evoked and induced responses vary with the alpha phase at sound onset and the alpha phase that coincides with the early sound-evoked response potential (ERP) measured with EEG. Thus, we use each subject&rsquo;s individualized alpha frequency (IAF) and individual auditory ERP latency to define target trough and peak alpha phases that allow an early component of the auditory ERP to align to the estimated poststimulus peak and trough phases, respectively. With this closed-loop and individualized approach, we find opposing alpha phase-dependent effects on the auditory ERP and alpha oscillations that follow stimulus onset. Trough and peak phase-locked sounds result in distinct evoked and induced post-stimulus alpha level and frequency modulations. Though additional studies are needed to localize the sources underlying these phase-dependent effects, these results suggest a general principle for alpha phase-dependence of sensory processing that includes the auditory system. Moreover, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using individualized neurophysiological indices to deliver automated, closed-loop, phase-locked auditory stimulation. </p>

                Background Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) represent a growing global health concern, necessitating comprehensive investigations into their prevalence and resistance mechanisms. This study protocol focuses on detecting carbapenemase genes, including blaVIM, blaNDM, blaKPC, blaIPM, and blaOXA-48, in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli from a tertiary hospital in Eastern India. The rise of carbapenem resistance poses challenges to effective antimicrobial therapy and infection control strategies. Methods Conducted at the Department of Microbiology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, the study employs a cross-sectional design from July 2022 to December 2023. The sample size calculation follows Daniel’s formula, considering a non-response rate of 10%. Modified Carbapenem Inactivation Method (mCIM) and EDTA-Modified Carbapenem Inactivation Method (eCIM) will be used for phenotypic detection, along with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for genotypic confirmation. Antibiotic susceptibility testing using the Kirby-Bauer Disk Diffusion method will complement resistance profiling. Expected Outcome Anticipated outcomes include insights into the efficacy of mCIM and eCIM in detecting carbapenem resistance, the prevalence of carbapenemase genes in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, and the antibiotic resistance pattern of carbapenemase-producing CRE. This study aims to provide valuable data for guiding empirical treatment strategies and reinforcing infection control measures in the region.

                Background Obstructive airway diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, pose significant global health challenges. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management. Although Spirometry has traditionally been the cornerstone of diagnostics, Impulse Oscillometry (IOS) has emerged as a promising alternative. This study aims to compare the diagnostic performance of Spirometry and IOS in patients attending the Respiratory Medicine Department at the Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital, Sawangi, India. Methods A Comparative Observational Study was conducted between August 2022 and August 2024, enrolling patients who met specific inclusion criteria. Data were collected through a comprehensive medical history, clinical examination, routine blood tests, chest radiography, High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), spirometry, and IOS. Key parameters, including Forced expiratory volume in the first second FEV1, FEV1/FVC (Forced Expiratory Volume), (Forced Expiratory Volume) FVC, (Forced Expiratory Flow) FEF 25-75 for Spirometry, and R5, R20, fres, X5, and AX for IOS, were analyzed using the Chi-Square Test and Student’s t-test with SPSS 27.0 and GraphPad Prism 7.0. Expected outcome The study included 130 participants with the primary objective of evaluating IOS’s diagnostic advantages of IOS over spirometry. Our findings demonstrate that IOS offers enhanced sensitivity for diagnosing early small airway diseases, which is a crucial factor for early diagnosis in both pediatric and adult populations.

                Background In patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, intradialytic hypertension and intradialytic hypotension are the common complications. The study aimed to collect and assess intradialytic Blood Pressure (BP) complications and their association with different factors, including BP medication. Methods This was a prospective observational study, conducted at the hemodialysis center in a teaching hospital in the UAE, that provide a specialist’s care for the patients receiving ongoing hemodialysis. Patient demographics, medications used, lab data and the peridialytic BP (pre-, intra-, and post-) dialytic BP were collected for a period of 6 months. SPSS Version 29, Armonk, NY was used for statistical analysis. Pearson Chi-square test and Fischer’s Exact test were used to compare the association between categorical variables to intradialytic hypertension and hypotension. Results Blood pressure data was collected from 47 hemodialysis patients for a total of 2616 hemodialysis sessions during the 6 months study period. Beta-blockers (68%) and calcium channel blockers (66%) were the commonly used antihypertensive medications in the study population. Intradialytic hypertension events were diagnosed in 49 hemodialysis sessions and intradialytic hypotension was diagnosed in 23 hemodialysis sessions. On comparing the effect of antihypertensive medication to the occurrence of intradialytic BP complications, ARBs and alpha-1 blockers showed no association to intradialytic hypertension, but beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers use were associated with increased number of intradialytic hypertension events (p-value <0.05). On the other hand, antihypertensive medication use showed no association with intradialytic hypotension. Conclusions Patients using ARBs or alpha-1 blockers had higher intradialytic hypertension events. Beta-blocker and calcium channel users had lower intradialytic hypertension events. Antihypertensive use showed no association with intradialytic hypotension events.

                <p>by Kris Sankaran, Pratheepa Jeganathan</p>

Time series studies of microbiome interventions provide valuable data about microbial ecosystem structure. Unfortunately, existing models of microbial community dynamics have limited temporal memory and expressivity, relying on Markov or linearity assumptions. To address this, we introduce a new class of models based on transfer functions. These models learn impulse responses, capturing the potentially delayed effects of environmental changes on the microbial community. This allows us to simulate trajectories under hypothetical interventions and select significantly perturbed taxa with False Discovery Rate guarantees. Through simulations, we show that our approach effectively reduces forecasting errors compared to strong baselines and accurately pinpoints taxa of interest. Our case studies highlight the interpretability of the resulting differential response trajectories. An R package, mbtransfer, and notebooks to replicate the simulation and case studies are provided.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012165">Threshold-awareness in adaptive cancer therapy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by MingYi Wang, Jacob G. Scott, Alexander Vladimirsky</p>

Although adaptive cancer therapy shows promise in integrating evolutionary dynamics into treatment scheduling, the stochastic nature of cancer evolution has seldom been taken into account. Various sources of random perturbations can impact the evolution of heterogeneous tumors, making performance metrics of any treatment policy random as well. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for selecting optimal adaptive treatment policies under randomly evolving tumor dynamics. The goal is to improve the cumulative “cost” of treatment, a combination of the total amount of drugs used and the total treatment time. As this cost also becomes random in any stochastic setting, we maximize the probability of reaching the treatment goals (tumor stabilization or eradication) without exceeding a pre-specified cost threshold (or a “budget”). We use a novel Stochastic Optimal Control formulation and Dynamic Programming to find such “threshold-aware” optimal treatment policies. Our approach enables an efficient algorithm to compute these policies for a range of threshold values simultaneously. Compared to treatment plans shown to be optimal in a deterministic setting, the new “threshold-aware” policies significantly improve the chances of the therapy succeeding under the budget, which is correlated with a lower general drug usage. We illustrate this method using two specific examples, but our approach is far more general and provides a new tool for optimizing adaptive therapies based on a broad range of stochastic cancer models.

                <p>by Jeremy VanderDoes, Claire Marceaux, Kenta Yokote, Marie-Liesse Asselin-Labat, Gregory Rice, Jack D. Hywood</p>

Tumor microenvironments (TMEs) contain vast amounts of information on patient’s cancer through their cellular composition and the spatial distribution of tumor cells and immune cell populations. Exploring variations in TMEs between patient groups, as well as determining the extent to which this information can predict outcomes such as patient survival or treatment success with emerging immunotherapies, is of great interest. Moreover, in the face of a large number of cell interactions to consider, we often wish to identify specific interactions that are useful in making such predictions. We present an approach to achieve these goals based on summarizing spatial relationships in the TME using spatial <i>K</i> functions, and then applying functional data analysis and random forest models to both predict outcomes of interest and identify important spatial relationships. This approach is shown to be effective in simulation experiments at both identifying important spatial interactions while also controlling the false discovery rate. We further used the proposed approach to interrogate two real data sets of Multiplexed Ion Beam Images of TMEs in triple negative breast cancer and lung cancer patients. The methods proposed are publicly available in a companion R package funkycells.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Synaptic excitation and inhibition are essential for neuronal communication. However, the variables that regulate synaptic excitation and inhibition in the intact brain remain largely unknown. Here, we examined how spike transmission and suppression between principal cells (PCs) and interneurons (INTs) are modulated by activity history, brain state, cell type, and somatic distance between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons by applying cross-correlogram analyses to datasets recorded from the dorsal hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of 11 male behaving and sleeping Long Evans rats. The strength, temporal delay, and brain-state dependency of the spike transmission and suppression depended on the subregions/layers. The spike transmission probability of PC–INT excitatory pairs that showed short-term depression versus short-term facilitation was higher in CA1 and lower in CA3. Likewise, the intersomatic distance affected the proportion of PC–INT excitatory pairs that showed short-term depression and facilitation in the opposite manner in CA1 compared with CA3. The time constant of depression was longer, while that of facilitation was shorter in MEC than in CA1 and CA3. During sharp-wave ripples, spike transmission showed a larger gain in the MEC than in CA1 and CA3. The intersomatic distance affected the spike transmission gain during sharp-wave ripples differently in CA1 versus CA3. A subgroup of MEC layer 3 (EC3) INTs preferentially received excitatory inputs from and inhibited MEC layer 2 (EC2) PCs. The EC2 PC–EC3 INT excitatory pairs, most of which showed short-term depression, exhibited higher spike transmission probabilities than the EC2 PC–EC2 INT and EC3 PC–EC3 INT excitatory pairs. EC2 putative stellate cells exhibited stronger spike transmission to and received weaker spike suppression from EC3 INTs than EC2 putative pyramidal cells. This study provides detailed comparisons of monosynaptic interaction dynamics in the hippocampal–entorhinal loop, which may help to elucidate circuit operations.</p>

                Introduction Diarrhea is a significant health problem in the Third World. Identification of the pathogen that causes diarrhea is vital for measures to prevent and control this disease. There are also very few reports of diarrhea in Sudan. Our study aimed to determine the Prevalence of specific protozoan pathogens (Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium parvum., and Giardia spp) in children in Khartoum, Sudan. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among children under five years of age who were hospitalized with acute diarrhea between April and December 2014. Diarrheal stool samples were collected and E. histolytica, C. parvum, and Giardia spp were examined using multiplex real-time PCR. Results Four hundred and thirty-seven children with acute diarrheawere included in this study; the higher Prevalence of diarrhea was in the age less than ≤ 2 years old (403,92.2%). The male-to-female ratio in this study was 1:1.7. infection with intestinal parasite was found in 155 (35.5%) cases, and co-infection was detected in 16 (10.3%) cases. Giardia spp(18.8%) and C. parvum (15.8 %) were the most frequently identified parasites, followed by E. histolytica (0.9). The parasite infection rate was highest and lowest in the under 2-year-old group (92.3%) and the 2–4-year-old group (7.3%). The infection rate was higher in boys (67.1%) than in girls (32.9%). The incidence of protozoan infection was higher in the rainy season (August to December) (92.2%), corresponding with that in the dry Season (April to June). (7.8%). Discussion Our present study demonstrated the high prevalence of Giardia spp and C. parvum in children with diarrhea in the Khartoum region and the usefulness of the multiplex real-time method in disclosing pathogenic protozoal agents. Our result highlighted the necessity of developing intervention measurement and control strategies to deal with childhood parasitic diarrhea in this region.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26997?af=R">Ischemic Stroke with Comorbid Cancer Has Specific miRNA‐mRNA Networks in Blood That Vary by Ischemic Stroke Mechanism</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately half of ischemic strokes (IS) in cancer patients are cryptogenic, with many presumed cardioembolic. We evaluated whether there were specific miRNA and mRNA transcriptome architectures in peripheral blood of IS patients with and without comorbid cancer, and between cardioembolic versus noncardioembolic IS etiologies in comorbid cancer.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied patients with cancer and IS (CS; n = 42), stroke only (SO; n = 41), and cancer only (n = 28), and vascular risk factor-matched controls (n = 30). mRNA-Seq and miRNA-Seq data, analyzed with linear regression models, identified differentially expressed genes in CS versus SO and in cardioembolic versus noncardioembolic CS, and miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs. Network-level analyses identified stroke etiology-specific responses in CS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 2,085 mRNAs and 31 miRNAs were differentially expressed between CS and SO. In CS, 122 and 35 miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs, and 5 and 3 coexpressed gene modules, were associated with cardioembolic and noncardioembolic CS, respectively. Complement, growth factor, and immune/inflammatory pathways showed differences between IS etiologies in CS. A 15-gene biomarker panel assembled from a derivation cohort (n = 50) correctly classified 81% of CS and 71% of SO participants in a validation cohort (n = 33). Another 15-gene panel correctly identified etiologies for 13 of 13 CS-cardioembolic and 11 of 11 CS-noncardioembolic participants upon cross-validation; 11 of 16 CS-cryptogenic participants were predicted cardioembolic.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We discovered unique mRNA and miRNA transcriptome architecture in CS and SO, and in CS with different IS etiologies. Cardioembolic and noncardioembolic etiologies in CS showed unique coexpression networks and potential master regulators. These may help distinguish CS from SO and identify IS etiology in cryptogenic CS patients. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1506/v2?src=rss">Sex difference in body image, exercise motivation and social comparison among Instagram users: a cross sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                In the 21st century, impact of social media, particularly Social Networking Sites (SNSs) has been linked to a wide range of human beliefs and expectations. Growing body of research has indicated that body image concerns along with exercise motivation and social comparison are on the rise among young adults. The present study aimed to examine the sex difference in body image, exercise motivation and social comparison among people who use Instagram in the age group 20-30. A total of 212 participants (men=106, women=106) aged 20-30 years, who are users of Instagram completed Body Self Image Questionnaire Short Form as a measure of Body image, Exercise Motivation Inventory – 2 as a measure of Exercise Motivation and Instagram as a Tool for Social Comparison as a measure of Social Comparison. Results showed that a significant difference in body image exist across gender with body image issues higher among females and significant difference in exercise motivation across gender with exercise motivation higher among males. No sex differences were seen in social comparison. It was concluded that body image concerns are higher among females and the drive for exercise is higher among males who used Instagram. It was found that body image concerns were higher among people who exercised regularly as well as among those who followed fitness related pages on Instagram as compared to those who did not. These results provide an insight into the sex differences between the variables and future directions can be aimed at conducting an in-depth analysis using body image, exercise motivation and social comparison.
