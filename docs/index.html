              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00010">Computational Advances in Taste Perception: From Ion Channels to Neural Coding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.00010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in computational neuroscience demand models that balance biophysical realism with scalability. We present a hybrid neuron model combining the biophysical fidelity of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) dynamics for taste receptor cells with the computational efficiency of Izhikevich spiking neurons for large-network simulations. Our framework incorporates biomorphic taste cell models, featuring modality-specific receptor dynamics (T1R/T2R, ENaC, PKD) and Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK)-driven ion currents to accurately simulate gustatory transduction. Synaptic interactions are modeled via glutamate release kinetics with alpha-function profiles, AMPA receptor trafficking regulated by phosphorylation, and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to enforce temporal coding. At the network level, we optimize multiscale learning, leveraging both temporal spike synchrony (van Rossum metrics) and combinatorial population coding (rank-order patterns). This approach bridges single-cell biophysics with ensemble-level computation, enabling efficient simulation of gustatory pathways while retaining biological fidelity.

                arXiv:2510.00011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing latent state-space geometry from time series provides a powerful route to studying nonlinear dynamics across complex systems. Delay-coordinate embedding provides the theoretical basis but assumes long, noise-free recordings, which many domains violate. In neuroimaging, for example, fMRI is short and noisy; low sampling and strong red noise obscure oscillations and destabilize embeddings. We propose bootstrap Monte Carlo SSA with a red-noise null and bootstrap stability to retain only oscillatory modes that reproducibly exceed noise. This produces reconstructions that are red-noise-robust and mode-robust, enhancing determinism and stabilizing subsequent embeddings. Our results show that BMC-SSA improves the reliability of functional measures and uncovers differences in state-space dynamics in fMRI, offering a general framework for robust embeddings of noisy, finite signals.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00423">Evolutionary Kuramoto dynamics unravels origins of chimera states in neural populations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.00423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural synchronization is central to cognition However, incomplete synchronization often produces chimera states where coherent and incoherent dynamics coexist. While previous studies have explored such patterns using networks of coupled oscillators, it remains unclear why neurons commit to communication or how chimera states persist. Here, we investigate the coevolution of neuronal phases and communication strategies on directed, weighted networks, where interaction payoffs depend on phase alignment and may be asymmetric due to unilateral communication. We find that both connection weights and directionality influence the stability of communicative strategies -- and, consequently, full synchronization -- as well as the strategic nature of neuronal interactions. Applying our framework to the C. elegans connectome, we show that emergent payoff structures, such as the snowdrift game, underpin the formation of chimera states. Our computational results demonstrate a promising neurogame-theoretic perspective, leveraging evolutionary graph theory to shed light on mechanisms of neuronal coordination beyond classical synchronization models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00764">Emergence of Deviance Detection in Cortical Cultures through Maturation, Criticality, and Early Experience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.00764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mismatch negativity (MMN) in humans reflects deviance detection (DD), a core neural mechanism of predictive processing. However, the fundamental principles by which DD emerges and matures during early cortical development-potentially providing a neuronal scaffold for MMN-remain unclear. Here, we tracked the development of DD in dissociated cortical cultures grown on high-density CMOS microelectrode arrays from 10 to 35 days in vitro (DIV). Cultures were stimulated with oddball and many-standards control paradigms while spontaneous and evoked activity were recorded longitudinally. At early stages, stimulus-evoked responses were confined to fast components reflecting direct activation. From DIV15-20 onward, robust late responses appeared, and deviant stimuli progressively evoked stronger responses than frequent and control stimuli, marking the onset of DD. By DIV30, responses became stronger, faster, and more temporally precise. Neuronal avalanche analysis revealed a gradual transition from subcritical to near-critical dynamics, with cultures exhibiting power-law statistics showing the strongest deviant responses. Nonetheless, DD was also present in non-critical networks, indicating that criticality is not required for its emergence but instead stabilizes and amplifies predictive processing as networks mature. Early oddball experience reinforces the deviant pathway, resulting in faster conduction along those circuits. However, as frequent and deviant pathways become less distinct, the deviance detection index is reduced. Together, these findings demonstrate that DD arises intrinsically through local circuit maturation, while self-organization toward criticality and early experience further refine its strength and timing, providing mechanistic insight into predictive coding in simplified cortical networks and informing the design of adaptive, prediction-sensitive artificial systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01000">Some Further Developments on a Neurobiologically-based Model for Color Sensations in Humans</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.01000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At HVEI-2012, I presented a neurobiologically-based model for trichromatic color sensations in humans, mapping the neural substrate for color sensations to V1-L4: the thalamic recipient layer of the primary visual cortex. In this paper, I propose that V1-L4 itself consists of three distinct sub-layers that directly correspond to the three primary color sensations: blue, red, and green. Furthermore, I apply this model to three aspects of color vision: the three-dimensional (3D) color solid, dichromatism, and ocular agnosticism. Regarding these aspects further: (1) 3D color solid: V1-L4 is known to exhibit a gradient of cell densities from its outermost layer (i.e., its pia side) to its innermost layer (i.e., its white matter side). Taken together with the proposition that the population size of a cell assembly directly corresponds with the magnitude of a color sensation, it can be inferred that the neurobiologically-based color solid is a tilted cuboid. (2) Chromatic color blindness: Using deuteranopia as an example, at the retinal level, M-cones are lost and replaced by L-cones. However, at the cortical level, deuteranopia manifests as a fusion of the two bottom layers of V1-L4. (3) Ocular agnosticism: Although color sensation is monocular, we normally are not aware of which eye we are seeing with. This visual phenomenon can be explained by the nature of ocular integration within V1-L4. A neurobiologically-based model for human color sensations could significantly contribute to future engineering efforts aimed at enhancing human color experiences.

                arXiv:2510.00032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) interpretation using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a novel approach for analyzing brain signals. However, the complex nature of brain activity introduces critical challenges: EEG signals simultaneously encode both cognitive processes and intrinsic neural states, creating a mismatch in EEG paired-data modality that hinders effective cross-modal representation learning. Through a pivot investigation, we uncover complementary relationships between these modalities. Leveraging this insight, we propose mapping EEG signals and their corresponding modalities into a unified semantic space to achieve generalized interpretation. To fully enable conversational capabilities, we further introduce WaveMind-Instruct-338k, the first cross-task EEG dataset for instruction tuning. The resulting model demonstrates robust classification accuracy while supporting flexible, open-ended conversations across four downstream tasks, thereby offering valuable insights for both neuroscience research and the development of general-purpose EEG models.

                arXiv:2501.14615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calcium imaging allows for the parallel measurement of large neuronal populations in a spatially resolved and minimally invasive manner, and has become a gold-standard for neuronal functionality. While deep generative models have been successfully applied to study the activity of neuronal ensembles, their potential for learning single-neuron representations from calcium imaging fluorescence traces remains largely unexplored, and batch effects remain an important hurdle. To address this, we explore supervised variational autoencoder architectures that learn compact representations of individual neurons from fluorescent traces without relying on spike inference algorithms. We find that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art models, preserving biological variability while mitigating batch effects. Across simulated and experimental datasets, this framework enables robust visualization, clustering, and interpretation of single-neuron dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00498">Emergence of robust looming selectivity via coordinated inhibitory neural computations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.00498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the locust's lobula giant movement detector neural pathways, four categories of inhibition, i.e., global inhibition, self-inhibition, lateral inhibition, and feed-forward inhibition, have been functionally explored in the context of looming perception. However, their combined influence on shaping selectivity to looming motion remains unclear. Driven by recent physiological advancements, this paper offers new insights into the roles of these inhibitory mechanisms at multiple levels and scales in simulations, refining the specific selectivity for responding only to objects approaching the eyes while remaining unresponsive to other forms of movement. Within a feed-forward, multi-layer neural network framework, global inhibition, lateral inhibition, self-inhibition, and feed-forward inhibition are integrated. Global inhibition acts as an immediate feedback mechanism, normalising light intensities delivered by ommatidia, particularly addressing low-contrast looming. Self-inhibition, modelled numerically for the first time, suppresses translational motion. Lateral inhibition is formed by delayed local excitation spreading across a larger area. Notably, self-inhibition and lateral inhibition are sequential in time and are combined through feed-forward inhibition, which indicates the angular size subtended by moving objects. Together, these inhibitory processes attenuate motion-induced excitation at multiple levels and scales. This research suggests that self-inhibition may act earlier than lateral inhibition to rapidly reduce excitation in situ, thereby suppressing translational motion, and global inhibition can modulate excitation on a finer scale, enhancing selectivity in higher contrast range.

                arXiv:2401.17231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite advancements in artificial intelligence, object recognition models still lag behind in emulating visual information processing in human brains. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of using neural data to mimic brain processing; however, these often rely on invasive neural recordings from non-human subjects, leaving a critical gap in understanding human visual perception. Addressing this gap, we present, 'Re(presentational)Al(ignment)net', a vision model aligned with human brain activity based on non-invasive EEG, demonstrating a significantly higher similarity to human brain representations. Our innovative image-to-brain multi-layer encoding framework advances human neural alignment by optimizing multiple model layers and enabling the model to efficiently learn and mimic the human brain's visual representational patterns across object categories and different modalities. Our findings suggest that ReAlnets better align artificial neural networks with human brain representations, making it more similar to human brain processing than traditional computer vision models, which takes an important step toward bridging the gap between artificial and human vision and achieving more brain-like artificial intelligence systems.

In particular, when tackling combinatorial optimisation problems with many objectives, that arise in real-world logistic scenarios, better support for the decision maker can be achieved through better understanding of the often complex fitness landscape. This paper makes a contribution in this direction by presenting a technique that allows a visualisation and analysis of the local and global relationships between objectives in optimisation problems with many objectives. The proposed technique uses four steps: First, the global pairwise relationships are analysed using the Kendall correlation method; then, the ranges of the values found on the given Pareto front are estimated and assessed; next, these ranges are used to plot a map using Gray code, similar to Karnaugh maps, that has the ability to highlight the trade-offs between multiple objectives; and finally, local relationships are identified using scatter plots. Experiments are presented for three combinatorial optimisation problems: multiobjective multidimensional knapsack problem, multiobjective nurse scheduling problem, and multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time windows . Results show that the proposed technique helps in the gaining of insights into the problem difficulty arising from the relationships between objectives.

                arXiv:2510.00219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated, natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work, we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time, paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

                arXiv:2510.00373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical control tuning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00698">Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine (PIELM) for Tunnelling-Induced Soil-Pile Interactions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.00698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning systems in geotechnical engineering.

Abstract: In the complex landscape of multivariate time series forecasting, achieving both accuracy and interpretability remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the Fuzzy Transformer (Fuzzformer), a novel recurrent neural network architecture combined with multi-head self-attention and fuzzy inference systems to analyze multivariate stock market data and conduct long-term time series forecasting. The method leverages LSTM networks and temporal attention to condense multivariate data into interpretable features suitable for fuzzy inference systems. The resulting architecture offers comparable forecasting performance to conventional models such as ARIMA and LSTM while providing meaningful information flow within the network. The method was examined on the real world stock market index S\&P500. Initial results show potential for interpretable forecasting and identify current performance tradeoffs, suggesting practical application in understanding and forecasting stock market behavior.

                arXiv:2510.01012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven, fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.

Abstract: The relative power of quantum algorithms, using an adaptive access to quantum devices, versus classical post-processing methods that rely only on an initial quantum data set, remains the subject of active debate. Here, we present evidence for an exponential separation between adaptive and non-adaptive strategies in a quantum circuit recompilation task. Our construction features compilation problems with loss landscapes for discrete optimization that are unimodal yet non-separable, a structure known in classical optimization to confer exponential advantages to adaptive search. Numerical experiments show that optimization can efficiently uncover hidden circuit structure operating in the regime of volume-law entanglement and high-magic, while non-adaptive approaches are seemingly limited to exhaustive search requiring exponential resources. These results indicate that adaptive access to quantum hardware provides a fundamental advantage.

                arXiv:2506.06558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning dynamical systems that respect physical symmetries and constraints remains a fundamental challenge in data-driven modeling. Integrating physical laws with graph neural networks facilitates principled modeling of complex N-body dynamics and yields accurate and permutation-invariant models. However, training graph neural networks with iterative, gradient-based optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSProp, LBFGS) often leads to slow training, especially for large, complex systems. In comparison to 15 different optimizers, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian Graph Networks (HGN) can be trained up to 600x faster--but with comparable accuracy--by replacing iterative optimization with random feature-based parameter construction. We show robust performance in diverse simulations, including N-body mass-spring and molecular systems in up to 3 dimensions and 10,000 particles with different geometries, while retaining essential physical invariances with respect to permutation, rotation, and translation. Our proposed approach is benchmarked using a NeurIPS 2022 Datasets and Benchmarks Track publication to further demonstrate its versatility. We reveal that even when trained on minimal 8-node systems, the model can generalize in a zero-shot manner to systems as large as 4096 nodes without retraining. Our work challenges the dominance of iterative gradient-descent-based optimization algorithms for training neural network models for physical systems.

                <p>The sensorimotor system continuously uses error signals to remain precisely calibrated. We examined how attention influences this automatic and implicit learning process in humans (male and female). Focusing first on spatial attention, we compared conditions in which attention was oriented either toward or away from the visual feedback that defined the error signal. Surprisingly, this manipulation had no effect on the rate of sensorimotor adaptation. Using dual-task methods, we next examined the influence of attentional resources on adaptation. Again, we found no effect of attention, with the rate of adaptation similar under focused and divided attention conditions. However, we found that attention modulates adaptation in an indirect manner: The rate of adaptation was significantly attenuated when the attended stimulus changed from the end of one trial to the start of the next trial. In contrast, similar changes to unattended stimuli had no impact on adaptation. These results suggest that visual attention defines the cues that establish the context for sensorimotor learning.</p>

                <p>The central amygdala (CeA) is an important neuronal hub that integrates external sensory inputs and information about internal states to regulate a range of innate and learned behaviors, including fear learning and memory. Prior studies, leveraging robust fear conditioning assays, have delineated detailed circuit mechanisms underlying the acquisition and recall of fear memories. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying these processes in the CeA remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of the clock output molecule mWAKE/ANKFN1 within the CeA of male mice in fear learning and memory. mWAKE is expressed in multiple neuronal subclusters in the lateral CeA. Surprisingly, mWAKE levels do not exhibit rhythmic expression in the CeA. In line with this observation, expression of the core clock genes PER2 and BMAL also does not cycle in the CeA. Consistent with prior studies, loss of mWAKE function increases intrinsic excitability of CeA neurons. Furthermore, conditional knock-out of mWAKE and chemogenetic activation of CeA<sup>mWAKE</sup> neurons impair fear learning and memory. Finally, we show that mWAKE levels in a subset of CeA neurons are reduced following fear conditioning. These findings suggest a potential molecular mechanism modulating the activity and function of CeA neurons in fear learning and memory.</p>

                <p>While cerebrovascular dysfunction and reactive astrocytosis are extensively characterized hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, the dynamic relationship between reactive astrocytes and cerebral vessels remains poorly understood. Here, we used jGCaMP8f and two-photon microscopy to investigate calcium signaling in multiple astrocyte subcompartments, concurrent with changes in cerebral arteriole activity, in fully awake 7- to 8-month-old male and female 5xFAD mice, a model for AD-like pathology, and wild-type (WT) littermates. In the absence of movement, spontaneous calcium transients in barrel cortex occurred more frequently in astrocyte somata, processes, and perivascular regions of 5xFAD mice. However, evoked arteriole dilations (in response to air puff stimulation of contralateral whiskers) and concurrent calcium transients across astrocyte compartments were reduced in 5xFAD mice relative to WTs. Synchronous activity within multicell astrocyte networks was also impaired in the 5xFAD group. Using a custom application to assess functional coupling between astrocyte end feet and immediately adjacent arteriole segments, we detected deficits in calcium response probability in 5xFAD mice. Moreover, end feet calcium transients following arteriole dilations exhibited a slower onset, reduced amplitude, and lacked relative proportionality to vasomotive activity compared with WTs. The results reveal nuanced alterations in 5xFAD reactive astrocytes highlighted by impaired signaling fidelity between astrocyte end feet and cerebral arterioles. The results have important implications for the mechanistic underpinnings of brain hypometabolism and the disruption of neurophysiologic communication found in AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.</p>

                <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by mislocalization and aggregation of proteins in motor neurons. Ataxin-2 (ATXN2), an RNA-binding protein harboring 22-polyglutamine (polyQ) repeats, is a risk factor for ALS, when its polyQ repeats are expanded to 27&ndash;33 repeats. However, the physiological function of ATXN2 beyond its role in RNA regulation and how polyQ expansion in ATXN2 increases risk for ALS remain unclear. We previously demonstrated that <I>Drosophila</I> Atx2 functions as a regulator of microtubule (MT) dynamics in motor neurons. Here, we uncover the molecular mechanism underlying Atx2-mediated MT regulation and how polyQ expansion disrupts its function, using a mixed-sex population of <I>Drosophila</I> as a model system. Specifically, we show that Atx2 requires its RNA-binding Lsm domain to regulate MTs. Notably, the LSM domains of human ATXN2 rescue MT phenotype in <I>Drosophila</I>, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved role of ATXN2 in MT regulation. Importantly, we find that polyQ-expanded ATXN2 forms cytoplasmic aggregates and leads to excessive MT destabilization. Additionally, polyQ expansion severely impairs axon outgrowth. Finally, we identify uncoordinated-76 (UNC-76/FEZ1) as a downstream effector of Atx2 in MT regulation and neuronal development.</p>

                <p>Behavioral change studies mostly focus on external reinforcements to modify preferences. Cue-approach training (CAT) is a paradigm that influences preferences by the mere association of stimuli, sensory cues, and a rapid motor response, without external reinforcements. The behavioral effect has been shown to last for months after less than 1&nbsp;h of training. Here, we used a modified version of CAT by changing the neutral-cue to a number that represented a monetary amount of reward that the participants accumulate (i.e., incentive-cue). After a single training session, we compared behavioral performance and functional connectivity (FC), as measured by resting-state scans using functional magnetic resonance imaging, between two groups (total of 107 males and females in both groups), one receiving a neutral-cue and the other receiving an incentive-cue, at five time points across 1&nbsp;year. We replicated the maintenance of behavioral changes after 6&nbsp;months for the nonexternally reinforced neutral-cue participants, but not for the reinforced group. The reinforced training group showed higher FC within the limbic system, whereas the nonexternally reinforced group showed higher functional connectivity within and between default mode and dorsal attention networks. Our findings offer putative neural correlates for both reinforced and nonexternally reinforced preference changes that are maintained over time and which could be implemented in future behavioral change interventions.</p>

                <p>Behavioral outcomes are rarely certain, requiring subjects to discriminate between available choices by using feedback to guide future decisions. Probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) tasks test subjects&rsquo; ability to learn and flexibly adapt to changes in reward contingencies. Cortico-striatal circuitry has been broadly implicated in flexible decision-making&mdash;though what role these circuits play remains complicated. In this study we leveraged the fast temporal dynamics of local field potentials to precisely identify the role that cortico-striatal networks play during PRL reward feedback. We measured widespread (32-CH) local field potential activity of male Long&ndash;Evans rats during a PRL task wherein a target response delivered reward on 80% of trials while a non-target response delivered reward on 20% of trials. When subjects learned those reward probabilities, contingencies were reversed. We found that reward-evoked oscillations at beta (15&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) and high gamma (&gt;70&nbsp;Hz) frequencies marked positive reward valence and reflected probability of reward. Activity and connectivity at beta frequencies between orbitofrontal cortex, anterior insula, medial prefrontal cortex, and ventral striatum during expected rewards were correlated with behavioral performance and specific aspects of value/exploitative behavior as defined by a reinforcement learning computational model. Finally, we found that modulating beta activity in orbitofrontal cortex with optogenetic (20&nbsp;Hz) stimulation promoted maladaptive behavior when stimulation was provided during non-target responses, consistent with our data and computational model predictions. Reward-evoked beta oscillations may reflect a crucial component underlying reward learning, and erroneous elevations in this physiological signal may contribute to maladaptive task performance and behavioral disruptions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/40/e1170252025?rss=1">Stopping Muscle Contractions and Relaxations during Action Inhibition Involves Global and Targeted Control Dependent on Muscle State</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mechanisms underpinning the stopping of muscle contractions and relaxations during action inhibition remain unclear. Central stop commands may be targeted and act on task-active muscles only, or instead be global, acting on task-passive muscles as well. We addressed this question in three stop signal task experiments with human participants (<I>n</I> = 54; 18 male, 36 female). While maintaining baseline force levels (10% MVC) in both index fingers, Go signals required participants to increase or decrease this force in the task-active finger (Task-active Contract vs Task-active Relax) while keeping activity in the task-passive muscle constant. On 30% of trials, delayed stop signals instructed participants to stop the task-active responses. Stop-related activity was detected in task-active muscles at the single trial level, using electromyography (EMG), and used to determine whether stop-related activity was also present in task-passive muscles. We found that stop commands act on both task-active and task-passive muscles, suggesting global control. This global control was furthermore muscle state specific, by decreasing muscle activity when stopping contractions and increasing muscle activity when stopping relaxations. However, stopping muscle contractions involved more sustained suppression of muscle activity in task-active than task-passive muscles, suggesting additional targeted control. This was not the case when stopping muscle relaxations, which only showed evidence of global control. Our results may explain how complex, real-world actions are inhibited. Global stop commands that are sensitive to muscle state may rapidly adjust muscle activity across the body, with additional control targeted to contracting, task-active muscles.</p>

                <p>The basal forebrain (BF) acts as a pivotal relay station in the transmission of arousal signals, projecting to both cortical and subcortical structures. Among its downstream targets is the lateral habenula (LHb), which recent research has implicated in the modulation of sleep rhythms and in mediating the loss of consciousness associated with anesthetic agents. In our study, we utilized optogenetic manipulation to selectively modulate the BF<sup>VGluT2/SOM</sup> neuron projection pathway to the LHb, thereby examining its impact on behavioral and electroencephalographic responses to isoflurane anesthesia. Our results demonstrated that in healthy adult male mice, the activation of the BF<sup>SOM</sup>-&gt;LHb projection pathway significantly prolonged the induction time of anesthesia and shortened recovery time, consequently diminishing the anesthetic potency of isoflurane and reducing EEG <I></I> power. In contrast, the inhibition of this pathway yielded the inverse effects. Notably, modulation of the BF<sup>VGluT2</sup>-&gt;LHb projection pathway did not significantly affect the induction or recovery times of isoflurane anesthesia. Employing optogenetics in conjunction with calcium signal recording, we elucidated that the arousing effect of the BF<sup>SOM</sup>-&gt;LHb pathway is attributable to the enhanced inhibitory action of BF<sup>SOM</sup> neurons on LHb<sup>Glu</sup> neurons. This discovery sheds new light on the neural circuits involved in the loss and recovery of consciousness induced by anesthetic drugs, potentially informing future therapeutic strategies.</p>

                <p>Sudden and surprising sensory changes signal environmental events that may require immediate behavioral reactions. In mammals, these changes engage nonspecific "extralemniscal" thalamocortical pathways and evoke large and widespread cortical vertex potentials (VPs). Extralemniscal activity modulates cortical motor output in a variety of tasks and facilitates purposeful and immediate behavioral responses. In contrast, whether the extralemniscal system also affects cortical processing of sensory input transmitted through canonical "lemniscal" thalamocortical pathways remains unknown. Here we tested this hypothesis. In 23 healthy human participants (11 females) we continuously probed lemniscal processing in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) by measuring the early-latency evoked potentials elicited by a stream of high-frequency (9.5&nbsp;Hz) somatosensory electrical stimuli. We concurrently recorded extralemniscal activity by measuring the large VPs elicited by fast-rising and infrequent (~0.1&nbsp;Hz) auditory pure tones. We observed that the amplitude of S1 responses changes as a function of the phase of the VP, an effect consequent to a modulation of lemniscal input at the cortical rather than subcortical level. These findings demonstrate that a transient activation of the extralemniscal system interferes with ongoing cortical functions across different brain systems&mdash;i.e., not only at the level of the motor output but already at the sensory input&mdash;and thereby influences global brain dynamics.</p>

                <p>Acute restraint stress (RS) causes analgesia in humans and laboratory animals, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Recently, we have shown that a multinodal circuitry between the dorsal lateral septum (dLS), lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), and rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) plays an instructive role in RS-induced analgesia (SIA). We found that the dLS neurons are activated when mice struggle to escape the restraint, and we wondered about the origin of the escape signals. Hence, we performed retrograde viral labeling from the dLS and found that the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), a known anatomical substrate for escape behaviors, provides inputs to the dLS. Through anatomical, behavioral, and in vivo fiber photometry, we show that the PAG and dLS neurons are synaptically connected; activation of either PAG or the postsynaptic dLS neurons is sufficient to cause analgesia and, when inhibited, cause hyperalgesia. Moreover, we found that the dLS neurons that receive inputs from PAG send axonal projections to the LHA. Together, our data indicate that the vlPAG neurons encoding nociceptive and escape behaviors provide synaptic inputs to the dLS&ndash;LHA&ndash;RVM circuitry to mediate acute restraint SIA in both male and female mice.</p>

                <p>A key process for successful working memory is to prioritize task-relevant information over distraction, i.e., to control attentional deployment. Here we investigate to what extent attentional control during a delayed match-to-sample task can be achieved when to-be-remembered items were presented unconsciously together with distracting information and with a prestimulus cue that indicated whether the target was likely to appear on the left or right side of the screen. This expectation was sometimes violated (20% of trials), requiring reorienting of attention to successfully solve the task. Moreover, the cue was uninformative of the exact location of the target, which could appear on the top, middle, or bottom part of the screen. Participants performed better than chance on unconscious trials only when the cue correctly indicated target side, suggesting an inability to reorient attention when the cues were invalid. Neural activity (fMRI BOLD signal change) in medial and lateral prefrontal cortex was significant for unconscious valid-cue trials and remained significant for invalid-cue trials only in the lateral prefrontal cortex, although neither region was significantly modulated by cue validity. Parietal regions did not show significant activation for valid or invalid unconscious stimuli. Thus, even though activity in brain regions associated with cognitive control reached significant levels for unconscious stimuli, there was no evidence for adaptive deployment of selective attention based on unconscious information, which was the case for conscious stimuli. The ability to control attentional deployment appears to differ between conscious and unconscious working memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-797/v2?src=rss">Multiparty democracy, social cohesion, and human development in Sub-Saharan Africa: A panel data analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The reintroduction of multiparty democracy in Sub-Saharan Africa during the early 90s and the persistent poor human development performance of the region, have sparked several controversies regarding the need for such a political system in Africa. In the extant literature, these controversies have been characterized by fierce theoretical debates as to whether multiparty democracy influences human development and the scholarly contention that social cohesion, rather than this form of democracy leads to development. Objectives The present study examines these controversies along with the perception of Sub-Saharan African populations concerning the democratic transition and its impact on their well-being. To this aim, the following objectives have been formulated: to determine the effect of multiparty democracy on human development; to determine the effect of social cohesion on human development; and to determine the effect of the interaction between multiparty democracy and social cohesion on human development. Methods A panel data analysis of 35 countries was conducted between 1995 and 2019 to test the research hypotheses. Fixed-effects and system generalized methods of moments estimations were used to control for specific characteristics. Results The study found that, multiparty democracy, social cohesion, and the interaction between these two variables have a positive long-term effect on human development. More importantly, the study revealed that social cohesion decreases the negative influence of multiparty democracy on human development. Conclusions Overall, the findings of this study suggest that multiparty democracy is likely to improve the well-being of the populations of Sub-Saharan Africa if the degree of social cohesion is sufficiently high. As such, social cohesion is critical in terms of the extent to which multiparty democracy wields influence on human development outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa. Based on these conclusions, the study calls for comprehensive policy interventions—ranging from institutional reforms to the implementation of home-grown policies—to achieve sustained human development in the region.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1020/v1?src=rss">Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in ANK3 and Psychiatric Risk: A Meta-Analysis, Systematic Review, and Quantitative Trait Locus Insights [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Ankyrin 3 (Ankyrin G), encoded by the ANK3 gene, is a membrane-associated scaffold protein critical for neuronal signaling and highly enriched in axonal initial segments and nodes of Ranvier. ANK3 variants have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Objectives To identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ANK3 associated with psychiatric disorders, assess population-specific significance, determine variant locations, and explore regulatory effects through quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. Methods A meta-analysis and systematic literature review were conducted to identify disease-associated SNPs in ANK3. QTL analyses were performed using datasets from the eQTL Catalogue and GTEx v10 to evaluate regulatory effects in brain tissues. Results Meta-analysis identified significant associations between ANK3 SNPs and psychiatric disorders. In bipolar disorder, rs10994336 (OR = 1.28, P = 1.04×10−4) was significant in European+North American populations; rs9804190 was protective in Europeans (OR = 0.88, P = 0.020); and rs1938526 was significant in both European+North American (OR = 1.32, P = 7.26×10−12) and Asian populations (OR = 1.08, P = 4.68×10−12), with an overall effect (OR = 1.17, P = 0.003). In schizophrenia, rs10761482 showed opposite effects: protective in Chinese (OR = 0.74, P = 0.002) and risk-associated in Iranian cohorts (OR = 1.57, P = 0.025). rs10994359 was protective in major depressive disorder in Asians (OR = 0.69, P = 0.016), and three SNPs reduced PTSD risk (OR = 0.48, P = 0.045). All significant variants were intronic. QTL analyses showed rs10761482 increased ANK3 expression in neocortex (P = 0.001) and neurons (P = 0.038); three PTSD SNPs showed robust cerebellar splicing effects (FDR = 0.010); and apaQTLs indicated modest 3′-UTR effects in putamen. Conclusion Multiple intronic ANK3 SNPs are significantly associated with psychiatric disorders and display tissue-specific regulatory effects. Integrating QTL data provides insights into their potential functional roles in neuropsychiatric pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1019/v1?src=rss">Utilizing anatomical information for signal detection in functional magnetic resonance imaging [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background We are considering the statistical analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. As demonstrated in previous work, grouping voxels into regions (of interest) and carrying out a multiple test for signal detection on the basis of these regions typically leads to a higher sensitivity when compared with voxel-wise multiple testing approaches. Methods In the case of a multi-subject study, we propose to define the regions for each subject separately based on their individual brain anatomy, represented, e.g., by regional labels. The aggregation of the subject-specific evidence for the presence of signals in the different regions is then performed by means of a combination function for p-values. We validate the proposed methodology with simulated data and apply it to real fMRI data of a hypothesis-driven approach towards identifying brain regions involved in understanding software code. Results The results of our simulated data show that our proposed method demonstrated significantly higher power in detecting true activation. Testing our method on real fMRI data, we found that our approach yields overlapping results with a two-stage approach for which two independent experiments are needed, one for defining the regions and one for actual signal detection. Conclusions In this paper, we overall demonstrate that our method of utilizing anatomical information is a candidate to provide a more sensitive analysis of fMRI data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1018/v1?src=rss">Application of Modified Flanders Interaction Analysis During Mathematics Lessons in Lagos State Senior Secondary Schools [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective This study examined the application of Modified Flanders Interaction Analysis during mathematics lessons in senior secondary schools in the Festac area of Lagos State, Nigeria. Methods The study employed a descriptive survey design to observe and analyse classroom interactions between teachers and students, focusing on verbal and non-verbal communication. Researchers used a structured observation schedule to collect data from a purposively selected sample of 10 mathematics teachers and 725 students across five schools. The researchers designed the instrument to collect information on teachers’ and students’ interaction patterns in the classroom. They analysed the data using mean scores, standard deviation, percentages, and t-test statistics, applying a 0.05 significance level for hypothesis testing. Findings The results of the analysis revealed that teachers dominate all the activities in the classroom; that is, the teachers were the active people in the classes, while the students were just passive listeners and moderate engagement through non-verbal behaviours. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between teacher and student patterns, particularly verbal behaviours. The study underscores that mathematics classes in senior secondary schools in the Festac area of Lagos State were teachers-centered. Conclusion Based on the study findings, the researchers recommended that mathematics teachers adopt more student-centered teaching approaches to enhance active student participation and engagement during lessons. Also, they should not be too strict, but they should be approachable, friendly, and accommodating so that the students will not be afraid to ask questions during or after the lesson, enhancing their performance. Hence, the government should ensure that teacher training programs incorporate observation techniques to effectively equip teachers with the skills to assess and improve classroom interaction.

                Growing evidence documents that the influence of sedentary behaviors on brain health is not universally beneficial or detrimental but rather context-dependent and nuanced. More specifically, recent findings suggest that mentally active sedentary behavior, such as video gaming, may benefit brain health, whereas mentally passive sedentary behavior, such as television viewing, may not convey such benefits. However, traditional classification approaches do not fully recognize the importance of content relevance. In this opinion article, we propose a neurobiological, dual-axis framework combining mental activation and content relevance to distinguish effects of specific sedentary behavior types on brain health-related outcomes. This refined sedentary behavior taxonomy may open novel perspectives to clarify mechanisms and the roles of key moderators (e.g., age and life context) in future brain health research for enhanced public health strategies and more personalized lifestyle recommendations.

The strategy uses high-throughput experiments to generate data about enzyme-mediated reactions, and there is a tool that can predict compatible substrate–enzyme pairs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106614">The influence of temporal context on vision over multiple time scales</a></h4>

              
                Past sensory experiences influence perception of the present. Multiple research subfields have emerged to study this phenomenon at different temporal scales. These phenomena fall into three categories: the influence of immediately preceding sensory events (micro), expectations established by short sequences of events (meso), and regularities over long sequences of events (macro). In a single paradigm, we examined the influence of temporal context on human perception at each scale. By integrating behavioral and pupillometry recordings with electroencephalographical recordings from a previous study, we identify two distinct mechanisms that operate across all scales. The first is moderated by attention and supports rapid motor responses to expected events. The second operates independently of task demands and dampens the feedforward neural responses produced by expected events, leading to unexpected events eliciting earlier and more precise neural representations.

                Mutations in the X-linked <i>ZDHHC9</i> gene cause cognitive deficits in humans, with a subset of patients suffering from epilepsy. X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) is often ascribed to neuronal deficits, but here we report that expression of human and mouse ZDHHC9 orthologs is far higher in myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) than in other CNS cell types. <i>ZDHHC9</i> codes for a protein acyltransferase (PAT), and we found that ZDHHC9 is the most highly expressed PAT in OLs. Wild-type ZDHHC9 localizes to Golgi outposts in OL processes, but other PATs and XLID mutant forms of ZDHHC9 are restricted to OL cell bodies. Using genetic tools for OL progenitor fate tracing and sparse cell labeling, we show that mice lacking <i>Zdhhc9</i> have grossly normal OL development but display extensive morphological and structural myelin abnormalities. Consistent with the hypothesis that these deficits are OL-autonomous, they are broadly phenocopied by acute <i>Zdhhc9</i> knockdown in cultured conditions. Finally, we found that ZDHHC9 palmitoylates Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) in heterologous cells, and that palmitoylation of MBP is impaired in the <i>Zdhhc9</i> knockout brain. Our findings provide critical insights into the mechanisms of <i>ZDHHC9</i>-associated XLID and shed new light on the palmitoylation-dependent control of myelination.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106403">Patchy striatonigral neurons modulate locomotor vigor in response to environmental valence</a></h4>

              
                Spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in the dorsal striatum play crucial roles in locomotion control and value-based decision-making. SPNs, which include both direct-pathway striatonigral and indirect-pathway striatopallidal neurons, can be further classified into subtypes based on distinct transcriptomic profiles and cell body distribution patterns. However, how these SPN subtypes regulate spontaneous locomotion in the context of environmental valence remains unclear. Using Sepw1-Cre transgenic mice, which label a specific SPN subtype characterized by a patchy distribution of cell bodies in the dorsal striatum, we found that these patchy striatonigral neurons constrain motor vigor in response to valence differentials. In a modified light/dark box test, mice exhibited differential walking speeds between the light and dark zones. Genetic ablation of these patchy SPNs disrupted restful slowing in the dark zone and increased zone discrimination by speed. In vivo recordings linked the activity of these neurons to zone occupancy, speed, and deceleration, with a specific role in mediating deceleration. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of patchy SPNs—and optical activation of striatonigral neurons in particular—reduced locomotion and attenuated speed-based zone discrimination. These findings reveal that a subtype of patchy striatonigral neurons regulates implicit walking speed selection based on innate valence differentials.

">Cerebral Bases and Neural Dynamics of Audiovisual Temporal Binding Window: a TMS study</a></h4>

              
                The temporal binding window (TBW) refers to the time interval within which two stimuli, typically visual and auditory, are perceived as synchronous. Neural bases underlying this process consistently implicate a large-scale network with superior temporal sulcus (STS) as a central hub, alongside contributions from primary auditory and visual cortices and higher-order areas including prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex. This study aimed to provide causal evidence for the involvement of superior temporal gyrus (STG) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) in the simultaneity judgment (SJ) task using MRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In particular, we aimed to clarify temporal dynamics of these regions in audiovisual synchrony perception. Forty adults performed an SJ task in which they had to determine whether stimuli were synchronous or asynchronous. Single-pulse TMS was applied over bilateral IPS, STG, or the vertex at different delays following stimulus offset. Early stimulation of left IPS and right STG increased the proportion of "synchronous" responses. In contrast, later stimulation of bilateral STG was associated with reduced synchrony perception. These findings provide causal evidence for a dynamic interplay between parietal and temporal regions in audiovisual temporal integration. Early IPS and STG involvement facilitates temporal integration, while later STG activity promotes perceptual segregation.

">Exploring Single-Cell Gene Regulatory Dynamics in Rett Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Rett syndrome is a monogenic disorder with an incidence of 95% in women, characterized by the complexity of studying the associated phenotype due to the heterogeneity in patient tissues from the stochastic silencing of the affected X chromosome. Furthermore, we are largely unaware of the cascade of alterations that occur in neurons due to transcriptional changes induced by the affected MECP2 gene. To address these challenges, an in-depth network analysis was implemented using organoid single-cell transcriptomic data derived from human patients. We performed a Weighted correlation network analysis and trajectory analysis to understand the differences in the developmental processes between samples, we followed by the generation of gene regulatory networks for each relevant cell developmental pathways to assess the master regulator that are involved in this process with potential therapeutic implications which we identified by integration with SFARI and Genes4Epi. The results were adapted into dynamic Boolean models from fitted with the transcriptomic data for validation in which we evaluated the attractor field from each reachable state . These approaches allowed us to explore differences in regulatory behavior in the developmental pathways. Our study provides an insight that pinpoints the cellular stages on which the regulation and compensatory mechanism activate and regulate Rett syndrome. We identified 19 Master regulators for the Dopaminergic developmental trajectory, as well as 34 Master regulator genes for the Gabaergic developmental trajectory. Dynamic Boolean modeling of this systems showcased a comprehensive understanding of the disrupted developmental pathways of Rett syndrome, highlighting the transitional states of potential within maturation trajectories as the key point of divergence in regulation for Rett syndrome. After complementing with enrichment and clinical relevant variant analysis, we identify the key actors in this system as NR2F1 and TCF4, with TCF4 suggesting a symmetrical compensatory relationship with MeCP2, and NR2F1 as possible link with wider developmental conditions, this concluded with highlighting the possibility of regulation in this condition being affected by the MAPK-ERK pathway of transcriptional regulation in this condition being affected by the MAPK-ERK pathway of transcriptional regulation, offering a novel angle for targeted research.

">Menstrual cycle phase alters corticospinal excitability and spike-timing-dependent plasticity in healthy females</a></h4>

              
                The known fluctuations in ovarian hormone concentrations across the eumenorrheic menstrual cycle contribute to modulations in cortical excitability and inhibition. However, how such changes affect spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) has not been systematically studied. This research aimed to determine the effect of the menstrual cycle on corticospinal excitability and STDP. Twelve eumenorrheic female participants (age: 25 {+/-} 5 years), visited the lab in three menstrual cycle phases: early follicular (EF), late follicular (LF), and mid-luteal (ML). Visits comprised of corticospinal excitability (motor evoked potential [MEP]/Mmax), short-intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) measures, recorded in the resting first dorsal interosseous. Followed by a paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, utilising ulnar nerve and transcranial magnetic stimulation (25 ms interstimulus interval) to elicit neuroplasticity. To assess the time course of STDP, measurements were repeated at 15 and 30-minutes post PAS. Corticospinal excitability (MEP/Mmax) was greater in the LF phase (p [&le;]0.002) compared to EF and ML, with no phase effects observed for SICI or ICF (p[&ge;]0.112). PAS elicited an increase in MEP/Mmax across all phases at 15-minutes (112 {+/-} 5, 115 {+/-} 5, and 113 {+/-} 7% baseline, p[&le;]0.010), whereas at 30-minutes only ML was facilitated (126 {+/-} 7% baseline, p=0.029). The present data demonstrates facilitatory STDP can be induced with PAS across the tested menstrual cycle phases, but responses are prolonged and potentiated in the ML phase. Additionally, increased corticospinal excitability in the LF phase is likely due to intrinsic changes within the descending tract, as no changes in intracortical neurotransmission were observed.

">Effects of combined prenatal exposure to air pollution and maternal stress on immune and dopaminergic gene expression in the gut-brain axis</a></h4>

              
                Air pollution and maternal stress during pregnancy are both risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders and often converge on the same communities. Epidemiological and animal studies suggest that maternal psychosocial stress may worsen the effects of air pollutants on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Previous work utilizing a mouse model of combined prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP) and maternal stress (MS) has found numerous sex-specific effects of DEP/MS exposure on neuroimmune outcomes, dopamine receptors, the gut-brain axis, and social behavior. However, it is unclear how broadly the immune landscape is shifted in the brain and intestinal epithelium following DEP/MS. Here, we analyzed immune gene expression in 5 brain regions important for social behavior and in 3 regions of the intestinal epithelium in both male and female offspring following either DEP/MS or control exposure. We found several interesting overall patterns. First, changes in expression of immune genes such as CD11b and Tlr4 were concentrated in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus. Tlr4 and Il-17ra mRNA also increased in the jejunum and colon following DEP/MS, but only in females. Second, in the nucleus accumbens, catecholamine-O-methyltransferase (Comt) and dopamine transporter 1 (Slc6a3) gene expression were increased following DEP/MS indicating increased dopamine degradation at and reuptake from the synapse, respectively. Additionally, Drd2 mRNA was decreased following DEP/MS in males. Finally, we observed numerous sex differences in immune gene expression regardless of treatment in both the brain and gut. Together, these findings suggest the nucleus accumbens is a key site for neuroimmune and dopaminergic changes following DEP/MS exposure and indicate persistent female-specific changes in intestinal immunity following these prenatal exposures.

">Impact of Connectivity Granularity: A Comparison of ROI and Network-Level Approaches for Early Schizophrenia Classification</a></h4>

              
                While schizophrenia diagnosis relies on clinical interviews, there is growing interest in neuroimaging-based computational tools to aid classification. In particular, resting-state fMRI-derived functional connectivity has been explored as a potential biomarker, with applications not only in supporting clinical assessment but also in research contexts such as patient stratification and probing disease mechanisms. Here, we compare two common approaches to computing functional connectivity - region of interest (ROI)-level and brain network-level - and evaluate their predictive power for classifying first-episode schizophrenia patients, in contrast to most prior work focusing on chronic patients. We show that ROI-level features consistently outperform network-level features. Despite the simplicity of our classification models, we achieved accuracies up to 83.15% using the AAL90 atlas. We also found that non-lagged functional connectivity generally outperforms lagged variants, suggesting that added temporal complexity may introduce noise rather than improve predictive power. Overall, our findings highlight region-based connectivity from a medium-resolution atlas as a promising representation for early-stage schizophrenia classification, while emphasising the need for validation on independent datasets to confirm generalisability.

">Contralateral-Ipsilateral Segregation as a Conserved Principle of the Visual Corpus Callosum</a></h4>

              
                How the corpus callosum (CC) integrates the left and right visual fields to create a unified perceptual experience is a fundamental unresolved question. It remains unresolved whether the CC transmits this information via segregated parallel channels or through mixed, integrated pathways. Here, we resolve this by creating a multimodal functional blueprint of the forceps major (FMA), the principal component of the visual callosum, in humans and mice. By combining ultra-high-field 7T fMRI with Bayesian population receptive field (pRF) modeling in humans, we directly test the competing hypotheses: segregated streams should manifest as voxels dominated by single pRFs, whereas integrated signals would produce voxels with multiple pRFs. Our results reveal a functionally segregated architecture dominated by single pRFs (expected probability 0.92), forming parallel streams that represent the contralateral (87.7%) and distinct ipsilateral (12.3%) visual field. In contrast, integrative dual pRFs are sparse and localized to the cortical boundary, reflecting the localized convergence of bilateral axons. This organizational principle is anatomically corroborated at the mesoscale in the mouse, where dual-color neuronal viral tracing and whole-brain light sheet microscopy imaging reveal a complementary laminar segregation of callosal fibers. Collectively, these findings establish that the visual callosum operates as a set of parallel, segregated information conduits, providing a new framework for understanding unified visual perception and for investigating callosal disruptions in neurological disorders.

">Computational modelling of novelty detection in the mismatch negativity protocols and its impairments in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                The human auditory system rapidly distinguishes between novel and familiar sounds, a process reflected in mismatch neg- ativity (MMN), an EEG-based biomarker of auditory novelty detection. MMN is impaired in psychiatric conditions, most notably schizophrenia (SCZ), yet the neuronal mechanisms underlying this deficit remain unclear. Here, we combined com- putational modelling and genetic analyses to investigate how SCZ-associated cellular abnormalities affect auditory novelty detection. We developed an integrate-and-fire spiking network model capable of detecting four types of auditory novelty, including stimulus omission. Based on assumptions of short-term depressing synapses between the subpopulations of the net- work and the existence of neuronal inputs that are phase-locked to the rhythm of the recently experienced stimulus sequence, the model reliably reproduced MMN-like novelty detection and allowed systematic testing of SCZ-related cellular alterations. Simulations revealed that both reduced pyramidal cell excitability, linked to ion-channel dysfunction, and decreased spine density impaired novelty detection, with the latter producing stronger deficits. Our work provides a flexible spiking network model of auditory novelty detection that can link cellular-level abnormalities to measurable MMN deficits, improving their mechanistic interpretation and helping to explain the heterogeneity of SCZ.

">Target engagement in human motor cortex induced by constant sinusoidal and amplitude-modulated transcranial AC stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a noninvasive technique for modulating brain oscillations. While sinusoidal tACS (sin-tACS) delivers current at a constant amplitude, amplitude-modulated tACS (AM-tACS) uses a high-frequency carrier modulated by a low-frequency envelope. We systematically compared the acute effects of sin-tACS at theta (5 Hz), alpha (10 Hz), beta (20 Hz), and gamma (140 Hz) frequencies, and AM-tACS (140 Hz carrier frequency modulated at theta, alpha, or beta) on corticospinal excitability. Healthy participants received 2 mA peak-to-peak tACS to the primary motor hand area (M1HAND) via a bipolar montage (M1HAND-Pz). Each tACS block consisted of ten 30-second stimulation periods interleaved with 6-second pauses, followed by 11 minutes without stimulation. Corticospinal excitability was assessed during each block using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), delivered at the peak and trough of tACS. MEP amplitudes were generally larger at the trough. Only beta sin-tACS and theta AM-tACS significantly modulated corticospinal excitability. Beta sin-tACS increased MEP amplitudes in early stimulation epochs, while theta AM-tACS facilitated MEPs in later stimulation epochs and this facilitation persisted briefly after stimulation ended. Participants with stronger early responses to beta sin-tACS also tended to show greater delayed effects with theta AM-tACS. These excitability changes during tACS were not predicted by simulated electric field strength. A follow-up EEG experiment revealed that beta sin-tACS increased beta power over left sensorimotor cortex, while theta AM-tACS decreased beta power over midline parietal cortex. These EEG changes were restricted to tACS pauses. The results show that sin-tACS and AM-tACS can both modulate corticospinal excitability, but functional changes differ in temporal dynamics, frequency specificity, and cortical region engagement.

">A validated set of neural gene reporter mice and chemical tracers tools for mapping knee innervating neurons</a></h4>

              
                Joint pain is an increasing concern for our aging population, as current therapies to slow joint disease progression or reduce pain are largely ineffective and often carry significant health and dependency risks. Age and joint disease induce changes to all tissues that make up the joint, including the dense neural network that innervates the joint. Several studies have correlated some joint innervation changes in joint diseases such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, but little is known about their respective functional consequences. In general, knee innervating neurons are classified as either non/peptidergic nociceptive or sympathetic neurons. How subtypes of these neurons affect individual pain experience remains relatively uncharacterized. The few studies typically focused on a single neural subtype due to the limited availability of validated tools to study joint innervation1-5. To better understand the relationship between aging, joint disease, and pain, systematic characterization of pain nociceptors and other neural subtypes that regulate joint homeostasis and pain signaling is urgently needed. The objective of this study was to establish a validated molecular and genetic toolbox for accurate mapping of the neuroarchitecture in the murine knee. We screened a panel of genetic reporter mice, consisting of Cre and Flp recombinase driver mouse lines that activate recombinase responsive reporter alleles in either peripheral nociceptors or post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons, for their specificity and accuracy in labeling their respective neural subtype in the dorsal root ganglion and knee joint. In addition, we compared the performance of a series of conventional retrograde tracers for effective tracking of primary afferent sensory and post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons from the knee joint. The validated molecular and genetic tools identified in this study will facilitate the creation of comprehensive joint innervation maps in physiological and pathological contexts, setting the stage for identifying the cellular and molecular changes responsible for mediating joint pain, a necessary goal for improved therapeutic interventions.

">Disrupted Regional Dynamics of Structure-Function Connectivity Coupling in Euthymic Bipolar Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by persistent disturbances in emotional regulation and cognitive function, even during euthymia, yet its neural mechanisms remain unclear. Given evidence of structural and dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) abnormalities in BD, investigating dynamic structure-function connectivity coupling (SC-FC coupling) may provide insights into the pathophysiology of the disorder. Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state fMRI data were collected from 61 euthymic BD-I patients and 54 healthy controls (HC). Structural connectivity was derived using probabilistic tractography, and dFC was estimated with a sliding-window approach. SC-FC coupling was quantified as the extent to which structural features predicted dFC using multivariate linear regression. Abnormal SC-FC coupling in BD was assessed at both the network and regional levels, relative to HC. Over time, SC-FC coupling was categorized into high- and low-coupling states, and dynamic state analyses of dwell time, occurrence rate, and transition probabilities were performed in the affected brain regions. Results: Network-level analyses indicated that BD exhibits lower SC-FC coupling in subcortical regions compared with HC. Regional analyses revealed significantly reduced dynamic SC-FC coupling in two thalamic subregions (medial posterior and rostral temporal) and in the right primary somatosensory cortex in BD compared to HC. Dynamic analyses further demonstrated thalamic instability: BD showed shorter dwell times in high-coupling states, increased occurrence of low-coupling states, and more frequent high-to-low coupling transitions than HC. These abnormalities suggest that BD is characterized by disrupted structure-function integration and unstable thalamocortical dynamics. Conclusion: Our findings reveal regional abnormalities in SC-FC coupling dynamics in BD, indicating persistent dysfunction of structure-function integration during euthymia. Dynamic coupling measures may provide preliminary insights into potential biomarkers for disease monitoring.

">Flexible gaze reinstatement during working memory for natural scenes</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) representations may be more action-oriented and anatomically widespread than previously assumed. For instance, oculomotor signatures like gaze biases can reflect spatial WM content. However, the specificity and functional relevance of such signatures is unclear. Here, we tracked eye gaze during WM for naturalistic images, and manipulated which image features were most task-relevant (visual or semantic). In two experiments, we found that the eyes carried out item-specific spatiotemporal gaze sequences during WM maintenance, retracing the scanpath from stimulus encoding. Therefore, gaze patterns during WM track the identity of complex, natural images held in mind. Moreover, the degree of such WM gaze reinstatement was stronger when the task prioritized visual detail, and ramped up in anticipation of the test probe. Oculomotor WM signals are therefore malleable to when and how the content will be used, indicating that distributed WM representations are prospectively-oriented and functionally flexible to situational needs.

">Beyond the straight path: high-density laminar recordings in the ventral hippocampus with curved microprobes</a></h4>

              
                Brain function is governed by neural circuits distributed across an intricate, three-dimensional landscape of anatomically complex structures. Current methods for monitoring neural activity are limited to investigating structures that lie along a single, linear trajectory. While this approach is effective for columnar regions, such as dorsal cortical areas or the relatively planar dorsal hippocampus, it fails in deep or curved structures, like the ventral hippocampus, where a linear probe can only achieve with difficulty the combination of physical access and perpendicular orientation required for recordings across all layers. To overcome this limitation, we developed a multisite microelectrode array with a pre-formed curved geometry, engineered to align perpendicularly with neuronal layers in deep anatomical targets regardless of their orientation. This interface integrates a polymer-based array, featuring 16 PEDOT:BF4-coated microelectrodes for robust signal acquisition, with a dissolvable silk stiffener for precise surgical insertion. The resulting device exhibited excellent electrical properties (avg. impedance 18 k{Omega}) and enabled accurate placement across the distinct neuronal layers of the ventral hippocampus CA1 region. These capabilities allowed for successful recordings of both local field potentials and single-unit activity from this region, providing a powerful new tool to investigate the network dynamics of previously inaccessible neural circuits.

">Spacetime concordance in the primate cortex</a></h4>

              
                The expanding scale and complexity of functional brain image datasets require space-time analytics. Spacetime concordance (STC) meets this need through an adaptive and robust framework optimized for high-speed analysis. At the core of STC, the Regional Functional Affinity (RFA) metric quantifies functional diversity and uniformity in primate connectomes using wakeful fMRI. This data-driven optimization achieves considerably faster processing, becoming broadly relevant to comparative neuroscience applications. We validated this approach using large-scale datasets from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (N = 1,003) and the NIH Marmoset Brain Mapping Project (N = 26). Results demonstrate striking correspondence between parcellation boundaries of HCP atlas and functional heterogeneity, with boundary lines consistently aligning with regions of low RFA values. In humans, higher-order association networks exhibited lower RFA values indicating functional diversity, while primary sensorimotor networks displayed higher RFA values reflecting uniformity. Cross-species analysis revealed evolutionary conservation of this organizational principle alongside species-specific adaptations. The RFA metric successfully bridges discrete parcellation schemes and continuous models of brain function, offering new insights into primate brain organization and evolution.

">Beyond seizure control: identifying deficits in cognitive networks in absence seizure.</a></h4>

              
                Absence epilepsy is frequently associated with cognitive impairments, yet the direct or indirect involvement of cognitive circuits remains poorly understood, as spike-and-wave discharges are rarely reported in these regions. Here, we investigate the role of a thalamic-prefrontal pathway in a mouse model of absence epilepsy (Scn8a+/-). We find that Scn8a+/- mice exhibit deficits in reversal learning, along with impaired recruitment of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons by the Reuniens nucleus of the thalamus. This deficit is accompanied by an altered excitation-inhibition balance and reduced excitability of layer I interneurons in the mPFC, which constitutes the main recipient zone of reuniens inputs to the mPFC. Remarkably, stimulation of Reuniens at 20 Hz significantly reduces seizure incidence and improves performance in reversal learning. Our findings reveal previously unrecognized cognitive circuit dysfunctions in absence epilepsy and highlight the thalamo-prefrontal axis as a promising target for both cognitive and seizure-related interventions.

">Data-driven burst shape analysis for functional phenotyping of neuronal cultures</a></h4>

              
                Cultures of neurons in vitro are instrumental for studying network dynamics in normal and pathological conditions. Mature networks typically exhibit network bursting activity, which has traditionally been quantified by simplified features such as inter-burst intervals and burst durations. While these features advanced the understanding of development, disease phenotypes, and drug effects, they overlook the temporal structure of activity within bursts. Here, we developed a comprehensive framework to quantify burst shapes, the time course of network firing during bursts. Applying this approach to four datasets, including rodent- and human pluripotent stem cell-derived cultures, we show that burst shapes contain rich information about the underlying network dynamics. We quantify this information by using traditional and shape features to classify the recording conditions (types of genetic disorder, presence of pharmacological agents) and demonstrate that shapes significantly increase classification accuracy. We provide a pipeline for burst shape characterization, including simplified features that capture most of the shape information, establishing burst shape as a robust and biologically meaningful marker for functional phenotyping in disease modeling and drug screening.

">Reward-reset interval timing drives patch foraging decisions through neural state transitions in dorsomedial striatum</a></h4>

              
                Activities with diminishing returns pose a unique computational problem for the brain, requiring a combination of outcome evaluation and temporal tracking. Deciding the right time to stop one pursuit and move to alternatives is an important part of effective time management, yet it is unknown how the decision-making circuits of the brain determine the moment to switch. The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) mediates both goal-directed decision-making and interval timing, two functions that converge during patch foraging, where animals must time when to exit patches to maximize reward rates. We recorded extracellular activity from neurons in DMS while freely moving mice performed a patch-foraging task. Mice employed a 'reward-reset' strategy, primarily basing their exit decisions on the time since the last reward, but with the patch residence time and environmental reward-rate context also contributing to the intended time of departure. Individual neurons in DMS underwent discrete firing rate transitions at characteristic delays following each reward. These transition delays were distributed across the population, creating a cumulative signal that reached a threshold coinciding with patch exit. This population activity pattern spanned the intended reward-to-exit interval, compressing or expanding in accordance with patch residence time and changing environmental conditions. Fiber photometry recordings revealed phasic dopamine signals in DMS encoding reward prediction errors that reflected the declining reward probability over time. Our results provide insights into how DMS integrates its dual roles in timing and action selection to guide time investment strategies during foraging.

">Neuroprotective Parkinson's Disease Therapeutic: Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanoflower Treatments Alleviate Pathological Cell Stress</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is triggered by irreversible degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, hypothalamus, and thalamus. Although the underlying molecular etiology of these pathological processes remains unclear, progressive aggregation of alpha-synuclein (a-syn) and mitochondrial dysfunction are two expected mechanisms implicated in neuronal degeneration. Accumulating evidence indicates that transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanoflowers (NFs), a novel class of nanomaterials, can restore mitochondrial health by the activation of mitochondrial biogenesis. However, therapeutic potential of TMD NFs in PD remains unclear. The current study investigates the neuroprotective properties of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) nanoflowers (NFs) in neurons and astrocytes exposed to a-syn aggregates. It was found that MoS2 and MoSe2 suppressed a-syn-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum, and upregulated autophagy and exocytosis of a-syn fibrils. TMD NFs also reversed a-syn-induced damage of cell mitochondria, simultaneously stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis. As a result, a drastic decrease in ROS levels in both neurons and astrocytes was observed. These results show that MoS2 or MoSe2 NFs could fully rescue neurons and astrocytes from the cytotoxic effects of a-syn fibrils. Neuroprotective properties of these novel nanomaterials were further explored in Caenorhabditis elegans that overexpress a-syn. Nematodes that received NFs experienced a drastic reduction in the amount of aggregated a-syn which resulted in a significant increase in C. elegans lifespan. These findings indicated that MoS2 or MoSe2 NFs could be used as novel therapeutic to decelerate the progression of PD.

">Increased sensitivity to myopia and altered retinal ON/OFF balance in a mouse model lacking Dusp4</a></h4>

              
                Myopia occurs as the eye fails to stop the emmetropization process, causing an overgrowth of the eyeball. Environmental factors like light and genetics play a key role in the development of myopia. Animal models of inherited retinal disorders lacking a functional ON-pathway and which develop high myopia identified several differentially expressed genes suggesting a possible involvement of these genes in myopia. Using a mouse model in which one of those genes, Dusp4, was deleted, we aim to better understand the mechanisms implicated in myopia development and the role of DUSP4 in the retina. We report here that mice lacking DUSP4 have a reduced basal level of retinal dopamine and a higher susceptibility to lens-induced myopia. Dusp4 is expressed in ON-bipolar cells and a subset of OFF-bipolar cells in a light dependent manner. The absence of DUSP4 causes a hyperactivation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. Dusp4-/- mice show a reduced optomotor response and an altered retinal response to light stimuli. We observed increased ON-bipolar cell responses and reduced oscillatory potentials together with altered OFF and ON-OFF RGC response to light flashes. Altogether, these data demonstrate a light-dependent role for DUSP4 in bipolar cell signaling and provide new insights into retina-driven mechanisms of myopia development, nuancing the impact of ON and OFF pathways upon emmetropization.

">Analyzing Gaze and Hand Movement Patterns in Leader-Follower Interactions During a Time-Continuous Cooperative Manipulation Task</a></h4>

              
                In daily life, people often interact by taking on leader and follower roles. Unlike laboratory experiments, these interactions unfold naturally and continuously. Although it is well established that gaze typically precedes object manipulation, much less is known about how gaze-hand patterns evolve in interactive settings where one person must take the other's actions into account. Here we examine predictive, planning-related behavior in a two-player tabletop game called "do-undo". Participants alternated as Leader and Follower. The Leader performed simple pick-and-place actions to alter the arrangement of objects, while the Follower used other objects to restore the previous configuration. We recorded eye and hand movements, along with object trajectories, using a system that combined eye tracking with multi-camera motion capture. Touch sensors on the players' hands provided precise timing of contacts, allowing us to segment cooperative action into well-defined temporal intervals. As expected, eye fixations consistently preceded manipulation, but clear role differences emerged. Leaders looked more often and earlier at target objects. In many trials, their gaze anticipated not only their own actions but also those required of the Follower. Leaders also more frequently checked the outcome of the do-undo sequence. Both roles showed gaze patterns consistent with memorization, but alternating gazes between objects and destinations were much more common in Leaders. Some patterns suggested longer-term planning beyond the immediate action. These findings reveal distinct decision-making and planning strategies in Leaders and Followers. Leaders consider not only their own next moves but also the potential actions of their partners, shedding light on the complex cognitive processes that underly everyday human interaction.

">Retrograde mitochondrial transport regulates mitochondrial biogenesis in zebrafish neurons</a></h4>

              
                To maintain a healthy mitochondrial population in a long-lived cell like a neuron, mitochondria must be continuously replenished through the process of mitochondrial biogenesis. Because the majority of mitochondrial proteins are nuclear encoded, mitochondrial biogenesis requires nuclear sensing of mitochondrial population health and function. This can be a challenge in a large, compartmentalized cell like a neuron in which a large portion of the mitochondrial population is in neuronal compartments far from the nucleus. Using in vivo assessments of mitochondrial biogenesis in zebrafish neurons, we determined that mitochondrial transport between distal axonal compartments and the cell body is required for sustained mitochondrial biogenesis. Estrogen-related receptor transcriptional activation links transport with mitochondrial gene expression. Together, our data support a role for retrograde feedback between axonal mitochondria and the nucleus for regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in neurons.

">Lower Bound Estimates for Electrophysiological Power Dissipation in Human Gray Matter</a></h4>

              
                The human brain is popularly described as remarkably energy efficient, with its metabolic power consumption estimated at approximately 20 watts (W). Biophysical models have partitioned this power budget across distinct cellular processes, but these theoretical estimates have yet to be empirically constrained using whole-brain electrophysiological data. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) source imaging of resting-state human brain activity to derive empirical lower-bound estimates of electrical power dissipation in cortical gray matter. We found that the total power dissipated by currents, primarily associated with post-synaptic potentials, ranges between 10-9 and 10-10 W, several orders of magnitude lower than prevailing metabolic estimates. Using finite element modeling (FEM), we observed that electrophysiological power dissipation is predominantly confined to gray matter. Additionally, spatial variations in MEG-derived power dissipation partially correlated with regional oxygen metabolism measured by PET, yet notable discrepancies emerged across large-scale functional brain networks. These results underscore a critical divergence between electrophysiological and metabolic indices of brain energy use, and highlight the need for more integrated biophysical models to bridge this gap and better characterize the physiological underpinnings of regional brain energetics.

">Adolescent alcohol exposure disrupts extinction learning and retrosplenial cortex physiology in adult males</a></h4>

              
                Adolescent binge drinking can lead to a myriad of issues later in life, including co-occurring diagnoses of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and affective disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although efforts to understand the effects of adolescent alcohol exposure on later health outcomes have unveiled lasting, maladaptive behaviors in adulthood, questions remain about region and cell-type specific mechanisms that drive such effects. Here, we tested the hypothesis that adolescent alcohol exposure would produce lasting alterations in retrosplenial cortex (RSC) function and physiology. In support of this hypothesis, we found that adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) vapor exposure resulted in impaired extinction recall of a trace fear memory in adulthood, as well as lasting reductions in intrinsic excitability in adult RSC pyramidal cells. Importantly, these changes were sex-specific, occurring in males but not females. Together, this work suggests that the RSC may be a key, vulnerable locus for the detrimental effects of adolescent alcohol exposure.

">Functional Reorganization of the Somatomotor Network in Prodromal and Early Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                In Parkinson's disease (PD), higher network attack tolerance (NAT) may contribute to compensation of motor deficits. However, it is unclear whether NAT is lost due to disease progression or actively increased as a compensatory response. We used cross-sectional resting state functional MRI data of 28 healthy controls (HC), 60 prodromal PD patients, 94 clinical PD patients to create graph theoretical networks. NAT was assessed at global and subnetwork level by calculating global efficiency upon iterative node removal. Using linear mixed-effects models we assessed how putaminal dopamine terminal (DaT) binding, or disease status affected NAT, controlling for density, age, sex and education. Finally, we compared the node degree distribution specifically for the somatomotor network (SMN) across groups. Lower putaminal DaT predicted higher SMN NAT. Patients with PD showed elevated SMN NAT versus controls. Neither global nor other networks showed an effect. Compared to HCs subcortical/cerebellar SMN nodes appeared more connected in PD and prodromal patients. Dopaminergic depletion appears to drive targeted reorganization of the SMN. This reorganization may involve additional recruitment of subcortical and cerebellar regions to sustain the information flow inside the SMN. Concomitantly, this active adaptation motivates further investigations regarding SMN NAT as potential compensation mechanism in early PD.

">A gut-brain axis for aversive interoception drives innate and anticipatory emesis in Drosophila.</a></h4>

              
                Signals from the gut are increasingly recognized as modulators of brain function and behavior. However, the pathways through which the gut conveys adverse or unpleasant information to the brain are still not well understood. In this study, we identify an aversive gut-brain axis in Drosophila melanogaster that detects toxin-induced gut damage and triggers both innate and learned anticipatory emesis (vomiting). After toxin ingestion, reactive oxygen species are produced by midgut enterocytes and detected by the transient receptor potential channel TrpA1 on nearby enteroendocrine cells. This sensing stimulates the release of neuropeptides from enteroendocrine cells, likely representing the gastric malaise flies experience after eating. We show that these neuropeptides act on specific serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in the brain. These neurons interact with each other and signal to the downstream memory-related mushroom bodies to promote emesis. This circuit not only drives an immediate emetic response but also represents a malaise-driven aversive signal. The signal manifests as the persistent activity of dopaminergic neurons, which reinforces aversive valence to odor cues in the mushroom bodies. Thus, the flies learn that a specific odor predicts the presence of a toxin in food and exhibit anticipatory emesis upon re-exposure to the same odor. Taken together, we have identified an interoceptive signaling pathway that may be conserved for detecting harmful gut conditions and for remembering how to avoid them. Our work offers a mechanistic framework for studying aversive gut-brain communication involved in feeding, metabolism, depression, brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases.

">Machine learning behavioral analysis reveals cervical instability as an early biomarker of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Early detection of neuromuscular disorders is a major clinical challenge, with most diagnoses only occurring after considerable motor neuron degeneration has already taken place. The central problem for early diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases is the subtlety of early symptoms and where to look for them. Without defined behavioral markers, the earliest stages of disease go undetected, delaying intervention and limiting neuroprotective therapeutic evaluation. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) based framework that identifies subtle postural alterations in freely behaving animals. Using longitudinal pose data from SOD1G93A mice, a widely used Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) mouse model, we focused on postural states in idle periods, behavioral states usually overlooked in disease monitoring. Our analyses revealed consistent deviations in posture and a feature analysis pinpointed cervical instability during adolescence as a key distinguishing feature. We validated these findings through two independent behavioral assays engaging cervical musculature: rearing and wet-dog shakes, both of which showed significant impairments in male SOD1G93A mice as early as 3 weeks of age, many weeks earlier than conventional muscle function assays. This approach establishes an unbiased, non-invasive, scalable strategy for detecting early-stage neuromuscular dysfunction, and provides a foundation both for clinical behavioral biomarker development in ALS and related disorders and will enable evaluation of early neuroprotective interventions.

">Injured SSTR2+ nociceptor axons in neuromas drive chronic spontaneous neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous pain is a very common but poorly understood consequence of peripheral nerve injury. We developed a system for measuring spontaneous pain-related behaviors in mice over months, which revealed that limb flicks--emerging predominantly 2 months post-injury--reflect spontaneous pain, and that neuromas are the drivers of this component of neuropathic pain. In vivo dorsal root ganglion imaging showed that small-diameter sensory neurons are the source of spontaneous ectopic neuroma activity and are different from the intact neurons that drive stimulus-evoked pain. Cell-specific optogenetic stimulation studies identified that injured SSTR2+ sensory axons in neuromas are the triggers of spontaneous limb flicks/neuropathic pain. These findings reveal the mechanisms of spontaneous neuropathic pain and open new therapeutic opportunities.

">Concept Learning Builds Behaviourally Relevant Attentional Templates</a></h4>

              
                Attention optimizes learning by filtering relevant information to build conceptual knowledge. However, how learned concepts, once encoded in memory, subsequently guide attentional processes remains an intriguing question. We propose that concept learning leads to the emergence of attentional templates that store goal-relevant representations, thereby actively guiding attention allocation. Participants completed two separate learning tasks and a test, wherein each trial began with a cue, indicating which learning task should be employed. Random test trials included a probe instead of concept specific features: a small arrow appeared at a feature location that was relevant (i.e., valid) or irrelevant (i.e., invalid) for the cued task. Successful learners were faster at responding to valid probes than invalid, demonstrating the deployment of concept-specific attentional templates. Importantly, the efficiency of this attention allocation was tied to concept learning success, with higher learning performance yielding greater response time benefits at test. Thus, our results reveal that learning builds behaviourally relevant attentional templates, and subsequently, learned concepts in memory guide attention by deploying these templates, a phenomenon that we introduce as learning-guided attention. This work provides novel insights into the dynamic interplay between learning, memory, and attention.

">Translating Music to Touch: Exploring Tactile Perception of Pitch, Roughness, and Pleasantness</a></h4>

              
                Music is a rich multisensory experience, yet individuals with hearing impairments often lack access to this important aspect of culture. As tactile technologies advance, there is growing interest in whether musical information can be conveyed through vibration. This study investigates how core dimensions of auditory music perception, pitch, roughness, and pleasantness, can be translated into the tactile domain. Participants were asked to rate these perceptual dimensions in response to sinusoidal and complex waveforms, including amplitude-modulated signals, sawtooth, and missing fundamental stimuli. Perceived pitch showed a systematic relationship with stimulus frequency for most participants, suggesting that tactile devices could effectively convey melodic patterns. The sawtooth waveform emerged as particularly effective for representing pitch changes, underscoring the role of rapid temporal transitions in tactile pitch encoding. Roughness ratings were negatively correlated with pleasantness, mirroring well-established findings in auditory perception. Waveforms with sudden temporal changes or rapid amplitude modulations were consistently judged as less pleasant. Taken together, these findings indicate that tactile systems can effectively convey melodic structure and emotional tone, laying the groundwork for musical touch interfaces. Importantly, our results highlight the crucial role of the fast temporal envelope rather than the temporal fine structure, in shaping vibrotactile perception. Consistent with this interpretation, our data provide evidence for a tactile analog of the auditory missing fundamental phenomenon, reinforcing the idea that tactile pitch perception primarily relies on envelope periodicity rather than the presence of specific frequency components.

">Dynamic Meta-Networking Identifies Distinct Network Correlates of Positive and Negative Formal Thought Disorder in Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Formal thought disorder (FTD) is a core symptom of schizophrenia, yet the neural network mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain poorly understood. In this study, we applied a dynamic meta-networking framework, which captures temporally recurring functional network states, to investigate alterations in the language and executive control networks and their associations with positive and negative FTD. Resting-state fMRI data were collected from three independent cohorts: a discovery cohort comprising 150 first-episode, drug-naive patients with schizophrenia and 175 healthy controls (HCs); a replication cohort including 183 first-episode, drug-naive patients and 109 HCs; and a third cohort consisting of 71 patients who had received two weeks of antipsychotic treatment and 71 HCs. Meta-networking analysis identified four distinct resting-state meta-states within both the language and executive control networks. Connectivity-behavior correlation analyses and machine-learning regression models revealed that positive FTD was associated with aberrant connectivity across specific meta-states in both networks. In contrast, negative FTD was linked exclusively to dysfunction within two meta-states of the executive control network. Notably, these polarity-specific, multi-state connectivity disruptions normalized following short-term antipsychotic treatment, highlighting their potential as clinically relevant neuroimaging biomarkers.

">Brain injury reactivates a developmental program driving genesis and integration of transient LGE-class interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Brain lesions can unlock a latent neurogenic potential in parenchymal astrocytes. However, the identity of their neuronal progeny has remained unclear. Here, we show that neurons generated by striatal astrocytes following excitotoxic lesions are transient, yet they reach advanced stages of morphological and functional maturation and integrate into cortico-striatal-thalamic circuits. Single-cell RNA-seq mapping onto an embryonic reference revealed that these cells are not related to adult striatal neuron types but instead belong to the LGE-MEIS2/PAX6 interneuron class. Notch abrogation, which mimics neurogenic activation, drives both cortical and striatal astrocytes toward this same interneuron class, revealing a shared intrinsic commitment. In primates, LGE-MEIS2/PAX6 cells transiently populate the embryonic striatum and cortex, and through spatial transcriptomics, we reveal that in mice these cells are also present and widely distributed throughout the telencephalon during embryonic and postnatal development. Thus, unlike other vertebrates in which adult telencephalic astroglia preserve the potential to generate constitutive region-specific neurons, the homologous cells in mammals converge on the generation of a specific transient neuron class, possibly representing a reservoir for circuit plasticity in adult life.

                Background Tuberculosis remains a significant public health issue in Tunisia. This study aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics of cervical lymph node tuberculosis and identify factors influencing outcomes. Methods A retrospective study was conducted over a 3-year period in the ENT department at La Rabta Hospital, Tunis. Diagnosis was based on histopathological evidence, and disease progression was categorized as favorable (treatment <9 months, no additional surgery) or unfavorable (treatment >9 months and/or supplementary surgery). The study population was divided into two groups based on the outcome nature, and analytical analysis was performed to assess factors influencing outcomes Results The study included 102 patients (32 men and 70 women), with a median age of 34.5 years (range: 8-83 years). Most patients (78.4%) had no significant medical history or known HIV infection. Thirty-nine patients (38.2%) had a history of consuming raw milk. In 65 cases (63.7%), lymph node size exceeded 3 cm. Hypoechogenicity (53.9%) and necrosis (40.1%) were the most common findings on ultrasound and CT scan, respectively. The initial diagnostic approach included adenectomy (56.8%), lymph node dissection (8.9%), and drainage of cold abscesses (34.3%). All patients received an initial four-drug antituberculosis regimen. Ethambutol treatment was extended beyond 2 months in 65 cases (63.7%). Fifty-six patients (54.9%) had a favorable outcome. Factors associated with a favorable outcome included intact skin, complete initial lymph node dissection, favorable progress at 2 months, and prolonged ethambutol therapy. Conclusions The management of lymph node tuberculosis remains challenging, especially with insufficient bacteriological confirmation. Regional epidemiological factors should be considered. The role of surgery is crucial; however, further standardization is needed to optimize patient outcomes.

Recent advancements of spatial sequencing technologies enable measurements of transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles within the same tissue slice, providing an unprecedented opportunity to understand cellular microenvironments. However, effective approaches for the integrative analysis of such spatial multi-omics data are lacking. Here, we propose SpaMI, a graph neural network-based model which extract features by contrastive learning strategy for each omics and integrate different omics by an attention mechanism to integrate spatial multi-omics data. We applied SpaMI to both simulated data and three real spatial multi-omics datasets derived from the same tissue slices, including spatial epigenome–transcriptome and transcriptome–proteome data. By comparing SpaMI with the state-of-the-art methods on simulation and real datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of SpaMI in identifying spatial domain and data denoising.

Large-scale single-cell projects generate rapidly growing datasets, but downstream analysis is often confounded by data sources, requiring data integration methods to do correction. Existing data integration methods typically require data centralization, raising privacy and security concerns. Here, we introduce Federated Harmony, a novel method combining properties of federated learning with Harmony algorithm to integrate decentralized omics data. This approach preserves privacy by avoiding raw data sharing while maintaining integration performance comparable to Harmony. Experiments on various types of single-cell data showcase superior results, highlighting a novel data integration approach for distributed multi-omics data without compromising data privacy or analytical performance.

Phosphoinositides are a group of interconvertible lipids that are located in the membrane of eukaryotic cells. They turnover via complex network of reactions (called the phosphoinositide pathway) that respond rapidly to regulate many aspects of a cell’s response to their environment. Given their low-abundance they are difficult to characterise experimentally. Here we utilise a new experimental method to generate an unusually large dataset that characterises the time-dependent changes in five membrane bound phospoinositides and a soluble inositide in platelet, downstream of its GPVI receptor, where we know the phosphoinositide pathway is particularly active. To shed light on regulatotory steps that are often opaque to experimentation we use this data within a mathematical and computational framework. We construct and assess eleven mathematical models that represent competing interpretations of the dominant mechanisms that regulate the pathway. We find that while four of the models can generate the available data only one model, that incorporates an additional pool of PtdIns, is consistent with the data and is able to successfully predict the effects of an inhibitor. We publish all models openly in a form that is easily usable and adaptable for other researchers to use alongside our or their own data. We studied how changes in the shape and magnitude of events that stimulate the phosphoinositide pathway affect its dynamics. Despite these perturbations, the abundance of Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) remained stable, consistent with findings reported in the literature.

This study aimed to provide strategies to optimize the prevention and control measures of echinococcosis in Gansu Province. Based on the transmission mechanism of echinococcosis, a System Dynamics (SD) model of echinococcosis in Gansu Province was established using Vensim software. Through this model, parameters such as vaccination coverage, domestic dog deworming coverage, slaughter management level, and health education level were adjusted to predict the changing trends in the number of human cases and infected sheep. The results showed that the number of human cases was most sensitive to the adjustment of health education level, followed by changes to vaccination coverage. The number of infected sheep was most sensitive to the adjustment of vaccination coverage, followed by the adjustment of slaughter management level. Based on these simulation results, the prevention and control measures for echinococcosis in Gansu Province were further optimized. The results showed that if the health education level and the vaccination coverage were increased by 50% and 40%, respectively, based on the current prevention and control levels, the number of human cases would approach zero by approximately 2026. When the vaccination coverage and slaughter management level increased by 60% and 45%, respectively, based on current prevention and control levels, the number of infected sheep would approach zero by approximately 2027. This study applied the SD method to the prevention and control of echinococcosis for the first time, and the results can provide key decision-making recommendations to optimize the prevention and control measures of echinococcosis in Gansu province.

Recent studies have highlighted axonal myelination as a common feature of parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons throughout the cerebral cortex. However, the precise function of PV interneuron myelination remains incompletely understood. In this study, we used the cuprizone model of demyelination in mice to investigate how PV interneuron myelination might influence their neuronal physiology. Specifically, we examined whether impairing myelination from postnatal day 21 onwards, during a critical neurodevelopmental period of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), can affect PV interneuron maturation and function. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to examine intrinsic properties of PV interneurons in the PFC, we found that juvenile demyelination in mice induced robust alterations of PV interneuron firing patterns. Specifically, we observed that demyelination caused an impairment in the ability of PV interneurons to sustain high-frequency firing associated with a substantial decrease in Kv3-specific currents. We also found a significant impairment in PV interneuron autaptic self-inhibitory transmission, a feature implicated in temporal control of PV interneuron firing during cortical network activity. Following a remyelination period of 5 weeks, PV interneuron properties were only partially recovered, suggesting that transient juvenile demyelination leads to long-lasting impairments of PV interneuron function. In contrast, adult demyelination had no significant effects on PV interneuron firing properties. Together, our data uncovers a critical period for juvenile myelination as an important factor in PFC PV interneuron development and brain maturation.

                <p>by Julia von Knoerzer-Suckow, Eva-Helena Aden, Romuald Haase, Andreas Klingl, Ignasi Forné, Simon Gras</p>

During intracellular development, apicomplexan parasites reside within a parasitophorous vacuole largely derived from the host plasma membrane (PM) and rendered nonfusogenic with the host endolysosomal system. Yet, the parasite is capable of protein uptake from the host cell via endocytosis, which occurs via a conserved structure, the micropore. Recently the composition of the micropore was characterized and its stability was shown to depend on the presence of the kelch-domain protein K13 which is also central to malarial drug-resistance to artemisinin. Interestingly, depletion of K13 also resulted in an impressive accumulation of PM attached to or between individual parasites, suggesting that the micropore plays a critical role in PM homoeostasis. Here, we characterized the dynamics and recycling of the PM in <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. In intracellular parasites, the PM is shared between individual parasites and undergoes a cycle of endocytosis and exocytosis during replication, similar to what has been previously demonstrated for extracellular parasites. This cycle appears to depend on Rab5b and MyoF. Interestingly, in contrast to <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, Rab5b is dispensable for the lytic cycle of <i>T. gondii</i>. During replication, parasites establish an extracellular plasma membrane reservoir (PMR) prior to daughter cell formation. The PMR is a dynamic membranous structure that varies in size and position throughout replication and disappears after daughter cell budding. Perturbation of the endo-exocytic balance disrupts PMR formation, leading to increased number and size of PMRs and, ultimately, to a complete loss of membrane organization directly linking endocytosis to the regulation of PMR formation.

                <p>by Ruiling Zhong, Claire E. Richardson</p>

Lysosomes are essential for neuronal homeostasis, providing degradation and recycling functions necessary to support neurons’ complex operations and long lifespans. However, the regulation of lysosomal degradative capacity in healthy neurons is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of HLH-30, the sole <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> homolog of Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis and autophagy that is thought to predominantly function in the context of starvation or stress. We demonstrate that HLH-30 is dispensable for neuronal development but acts cell-intrinsically to expand lysosomal degradative capacity during early adulthood. Loss of HLH-30 leads to lysosomal dysfunction and delayed turnover of synaptic vesicle proteins from the synapse. Notably, we show that basal HLH-30 activity is sufficient to expand neuronal lysosomal capacity without nuclear enrichment, in contrast to the nuclear translocation associated with starvation- and stress-induced activation of TFEB and HLH-30. Furthermore, we show that neuronal lysosomal function declines with age in wild-type animals, and this corresponds to a decrease in basal HLH-30-mediated transcription. We further demonstrate that basal HLH-30 activity is crucial for neuron maintenance: lysosomal dysfunction due to inadequate HLH-30 activity leads to dendrite degeneration and aberrant outgrowths. In summary, our study establishes a critical role for HLH-30/TFEB in promoting lysosomal capacity to preserve neuronal homeostasis and structural integrity of mature neurons in vivo.

     alt="Glutamatergic and GABAergic Synapses in the Human Spinal Dorsal Horn Revealed With Immunohistochemistry"/>
<p>Immunohistochemical analysis of synaptic proteins in the dorsal horn of the human spinal cord reveals the presence of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 and the GABAA-alpha 2 receptor subunit at most excitatory and inhibitory synapses in lamina II, respectively.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Primary afferent neurons detect sensory stimuli in the periphery and transmit this information to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where it is processed by excitatory and inhibitory controls before being sent to the brain. Our understanding of the synaptic architecture of these spinal circuits in the rodent has been massively advanced using antibodies raised against scaffolding proteins Homer1 and gephyrin, which anchor glutamate and GABA receptors to the membrane, respectively. Few studies have attempted to visualize spinal cord synapses in human tissue, partly due to a lack of high-quality tissue with low postmortem intervals. In this study, we reveal both excitatory and inhibitory synapses at a high resolution in human lumbar spinal cord tissue using Homer1 and gephyrin immunolabeling and show that the basic organization of these proteins within the dorsal horn is similar to that in the rodent. Homer1+ puncta are highly colocalized with ionotropic glutamate receptors, and over 75% are in contact with a presynaptic axon terminal containing the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2). Similarly, most gephyrin+ profiles are coextensive with the GABA<sub>A</sub>-α<sub>2</sub> subunit but fewer than 10% colocalize with Homer1+ puncta, confirming the specificity of these markers. Finally, we use Homer1 immunolabeling to demonstrate that primary afferents can form complex synaptic arrangements in human spinal cord. We conclude that these antibodies can be used as reliable tools for the study of human synaptic circuitry, and we have used them to reveal insight into the spinal connections underlying somatosensation that can be expanded upon in future studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70037?af=R">Changes in Naturalistic Viewing in Healthy Aging and Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Visual exploration—where the eyes move and when—is guided by prior experiences. Memory-guided viewing behavior is altered in healthy aging and is further disrupted in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a condition in which there is accelerated structural and functional decline of the hippocampus and associated medial temporal lobe structures (HC/MTL). Computational modeling has demonstrated the potential for rapid information flow from the HC/MTL to regions responsible for the cognitive control of eye movements, such that visual exploration behavior could be impacted in the moment and on an ongoing fashion. It was predicted here, then, that older adults and individuals with aMCI would show changes in naturalistic viewing compared to younger adults, even in the absence of any memory task. Multivariate analyses revealed that viewing for younger adults was characterized by larger saccade amplitudes and a larger area of exploration; the opposite pattern was reliably expressed by individuals with aMCI. Viewing patterns of healthy older adults were associated with shorter gaze durations. The entropy of viewing in older adults was associated with overall cognitive status, as determined by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, highlighting the top-down influence of cognitive function on active vision. Lower scores on the memory subtest were reliably associated with a pattern of viewing characterized by fewer fixations (with longer durations), saccades, regions explored, smaller area of exploration, and lower entropy, mimicking some of the viewing features of the aMCI group and suggesting that increasing HC/MTL decline results in less exploratory viewing patterns. These findings reveal the ongoing influence of the hippocampus and its extended system on moment-to-moment naturalistic viewing.</p>
