                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Previous studies have reported an association between anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) treatment and central nervous system (CNS) events. We described eight patients presenting with demyelinating CNS events while on treatment with anti-TNFα for autoimmune diseases and followed up for a medium period of 4 years. Four patients presented with isolated demyelinating events, three patients fulfilled the criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS), and one patient showed worsening of pre-existing MS after anti-TNF therapy initiation. All patients except one, showed a good medium-term prognosis. Our observation supports an association between anti-TNFα treatment and demyelinating events and suggests that a prompt discontinuation of the drug may lead to a favorable demyelinating disease outcome.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://link.springer.com/search.rss?search-within=Journal&facet-journal-id=415&query=">Mononeuritis multiplex: an unexpectedly frequent feature of severe COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The prolonged mechanical ventilation that is often required by patients with severe COVID-19 is expected to result in significant intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) in many of the survivors. However, in our post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic we have found that, as well as the anticipated global weakness related to loss of muscle mass, a significant proportion of these patients also have disabling focal neurological deficits relating to multiple axonal mononeuropathies. Amongst the 69 patients with severe COVID-19 that have been discharged from the intensive care units in our hospital, we have seen 11 individuals (16%) with such a mononeuritis multiplex. In many instances, the multi-focal nature of the weakness in these patients was initially unrecognised as symptoms were wrongly assumed to relate simply to “critical illness neuromyopathy”. While mononeuropathy is well recognised as an occasional complication of intensive care, our experience suggests that such deficits are surprisingly frequent and often disabling in patients recovering from severe COVID-19.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">We report a 57-year-old man with recurrent meningoencephalitis resulting in bouts of altered consciousness, encephalopathy, tremors, focal seizures, and paraparesis. The neurological manifestations were accompanied by fever and leukocytosis in the absence of other systemic manifestations. MRI abnormalities of the brain, brainstem, spinal cord and meninges and CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein were observed. Exhaustive studies failed to reveal an etiology. Brain biopsy revealed nodules of neutrophils and macrophages, but no vasculitis. The lesions were not vasocentric as would be expected with neuro-Behcet’s disease and neuro-Sweet’s disease. The disorder was responsive to high-dose corticosteroid therapy and, ultimately, to anakinra, an IL-1α and IL-1β receptor antagonist.</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">During the COVID-19 outbreak, the presence of extensive white matter microhemorrhages was detected by brain MRIs. The goal of this study was to investigate the origin of this atypical hemorrhagic complication.</p>
                    </span>
                    <span class="a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2">
                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Methods</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Between March 17 and May 18, 2020, 80 patients with severe COVID-19 infections were admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome to intensive care units at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg for whom a brain MRI for neurologic manifestations was performed. 19 patients (24%) with diffuse microhemorrhages were compared to 18 control patients with COVID-19 and normal brain MRI.</p>

                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Results</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">The first hypothesis was hypoxemia. The latter seemed very likely since respiratory failure was longer and more pronounced in patients with microhemorrhages (prolonged endotracheal intubation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.0002), higher FiO<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.03), increased use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04)). A relevant hypothesis, the role of microangiopathy, was also considered, since patients with microhemorrhages presented a higher increase of the D-Dimers (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.01) and a tendency to more frequent thrombotic events (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.12). Another hypothesis tested was the role of kidney failure, which was more severe in the group with diffuse microhemorrhages (higher creatinine level [median of 293 µmol/L versus 112 µmol/L, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04] and more dialysis were introduced in this group during ICU stay [12 versus 5 patients, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04]).</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Blood–brain barrier dysfunction secondary to hypoxemia and high concentration of uremic toxins seems to be the main mechanism leading to critical illness-associated cerebral microbleeds, and this complication remains to be frequently described in severe COVID-19 patients.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Many neuropsychological disorders, especially attentional abnormality, are present in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate attention function by auditory event-related potential (ERP) P3a (novelty paradigm) in DM1 patients. A total of 10 young DM1 patients (mean age 30.4 years) and 14 age-matched normal controls participated in this study. ERPs were recorded using an auditory novel paradigm, consisting of three types of stimuli, i.e., standard sound (70%), target sound (20%), and various novel sounds (10%), and participants pressed buttons to the target sounds. ERP components P3b after the target stimuli and P3a following the novel stimuli were analyzed. Correlations of neuropsychological evaluations with the amplitudes and latencies of P3b and P3a were analyzed in DM1 patients. We found that P3a latency was significantly delayed in patients with DM1 compared with normal controls, although the latency and amplitude of P3b in DM1 patients were comparable with those in normal controls. The achievement rates of both the Symbol Digit Modality Test and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were significantly correlated with P3a amplitude, as well as P3b amplitude. These results suggest that ERPs, including P3a and P3b, provide important insights into the physiological basis of neuropsychological abnormalities in patients with DM1, especially from the viewpoint of the frontal lobe and attention function.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Valproate is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED) of particular interest in pediatric epilepsy syndromes and idiopathic generalized epilepsy, as it is relatively more effective in these syndromes than other AEDs. In 2018, the European Medicines Agency introduced new restrictions on the use of valproate in girls and women of childbearing potential to avoid exposure during pregnancy. The strengthening of existing restrictions sparked controversy and debate among patients and the medical community. The high prevalence of epilepsy syndromes amenable to valproate treatment in women of childbearing age and the little information available on the teratogenic potential of alternative treatments have created uncertainty on how to manage these patients. In this consensus statement, based on a review of the literature and the clinical experience of a panel of European epilepsy experts, we present general recommendations for the optimal clinical management of AED treatment in girls, women of childbearing potential, and pregnant women across the different epilepsy syndromes.</p>

Four patients suffered severe respiratory distress, three of which required invasive mechanical ventilation. Neurological manifestations included impaired consciousness, agitation, delirium, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. EEG demonstrated diffuse slowing in all patients. Brain MRI showed non-specific findings. CSF analysis revealed normal cell count and protein levels. In all subjects, RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF tested negative. IVIg at 0.4 g/kg/die was commenced 29.8 days (mean, range: 19–55 days) after encephalopathy onset, leading to complete electroclinical recovery in all patients, with an initial improvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in 3.4 days (mean, range: 1–10 days). No adverse events related to IVIg were observed.</p>

                Ventricular non-compaction (VNC) is a rare myocardium disorder, which can be both genetic and sporadic. A poor wall compaction process or an excessive trabeculae formation may be at the genesis of myocardial hypertrabeculation with multiple recesses. It is often complicated by ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias and cardiac embolism. Herein we report a case of a 20-year-old male patient with no particular past medical history who was followed up at the cardiology department for dyspnea. Echocardiography showed reduced ejection fraction of the left ventricle with potential hypertrabeculation in the right ventricle, confirmed by cardiac MRI. The patient was not put under medication and was later lost to follow-up. He died few months later without a clear cause explaining death. A forensic autopsy was performed that attributed death to acute ventricle arrhythmia secondary to VNC, emphasizing the major role of an early and specific treatment to avoid such a fatal outcome.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between depression, anxiety, stress and perceived quality of life in a Malaysian B40 urban community during the COVID-19 lockdown: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In Malaysia, B40 communities are those with a median monthly household earning of under RM 3166. With the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown, the livelihoods of those in these areas has been severely impacted. This has increased their vulnerability to psychological afflictions and has led to a poorer perception of their quality of life (QoL) in comparison to the rest of the population. We investigated the association between perceived levels of depression, anxiety and stress and their impact on quality of life (QoL) among B40 residents in a low-cost urban housing area in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between July 2020 and February 2021 in the Seri Pantai housing settlement. The validated Malay versions of the depression, anxiety, and stress scale-21 (DASS-21) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life, brief (WHOQOL-BREF) were distributed to the participants using Google forms. The statistical significance of the association between subscales of depression, anxiety, stress and QoL domains were assessed using the Pearson’s correlation test. Results: Of the 180 participants, the majority were Malays (87.2%) and females (82.2%).  The average scores were the highest for stress (5.66 ± 4.59) and the score in the environment domain of QoL (59.27 ± 17.23) was the lowest. A statistically significant negative correlation was found between the subscales of DASS-21 and the four domains of the QoL, with the social relationships and psychological domains showing a highly significant association (p < 0.001). The strongest correlation was observed between the psychological domain and depression (r= -.520) followed by psychological domain and stress (r= -.496). Conclusion: The strongest correlation was observed between psychological domain and depression. This suggests a need to address potential devastating mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the QoL of residents in B40 communities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">PhD students in life sciences can benefit from team cohesion [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Scientific progress during doctoral studies is a combination of individual effort and teamwork. A recently growing body of interdisciplinary literature has investigated the determinants of early career success in academia, in which learning from supervisors and co-authors play a great role. Yet, it is less understood how collaboration patterns of the research team, in which the doctoral student participates, influences the future career of students. Here we take a social network analysis approach to investigate this and define the research team as the co-authorship network of the student. Methods: We use the Hungarian Scientific Bibliography Database, which includes all publications of PhD students who defended theses from the year 1993. The data also include thesis information, and the publications of co-authors of students. Using this data, we quantify cohesion in the ego-network of PhD students, the impact measured by citations received, and productivity measured by number of publications. We run multivariate linear regressions to measure the relation of network cohesion, and publication outputs during doctoral years with future impact. Results: We find that those students in life sciences, but not in other fields, who have a cohesive co-author network during studies and two years after defence receive significantly more citations in eight years. We find that the number of papers published during PhD years and closely after the defence correlates negatively while the impact of these papers correlates positively with future success of students in all fields. Conclusions: These results highlight that research teams are effective learning environments for PhD students where collaborations create a tightly knit knowledge network.

                Fecaloma is an accumulation of hardened impacted stool typically occurring in the sigmoid colon and rectum. It mainly affects elderly and bedridden patients suffering from chronic constipation and can be revealed by different signs. We report a case of 74-year-old female, with anorexia, Alzheimer’s disease, and chronic constipation, who was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea and anuria. Clinical examination showed fever, Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13/15, tachycardia with a blood pressure of 100/50 mmHg, polypnea with hypoxia, foci of crepitant rales in pulmonary auscultation and a tender hypogastric mass with mild diffuse abdominal tenderness. Digital rectal examination revealed hard fecal material. Computed tomography (CT) images demonstrated bilateral pulmonary parenchymal condensation and a huge heterogeneous fecaloma in the sigmoid colon and rectum compressing the bladder. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of giant fecaloma causing aspiration pneumonia and urinary retention was retained. Manual disimpaction and bowel enemas were done but they were unsuccessful and surgical treatment was refused. Ultimately the patient died due to septic shock. Early diagnosis should be made to relieve symptoms and prevent complications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evolution of human respiratory virus epidemics [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pathogens are often assumed to evolve towards reduced virulence, but counterexamples abound. Faced with a new pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to be able to forecast the case fatality rate (CFR) and the overall disease burden. Considerable effort has been invested towards developing a mathematical framework for predicting virulence evolution. Although many approaches accurately recapitulate complex outcomes, most rely on an assumed trade-off between CFR and infection rate. It is often impractical to empirically validate this constraint for human pathogens. Methods: A compartment model with parameters tuning the degree to which symptomatic individuals are isolated and the duration of immunity is constructed and evaluated at both short timescales and at equilibrium. Results: We reveal kinetic constraints whereby variation of multiple parameters in concert leads to decreased CFR and increased pathogen fitness, whereas independent variation of the parameters decreases pathogen fitness. Smallpox, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza are analyzed as diverse representatives of human respiratory viruses. We show that highly virulent viruses, such as smallpox, are often constrained by the host behavior, whereas moderately virulent viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, appear to be typically constrained by the relationship between the duration of immunity and CFR. Conclusions: Evolution of human respiratory epidemics appears to be often kinetically constrained and a reduction in CFR should not be assumed. These results agree with previous work demonstrating an increase in virulence for smallpox and further predict that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to continue presenting a substantial disease burden. Herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and viruses with similar life history traits might be unachievable without vaccination. However, partial isolation of symptomatic individuals can have a major effect on the epidemic dynamics not only by reducing the number of fatalities in the short term but also by changing the evolutionary trajectory of moderate CFR viruses towards reduced CFR.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Discrepancy between Clove and Non-Clove Cigarette Smoke-Promoted Candida albicans Biofilm Formation with Precoating RNA-aptamer [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                This study explores the influence of precoating aptamer (Ca-apt1) on C. albicans viability while the fungus was growing in the presence of exposing condensed cigarette smoke (CSC), prepared from clove (CCSC) and non-clove (NCSC) cigarettes, for 48 h. Using qPCR, we found that mRNA expression of adhesion-associated genes (ALS3 and HWP1) was impaired by precoating C. albicans yeast cells with the aptamer. Conversely, the gene transcription was upregulated when aptamer-uncoated yeast was pre-treated with either CSC. In addition, by analysing the result of MTT ([3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] assay, we found that the presence of added CCSC or NCSC in growth medium for 48 h was significantly enhanced C. albicans biofilm development. However, the presence of precoated aptamer was significantly impaired biofilm development accelerated by the NCSC. The inhibitory effect of the Ca-apt1 was not dependent on the precoated aptamer (1ng/μL and 10 ng/μL). Interestingly, we noted that the enhancer effect of treated CCSC was no longer effective when the yeast had been precoated with 10 ng/μL aptamer tested. Additionally, light microscopy analysis revealed that precoating aptamer alleviates morphological changes of C. albicans (from yeast to hypha formation) that are enhanced by adding CCSC or NCSC in the growth medium. In conclusion, these results suggest that administration on Ca-ap1 exhibits a significant protective effect on CSC-induced biofilm formation by C. albicans.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A strategy for building and using a human reference pangenome [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                In March 2019, 45 scientists and software engineers from around the world converged at the University of California, Santa Cruz for the first pangenomics codeathon. The purpose of the meeting was to propose technical specifications and standards for a usable human pangenome as well as to build relevant tools for genome graph infrastructures. During the meeting, the group held several intense and productive discussions covering a diverse set of topics, including advantages of graph genomes over a linear reference representation, design of new methods that can leverage graph-based data structures, and novel visualization and annotation approaches for pangenomes. Additionally, the participants self-organized themselves into teams that worked intensely over a three-day period to build a set of pipelines and tools for specific pangenomic applications. A summary of the questions raised and the tools developed are reported in this manuscript.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural heterogeneity of cellular K5/K14 filaments as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Keratin intermediate filaments are an essential and major component of the cytoskeleton in epithelial cells. They form a stable yet dynamic filamentous network extending from the nucleus to the cell periphery, which provides resistance to mechanical stresses. Mutations in keratin genes are related to a variety of epithelial tissue diseases. Despite their importance, the molecular structure of keratin filaments remains largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the structure of keratin 5/keratin 14 filaments within ghost mouse keratinocytes by cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography. By averaging a large number of keratin segments, we have gained insights into the helical architecture of the filaments. Two-dimensional classification revealed profound variations in the diameter of keratin filaments and their subunit organization. Computational reconstitution of filaments of substantial length uncovered a high degree of internal heterogeneity along single filaments, which can contain regions of helical symmetry, regions with less symmetry and regions with significant diameter fluctuations. Cross section views of filaments revealed that keratins form hollow cylinders consisting of multiple protofilaments, with an electron dense core located in the center of the filament. These findings shed light on the complex and remarkable heterogenic architecture of keratin filaments, suggesting that they are highly flexible, dynamic cytoskeletal structures.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Murine muscle stem cell response to perturbations of the neuromuscular junction are attenuated with aging</a></h4>

              
                During aging and neuromuscular diseases, there is a progressive loss of skeletal muscle volume and function impacting mobility and quality of life. Muscle loss is often associated with denervation and a loss of resident muscle stem cells (satellite cells or MuSCs), however, the relationship between MuSCs and innervation has not been established. Herein, we administered severe neuromuscular trauma to a transgenic murine model that permits MuSC lineage tracing. We show that a subset of MuSCs specifically engraft in a position proximal to the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the synapse between myofibers and motor neurons, in healthy young adult muscles. In aging and in a mouse model of neuromuscular degeneration (Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase knockout – <i>Sod1<sup>-/-</sup></i>), this localized engraftment behavior was reduced. Genetic rescue of motor neurons in <i>Sod1<sup>-/-</sup> </i>mice reestablished integrity of the NMJ in a manner akin to young muscle and partially restored MuSC ability to engraft into positions proximal to the NMJ. Using single cell RNA-sequencing of MuSCs isolated from aged muscle, we demonstrate that a subset of MuSCs are molecularly distinguishable from MuSCs responding to myofiber injury and share similarity to synaptic myonuclei. Collectively, these data reveal unique features of MuSCs that respond to synaptic perturbations caused by aging and other stressors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Eukaryotic initiation factor EIF-3.G augments mRNA translation efficiency to regulate neuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                The translation initiation complex eIF3 imparts specialized functions to regulate protein expression. However, understanding of eIF3 activities in neurons remains limited despite widespread dysregulation of eIF3 subunits in neurological disorders. Here, we report a selective role of the <i>C. elegans </i>RNA-binding subunit EIF-3.G in shaping the neuronal protein landscape. We identify a missense mutation in the conserved Zinc-Finger (ZF) of EIF-3.G that acts in a gain-of-function manner to dampen neuronal hyperexcitation. Using neuron type-specific seCLIP, we systematically mapped EIF-3.G-mRNA interactions and identified EIF-3.G occupancy on GC-rich 5′UTRs of a select set of mRNAs enriched in activity-dependent functions. We demonstrate that the ZF mutation in EIF-3.G alters translation in a 5′UTR dependent manner. Our study reveals an <i>in vivo</i> mechanism for eIF3 in governing neuronal protein levels to control neuronal activity states and offers insights into how eIF3 dysregulation contributes to neuronal disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Scanned optogenetic control of mammalian somatosensory input to map input-specific behavioral outputs</a></h4>

              
                Somatosensory stimuli guide and shape behavior, from immediate protective reflexes to longer-term learning and higher-order processes related to pain and touch. However, somatosensory inputs are challenging to control in awake mammals due to the diversity and nature of contact stimuli. Application of cutaneous stimuli is currently limited to relatively imprecise methods as well as subjective behavioral measures. The strategy we present here overcomes these difficulties, achieving 'remote touch' with spatiotemporally precise and dynamic optogenetic stimulation by projecting light to a small defined area of skin. We mapped behavioral responses in freely behaving mice with specific nociceptor and low-threshold mechanoreceptor inputs. In nociceptors, sparse recruitment of single action potentials shapes rapid protective pain-related behaviors, including coordinated head orientation and body repositioning that depend on the initial body pose. In contrast, activation of low-threshold mechanoreceptors elicited slow-onset behaviors and more subtle whole-body behaviors. The strategy can be used to define specific behavioral repertoires, examine the timing and nature of reflexes, and dissect sensory, motor, cognitive and motivational processes guiding behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Decoding locomotion from population neural activity in moving C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                We investigated the neural representation of locomotion in the nematode C. elegans by recording population calcium activity during movement. We report that population activity more accurately decodes locomotion than any single neuron. Relevant signals are distributed across neurons with diverse tunings to locomotion. Two largely distinct subpopulations are informative for decoding velocity and curvature, and different neurons’ activities contribute features relevant for different aspects of a behavior or different instances of a behavioral motif. To validate our measurements, we labeled neurons AVAL and AVAR and found that their activity exhibited expected transients during backward locomotion. Finally, we compared population activity during movement and immobilization. Immobilization alters the correlation structure of neural activity and its dynamics. Some neurons positively correlated with AVA during movement become negatively correlated during immobilization and vice versa. This work provides needed experimental measurements that inform and constrain ongoing efforts to understand population dynamics underlying locomotion in C. elegans.

                To understand the architecture of human language, it is critical to examine diverse languages; yet most cognitive neuroscience research has focused on a handful of primarily Indo-European languages. Here, we report a large-scale investigation of the fronto-temporal language network across 45 languages and establish the cross-linguistic generality of its key functional properties, including general topography, left-lateralization, strong functional integration among its brain regions, and functional selectivity for language processing.

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">GFAP-IL6 transgenic mice are characterised by astroglial and microglial activation predominantly in the cerebellum, hallmarks of many neuroinflammatory conditions. However, information available regarding the proteome profile associated with IL-6 overexpression in the mouse brain is limited. This study investigated the cerebellum proteome using a top-down proteomics approach using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry and correlated these data with motor deficits using the elevated beam walking and accelerod tests. In a detailed proteomic analysis, a total of 67 differentially expressed proteoforms including 47 cytosolic and 20 membrane-bound proteoforms were identified. Bioinformatics and literature mining analyses revealed that these proteins were associated with three distinct classes: metabolic and neurodegenerative processes as well as protein aggregation. The GFAP-IL6 mice exhibited impaired motor skills in the elevated beam walking test measured by their average scores of ‘number of footslips’ and ‘time to traverse’ values. Correlation of the proteoforms' expression levels with the motor test scores showed a significant positive correlation to peroxiredoxin-6 and negative correlation to alpha-internexin and mitochondrial cristae subunit Mic19. These findings suggest that the observed changes in the proteoform levels caused by IL-6 overexpression might contribute to the motor function deficits.</p>

	<p>A reliable method for non-invasive detection of dangerous intracranial pressure (ICP) elevations is still unavailable. In this preliminary study, we investigate quantitatively our observation that superimposing waveforms of transcranial Doppler blood flow velocity (FV) and arterial blood pressure (ABP) may help in non-invasive identification of ICP plateau waves. Recordings of FV, ABP and ICP in 160 patients with severe head injury (treated in the Neurocritical Care Unit at Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK) were reviewed retrospectively. From that cohort, we identified 18 plateau waves registered in eight patients. A “measure of dissimilarity” (Dissimilarity/Difference Index, DI) between ABP and FV waveforms was calculated in three following steps: 1. fragmentation of ABP and FV signal according to cardiac cycle; 2. obtaining the normalised representative ABP and FV cycles; and finally; 3. assessing their difference, represented by the area between both curves. DI appeared to discriminate ICP plateau waves from baseline episodes slightly better than conventional pulsatility index did: area under ROC curve 0.92 vs. 0.90, sensitivity 0.81 vs. 0.69, accuracy 0.88 vs. 0.84, respectively. The concept of DI, if further tested and improved, might be used for non-invasive detection of ICP plateau waves.</p>

	<p>Hemispheric asymmetries in affective and cognitive functions have been extensively studied. While both cerebral hemispheres contribute to most affective and cognitive processes, neuroscientific literature and neuropsychological evidence support an overall right hemispheric dominance for emotion, attention and arousal. Emotional stimuli, especially those with survival value such as threat, tend to be prioritized in attentional resource competition. Arousing unpleasant emotional stimuli have prioritized access, especially to right-lateralized attention networks. Interference of task performance may be observed when limited resources are exhausted by task- and emotion-related processing. Tasks that rely on right hemisphere-dependent processing, like attending to the left visual hemifield or global-level visual features, are especially vulnerable to interference due to attention capture by unpleasant emotional stimuli. The aim of this review is to present literature regarding the special role of the right hemisphere in affective and attentional brain processes and their interaction. Furthermore, clinical and technological implications of this interaction will be presented. Initially, the effects of focal right hemisphere lesion or atrophy on emotional functions will be introduced. Neurological right hemisphere syndromes including aprosodia, anosognosia and neglect, which further point to the predominance of the intact right hemisphere in emotion, attention and arousal will be presented. Then there will be a brief review of electrophysiological evidence, as well as evidence from patients with neglect that support attention capture by emotional stimuli in the right hemisphere. Subsequently, experimental work on the interaction of emotion, attention and cognition in the right hemispheres of healthy subjects will be presented. Finally, clinical implications for better understanding and assessment of alterations in emotion–attention interaction due to brain disorder or treatment, such as neuromodulation, that impact affective brain functions will be discussed. It will be suggested that measuring right hemispheric emotion–attention interactions may provide basis for novel biomarkers of brain health. Such biomarkers allow for improved diagnostics in brain damage and disorders and optimized treatments. To conclude, future technological applications will be outlined regarding brain physiology-based measures that reflect engagement of the right hemisphere in affective and attentional processes.</p>

	<p> Visual encoding models are important computational models for understanding how information is processed along the visual stream. Many improved visual encoding models have been developed from the perspective of the model architecture and the learning objective, but these are limited to the supervised learning method. From the view of unsupervised learning mechanisms, this paper utilized a pre-trained neural network to construct a visual encoding model based on contrastive self-supervised learning for the ventral visual stream measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We first extracted features using the ResNet50 model pre-trained in contrastive self-supervised learning (ResNet50-CSL model), trained a linear regression model for each voxel, and finally calculated the prediction accuracy of different voxels. Compared with the ResNet50 model pre-trained in a supervised classification task, the ResNet50-CSL model achieved an equal or even relatively better encoding performance in multiple visual cortical areas. Moreover, the ResNet50-CSL model performs hierarchical representation of input visual stimuli, which is similar to the human visual cortex in its hierarchical information processing. Our experimental results suggest that the encoding model based on contrastive self-supervised learning is a strong computational model to compete with supervised models, and contrastive self-supervised learning proves an effective learning method to extract human brain-like representations.</p>

	<p>In the context of geriatric research, a growing body of evidence links normal age-related changes in sleep with many adverse health outcomes, especially a decline in cognition in older adults. The most important sleep alterations that continue to worsen after 60 years involve sleep timing, (especially early wake time, phase advance), sleep maintenance (continuity of sleep interrupted by numerous awakenings) and reduced amount of sigma activity (during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep) associated with modifications of sleep spindle characteristics (density, amplitude, frequency) and spindle–Slow Wave coupling. After 60 years, there is a very clear gender-dependent deterioration in sleep. Even if there are degradations of sleep after 60 years, daytime wake level and especially daytime sleepiness is not modified with age. On the other hand, under sleep deprivation condition, older adults show smaller cognitive impairments than younger adults, suggesting an age-related lower vulnerability to extended wakefulness. These sleep and cognitive age-related modifications would be due to a reduced homeostatic drive and consequently a reduced sleep need, an attenuation of circadian drive (reduction of sleep forbidden zone in late afternoon and wake forbidden zone in early morning), a modification of the interaction of the circadian and homeostatic processes and/or an alteration of subcortical structures involved in generation of circadian and homeostatic drive, or connections to the cerebral cortex with age. The modifications and interactions of these two processes with age are still uncertain, and still require further investigation. The understanding of the respective contribution of circadian and homeostatic processes in the regulation of neurobehavioral function with aging present a challenge for improving health, management of cognitive decline and potential early chronobiological or sleep-wake interventions.</p>

The aim of this study was to explore whether adding a computer-based training on EFs to an ordinary rehabilitation program, regardless of the specific brain damage and clinical impairment (motor, language, or cognitive), could improve rehabilitation outcomes in patients with stroke. An EF training was designed to have minimal motor and expressive language demands and to be applied to a wide range of clinical conditions. A total of 37 stroke patients were randomly assigned to two groups: a training group, which performed the EF training in addition to the ordinary rehabilitation program (treatment as usual), and a control group, which performed the ordinary rehabilitation exclusively. Both groups were assessed before and after the rehabilitation program on neuropsychological tests covering multiple cognitive domains, and on functional scales (Barthel index, Functional Independence Measure). The results showed that only patients who received the training improved their scores on the Attentional Matrices and Phonemic Fluency tests after the rehabilitation program. Moreover, they showed a greater functional improvement in the Barthel scale as well. These results suggest that combining an EF training with an ordinary rehabilitation program potentiates beneficial effects of the latter, especially in promoting independence in activities of daily living.</p>

	<p>Despite the high number of studies on mental health among healthcare workers, only a few have attempted to assess the mental health of people with chronic diseases during the COVID-19 crisis. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, and depression among people with chronic diseases working in healthcare and in other professions. The study participants were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of 441 healthcare workers, and the second consisted of 572 non-healthcare professionals. Correlation analysis showed a strong correlation between autoimmune diseases and an increase in GAD-7 scale, ISI score, and PHQ-9 scale. Therefore, only autoimmune diseases were included for further analyses as a predictor of insomnia, depression, and anxiety. After adjusting the results for gender, age, smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and profession, the group with autoimmune diseases showed a more than a 2-fold increase in the risk of anxiety symptoms, a more than 2.5-fold increase in the risk of depressive symptoms, and a 4-fold increase in the risk of insomnia symptoms. This study shows that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of insomnia, anxiety disorders, and depressive disorders may depend on the pre-existent health status of an individual rather than on their profession.</p>

                <p>In an interconnected world, understanding policy spillovers is essential. We propose a program evaluation framework to measure policy spillover effects and apply that framework to study the governmental responses to COVID-19 in the United States. Our analysis suggests the presence of social spillovers. We estimate that while state closures directly reduced mobility by 3 to 4%, all other states locking down further decreased mobility in the focal state by 8 to 14%. Similarly, while reopening directly increased mobility by 2 to 3%, all other states&rsquo; reopening increased mobility in the focal state by 12 to 21%. Our analysis also suggests geographic spillovers: Travel from locked down origins to open destinations increased by 12 to 29%. In contrast, travel from reopened origins to locked down destinations decreased by 6 to 7% for nearby counties and by 14 to 18% for distant counties. Despite its limitations, we believe that our approach takes the first steps toward creating a framework for interdependent program evaluation across policy domains.</p>

                <p>Self-assembled ionic liquid crystals can transport water and ions via the periodic nanochannels, and these materials are promising candidates as water treatment membranes. Molecular insights on the water transport process are, however, less investigated because of computational difficulties of ionic soft matters and the self-assembly. Here we report specific behavior of water molecules in the nanochannels by using the self-consistent modeling combining density functional theory and molecular dynamics and the large-scale molecular dynamics calculation. The simulations clearly provide the one-dimensional (1D) and 3D-interconnected nanochannels of self-assembled columnar and bicontinuous structures, respectively, with the precise mesoscale order observed by x-ray diffraction measurement. Water molecules are then confined inside the nanochannels with the formation of hydrogen bonding network. The quantitative analyses of free energetics and anisotropic diffusivity reveal that, the mesoscale geometry of 1D nanodomain profits the nature of water transport via advantages of dissolution and diffusion mechanisms inside the ionic nanochannels.</p>

                <p>Understanding of dedifferentiation, an indicator of poo prognosis for patients with thyroid cancer, has been hampered by imprecise and incomplete characterization of its heterogeneity and its attributes. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we explored the landscape of thyroid cancer at single-cell resolution with 46,205 cells and delineated its dedifferentiation process and suppressive immune microenvironment. The developmental trajectory indicated that anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) cells were derived from a small subset of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) cells. Moreover, a potential functional role of <I>CREB3L1</I> on ATC development was revealed by integrated analyses of copy number alteration and transcriptional regulatory network. Multiple genes in differentiation-related pathways (e.g., EMT) were involved as the downstream targets of CREB3L1, increased expression of which can thus predict higher relapse risk of PTC. Collectively, our study provided insights into the heterogeneity and molecular evolution of thyroid cancer and highlighted the potential driver role of <I>CREB3L1</I> in its dedifferentiation process.</p>

                <p>Spin-momentum locking is a universal wave phenomenon promising for applications in electronics and photonics. In acoustics, Lord Rayleigh showed that surface acoustic waves exhibit a characteristic elliptical particle motion strikingly similar to spin-momentum locking. Although these waves have become one of the few phononic technologies of industrial relevance, the observation of their transverse spin remained an open challenge. Here, we observe the full spin dynamics by detecting ultrafast electron cycloids driven by the gyrating electric field produced by a surface acoustic wave propagating on a slab of lithium niobate. A tubular quantum well wrapped around a nanowire serves as an ultrafast sensor tracking the full cyclic motion of electrons. Our acousto-optoelectrical approach opens previously unknown directions in the merged fields of nanoacoustics, nanophotonics, and nanoelectronics for future exploration.</p>

                <p>The hydrological cycle intensifies under global warming with precipitation increases. How the increased precipitation varies temporally at a given location has vital implications for regional climates and ecosystem services. On the basis of ensemble climate model projections under a high-emission scenario, here, we show that approximately two-thirds of land on Earth will face a "wetter and more variable" hydroclimate on daily to multiyear time scales. This means wider swings between wet and dry extremes. Such an amplification of precipitation variability is particularly prominent over climatologically wet regions, with percentage increases in variability more than twice those in mean precipitation. Thermodynamic effects, linked to increased moisture availability, increase precipitation variability uniformly everywhere. It is the dynamic effects (negative) linked to weakened circulation variability that make precipitation variability changes strongly region dependent. The increase in precipitation variability poses an additional challenge to the climate resilience of infrastructures and human society.</p>

                <p>Men with more advantaged socioeconomic position (SEP) have been observed to have higher levels of testosterone. It is unclear whether these associations arise because testosterone has a causal impact on SEP. In 306,248 participants of UK Biobank, we performed sex-stratified genome-wide association analysis to identify genetic variants associated with testosterone. Using the identified variants, we performed Mendelian randomization analysis of the influence of testosterone on socioeconomic position, including income, employment status, neighborhood-level deprivation, and educational qualifications; on health, including self-rated health and body mass index; and on risk-taking behavior. We found little evidence that testosterone affected socioeconomic position, health, or risk-taking. Our results therefore suggest that it is unlikely that testosterone meaningfully affects these outcomes in men or women. Differences between Mendelian randomization and multivariable-adjusted estimates suggest that previously reported associations with socioeconomic position and health may be due to residual confounding or reverse causation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Model-based aversive learning in humans is supported by preferential task state reactivation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Harm avoidance is critical for survival, yet little is known regarding the neural mechanisms supporting avoidance in the absence of trial-and-error experience. Flexible avoidance may be supported by a mental model (i.e., model-based), a process for which neural reactivation and sequential replay have emerged as candidate mechanisms. During an aversive learning task, combined with magnetoencephalography, we show prospective and retrospective reactivation during planning and learning, respectively, coupled to evidence for sequential replay. Specifically, when individuals plan in an aversive context, we find preferential reactivation of subsequently chosen goal states. Stronger reactivation is associated with greater hippocampal theta power. At outcome receipt, unchosen goal states are reactivated regardless of outcome valence. Replay of paths leading to goal states was modulated by outcome valence, with aversive outcomes associated with stronger reverse replay than safe outcomes. Our findings are suggestive of avoidance involving simulation of unexperienced states through hippocampally mediated reactivation and replay.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Size- and composition-controlled intermetallic nanocrystals via amalgamation seeded growth</a></h4>

              
                <p>Intermetallic nanocrystals are a large family of emerging materials with extensive applications in many fields. Yet, a generalized synthetic method for intermetallic nanocrystals is lacking. Here, we report the development of a colloidal synthesis method based on amalgamation of monometallic nanocrystal seeds with low&ndash;melting point metals. We use this approach to achieve crystalline and compositionally uniform intermetallic nanocrystals of Au-Ga, Ag-Ga, Cu-Ga, Ni-Ga, Pd-Ga, Pd-In, and Pd-Zn compounds. We demonstrate both compositional tunability across the phase spaces (e.g., AuGa<SUB>2</SUB>, AuGa, Au<SUB>7</SUB>Ga<SUB>2</SUB>, and Ga-doped Au), size tunability (e.g., 14.0-, 7.6-, and 3.8-nm AuGa<SUB>2</SUB>), and size uniformity (e.g., 5.4% size deviations). This approach makes it possible to systematically achieve size- and composition-controlled intermetallic nanocrystals, opening up a multitude of possibilities for these materials.</p>

                <p>Integrating signals is essential for cell survival, leading to the concept of synthetic lethality. However, how signaling is integrated to control cell migration remains unclear. By conducting a "two-hit" screen, we revealed the synergistic reduction of cell migration when serine-threonine kinase 40 (STK40) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were simultaneously suppressed. Single-cell analyses showed that STK40 knockdown reduced cell motility and coordination by strengthening focal adhesion (FA) complexes. Furthermore, STK40 knockdown reduced the stability of yes-associated protein (YAP) and subsequently decreased YAP transported into the nucleus, while MAPK inhibition further weakened YAP activities in the nucleus to disturb FA remodeling. Together, we unveiled an integrated STK40-YAP-MAPK system regulating cell migration and introduced "synthetic dysmobility" as a novel strategy to collaboratively control cell migration.</p>

                <p>Biomaterials without exogenous cells or therapeutic agents often fail to achieve rapid endogenous bone regeneration with high quality. Here, we reported a class of three-dimensional (3D) nanofiber scaffolds with hierarchical structure and controlled alignment for effective endogenous cranial bone regeneration. 3D scaffolds consisting of radially aligned nanofibers guided and promoted the migration of bone marrow stem cells from the surrounding region to the center in vitro. These scaffolds showed the highest new bone volume, surface coverage, and mineral density among the tested groups in vivo. The regenerated bone exhibited a radially aligned fashion, closely recapitulating the scaffold&rsquo;s architecture. The organic phase in regenerated bone showed an aligned, layered, and densely packed structure, while the inorganic mineral phase showed a uniform distribution with smaller pore size and an even distribution of stress upon the simulated compression. We expect that this study will inspire the design of next-generation biomaterials for effective endogenous bone regeneration with desired quality.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Molecular mechanism for kinesin-1 direct membrane recognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>The cargo-binding capabilities of cytoskeletal motor proteins have expanded during evolution through both gene duplication and alternative splicing. For the light chains of the kinesin-1 family of microtubule motors, this has resulted in an array of carboxyl-terminal domain sequences of unknown molecular function. Here, combining phylogenetic analyses with biophysical, biochemical, and cell biology approaches, we identify a highly conserved membrane-induced curvature-sensitive amphipathic helix within this region of a subset of long kinesin light-chain paralogs and splice isoforms. This helix mediates the direct binding of kinesin-1 to lipid membranes. Membrane binding requires specific anionic phospholipids, and it contributes to kinesin-1&ndash;dependent lysosome positioning, a canonical activity that, until now, has been attributed exclusively the recognition of organelle-associated cargo adaptor proteins. This leads us to propose a protein-lipid coincidence detection framework for kinesin-1&ndash;mediated organelle transport.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Unifying fluctuation-dissipation temperatures of slow-evolving nonequilibrium systems from the perspective of inherent structures</a></h4>

              
                <p>For nonequilibrium systems, how to define temperature is one of the key and difficult issues to solve. Although effective temperatures have been proposed and studied to this end, it still remains elusive what they actually are. Here, we focus on the fluctuation-dissipation temperatures and report that such effective temperatures of slow-evolving systems represent characteristic temperatures of their equilibrium counterparts. By calculating the fluctuation-dissipation relation of inherent structures, we obtain a temperature-like quantity <I>T</I><SUB>IS</SUB>. For monocomponent crystal-formers, <I>T</I><SUB>IS</SUB> agrees well with the crystallization temperature <I>T</I><SUB>c</SUB>, while it matches with the onset temperature <I>T</I><SUB>on</SUB> for glass-formers. It also agrees with effective temperatures of typical nonequilibrium systems, such as aging glasses, quasi-static shear flows, and quasi-static self-propelled flows. From the unique perspective of inherent structures, our study reveals the nature of effective temperatures and the underlying connections between nonequilibrium and equilibrium systems and confirms the equivalence between <I>T</I><SUB>on</SUB> and <I>T</I><SUB>c</SUB>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Regulation of telomere homeostasis and genomic stability in cancer by N6-adenosine methylation (m6A)</a></h4>

              
                <p>The role of RNA methylation on <I>N</I><sup>6</sup>-adenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) in cancer has been acknowledged, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we identified homeobox containing 1 (<I>HMBOX1</I>) as an authentic target mRNA of m<sup>6</sup>A machinery, which is highly methylated in malignant cells compared to the normal counterparts and subject to expedited degradation upon the modification. m<sup>6</sup>A-mediated down-regulation of <I>HMBOX1</I> causes telomere dysfunction and inactivation of p53 signaling, which leads to chromosome abnormalities and aggressive phenotypes. CRISPR-based, m<sup>6</sup>A-editing tools further prove that the methyl groups on <I>HMBOX1</I> per se contribute to the generation of altered cancer genome. In multiple types of human cancers, expression of the RNA methyltransferase <I>METTL3</I> is negatively correlated with the telomere length but favorably with fractions of altered cancer genome, whereas <I>HMBOX1</I> mRNA levels show the opposite patterns. Our work suggests that the cancer-driving genomic alterations may potentially be fixed by rectifying particular epitranscriptomic program.</p>

                <p>Advances in molecular profiling have opened up the possibility to map the expression of genes in cells, tissues, and organs in the human body. Here, we combined single-cell transcriptomics analysis with spatial antibody-based protein profiling to create a high-resolution single&ndash;cell type map of human tissues. An open access atlas has been launched to allow researchers to explore the expression of human protein-coding genes in 192 individual cell type clusters. An expression specificity classification was performed to determine the number of genes elevated in each cell type, allowing comparisons with bulk transcriptomics data. The analysis highlights distinct expression clusters corresponding to cell types sharing similar functions, both within the same organs and between organs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Disassembly of HIV envelope glycoprotein trimer immunogens is driven by antibodies elicited via immunization</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rationally designed protein subunit vaccines are being developed for a variety of viruses including influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV. These vaccines are based on stabilized versions of the primary targets of neutralizing antibodies on the viral surface, namely, viral fusion glycoproteins. While these immunogens display the epitopes of potent neutralizing antibodies, they also present epitopes recognized by non-neutralizing or weakly neutralizing ("off-target") antibodies. Using our recently developed electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping approach, we have uncovered a phenomenon wherein off-target antibodies elicited by HIV trimer subunit vaccines cause the otherwise highly stabilized trimeric proteins to degrade into cognate protomers. Further, we show that these protomers expose an expanded suite of off-target epitopes, normally occluded inside the prefusion conformation of trimer, that subsequently elicit further off-target antibody responses. Our study provides critical insights for further improvement of HIV subunit trimer vaccines for future rounds of the iterative vaccine design process.</p>

                <p>Bacteria often interact with their environment through extracellular molecules that increase access to limiting resources. These secretions can act as public goods, creating incentives for exploiters to invade and "steal" public goods away from producers. This phenomenon has been studied extensively in vitro, but little is known about the occurrence and impact of public good exploiters in the environment. Here, we develop a genomic approach to systematically identify bacteria that can exploit public goods produced during the degradation of polysaccharides. Focusing on chitin, a highly abundant marine biopolymer, we show that public good exploiters are active in natural chitin degrading microbial communities, invading early during colonization, and potentially hindering degradation. In contrast to in vitro studies, we find that exploiters and degraders belong to distant lineages, facilitating their coexistence. Our approach opens novel avenues to use the wealth of genomic data available to infer ecological roles and interactions among microbes.</p>

                <p>Cardiac sarcoidosis (CS), an inflammatory disease characterized by formation of granulomas in the heart, is associated with high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) from ventricular arrhythmias. Current "one-size-fits-all" guidelines for SCD risk assessment in CS result in insufficient appropriate primary prevention. Here, we present a two-step precision risk prediction technology for patients with CS. First, a patient&rsquo;s arrhythmogenic propensity arising from heterogeneous CS-induced ventricular remodeling is assessed using a novel personalized magnetic-resonance imaging and positron-emission tomography fusion mechanistic model. The resulting simulations of arrhythmogenesis are fed, together with a set of imaging and clinical biomarkers, into a supervised classifier. In a retrospective study of 45 patients, the technology achieved testing results of 60% sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI): 57-63%], 72% specificity [95% CI: 70-74%], and 0.754 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [95% CI: 0.710-0.797]. It outperformed clinical metrics, highlighting its potential to transform CS risk stratification.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cannabidiol Inhibition of Murine Primary Nociceptors: Tight Binding to Slow Inactivated States of Nav1.8 Channels</a></h4>

              
                <p>The nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) has been shown to have analgesic effects in animal studies but little is known about its mechanism of action. We examined the effects of CBD on intrinsic excitability of primary pain-sensing neurons. Studying acutely dissociated capsaicin-sensitive mouse DRG neurons at 37&deg;C, we found that CBD effectively inhibited repetitive action potential firing, from 15&ndash;20 action potentials evoked by 1 s current injections in control to 1&ndash;3 action potentials with 2 &mu;<scp>m</scp> CBD. Reduction of repetitive firing was accompanied by a reduction of action potential height, widening of action potentials, reduction of the afterhyperpolarization, and increased propensity to enter depolarization block. Voltage-clamp experiments showed that CBD inhibited both TTX-sensitive and TTX-resistant (TTX-R) sodium currents in a use-dependent manner. CBD showed strong state-dependent inhibition of TTX-R channels, with fast binding to inactivated channels during depolarizations and slow unbinding on repolarization. CBD alteration of channel availability at various voltages suggested that CBD binds especially tightly [<I>K</I><SUB>d</SUB> (dissociation constant), ~150 n<scp>m</scp>] to the slow inactivated state of TTX-R channels, which can be substantially occupied at voltages as negative as &ndash;40 mV. Remarkably, CBD was more potent in inhibiting TTX-R channels and inhibiting action potential firing than the local anesthetic bupivacaine. We conclude that CBD might produce some of its analgesic effects by direct effects on neuronal excitability, with tight binding to the slow inactivated state of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.8 channels contributing to effective inhibition of repetitive firing by modest depolarizations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cannabidiol (CBD) has been shown to inhibit pain in various rodent models, but the mechanism of this effect is unknown. We describe the ability of CBD to inhibit repetitive action potential firing in primary nociceptive neurons from mouse dorsal root ganglia and analyze the effects on voltage-dependent sodium channels. We find that CBD interacts with TTX-resistant sodium channels in a state-dependent manner suggesting particularly tight binding to slow inactivated states of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.8 channels, which dominate the overall inactivation of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.8 channels for small maintained depolarizations from the resting potential. The results suggest that CBD can exert analgesic effects in part by directly inhibiting repetitive firing of primary nociceptors and suggest a strategy of identifying compounds that bind selectively to slow inactivated states of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.8 channels for developing effective analgesics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Subregion-Specific Regulation of Dopamine D1 Receptor Signaling in the Striatum: Implication for L-DOPA-Induced Dyskinesia</a></h4>

              
                <p>The striatum is the main structure of the basal ganglia. The striatum receives inputs from various cortical areas, and its subregions play distinct roles in motor and emotional functions. Recently, striatal maps based on corticostriatal connectivity and striosome-matrix compartmentalization were developed, and we were able to subdivide the striatum into seven subregions. Dopaminergic modulation of the excitability of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) is critical for striatal function. In this study, we investigated the functional properties of dopamine signaling in seven subregions of the striatum from male mice. By monitoring the phosphorylation of PKA substrates including DARPP-32 in mouse striatal slices, we identified two subregions with low D1 receptor signaling: the dorsolateral portion of the intermediate/rostral part (DL-IR) and the intermediate/caudal part (IC). Low D1 receptor signaling in the two subregions was maintained by phosphodiesterase (PDE)10A and muscarinic M4 receptors. In an animal model of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced hemi-parkinsonism, D1 receptor signaling was upregulated in almost all subregions including the DL-IR, but not in the IC. When L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) was developed, D1 receptor signaling in the IC was upregulated and correlated with the severity of LID. Our results suggest that the function of the striatum is maintained through the subregion-specific regulation of dopamine D1 receptor signaling and that the aberrant activation of D1 receptor signaling in the IC is involved in LID. Future studies focusing on D1 receptor signaling in the IC of the striatum will facilitate the development of novel therapeutics for LID.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent progress in striatal mapping based on corticostriatal connectivity and striosome-matrix compartmentalization allowed us to subdivide the striatum into seven subregions. Analyses of D1 receptor signaling in the seven subregions identified two unique subregions with low D1 receptor signaling: the dorsolateral portion of the intermediate/rostral part (DL-IR) and the intermediate/caudal part (IC). Aberrant activation of D1 receptor signaling in the IC is involved in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). Previous studies of LID have mainly focused on the DL-IR, but not on the IC of the striatum. Future studies to clarify aberrant D1 receptor signaling in the IC are required to develop novel therapeutics for LID.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Protein Kinase C-Mediated Phosphorylation and {alpha}2{delta}-1 Interdependently Regulate NMDA Receptor Trafficking and Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p><I>N</I>-methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are important for synaptic plasticity associated with many physiological functions and neurologic disorders. Protein kinase C (PKC) activation increases the phosphorylation and activity of NMDARs, and &alpha;2-1 is a critical NMDAR-interacting protein and controls synaptic trafficking of NMDARs. In this study, we determined the relative roles of PKC and &alpha;2-1 in the control of NMDAR activity. We found that &alpha;2-1 coexpression significantly increased NMDAR activity in HEK293 cells transfected with GluN1/GluN2A or GluN1/GluN2B. PKC activation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) increased receptor activity only in cells coexpressing GluN1/GluN2A and &alpha;2-1. Remarkably, PKC inhibition with Go&#x0308;6983 abolished &alpha;2-1-coexpression-induced potentiation of NMDAR activity in cells transfected with GluN1/GluN2A or GluN1/GluN2B. Treatment with PMA increased the &alpha;2-1&ndash;GluN1 interaction and promoted &alpha;2-1 and GluN1 cell surface trafficking. PMA also significantly increased NMDAR activity of spinal dorsal horn neurons and the amount of &alpha;2-1-bound GluN1 protein complexes in spinal cord synaptosomes in wild-type mice, but not in &alpha;2-1 knockout mice. Furthermore, inhibiting &alpha;2-1 with pregabalin or disrupting the &alpha;2-1&ndash;NMDAR interaction with the &alpha;2-1 C-terminus peptide abolished the potentiating effect of PMA on NMDAR activity. Additionally, using quantitative phosphoproteomics and mutagenesis analyses, we identified S929 on GluN2A and S1413 (S1415 in humans) on GluN2B as the phosphorylation sites responsible for NMDAR potentiation by PKC and &alpha;2-1. Together, our findings demonstrate the interdependence of &alpha;2-1 and PKC phosphorylation in regulating NMDAR trafficking and activity. The phosphorylation-dependent, dynamic &alpha;2-1&ndash;NMDAR interaction constitutes an important molecular mechanism of synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A major challenge in studies of protein phosphorylation is to define the functional significance of each phosphorylation event and determine how various signaling pathways are coordinated in response to neuronal activity to shape synaptic plasticity. PKC phosphorylates transporters, ion channels, and G-protein-coupled receptors in signal transduction. In this study, we showed that &alpha;2-1 is indispensable for PKC-activation-induced surface and synaptic trafficking of NMDARs, whereas the &alpha;2-1&ndash;NMDAR interaction is controlled by PKC-induced phosphorylation. Our findings reveal that &alpha;2-1 mainly functions as a phospho-binding protein in the control of NMDAR trafficking and activity. This information provides new mechanistic insight into the reciprocal roles of PKC-mediated phosphorylation and &alpha;2-1 in regulating NMDARs and in the therapeutic actions of gabapentinoids.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Serine Protease Homolog, Scarface, Is Sensitive to Nutrient Availability and Modulates the Development of the Drosophila Blood-Brain Barrier</a></h4>

              
                <p>The adaptable transcriptional response to changes in food availability not only ensures animal survival but also lets embryonic development progress. Interestingly, the CNS is preferentially protected from periods of malnutrition, a phenomenon known as "brain sparing." However, the mechanisms that mediate this response remain poorly understood. To get a better understanding of this, we used <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> as a model, analyzing the transcriptional response of neural stem cells (neuroblasts) and glia of the blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB) from larvae of both sexes during nutrient restriction using targeted DamID. We found differentially expressed genes in both neuroblasts and glia of the BBB, although the effect of nutrient deficiency was primarily observed in the BBB. We characterized the function of a nutritional sensitive gene expressed in the BBB, the serine protease homolog, <I>scarface</I> (<I>scaf</I>). Scaf is expressed in subperineurial glia in the BBB in response to nutrition. Tissue-specific knockdown of <I>scaf</I> increases subperineurial glia endoreplication and proliferation of perineurial glia in the blood&ndash;brain barrier. Furthermore, neuroblast proliferation is diminished on <I>scaf</I> knockdown in subperineurial glia. Interestingly, reexpression of Scaf in subperineurial glia is able to enhance neuroblast proliferation and brain growth of animals in starvation. Finally, we show that loss of <I>scaf</I> in the blood&ndash;brain barrier increases sensitivity to drugs in adulthood, suggesting a physiological impairment. We propose that Scaf integrates the nutrient status to modulate the balance between neurogenesis and growth of the BBB, preserving the proper equilibrium between the size of the barrier and the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The <I>Drosophila</I> BBB separates the CNS from the open circulatory system. The BBB glia are not only acting as a physical segregation of tissues but participate in the regulation of the metabolism and neurogenesis during development. Here we analyze the transcriptional response of the BBB glia to nutrient deprivation during larval development, a condition in which protective mechanisms are switched on in the brain. Our findings show that the gene <I>scarface</I> reduces growth in the BBB while promoting the proliferation of neural stem, assuring the balanced growth of the larval brain. Thus, Scarface would link animal nutrition with brain development, coordinating neurogenesis with the growth of the BBB.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Generation and Characterization of a Cell Type-Specific, Inducible Cre-Driver Line to Study Olfactory Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>In sensory systems of the brain, mechanisms exist to extract distinct features from stimuli to generate a variety of behavioral repertoires. These often correspond to different cell types at various stages in sensory processing. In the mammalian olfactory system, complex information processing starts in the olfactory bulb, whose output is conveyed by mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs). Despite many differences between them, and despite the crucial position they occupy in the information hierarchy, Cre-driver lines that distinguish them do not yet exist. Here, we sought to identify genes that are differentially expressed between MCs and TCs of the mouse, with an ultimate goal to generate a cell type-specific Cre-driver line, starting from a transcriptome analysis using a large and publicly available single-cell RNA-seq dataset (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B73">Zeisel et al., 2018</cross-ref>). Many genes were differentially expressed, but only a few showed consistent expressions in MCs and at the specificity required. After further validating these putative markers using ISH, two genes (i.e., <I>Pkib</I> and <I>Lbdh2</I>) remained as promising candidates. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we generated Cre-driver lines and analyzed the resulting recombination patterns. This indicated that our new inducible Cre-driver line, <I>Lbhd2-CreERT2</I>, can be used to genetically label MCs in a tamoxifen dose-dependent manner, both in male and female mice, as assessed by soma locations, projection patterns, and sensory-evoked responses <I>in vivo</I>. Hence, this is a promising tool for investigating cell type-specific contributions to olfactory processing and demonstrates the power of publicly accessible data in accelerating science.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the brain, distinct cell types play unique roles. It is therefore important to have tools for studying unique cell types specifically. For the sense of smell in mammals, information is processed first by circuits of the olfactory bulb, where two types of cells, mitral cells and tufted cells, output different information. We generated a transgenic mouse line that enables mitral cells to be specifically labeled or manipulated. This was achieved by looking for genes that are specific to mitral cells using a large and public gene expression dataset, and creating a transgenic mouse using the gene editing technique, CRISPR/Cas9. This will allow scientists to better investigate parallel information processing underlying the sense of smell.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Comodulation of h- and Na+/K+ Pump Currents Expands the Range of Functional Bursting in a Central Pattern Generator by Navigating between Dysfunctional Regimes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Central pattern generators (CPGs), specialized oscillatory neuronal networks controlling rhythmic motor behaviors such as breathing and locomotion, must adjust their patterns of activity to a variable environment and changing behavioral goals. Neuromodulation adjusts these patterns by orchestrating changes in multiple ionic currents. In the medicinal leech, the endogenous neuromodulator myomodulin speeds up the heartbeat CPG by reducing the electrogenic Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump current and increasing h-current in pairs of mutually inhibitory leech heart interneurons (HNs), which form half-center oscillators (HN HCOs). Here we investigate whether the comodulation of two currents could have advantages over a single current in the control of functional bursting patterns of a CPG. We use a conductance-based biophysical model of an HN HCO to explain the experimental effects of myomodulin. We demonstrate that, in the model, comodulation of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump current and h-current expands the range of functional bursting activity by avoiding transitions into nonfunctional regimes, such as asymmetric bursting and plateau-containing seizure-like activity. We validate the model by finding parameters that reproduce temporal bursting characteristics matching experimental recordings from HN HCOs under control, three different myomodulin concentrations, and Cs<sup>+</sup> treated conditions. The matching cases are located along the border of an asymmetric regime away from the border with more dangerous seizure-like activity. We found a simple comodulation mechanism with an inverse relation between the pump and h-currents makes a good fit of the matching cases and comprises a general mechanism for the robust and flexible control of oscillatory neuronal networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Rhythm-generating neuronal circuits adjust their oscillatory patterns to accommodate a changing environment through neuromodulation. In different species, chemical messengers participating in such processes may target two or more membrane currents. In medicinal leeches, the neuromodulator myomodulin speeds up the heartbeat central pattern generator by reducing Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump current and increasing h-current. In a computational model, we show that this comodulation expands the range of central pattern generator's functional activity by navigating the circuit between dysfunctional regimes resulting in a much wider range of cycle period. This control would not be attainable by modulating only one current, emphasizing the synergy of combined effects. Given the prevalence of h-current and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump current in neurons, similar comodulation mechanisms may exist across species.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Moving a Shape behind a Slit: Partial Shape Representations in Inferior Temporal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Current models of object recognition are based on spatial representations build from object features that are simultaneously present in the retinal image. However, one can recognize an object when it moves behind a static occlude, and only a small fragment of its shape is visible through a slit at a given moment in time. Such anorthoscopic perception requires spatiotemporal integration of the successively presented shape parts during slit-viewing. Human fMRI studies suggested that ventral visual stream areas represent whole shapes formed through temporal integration during anorthoscopic perception. To examine the time course of shape-selective responses during slit-viewing, we recorded the responses of single inferior temporal (IT) neurons of rhesus monkeys to moving shapes that were only partially visible through a static narrow slit. The IT neurons signaled shape identity by their response when that was cumulated across the duration of the shape presentation. Their shape preference during slit-viewing equaled that for static, whole-shape presentations. However, when analyzing their responses at a finer time scale, we showed that the IT neurons responded to particular shape fragments that were revealed by the slit. We found no evidence for temporal integration of slit-views that result in a whole-shape representation, even when the monkey was matching slit-views of a shape to static whole-shape presentations. These data suggest that, although the temporally integrated response of macaque IT neurons can signal shape identity in slit-viewing conditions, the spatiotemporal integration needed for the formation of a whole-shape percept occurs in other areas, perhaps downstream to IT.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> One recognizes an object when it moves behind a static occluder and only a small fragment of its shape is visible through a static slit at a given moment in time.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Under Threat, Weaker Evidence Is Required to Reach Undesirable Conclusions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Critical decisions, such as in domains ranging from medicine to finance, are often made under threatening circumstances that elicit stress and anxiety. The negative effects of such reactions on learning and decision-making have been repeatedly underscored. In contrast, here we show that perceived threat alters the process by which evidence is accumulated in a way that may be adaptive. Participants (<I>n</I> = 91) completed a sequential evidence sampling task in which they were incentivized to accurately judge whether they were in a desirable state, which was associated with greater rewards than losses, or an undesirable state, which was associated with greater losses than rewards. Before the task participants in the "threat group" experienced a social-threat manipulation. Results show that perceived threat led to a reduction in the strength of evidence required to reach an undesirable judgment. Computational modeling revealed this was because of an increase in the relative rate by which negative information was accumulated. The effect of the threat manipulation was global, as the alteration to evidence accumulation was observed for information which was not directly related to the cause of the threat. Requiring weaker evidence to reach undesirable conclusions in threatening environments may be adaptive as it can lead to increased precautionary action.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To make good judgments, people gather information. As information is often unlimited, a decision has to be made as to when the data are sufficiently strong to reach a conclusion. Here, we show that this decision is significantly influenced by perceived threat. In particular, under threat, the rate of negative information accumulation increased, such that weaker evidence was required to reach an undesirable conclusion. Such modulation could be adaptive as it can result in enhanced cautious behavior in dangerous environments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Anterior Thalamic Inputs Are Required for Subiculum Spatial Coding, with Associated Consequences for Hippocampal Spatial Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Just as hippocampal lesions are principally responsible for "temporal lobe" amnesia, lesions affecting the anterior thalamic nuclei seem principally responsible for a similar loss of memory, "diencephalic" amnesia. Compared with the former, the causes of diencephalic amnesia have remained elusive. A potential clue comes from how the two sites are interconnected, as within the hippocampal formation, only the subiculum has direct, reciprocal connections with the anterior thalamic nuclei. We found that both permanent and reversible anterior thalamic nuclei lesions in male rats cause a cessation of subicular spatial signaling, reduce spatial memory performance to chance, but leave hippocampal CA1 place cells largely unaffected. We suggest that a core element of diencephalic amnesia stems from the information loss in hippocampal output regions following anterior thalamic pathology.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> At present, we know little about interactions between temporal lobe and diencephalic memory systems. Here, we focused on the subiculum, as the sole hippocampal formation region directly interconnected with the anterior thalamic nuclei. We combined reversible and permanent lesions of the anterior thalamic nuclei, electrophysiological recordings of the subiculum, and behavioral analyses. Our results were striking and clear: following permanent thalamic lesions, the diverse spatial signals normally found in the subiculum (including place cells, grid cells, and head-direction cells) all disappeared. Anterior thalamic lesions had no discernible impact on hippocampal CA1 place fields. Thus, spatial firing activity within the subiculum requires anterior thalamic function, as does successful spatial memory performance. Our findings provide a key missing part of the much bigger puzzle concerning why anterior thalamic damage is so catastrophic for spatial memory in rodents and episodic memory in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disentangling Semantic Composition and Semantic Association in the Left Temporal Lobe</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although composing two words into a complex representation (e.g., "coffee cake") is conceptually different from forming associations between a pair of words (e.g., "coffee, cake"), the brain regions supporting semantic composition have also been implicated for associative encoding. Here, we adopted a two-word magnetoencephalography (MEG) paradigm which varies compositionality ("French/Korean cheese" vs "France/Korea cheese") and strength of association ("France/French cheese" vs "Korea/Korean cheese") between the two words. We collected MEG data while 42 English speakers (24 females) viewed the two words successively in the scanner, and we applied both univariate regression analyses and multivariate pattern classification to the source estimates of the two words. We show that the left anterior temporal lobe (LATL) and left middle temporal lobe (LMTL) are distinctively modulated by semantic composition and semantic association. Specifically, the LATL is mostly sensitive to high-association compositional phrases, while the LMTL responds more to low-association compositional phrases. Pattern-based directed connectivity analyses further revealed a continuous information flow from the anterior to the middle temporal region, suggesting that the integration of adjective and noun properties originated earlier in the LATL is consistently delivered to the LMTL when the complex meaning is newly encountered. Taken together, our findings shed light into a functional dissociation within the left temporal lobe for compositional and distributional semantic processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Prior studies on semantic composition and associative encoding have been conducted independently within the subfields of language and memory, and they typically adopt similar two-word experimental paradigms. However, no direct comparison has been made on the neural substrates of the two processes. The current study relates the two streams of literature, and appeals to audiences in both subfields within cognitive neuroscience. Disentangling the neural computations for semantic composition and association also offers insight into modeling compositional and distributional semantics, which has been the subject of much discussion in natural language processing and cognitive science.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Model-Based Planning Deficits in Compulsivity Are Linked to Faulty Neural Representations of Task Structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>Compulsive individuals have deficits in model-based planning, but the mechanisms that drive this have not been established. We examined two candidates&mdash;that compulsivity is linked to (1) an impaired model of the task environment and/or (2) an inability to engage cognitive control when making choices. To test this, 192 participants performed a two-step reinforcement learning task with concurrent EEG recordings, and we related the neural and behavioral data to their scores on a self-reported transdiagnostic dimension of compulsivity. To examine subjects' internal model of the task, we used established behavioral and neural responses to unexpected events [reaction time (RT) slowing, P300 wave, and parietal-occipital alpha band power] measured when an unexpected transition occurred. To assess cognitive control, we probed theta power at the time of initial choice. As expected, model-based planning was linked to greater behavioral (RT) and neural (alpha power, but not P300) sensitivity to rare transitions. Critically, the sensitivities of both RT and alpha to task structure were weaker in those high in compulsivity. This RT-compulsivity effect was tested and replicated in an independent pre-existing dataset (<I>N</I> = 1413). We also found that mid-frontal theta power at the time of choice was reduced in highly compulsive individuals though its relation to model-based planning was less pronounced. These data suggest that model-based planning deficits in compulsive individuals may arise, at least in part, from having an impaired representation of the environment, specifically how actions lead to future states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Compulsivity is linked to poorer performance on tasks that require model-based planning, but it is unclear what precise mechanisms underlie this deficit. Do compulsive individuals fail to engage cognitive control at the time of choice? Or do they have difficulty in building and maintaining an accurate representation of their environment, the foundation needed to behave in a goal-directed manner? With reaction time and EEG measures in 192 individuals who performed a two-step decision-making task, we found that compulsive individuals are less sensitive to surprising action&ndash;state transitions, where they slow down less and show less alpha band suppression following a rare transition. These findings implicate failures in maintaining an accurate model of the world in model-based planning deficits in compulsivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">{alpha}2{delta}-1-Dependent NMDA Receptor Activity in the Hypothalamus Is an Effector of Genetic-Environment Interactions That Drive Persistent Hypertension</a></h4>

              
                <p>The interplay between genetic and environmental factors is critically involved in hypertension development. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus regulates sympathetic output during stress responses and chronic hypertension. In this study, we determined mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in the PVN in chronic stress-induced persistent hypertension in male borderline hypertensive rats (BHR), the first offspring of spontaneously hypertensive rats and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. In Wistar-Kyoto rats, chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) increased arterial blood pressure (ABP) and heart rate, which quickly returned to baseline after CUMS ended. In contrast, in BHR, CUMS caused persistent elevation in ABP, which lasted at least 2 weeks after CUMS ended. CUMS also increased the mRNA level of &alpha;2-1 and synaptic protein levels of GluN1, &alpha;2-1, and &alpha;2-1&ndash;GluN1 complexes in the PVN in BHR. Furthermore, CUMS significantly increased the frequency of miniature EPSCs and the amplitude of NMDAR currents in spinally projecting PVN neurons in BHR; these increases were normalized by blocking NMDARs with AP5, inhibiting &alpha;2-1 with gabapentin, or disrupting the &alpha;2-1&ndash;NMDAR interaction with &alpha;2-1Tat peptide. Microinjection of AP5 or &alpha;2-1Tat peptide into the PVN normalized elevated ABP and renal sympathetic nerve activity in stressed BHR. In addition, systemically administered gabapentin or memantine attenuated higher ABP induced by CUMS in BHR. Our findings indicate that chronic stress-induced persistent hypertension is mediated by augmented sympathetic outflow via &alpha;2-1&ndash;bound NMDARs in the PVN. This new information provides a cellular and molecular basis for how the genetic-environment interactions cause persistent hypertension.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chronic stress is a major risk factor for hypertension development, especially for individuals with a genetic predisposition to hypertension. Using a rat model of borderline hypertension, we showed that chronic stress induced long-lasting hypertension and sympathetic nerve hyperactivity, which were maintained by NMDAR activation in the hypothalamus. Chronic stress also increased the expression of &alpha;2-1, previously regarded as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel subunit, promoting physical interaction with and synaptic trafficking of NMDARs in the hypothalamus. Inhibiting &alpha;2-1, blocking NMDARs, or disrupting &alpha;2-1&ndash;bound NMDARs reversed chronic stress-induced sympathetic outflow and persistent hypertension. Thus, &alpha;2-1&ndash;dependent NMDAR activity in the hypothalamus is an effector of genetic-environment interactions and may be targeted for treating stress-induced neurogenic hypertension.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Inflammation-Induced Histamine Impairs the Capacity of Escitalopram to Increase Hippocampal Extracellular Serotonin</a></h4>

              
                <p>Commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) inhibit the serotonin transporter to correct a presumed deficit in extracellular serotonin signaling during depression. These agents bring clinical relief to many who take them; however, a significant and growing number of individuals are resistant to SSRIs. There is emerging evidence that inflammation plays a significant role in the clinical variability of SSRIs, though how SSRIs and inflammation intersect with synaptic serotonin modulation remains unknown. In this work, we use fast <I>in vivo</I> serotonin measurement tools to investigate the nexus between serotonin, inflammation, and SSRIs. Upon acute systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration in male and female mice, we find robust decreases in extracellular serotonin in the mouse hippocampus. We show that these decreased serotonin levels are supported by increased histamine activity (because of inflammation), acting on inhibitory histamine H3 heteroreceptors on serotonin terminals. Importantly, under LPS-induced histamine increase, the ability of escitalopram to augment extracellular serotonin is impaired because of an off-target action of escitalopram to inhibit histamine reuptake. Finally, we show that a functional decrease in histamine synthesis boosts the ability of escitalopram to increase extracellular serotonin levels following LPS. This work reveals a profound effect of inflammation on brain chemistry, specifically the rapidity of inflammation-induced decreased extracellular serotonin, and points the spotlight at a potentially critical player in the pathology of depression, histamine. The serotonin/histamine homeostasis thus, may be a crucial new avenue in improving serotonin-based treatments for depression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Acute LPS-induced inflammation (1) increases CNS histamine, (2) decreases CNS serotonin (via inhibitory histamine receptors), and (3) prevents a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) from effectively increasing extracellular serotonin. A targeted depletion of histamine recovers SSRI-induced increases in extracellular hippocampal serotonin.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A model of resource partitioning between foraging bees based on learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thibault Dubois, Cristian Pasquaretta, Andrew B. Barron, Jacques Gautrais, Mathieu Lihoreau</p>

Central place foraging pollinators tend to develop multi-destination routes (traplines) to exploit patchily distributed plant resources. While the formation of traplines by individual pollinators has been studied in detail, how populations of foragers use resources in a common area is an open question, difficult to address experimentally. We explored conditions for the emergence of resource partitioning among traplining bees using agent-based models built from experimental data of bumblebees foraging on artificial flowers. In the models, bees learn to develop routes as a consequence of feedback loops that change their probabilities of moving between flowers. While a positive reinforcement of movements leading to rewarding flowers is sufficient for the emergence of resource partitioning when flowers are evenly distributed, the addition of a negative reinforcement of movements leading to unrewarding flowers is necessary when flowers are patchily distributed. In environments with more complex spatial structures, the negative experiences of individual bees on flowers favour spatial segregation and efficient collective foraging. Our study fills a major gap in modelling pollinator behaviour and constitutes a unique tool to guide future experimental programs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Noise suppression in stochastic genetic circuits using PID controllers</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Saurabh Modi, Supravat Dey, Abhyudai Singh</p>

Inside individual cells, protein population counts are subject to molecular noise due to low copy numbers and the inherent probabilistic nature of biochemical processes. We investigate the effectiveness of proportional, integral and derivative (PID) based feedback controllers to suppress protein count fluctuations originating from two noise sources: bursty expression of the protein, and external disturbance in protein synthesis. Designs of biochemical reactions that function as PID controllers are discussed, with particular focus on individual controllers separately, and the corresponding closed-loop system is analyzed for stochastic controller realizations. Our results show that proportional controllers are effective in buffering protein copy number fluctuations from both noise sources, but this noise suppression comes at the cost of reduced static sensitivity of the output to the input signal. In contrast, integral feedback has no effect on the protein noise level from stochastic expression, but significantly minimizes the impact of external disturbances, particularly when the disturbance comes at low frequencies. Counter-intuitively, integral feedback is found to amplify external disturbances at intermediate frequencies. Next, we discuss the design of a coupled feedforward-feedback biochemical circuit that approximately functions as a derivate controller. Analysis using both analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations reveals that this derivative controller effectively buffers output fluctuations from bursty stochastic expression, while maintaining the static input-output sensitivity of the open-loop system. In summary, this study provides a systematic stochastic analysis of biochemical controllers, and paves the way for their synthetic design and implementation to minimize deleterious fluctuations in gene product levels.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Beyond the chemical master equation: Stochastic chemical kinetics coupled with auxiliary processes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Davin Lunz, Gregory Batt, Jakob Ruess, J. Frédéric Bonnans</p>

The chemical master equation and its continuum approximations are indispensable tools in the modeling of chemical reaction networks. These are routinely used to capture complex nonlinear phenomena such as multimodality as well as transient events such as first-passage times, that accurately characterise a plethora of biological and chemical processes. However, some mechanisms, such as heterogeneous cellular growth or phenotypic selection at the population level, cannot be represented by the master equation and thus have been tackled separately. In this work, we propose a unifying framework that augments the chemical master equation to capture such auxiliary dynamics, and we develop and analyse a numerical solver that accurately simulates the system dynamics. We showcase these contributions by casting a diverse array of examples from the literature within this framework and applying the solver to both match and extend previous studies. Analytical calculations performed for each example validate our numerical results and benchmark the solver implementation.

                <p>by Jonathan W. Cody, Amy L. Ellis-Connell, Shelby L. O’Connor, Elsje Pienaar</p>

Immunomodulatory drugs could contribute to a functional cure for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Interleukin-15 (IL-15) promotes expansion and activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell and natural killer (NK) cell populations. In one study, an IL-15 superagonist, N-803, suppressed Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) in non-human primates (NHPs) who had received prior SIV vaccination. However, viral suppression attenuated with continued N-803 treatment, partially returning after long treatment interruption. While there is evidence of concurrent drug tolerance, immune regulation, and viral escape, the relative contributions of these mechanisms to the observed viral dynamics have not been quantified. Here, we utilize mathematical models of N-803 treatment in SIV-infected macaques to estimate contributions of these three key mechanisms to treatment outcomes: 1) drug tolerance, 2) immune regulation, and 3) viral escape. We calibrated our model to viral and lymphocyte responses from the above-mentioned NHP study. Our models track CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell and NK cell populations with N-803-dependent proliferation and activation, as well as viral dynamics in response to these immune cell populations. We compared mathematical models with different combinations of the three key mechanisms based on Akaike Information Criterion and important qualitative features of the NHP data. Two minimal models were capable of reproducing the observed SIV response to N-803. In both models, immune regulation strongly reduced cytotoxic cell activation to enable viral rebound. Either long-term drug tolerance or viral escape (or some combination thereof) could account for changes to viral dynamics across long breaks in N-803 treatment. Theoretical explorations with the models showed that less-frequent N-803 dosing and concurrent immune regulation blockade (e.g. PD-L1 inhibition) may improve N-803 efficacy. However, N-803 may need to be combined with other immune therapies to countermand viral escape from the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response. Our mechanistic model will inform such therapy design and guide future studies.

The risk of tuberculosis (TB) disease is higher in individuals with recent <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>M.tb</i>) infection compared to individuals with more remote, established infection. We aimed to define blood-based biomarkers to distinguish between recent and remote infection, which would allow targeting of recently infected individuals for preventive TB treatment. We hypothesized that integration of multiple immune measurements would outperform the diagnostic performance of a single biomarker. Analysis was performed on different components of the immune system, including adaptive and innate responses to mycobacteria, measured on recently and remotely <i>M.tb</i> infected adolescents. The datasets were standardized using variance stabilizing scaling and missing values were imputed using a multiple factor analysis-based approach. For data integration, we compared the performance of a Multiple Tuning Parameter Elastic Net (MTP-EN) to a standard EN model, which was built to the individual adaptive and innate datasets. Biomarkers with non-zero coefficients from the optimal single data EN models were then isolated to build logistic regression models. A decision tree and random forest model were used for statistical confirmation. We found no difference in the predictive performances of the optimal MTP-EN model and the EN model [average area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) = 0.93]. EN models built to the integrated dataset and the adaptive dataset yielded identically high AUROC values (average AUROC = 0.91), while the innate data EN model performed poorly (average AUROC = 0.62). Results also indicated that integration of adaptive and innate biomarkers did not outperform the adaptive biomarkers alone (Likelihood Ratio Test <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> = 6.09, p = 0.808). From a total of 193 variables, the level of HLA-DR on ESAT6/CFP10-specific Th1 cytokine-expressing CD4 cells was the strongest biomarker for recent <i>M.tb</i> infection. The discriminatory ability of this variable was confirmed in both tree-based models.
A single biomarker measuring <i>M.tb</i>-specific T cell activation yielded excellent diagnostic potential to distinguish between recent and remote <i>M.tb</i> infection.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the visual world of a velvet worm</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mikael Ljungholm, Dan-E. Nilsson</p>

In many animal phyla, eyes are small and provide only low-resolution vision for general orientation in the environment. Because these primitive eyes rarely have a defined image plane, traditional visual-optics principles cannot be applied. To assess the functional capacity of such eyes we have developed modelling principles based on ray tracing in 3D reconstructions of eye morphology, where refraction on the way to the photoreceptors and absorption in the photopigment are calculated incrementally for ray bundles from all angles within the visual field. From the ray tracing, we calculate the complete angular acceptance function of each photoreceptor in the eye, revealing the visual acuity for all parts of the visual field. We then use this information to generate visual filters that can be applied to high resolution images or videos to convert them to accurate representations of the spatial information seen by the animal. The method is here applied to the 0.1 mm eyes of the velvet worm <i>Euperipatoides rowelli</i> (Onychophora). These eyes of these terrestrial invertebrates consist of a curved cornea covering an irregular but optically homogeneous lens directly joining a retina packed with photoreceptive rhabdoms. 3D reconstruction from histological sections revealed an asymmetric eye, where the retina is deeper in the forward-pointing direction. The calculated visual acuity also reveals performance differences across the visual field, with a maximum acuity of about 0.11 cycles/deg in the forward direction despite laterally pointing eyes. The results agree with previous behavioural measurements of visual acuity, and suggest that velvet worm vision is adequate for orientation and positioning within the habitat.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evolution to alternative levels of stable diversity leaves areas of niche space unexplored</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ilan N. Rubin, Iaroslav Ispolatov, Michael Doebeli</p>

One of the oldest and most persistent questions in ecology and evolution is whether natural communities tend to evolve toward saturation and maximal diversity. Robert MacArthur’s classical theory of niche packing and the theory of adaptive radiations both imply that populations will diversify and fully partition any available niche space. However, the saturation of natural populations is still very much an open area of debate and investigation. Additionally, recent evolutionary theory suggests the existence of alternative evolutionary stable states (ESSs), which implies that some stable communities may not be fully saturated. Using models with classical Lotka-Volterra ecological dynamics and three formulations of evolutionary dynamics (a model using adaptive dynamics, an individual-based model, and a partial differential equation model), we show that following an adaptive radiation, communities can often get stuck in low diversity states when limited by mutations of small phenotypic effect. These low diversity metastable states can also be maintained by limited resources and finite population sizes. When small mutations and finite populations are considered together, it is clear that despite the presence of higher-diversity stable states, natural populations are likely not fully saturating their environment and leaving potential niche space unfilled. Additionally, within-species variation can further reduce community diversity from levels predicted by models that assume species-level homogeneity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Targeting Mycobacterium tuberculosis response to environmental cues for the development of effective antitubercular drugs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Richard C. Lavin, Calvin Johnson, Yong-Mo Ahn, Kyle M. Kremiller, Matthew Sherwood, Jimmy S. Patel, Yan Pan, Riccardo Russo, Nathan J. MacGilvary, David Giacalone, Yuzo L. Kevorkian, Matthew D. Zimmerman, J. Fraser Glickman, Joel S. Freundlich, Shumin Tan</p>

Sensing and response to environmental cues, such as pH and chloride (Cl<sup>−</sup>), is critical in enabling <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) colonization of its host. Utilizing a fluorescent reporter Mtb strain in a chemical screen, we have identified compounds that dysregulate Mtb response to high Cl<sup>−</sup> levels, with a subset of the hits also inhibiting Mtb growth in host macrophages. Structure–activity relationship studies on the hit compound “C6,” or 2-(4-((2-(ethylthio)pyrimidin-5-yl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)benzo[d]oxazole, demonstrated a correlation between compound perturbation of Mtb Cl<sup>−</sup> response and inhibition of bacterial growth in macrophages. C6 accumulated in both bacterial and host cells, and inhibited Mtb growth in cholesterol media, but not in rich media. Subsequent examination of the Cl<sup>−</sup> response of Mtb revealed an intriguing link with bacterial growth in cholesterol, with increased transcription of several Cl<sup>−</sup>-responsive genes in the simultaneous presence of cholesterol and high external Cl<sup>−</sup> concentration, versus transcript levels observed during exposure to high external Cl<sup>−</sup> concentration alone. Strikingly, oral administration of C6 was able to inhibit Mtb growth in vivo in a C3HeB/FeJ murine infection model. Our work illustrates how Mtb response to environmental cues can intersect with its metabolism and be exploited in antitubercular drug discovery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mechanics of the Peripheral Auditory System: Foundations for Embodied Listening Using Dynamic Systems Theory and the Coupling Devices as a Metaphor [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Current approaches to listening are built on standard cognitive science, which considers the brain as the locus of all cognitive activity. This work aims to investigate listening as phenomena occurring within a brain, a body (embodiment), and an environment (situatedness). Drawing on insights from physiology, acoustics, and audiology, this essay presents listening as an interdependent brain-body-environment construct grounded in dynamic systems theory. Coupling, self-organization, and attractors are the central characteristics of dynamic systems. This article reviews the first of these aspects in order to develop a fuller understanding of how embodied auditory perception occurs. It introduces the mind-body problem before reviewing dynamic systems theory and exploring the notion of coupling in human hearing by way of current and original analogies drawn from engineering. It posits that the current use of the Watt governor device as an analogy for coupling is too simplistic to account for the coupling phenomena in the human ear. In light of this review of the physiological characteristics of the peripheral auditory system, coupling in hearing appears more variegated than originally thought and accounts for the diversity of perception among individuals, a cause for individual variance in how the mind emerges, which in turn affects academic performance. Understanding the constraints and affordances of the physical ear with regard to incoming sound supports the embodied listening paradigm.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Accumulated evidence points toward a long-axis functional division of the hippocampus, with its anterior part primarily associated with emotional processes and the posterior with navigation and cognition. It is yet unclear, however, how functional connectivity between areas along the hippocampal longitudinal axis and other brain regions differ, and how they are affected by age. Applying an anatomically driven general linear model-based functional connectivity analysis on a large database of resting-state fMRI data, we demonstrate that independent of age, the posterior hippocampus is functionally connected primarily with sensory and motor areas, the middle hippocampus with the default mode network, and the anterior with limbic and prefrontal regions. Along with an age-related disintegration of intra-hippocampal BOLD signal uniformity, the middle and posterior sub-regions exhibit mostly decreases in their functional connectivity with cortical regions, whereas the anterior hippocampus and ventral striatum appear to become more synchronized with age. These findings indicate that long-axis hippocampal areas are tuned to particular functional networks, which do not age in a unified manner.</p>

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/113bb147-3963-4f63-baf2-8c67b7ec7fd6/cne25210-toc-0001-m.png"
     alt="Morphological properties of the axon initial segment-like process of AII amacrine cells in the rat retina"/>
<p>AII amacrine cells in the mammalian retina display an axon initial segment (AIS)-like process that expresses voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels and generates spikes. Immunolabeling for the cytoskeletal linker protein ankyrin-G enables detection of the AIS-like processes in wholemounts and analysis of its distribution and spatial orientation. The AIS-like processes display no preferred orientation in the horizontal plane and randomly ascend or descend from the site of origin in the vertical plane of the retina, suggesting that this unique process is unlikely to take part in conventional synaptic connections. Instead, it may be adapted to respond to volume transmission by means of extrasynaptic receptors.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Signal processing within the retina is generally mediated by graded potentials, whereas output is conveyed by action potentials transmitted along optic nerve axons. Among retinal neurons, amacrine cells seem to be an exception to this general rule, as several types generate voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> (Na<sub>v</sub>) channel-dependent action potentials. The AII, a narrow-field, bistratified axon-less amacrine cell found in mammalian retinas, displays a unique process that resembles an axon initial segment (AIS), with expression of Na<sub>v</sub> channels colocalized with the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin-G, and generates action potentials. As the role of spiking in AIIs is uncertain, we hypothesized that the morphological properties of the AIS-like process could provide information relevant for its functional importance, including potential pre- and/or postsynaptic connectivity. For morphological analysis, we injected AII amacrine cells in slices with fluorescent dye and immunolabeled the slices for ankyrin-G. Subsequently, this enabled us to reliably identify AII-type processes among ankyrin-G-labeled processes in wholemount retina. We systematically analyzed the laminar localization, spatial orientation, and distribution of the AIS-like processes as a function of retinal eccentricity. In the horizontal plane, the processes displayed no preferred orientation and terminal endings were randomly distributed. In the vertical plane, the processes displayed a horizontal preference, but also ascended and descended into the inner nuclear layer and proximal inner plexiform layer, respectively. These results suggest that the AII amacrine AIS-like process is unlikely to take part in conventional synaptic connections, but may instead be adapted to respond to volume neurotransmission by means of extrasynaptic receptors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Cerebral venous thrombosis revealing celiac disease [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy resulting from intolerance of an individual genetically predisposed to gluten. It has a large clinical polymorphism ranging from a classic digestive clinical presentation due to the malabsorption syndrome to extra-intestinal symptoms. Among the hematologic abnormalities, venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) has been reported, and they are most often located in the abdomen or lower limbs, but the cerebral localization was exceptionally described. We report a case of CD revealed by cerebral thrombophlebitis. A 44-year-old patient with no medical history and no drug intake, presented with hemiplegia followed by a status epilepticus in a context of apyrexia, initially hospitalized in intensive care. Magnetic imaging resonance displayed a cerebral venous thrombosis of the sigmoid sinus requiring anticoagulant treatment, then transferred to our department for the etiological investigation. On questioning, the patient reported chronic diarrhea and weight loss with no other associated symptoms. The examination revealed an underweight patient with pale conjunctiva, improvement of her deficit symptoms, and no other abnormalities. Laboratory tests noted biological signs of malabsorption. The thrombophilia assessment revealed a protein C deficiency with a slight increase in anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-Beta 2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies. Immunological tests noted positives anti-transglutaminase and IgA anti-endomysium antibodies. Duodenal biopsy demonstrated villous atrophy. After ruling out the other causes of VTE, the diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis secondary to CD was retained. Early diagnosis and treatment of CD improves the quality-of-life for patients and may spare them various long-term or even fatal complications.

                Background: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and delirium are common in advanced phases of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Methods: Thirty-eight moderate-severe AD patients were enrolled (n=16 affected by type 2 diabetes). Each patient received a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) (including evaluation of BPSD and frailty), and a complete metabolic evaluation (including the measurement of the glycated hemoglobin, HbA1c). Results: Both the hyper- and hypo-glycemic extremes of the glycemic spectrum worsened BPSD, but delirium was more susceptible to hypoglycemic events. The severity of delirium was significantly related to cognitive function (r = -0.585, p<0.001) and frailty (r = +0.440, p<0.05). Conclusions: The measurement of HbA1c was useful for evaluating the risk of delirium in relationship to glycemic control and nutritional status.

                This dataset is an accumulation of data collected to test Rwandan physics students’ conceptual understanding of light phenomena and to assess instructional tools for active learning of optics. We collected and analysed data from 251 grade 11 (senior 5) students using our Light Phenomena Conceptual Assessment (LPCA) tool and from 136 grade 10 (senior 4) students using Geometric Optics Conceptual Understanding Test (GOCUT) in 2019. Before collecting data, we designed and validated LPCA and GOCUT, and tested their reliability. Data were collected before and after students learnt about the unit of light. Both day and boarding schools in rural and urban areas were included in our sampling. Data collected were test scores from students after performing a 30-item LPCA test or 25-item GOCUT test in 40 minutes. The data may be reused to extend  students' understanding of optics concepts through item analysis, analysis of school characteristics such as location and school type, or by analysing students' characteristics such as subject combinations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Correlation between CD44+ cancer stem cell expression and histopathological types of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) recurrency rate is still high despite patients receiving complete treatment. The response to treatment may vary depending on the type of histopathology and Epstein-Barr virus, however the mechanism remains unclear. Recent studies have found that there is a relationship between response to treatment and the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). CD44+ cancer stem cells may cause cancer cells to be resistant to treatment. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aims to determine the correlation between CD44 + cancer stem cell expression and the histopathological types of NPC. Method: Samples were obtained from NPC biopsies of type I, II, III patients (based on WHO histopathology criteria), who had not received prior treatment. CD44+ expression was examined using immunohistochemistry methods by staining CD44+ monoclonal antibodies. The degree of CD44+ cell membrane expression was based on the immunoreactive score scale or the Remmele index scale. Results: Most histopathological types were WHO type III (21 patients, 50%), followed by type II (18 patients, 42.86%), and type I (3 patients, 7.14%). CD44 + expression on type I showed one patient had moderate positive and two patients had a high-positive expression. In type II, 10 were moderate positive and eight were high-positive. In type III, one patient was low-positive, 11 were moderate positive and nine patients were high-positive. Statistical analysis showed that the CD44+ expression difference between the three histopathology types were not statistically significant. Conclusion: There were no correlations between CD44 + expression and histopathological type of NPC.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Conceptualizing an inquiry-based lingua-cultural learning through telecollaborative exchanges [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, telecollaboration has been gaining popularity among scholars, teachers, and students engaged in foreign language education because it facilitates the use of Internet-mediated communication tools to connect language and culture learners in geographically distant locations. Telecollaboration, as currently viewed in academic and classroom settings, places greater emphasis on the development of learners’ intercultural communicative competence. The problem with this approach is that this process may not consider the possibility that learners engaged in online intercultural exchanges could have limited or no knowledge about certain aspects of their own lingua-culture. We argue that, for learners to effectively share lingua-cultural knowledge with their online peers abroad, there must be a framework that supports the construction of learners’ own intra-cultural knowledge to provide a solid foundation for intercultural learning and communication. In this paper, we develop an inquiry-based model of telecollaboration incorporating both inquiry and online exchange based on the inquiry cycle, which includes engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration, and evaluation. This paper builds a case for the application of inquiry-based telecollaboration in a real classroom environment, which could not only help learners obtain and eventually share more authentic, deeper knowledge about their lingua-culture, but also promote informed intercultural exchange.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Functional and non-functional types of adrenal tumors: a case series [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Adrenal gland masses could be classified into functional, malignant, or benign. An adrenal cortical adenoma is one of the most common incidentalomas found with either functional or non-functional type. Pheochromocytoma is a neural crest cell origin tumor associated with catecholamine production. A classic triad of headache, sudden episodic perspiration, and tachycardia marked a pheochromocytoma. We report three patients with adrenal tumors. First, a 52-year-old woman with complaints of pain in the left flank suggests a left kidney tumor. The patient has an increased blood pressure intraoperatively. Adrenal cortical adenoma was found postoperatively. The second case is an Indonesian male 27-year-old with pain in the upper right abdomen. Intraoperative, the patient also has an escalation in blood pressure. Antihypertensive drugs are also used in this patient. Postoperatively, a pathology result of pheochromocytoma was revealed from this patient. The third case, adrenal myelolipoma, was suspected in a 48-year-old male and underwent surgery because of tumor growth. Later, a histopathological examination revealed myelolipoma of the adrenal. Management of adrenal tumor should be done individually based on each patient. In the first and second cases, blood pressure was unstable intraoperatively and was managed using several drugs, and was stable at follow-up. In the third case was no hemodynamic problem. In the case of an adrenal tumor, management tailoring should be based on the individual patient.

                Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a great burden on governments and the medical fraternity globally. Many clinical studies from the Indian system of Traditional Medicines [Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH)] have been carried out to find appropriate solutions. Through a living systematic review and meta-analysis, this study aims to determine the effectiveness of the Traditional System of Indian Medicine (AYUSH system) in lowering the incidence, duration, and severity of COVID-19. Methods: We will search the following databases: Pubmed; the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (CENTRAL); the Clinical Trials Registry - India (CTRI); Digital Helpline for Ayurveda Research Articles (DHARA): AYUSH research portal; and World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database. Clinical improvement, WHO ordinal scale, viral clearance, incidences of COVID-19 infection, and mortality will be considered as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes will be use of O2 therapy or mechanical ventilator, admission to high dependency unit or emergency unit, duration of hospitalization, the time to symptom resolution, and adverse events. Two authors will independently search the articles, extract the data and disagreements will be resolved by the involvement of a third reviewer. Data will be synthesized, and the risk of bias will be assessed with RevMan 5.4 tool. Certainty of evidence will be assessed through the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) tool. The review will be updated bi-monthly with two updates. Conclusion: This living systematic review will be the first to address AYUSH interventions in COVID-19, synthesizing the full spectrum of Indian Traditional System of Medicine against COVID-19. It will facilitate professionals, guideline developers, and authorities with up to date synthesis on interventions periodically to make health-care decisions on AYUSH therapies in the management of COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Metronomic oral vinorelbine doublet chemotherapy with carboplatin in treatment of advanced lung cancer: a feasibility and safety study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is globally one of the most common forms of cancer. Palliative treatment is a delicate balance against toxicity and survival. Using small frequent doses of chemotherapy, metronomic regimens have been hypothesized to maintain or even improve efficacy while achieving a lower treatment-related toxicity. The mechanism is thought to result from a more continuous exposure of the tumour cells to the drugs. Treating NSCLC, this study addresses the feasibility and tolerability of carboplatin in combination with 12 weeks of daily metronomic vinorelbine. Method: Patients were included over a period of ten months. All patients had biopsy-verified incurable NSCLC and were candidates for first line chemotherapy (PD-L1<50% and no targetable mutations). This open label, non-randomized prospective safety and feasibility study was investigator initiated. Patients received up-to four cycles of standard dose carboplatin AUC 5 every third week in combination with 12 weeks of metronomic oral daily Navelbine® (20/30 mg). Patients were evaluated by CT scans after end of treatment and then every 8 weeks (+/- 1 week) until progression. Results: A total of 20 patients were included. Male/female-ratio was 4/16. Age ranged from 49-83 with a median of 70.5 years. Majority had adenocarcinoma (95%). Two patients withdrew their consent within a week. 18 patients were included in safety analysis. 13 received all four cycles. Grade 1/2 toxicity was frequently seen and included fatigue 13 (72%), diarrhoea 13 (72%), constipation/congestion 13 (72%). Grade 3 toxicities were dyspnoea 2 (11%), nausea 3 (17%) and fatigue 3 (17%). Two (11%) had grade 4 toxicity with neutropenic fever, both recovered. No grade 5 toxicity was detected. Conclusion: In treatment of NSCLC this study is the first addressing the regimen of carboplatin in combination with daily metronomic vinorelbine. We conclude that doublet chemotherapy with daily vinorelbine is safe and feasible.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The indigenous meaning of dysmenorrhea: using modified photovoice to document perspectives of traditional health practitioners (THPs) and indigenous knowledge holders (IKHs) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Globally, health understanding and beliefs vary across sub-cultural groups, depending on geographical location. Increasingly, various parts of the world recognize these perspectives to offer culturally sensitive healthcare services at primary level. Understanding the indigenous perspectives of dysmenorrhea meaning from the custodians of knowledge holders may add to the value of literature that may be used to advocate humanized culturally sensitive healthcare. This article aimed to explore and describe the perspectives regarding the meaning of indigenous dysmenorrhea among Batlokwa traditional health practitioners (THPs) and indigenous knowledge holders (IKHs). Methods: A qualitative, explorative study with a modified photovoice design, which included photographs, interviews and lekgotla discussion was employed to engage THPs and IKHs residing in Botlokwa Limpopo province, South Africa. Initially, a purposive sampling technique was used to select the participants, followed by snowball sampling. The participants themselves analyzed the photographs and described their meaning during individual interview using the acronym “PHOTO”. The researchers employed thematic analysis of interviews and Lekgotla discussion, in which themes were identified, formulated and analyzed from the codified data set. Results: In total, eight women participated in the photovoice study. The findings showed that indigenous understanding of dysmenorrhea stems from the African belief about health and illness with special emphasis on importance of holistic meaning. To the THPs and IKHs dysmenorrhea was a broad and integrated trend of a normal or abnormal process of illness that occurs periodically during menstruation. Conclusions: The THP’s and IKH’s indigenous meaning of dysmenorrhea reflects physical, mental, emotional, social, environmental, political and economic dimensions. Therefore, dysmenorrhea should be understood from a holistic approach. With appropriate partnerships and processes in place, this knowledge may be well represented in dominant healthcare systems and health research.

                Background: Myanmar has the third highest number of people living with HIV in Southeast Asia behind Indonesia and Thailand. The independent predictors of comprehensive HIV knowledge among general population are not known. Methods: In this nationally representative study, we adopted a cross-sectional design using secondary data from the Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey (2015-16). We included all women and men aged 15-49 years who participated in the survey. We have provided weighted estimates as the analyses were weighted for the multi-stage sampling design. We used modified Poisson regression with robust variance estimates model to identify independent predictors of comprehensive knowledge. Results: Of 17,622 analyzed, 3,599 (20.4%, 95% CI: 19.7, 21.1) had comprehensive knowledge of HIV. Late adolescents, those with less than a high school education, those involved in agriculture and the poorest two quintiles were less likely to have comprehensive knowledge of HIV. Conclusion: In Myanmar, comprehensive knowledge of HIV among the general population needs to be improved and we identified certain independent predictors that could be specifically targeted by the national programme.

                Nucleic acid nanodevices present great potential as agents for logic-based therapeutic intervention as well as in basic biology. Often, however, the disease targets that need corrective action are localized in specific organs and thus realizing the full potential of DNA nanodevices also requires ways to target them to specific cell-types <i>in vivo</i>. Here we show that by exploiting either endogenous or synthetic receptor-ligand interactions and by leveraging the biological barriers presented by the organism, we can target extraneously introduced DNA nanodevices to specific cell types in <i>C. elegans</i>, with sub-cellular precision. The amenability of DNA nanostructures to tissue-specific targeting <i>in vivo</i> significantly expands their utility in biomedical applications and discovery biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcriptomic encoding of sensorimotor transformation in the midbrain</a></h4>

              
                Sensorimotor transformation, a process that converts sensory stimuli into motor actions, is critical for the brain to initiate behaviors. Although the circuitry involved in sensorimotor transformation has been well delineated, the molecular logic behind this process remains poorly understood. Here, we performed high-throughput and circuit-specific single-cell transcriptomic analyses of neurons in the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure implicated in early sensorimotor transformation. We found that SC neurons in distinct laminae express discrete marker genes. Of particular interest, <i>Cbln2</i> and <i>Pitx2</i> are key markers that define glutamatergic projection neurons in the optic nerve (Op) and intermediate gray (InG) layers, respectively. The Cbln2+ neurons responded to visual stimuli mimicking cruising predators, while the Pitx2+ neurons encoded prey-derived vibrissal tactile cues. By forming distinct input and output connections with other brain areas, these neuronal subtypes independently mediate behaviors of predator avoidance and prey capture. Our results reveal that, in the midbrain, sensorimotor transformation for different behaviors may be performed by separate circuit modules that are molecularly defined by distinct transcriptomic codes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Processing of the ribosomal ubiquitin-like fusion protein FUBI-eS30/FAU is required for 40S maturation and depends on USP36</a></h4>

              
                In humans and other holozoan organisms, the ribosomal protein eS30 is synthesized as a fusion protein with the ubiquitin-like protein FUBI. However, FUBI is not part of the mature 40S ribosomal subunit and cleaved off by an as-of-yet unidentified protease. How FUBI-eS30 processing is coordinated with 40S subunit maturation is unknown. To study the mechanism and importance of FUBI-eS30 processing, we expressed non-cleavable mutants in human cells, which affected late steps of cytoplasmic 40S maturation, including the maturation of 18S rRNA and recycling of late-acting ribosome biogenesis factors. Differential affinity purification of wild-type and non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants identified the deubiquitinase USP36 as a candidate FUBI-eS30 processing enzyme. Depletion of USP36 by RNAi or CRISPRi indeed impaired FUBI-eS30 processing and moreover, purified USP36 cut FUBI-eS30 <i>in vitro</i>. Together, these data demonstrate the functional importance of FUBI-eS30 cleavage and identify USP36 as a novel protease involved in this process.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High potency of sequential therapy with only beta-lactam antibiotics</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary adaptation is a major source of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens. Evolution-informed therapy aims to constrain resistance by accounting for bacterial evolvability. Sequential treatments with antibiotics that target different bacterial processes were previously shown to limit adaptation through genetic resistance trade-offs and negative hysteresis. Treatment with homogeneous sets of antibiotics is generally viewed to be disadvantageous, as it should rapidly lead to cross-resistance. We here challenged this assumption by determining the evolutionary response of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> to experimental sequential treatments involving both heterogenous and homogeneous antibiotic sets. To our surprise, we found that fast switching between only β-lactam antibiotics resulted in increased extinction of bacterial populations. We demonstrate that extinction is favored by low rates of spontaneous resistance emergence and low levels of spontaneous cross-resistance among the antibiotics in sequence. The uncovered principles may help to guide the optimized use of available antibiotics in highly potent, evolution-informed treatment designs.

Here, we demonstrate that genetic regulation of structural components of the axial skeleton, the intervertebral discs, and dense connective tissues (i.e., ligaments and tendons) are essential for the maintenance of spinal alignment. We show that the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor ADGRG6, previously implicated in human AIS association studies, is required in these tissues to maintain typical spine alignment in mice. Furthermore, we show that ADGRG6 regulates biomechanical properties of tendon and stimulates CREB signaling governing gene expression in cartilaginous tissues of the spine. Treatment with a cAMP agonist could mirror aspects of receptor function in culture, thus defining core pathways for regulating these axial cartilaginous and connective tissues. As <i>ADGRG6 </i>is a key gene involved in human AIS, these findings open up novel therapeutic opportunities for human scoliosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell analysis of mosquito hemocytes identifies signatures of immune cell sub-types and cell differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Mosquito immune cells, known as hemocytes, are integral to cellular and humoral responses that limit pathogen survival and mediate immune priming. However, without reliable cell markers and genetic tools, studies of mosquito immune cells have been limited to morphological observations, leaving several aspects of their biology uncharacterized. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize mosquito immune cells, demonstrating an increased complexity to previously defined prohemocyte, oenocytoid, and granulocyte subtypes. Through functional assays relying on phagocytosis, phagocyte depletion, and RNA-FISH experiments, we define markers to accurately distinguish immune cell subtypes and provide evidence for immune cell maturation and differentiation. In addition, gene-silencing experiments demonstrate the importance of lozenge in defining the mosquito oenocytoid cell fate. Together, our scRNA-seq analysis provides an important foundation for future studies of mosquito immune cell biology and a valuable resource for comparative invertebrate immunology.

                Tumor metastasis remains the main cause of breast cancer-related deaths, especially delayed breast cancer distant metastasis. The current study assessed the frequency of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> breast cancer cells in 576 tissue specimens for associations with clinicopathological features and metastasis and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. The results indicated that higher frequency (≥19.5%) of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells was associated with delayed postoperative breast cancer metastasis. Furthermore, CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells spontaneously converted into CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cancer stem cells (CSCs) with properties similar to CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> CSCs from primary human breast cancer cells and parental TNBC cells in terms of stemness marker expression, self-renewal, differentiation, tumorigenicity and lung metastasis<i> in vitro</i> and <i>in NOD/SCID mice</i>. RNA sequencing identified several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in newly converted CSCs and <i>RHBDL2</i>, one of the DEGs, expression was up-regulated. More importantly, <i>RHBDL2</i> silencing inhibited the YAP1/USP31/NF-κB signaling and attenuated spontaneous CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cell conversion into CSCs and their mammosphere formation. These findings suggest that the frequency of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> tumor cells and <i>RHBDL2</i> may be valuable for prognosis of delayed breast cancer metastasis, particularly for TNBC.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural basis of the effect of activating mutations on the EGF receptor</a></h4>

              
                Mutations within the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are common oncogenic driver events in non-small cell lung cancer. Although the activation of EGFR in normal cells is primarily driven by growth-factor-binding-induced dimerization, mutations on different exons of the kinase domain of the receptor have been found to affect the equilibrium between its active and inactive conformations giving rise to growth-factor-independent kinase activation. Using molecular dynamics simulations combined with enhanced sampling techniques, we compare here the conformational landscape of the monomers and homodimers of the wild-type and mutated forms of EGFR ΔELREA and L858R, as well as of two exon 20 insertions, D770-N771insNPG, and A763-Y764insFQEA. The differences in the conformational energy landscapes are consistent with multiple mechanisms of action including the regulation of the hinge motion, the stabilization of the dimeric interface, and local unfolding transitions. Overall, a combination of different effects is caused by the mutations and leads to the observed aberrant signaling.

                Exposure to environmental factors during fetal development may lead to epigenomic modifications in fetal germ cells, altering gene expression and promoting diseases in successive generations. In mouse, maternal exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is known to induce defects in spermatogenesis in successive generations, but the mechanism(s) of impaired spermatogenesis are unclear. Here, we showed that maternal DEHP exposure results in DNA hypermethylation of promoters of spermatogenesis-related genes in fetal testicular germ cells in F1 mice, and hypermethylation of <i>Hist1h2ba</i>, <i>Sycp1,</i> and <i>Taf7l</i>, which are crucial for spermatogenesis, persisted from fetal testicular cells to adult spermatogonia, resulting in the downregulation of expression of these genes. Forced methylation of these gene promoters silenced expression of these loci in a reporter assay. These results suggested that maternal DEHP exposure-induced hypermethylation of <i>Hist1h2ba</i>, <i>Sycp1,</i> and <i>Taf7l</i> results in downregulation of these genes in spermatogonia and subsequent defects in spermatogenesis, at least in the F1 generation.

                ASIC1a is a proton-gated sodium channel involved in modulation of pain, fear, addiction, and ischemia-induced neuronal injury. We report isolation and characterization of alpaca-derived nanobodies (Nbs) that specifically target human ASIC1a. Cryo-electron microscopy of the human ASIC1a channel at pH 7.4 in complex with one of these, Nb.C1, yielded a structure at 2.9 Å resolution. It is revealed that Nb.C1 binds to a site overlapping with that of the Texas coral snake toxin (MitTx1) and the black mamba venom Mambalgin-1; however, the Nb.C1-binding site does not overlap with that of the inhibitory tarantula toxin psalmotoxin-1 (PcTx1). Fusion of Nb.C1 with PcTx1 in a single polypeptide markedly enhances the potency of PcTx1, whereas competition of Nb.C1 and MitTx1 for binding reduces channel activation by the toxin. Thus, Nb.C1 is a molecular tool for biochemical and structural studies of hASIC1a; a potential antidote to the pain-inducing component of coral snake bite; and a candidate to potentiate PcTx1-mediated inhibition of hASIC1a in vivo for therapeutic applications.

                How does blindness affect the brain network supporting spatial hearing? We used a combined functional and diffusion MRI approach to study the impact of early blindness on the brain networks typically coding for audio-visual motion and location. Whole-brain functional univariate analysis revealed preferential response to auditory motion in a dorsal network including the planum temporale (hPT) as well as the anterior portion of the middle temporal cortex (hMT+/V5) in both sighted and congenitally blind participants (male and female). Blind participants showed additional preferential response to auditory motion in the posterior region of hMT+/V5. Importantly, multivariate decoding analysis revealed the presence of motion direction information that was higher in hMT+/V5 and lower in hPT of blind relative to sighted people. Decoding sound source location showed a similar pattern of results even if the decoding accuracies were in general lower than those obtained from motion directions. Diffusion MRI revealed that the macrostructure (trajectory and connectivity index) of hMT+/V5 -- hPT connectivity did not differ between groups, while the microstructure of the connections was altered in blind people. These results suggest that early visual deprivation triggers a network-level reorganization that enhances the recruitment of occipital areas in conjunction with a release in the computational workload of temporal regions typically dedicated to spatial hearing. This functional reorganization is accompanied by white-matter microstructural alterations in related occipital-temporal connections.

                We and others have shown that during odor plume navigation, walking Drosophila melanogaster bias their motion upwind in response to both the frequency of their encounters with the odor (Demir et al., 2020), and the intermittency of the odor signal, i.e. the fraction of time the signal is above a detection threshold (Alvarez-Salvado et al., 2018). Here we combine and simplify previous mathematical models that recapitulated these data to investigate the benefits of sensing both of these temporal features, and how these benefits depend on the spatiotemporal statistics of the odor plume. Through agent-based simulations, we find that navigators that only use frequency or intermittency perform well in some environments - achieving maximal performance when gains are near those inferred from experiment - but fail in others. Robust performance across diverse environments requires both temporal modalities. However, we also find a steep tradeoff when using both sensors simultaneously, suggesting a strong benefit to modulating how much each sensor is weighted, rather than using both in a fixed combination across plumes.

                Advances in sequencing techniques have made comparative studies of gene expression a current focus for understanding evolutionary and developmental processes. However, insights into the spatial expression of genes have been limited by a lack of robust methodology. We therefore developed a set of algorithms for quantifying and comparing tissue-wide spatial patterns of gene expression within and across species. Here we apply these algorithms to compare cortex-wide expression of Id2 and RZR{beta} mRNA in early postnatal mice and voles. We show that neocortical patterns of Id2 expression are moderately conserved between species, but that the degree of conservation varies by cortical layer and area. By comparison, patterns of RZR{beta} expression are highly conserved in somatosensory areas, and more variable between species in visual and auditory areas. We consider if these differences reflect independent evolution in the 35 million years since the last common ancestor.

                Recent evidence has uncovered an important role of Rab7 in regulating mitochondrial morphology and function. Missense mutation(s) of Rab7 underlies the pathogenesis of Charcot Marie Tooth 2B (CMT2B) peripheral neuropathy. Herein, we investigated how mitochondrial morphology and function were impacted by the CMT2B associated Rab7V162M mutation in fibroblasts from human CMT2B patients as well as in a knockin mouse model. In contrast to recently published results from studies of using heterologous overexpression systems, our results have demonstrated significant mitochondrial fragmentation in fibroblasts of both human CMT2B patients and CMT2B mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Furthermore, we have shown that mitochondria were fragmented and axonal mitochondrial movement was dysregulated in primary cultured E18 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, but not in E18 hippocampal and cortical primary neurons. We also show that inhibitors to either the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 or to the nucleotide binding to Rab7 normalized the mitochondrial deficits in both MEFs and E18 cultured DRG neurons. Our study has revealed, for the first time, that expression of CMT2B Rab7 mutation at physiological level enhances Drp1 activity to promote mitochondrial fission, that may potentially underlie selective vulnerability of peripheral sensory neurons in CMT2B pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reward Enhances Connectivity between the Ventral Striatum and the Default Mode Network</a></h4>

              
                One of the central topics in cognitive neuroscience revolves around understanding how responses in the default mode network (DMN) relate to cognitive process and disease states. While there has been many investigations of the intrinsic patterns of activation and connectivity of the DMN with other networks at rest, i.e. when an individual is not engaged in any particular behavior, to truly understand the influence and significance of the DMN activation and connectivity, we must study it in association with a particular process. Reward processing is an integral part of goal-directed behavior that has been shown to rely on the striatum, a subcortical brain region that is connected to multiple regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that belong to the DMN. Yet, it remains unclear how the DMN interacts with the striatum during reward processing. To investigate this issue, we analyzed card-guessing task data of 453 subjects from the Human Connectome Project and applied a novel network-based psychophysiological interaction analysis (nPPI) that quantified reward-dependent connectivity of the DMN. We show that only the DMN exhibits increased connectivity with the ventral striatum (VS) during the receipt of reward. This result was specific to the DMN and the strength of connectivity was associated with the personality characteristic of openness. These findings point to a novel role of the DMN during reward processing, and to the nPPI approach being able to capture a unique contribution of a collection of regions to task performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The neuropeptide Pth2 modulates social behavior and anxiety in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Animal behavior is strongly context-dependent and behavioral performance is often modulated by internal state. In particular, different social contexts can alter anxiety levels and modulate social behavior. The vertebrate-specific neuropeptide parathyroid hormone 2 (pth2) is directly regulated by the presence or absence of conspecifics in zebrafish. As its cognate receptor, the parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (pth2r), is widely expressed across the brain, we tested fish lacking the functional Pth2 peptide in several anxiety-related and social paradigms. Rodents lacking PTH2 display increased anxiety-related behavior. Here we show that the propensity to react to sudden stimuli with an escape response is increased in pth2-/- zebrafish, consistent with elevated anxiety. While overall social preference for conspecifics is maintained in pth2-/- fish until the early juvenile stage, we found that both social preference and shoaling are altered later in development. The data presented suggest that the neuropeptide Pth2 modulates several conserved behavioral features, and may thus enable the animal to react appropriately in different social contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of cells expressing Calcitonins A and B, PDF and ACP in Locusta migratoria using cross-reacting antisera and in situ hybridization</a></h4>

              
                This work was initiated because an old publication suggested that electrocoagulation of four paraldehyde fuchsin positive cells in the brain of Locusta migratoria might produce a diuretic hormone, the identity of which remains unknown, since none of the antisera to the various putative Locusta diuretic hormones recognizes these cells. The paraldehyde fuchsin positive staining suggests a peptide with a disulfide bridge and the recently identified Locusta calcitonins have both a disulfide bridge and are structurally similar to calcitonin-like diuretic hormone. In situ hybridization and antisera raised to calcitonin-A and -B were used to show were these peptides are expressed in Locusta. Calcitonin-A is produced by neurons and neuroendocrine cells that were previously shown to be immunoreactive to an antiserum to pigment dispersing factor (PDF). The apparent PDF-immunoreactivity in these neurons and neuroendocrine cells is due to crossreactivity with the calcitonin-A precursor. As confirmed by both an PDF-precursor specific antiserum and in situ hybridisation, those calcitonin-A expressing cells do not express PDF. Calcitonin B is expressed by numerous enteroendocrine cells in the midgut as well as the midgut caeca. A guinea pig antiserum to calcitonin A seemed quite specific as it recognized only the calcitonin A expressing cells. However, rabbit antisera to calcitonin-A and-B both crossreacted with neuroendocrine cells in the brain that produce ACP, this is almost certainly due to the common C-terminal dipeptide SPamide that is shared between Locusta calcitonin-A, calcitonin-B and ACP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Developmentally-regulated impairment of parvalbumin interneuron synaptic transmission in an experimental model of Dravet syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Dravet syndrome (DS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by epilepsy, intellectual disability, and sudden death, due to heterozygous variants in SCN1A with loss of function of the sodium channel subunit Nav1.1. Nav1.1-expressing parvalbumin GABAergic interneurons (PV-INs) from pre-weanling Scn1a+/- mice show impaired action potential generation. A novel approach assessing PV-IN function in the same mice at two developmental time points showed that, at post-natal day (P) 16-21, spike generation was impaired all mice, deceased prior or surviving to P35. However, synaptic transmission was selectively dysfunctional in pre-weanling mice that did not survive. Spike generation in surviving mice normalized by P35, yet we again identified abnormalities in synaptic transmission. We conclude that combined dysfunction of PV-IN spike generation and synaptic transmission drives disease severity, while ongoing dysfunction of synaptic transmission contributes to chronic pathology. Modeling revealed that PV-IN axonal propagation is more sensitive to decreases in sodium conductance than spike generation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Elevated fear responses to threatening cues in rats with early life stress is associated with greater excitability and loss of gamma oscillations in ventral-medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Stress experienced early in development can have profound influences on developmental trajectories and ultimately behaviors in adulthood. Potent stressors during brain maturation can profoundly disrupt prefrontal cortical areas in particular, which can set the stage for prefrontal-dependent alterations in fear regulation and risk of drug abuse in adulthood. Despite these observations, few studies have investigated in vivo signaling in prefrontal signals in animals with a history of early life stress (ELS). Here, rats with ELS experience on PND3-5 were then tested on a conditioned suppression paradigm during adulthood. During conditioned suppression, electrophysiological recordings were made in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during presentations of a fear-associated cues that resolved both single-unit activity and local field potentials (LFPs). Relative to unstressed controls, ELS-experienced rats showed greater fear-related suppression of lever pressing. During presentations of the fear-associated cue (CS+), neurons in the vmPFC of ELS animals showed a significant increase in the probability of excitatory encoding relative to controls, and excitatory phasic responses in the ELS animals were reliably of higher magnitude than Controls. In contrast, vmPFC neurons in ELS subjects better discriminated between the shock-associated CS+ and the neutral ("safe") CS- cue than Controls. LFPs recorded in the same locations revealed that high gamma band (65-95 Hz) oscillations were strongly potentiated in Controls during presentation of the fear-associated CS+ cue, but this potentiation was abolished in ELS subjects. Notably, no other LFP spectra differed between ELS and Controls for either the CS+ or CS-. Collectively, these data suggest that ELS experience alters the neurobehavioral functions of PFC in adulthood that are critical for processing fear regulation. As such, these alterations may also provide insight into to increased susceptibility to other PFC-dependent processes such as risk-based choice, motivation, and regulation of drug use and relapse in ELS populations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ifenprodil Intracerebrally Offers Neuroprotection against 6-OHDA-Induced Toxicity in SD-Rats via Enhancing Autophagy Function</a></h4>

              
                The progressive decline of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra is the main pathogenic change in Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies have found that excessive excitement of glutamatergic neurons causes intracellular calcium overload and induces autophagy impairment, which is one of the main mechanisms of dopamine neuron damage. The neuroprotective effect of Ifenprodil against 6-OHDA-injured mice was studied in this study. Ifenprodil was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) or intracerebrally to rats who had a nigral-striatum pathway lesioned by 6-OHDA stereotactic brain injection. The ability to move was evaluated. The survival of dopamine neurons in the nigral was determined using HE staining, while TH-positive expression was measured using immunohistochemistry. Western Blot was used to examine the expression of CaM protein and light chain 3 (LC3), Beclin-1, BNIP3LNix, and p62. The results revealed that Ifenprodil improves motor function in 6-OHDA rats, and intracerebral injection is more effective than systemic administration. The same results also found in HE and IHC. Ifenprodil enhanced LC3II, BNIP3LNix, and Beclin-1 while decreasing p62, p-CaMKII, and {beta}-Ca expression. In addition, Ifenprodil reduced the activation of microglia caused by 6-OHDA. Overall, the findings imply that Ifenprodil intracerebrally may protect against Parkinson's disease via modulating autophagy-related proteins during 6-OHDA-induced toxicity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">miR-17~92 exerts stage-specific effects in adult V-SVZ neural stem cell lineages</a></h4>

              
                In the adult mouse brain, neural stem cells (NSCs) in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) generate neurons and glia throughout life. microRNAs are important regulators of cell states, frequently acting in a stage- or context-dependent manner. Here, miRNA profiling of FACS-purified populations identified miR-17~92 as highly upregulated in activated NSCs and transit amplifying cells (TACs) in comparison to quiescent NSCs. Conditional deletion of miR-17~92 in NSCs reduced stem cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, in TACs, miR-17~92 deletion caused a selective shift from neurogenic DLX2+ TACs towards oligodendrogenic OLIG2+ TACs, resulting in increased oligodendrogenesis to the corpus callosum. miR-17~92 deletion also decreased proliferation and maturation of intraventricular oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Together, these findings reveal stage- and cell-type- specific functions of the miR-17~92 cluster within adult V-SVZ neural stem cell lineages.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Upregulation of breathing rate during running exercise by central locomotor circuits</a></h4>

              
                While respiratory adaptation to exercise is compulsory to cope with the increased metabolic supply to body tissues and with the necessary clearing of metabolic waste, the neural apparatus at stake remains poorly identified. Using viral tracing, ex vivo and in vivo optogenetic and chemogenetic interference strategies in mice, we unravel interactive locomotor and respiratory networks' nodes that mediate the respiratory rate increase that accompanies a running exercise. We show that the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) and the lumbar spinal locomotor pattern generator (lumbar CPG), which respectively initiate and execute the locomotor behavior, access the respiratory network through distinct entry points. The MLR directly projects onto the inspiratory rhythm generator, the preBotzinger complex (preBotC), and can trigger a moderate increase of respiratory frequency, prior to, or even in the absence of, locomotion. In contrast, the lumbar CPG projects onto the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) that in turn contacts the preBotC to enforce, during effective locomotion, higher respiratory frequencies. These data expand, on the one hand, the functional implications of the MLR beyond locomotor initiation to a bona fide respiratory modulation. On the other hand, they expand the adaptive respiratory ambitions of the RTN beyond chemoception to ''locomotor-ception''.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Realism Matters. Eye movements in VR reveal prior tool knowledge, intended interaction, and end-state comfort planning</a></h4>

              
                Seminal studies on human cognitive behavior have been conducted in controlled laboratory settings, demonstrating that visual attention is mainly goal-directed and allocated based on the action performed. However, it is unclear how far these results generalize to cognition in more naturalistic settings. The present study investigates active inference processes revealed by eye movements during interaction with familiar and novel tools with two levels of realism of the performed action. We presented participants with 3D tool models that were either familiar or unfamiliar, oriented congruent or incongruent to their handedness, and asked participants to interact with them by either lifting or using. Importantly, we used the same experimental design in two setups. In the first experiment, participants interacted with a VR controller; in the second, they performed the task with a more realistic interaction setup that allowed differentiated hand and finger movements. We used linear mixed models to determine the odds of fixations on the tool effector vs. handle before action initiation. The results show that participants fixate more on the tool's effector part before action initiation during the use task for unfamiliar tools. Furthermore, under more natural interaction conditions, subjects fixate more on the tool's handle as a function of the tool's orientation, well before the action was executed. Secondly, the spatial viewing bias on the tool reveals early fixations are associated with the task and familiarity of the tools. In contrast, later fixations are associated with the manual planning of the interaction. In sum, the findings from the experiments suggest that fixations are made in a task-oriented way to extract the mechanical properties of the tools to plan the intended action well before action initiation. Further, in more natural conditions, fixations are made towards proximal goals of optimally planning the grasp even when the perceived action on the tools is identical. Thus, the realism of the action in a virtual environment seems to be as important as the sensory stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automated slice-specific z-shimming for fMRI of the human spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the human spinal cord faces many challenges, one of which is signal loss due to local magnetic field inhomogeneities. This issue can be addressed with slice-specific z-shimming, which compensates for the dephasing effect of the inhomogeneities using a single, slice-specific gradient pulse. Since the original demonstration of its utility, this technique has already been employed in several spinal fMRI studies. Here, we aim to address two outstanding issues regarding this technique: on the one hand, we evaluate its effects on several parameters that are directly relevant for spinal fMRI (but have not yet been assessed) and on the other hand, we improve upon the manual selection of slice-specific z-shims by developing automated procedures. First, we demonstrate that the beneficial effects of z-shimming i) are apparent across a large range of echo times, ii) hold true for both the dorsal and ventral horn gray matter, and iii) are also clearly apparent in the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) of gradient-echo EPI time-series data. Second, and more importantly, we address the time-consuming and subjective nature of manual selection of slice-specific z-shims by developing two automated approaches: one is based on finding the z-shim that maximizes spinal cord signal intensity in each slice of an EPI z-shim reference-scan and the other is based on finding the strength of the gradient-field that compensates the through-slice inhomogeneity in field map data. Both automated approaches i) were much faster than the manual approach, ii) lead to significant improvements in spinal cord gray matter tSNR compared to no z-shimming and iii) resulted in beneficial effects that were stable across time. While the field map-based approach performed slightly worse than the manual approach, the EPI-based approach performed at least as well as the manual one and was furthermore validated on an independently acquired corticospinal data-set (N > 100). Together, we believe that automated z-shimming will improve the data quality of future spinal fMRI studies and -- by removing the subjective step of manual z-shim selection -- may also lead to increased reproducibility in longitudinal studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Data and model considerations for estimating time-varying functional connectivity in fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity (FC) in the brain has been shown to exhibit subtle but reliable modulations within a session. One way of estimating time-varying FC is by using state-based models that describe fMRI time series as temporal sequences of states, each with an associated, characteristic pattern of FC. However, the estimation of these models from data sometimes fails to capture changes in a meaningful way, such that the model estimation assigns entire sessions (or the largest part of them) to a single state, therefore failing to capture within-session state modulations effectively; we refer to this phenomenon as the model becoming static, or model stasis. Here, we aim to quantify how the nature of the data and the choice of model parameters affect the model's ability to detect temporal changes in FC using both simulated fMRI time courses and resting state fMRI data. We show that large between-subject FC differences can overwhelm subtler within-session modulations, causing the model to become static. Further, the choice of parcellation can also affect the model's ability to detect temporal changes. We finally show that the model often becomes static when the number of free parameters that need to be estimated is high and the number of observations available for this estimation is low in comparison. Based on these findings, we derive a set of practical recommendations for time-varying FC studies, in terms of preprocessing, parcellation and complexity of the model.

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Pathogenic variants in the <em class="a-plus-plus">SYNE1</em> gene are associated with a phenotypic spectrum spanning from late-onset, slowly progressive, relatively pure ataxia to early-onset, fast progressive multisystemic disease. Since its first description in 2007 as an adult-onset ataxia in French Canadian families, subsequent identification of patients worldwide has widened the clinical spectrum and increased the number of identified pathogenic variants. We report a 20-year-old Faroese female with early-onset progressive gait problems, weakness, dysphagia, slurred speech, orthostatic dizziness, and urge incontinence. Neurological examination revealed mild cognitive deficits, dysarthria, broken slow pursuit, hypometric saccades, weakness with spasticity, hyperreflexia, absent ankle reflexes, ataxia, and wide-based, spastic gait. Magnetic resonance imaging displayed atrophy of the cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. Severely prolonged central motor conduction time and lower motor neuron involvement was demonstrated electrophysiologically. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan showed hypometabolism of the cerebellum and right frontal lobe. Muscle biopsy revealed chronic neurogenic changes and near-absent immunostaining for Nesprin-1. Next-generation sequencing revealed a previously undescribed homozygous truncating, likely pathogenic variant in the <em class="a-plus-plus">SYNE1</em> gene. The patient’s mother and paternal grandfather were heterozygous carriers of the variant. Her father’s genotype was unobtainable. We expand the list of likely pathogenic variants in <em class="a-plus-plus">SYNE1</em> ataxia with a novel homozygous truncating variant with proximity to the C-terminus and relate it to a phenotype comprising early-onset cerebellar deficits, upper and lower motor neuron involvement and cognitive deficits. Also, we report novel findings of focally reduced frontal lobe FDG-PET uptake and motor evoked potential abnormalities suggestive of central demyelination.</p>

                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the recognized as the most aggressive brain tumor with poor prognosis and low 1-year and 5-year survival rate. The treatment methods for GBM are limited and inefficient, and novel strategies for GBM treatment are urgently warranted. <em class="a-plus-plus">MiR-338-3p</em> is described as a tumor suppressor in a variety of malignancies, including GBM. However, its role in GBM is not fully understood. The mRNA or protein levels of targets in cells or tissues were determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) or Western blot, respectively. The GBM cell growth rate in vitro or in vivo was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 or bioluminescence imaging, respectively. Upregulation of hsa-miR-338-3p and downregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Rac exchanger 2 protein (<em class="a-plus-plus">Prex2</em>) were observed in GBM tissues compared to normal brain tissues. We further confirmed that murine <em class="a-plus-plus">Prex2</em> was a target of mmu-miR-338-3p in GBM. Mmu-miR-338-3p exerted profound inhibition effects on GBM cell growth in vitro or in vivo through targeting <em class="a-plus-plus">Prex2</em>, leading to attenuation of (Protein kinase B) AKT/Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling activation. Restoration of mmu-miR-338-3p or inhibition of Prex2 may facilitate the development of innovative therapies for GBM treatment.</p>

                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lysophospholipid that causes neuronal growth cones to collapse and neurites to retract through a RhoA-ROCK mediated pathway. It has been reported that the NSAID ibuprofen improves regeneration after spinal cord injury through a mechanism of inhibiting RhoA. This leads to the hypothesis that ibuprofen should block LPA-mediated growth cone collapse. We tested this hypothesis by treating embryonic chick retinal neurons with ibuprofen followed by LPA. Retinal growth cones collapsed with LPA in the presence of ibuprofen similar to control; however, growth cone collapse was effectively blocked by a ROCK inhibitor. Thus, our results do not support the designation of ibuprofen as a direct RhoA inhibitor.</p>

	<p>During natural conversation, people must quickly understand the meaning of what the other speaker is saying. This concerns not just the semantic content of an utterance, but also the social action (i.e., what the utterance is doing—requesting information, offering, evaluating, checking mutual understanding, etc.) that the utterance is performing. The multimodal nature of human language raises the question of whether visual signals may contribute to the rapid processing of such social actions. However, while previous research has shown that how we move reveals the intentions underlying instrumental actions, we do not know whether the intentions underlying fine-grained social actions in conversation are also revealed in our bodily movements. Using a corpus of dyadic conversations combined with manual annotation and motion tracking, we analyzed the kinematics of the torso, head, and hands during the asking of questions. Manual annotation categorized these questions into six more fine-grained social action types (i.e., request for information, other-initiated repair, understanding check, stance or sentiment, self-directed, active participation). We demonstrate, for the first time, that the kinematics of the torso, head and hands differ between some of these different social action categories based on a 900 ms time window that captures movements starting slightly prior to or within 600 ms after utterance onset. These results provide novel insights into the extent to which our intentions shape the way that we move, and provide new avenues for understanding how this phenomenon may facilitate the fast communication of meaning in conversational interaction, social action, and conversation.</p>

	<p>Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is defined as the sudden death of a patient with epilepsy in the absence of an anatomic or toxicologic cause. Whether pregnancy is a risk factor for SUDEP is unclear. Using data submitted to the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (JAOG), which has been collating information regarding all maternal deaths in Japan since 2000, this study evaluated maternal mortality data from 2010 to 2019 to evaluate the current circumstances of maternal death related to SUDEP in Japan. Six women died due to SUDEP during this period; the maternal mortality rate related to SUDEP was 0.066/100,000 individuals. Two women each died during the second trimester, third trimester, and postpartum period. Four and two women were receiving monotherapy and no therapy with anti-epileptic drugs, respectively. The duration of epilepsy was ≤15 years in three women, &amp;amp;gt;15 years in one woman, and unknown in two women. This study furthers our understanding of the prevalence of maternal deaths due to SUDEP in Japan. Further studies are needed to confirm whether pregnancy is a risk factor for SUDEP.</p>

	<p>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the deadliest form of brain tumors. To date, the GBM therapeutical approach consists of surgery, radiation-therapy and chemotherapy combined with molecules improving cancer responsiveness to treatments. In this review, we will present a brief overview of the GBM classification and pathogenesis, as well as the therapeutic approach currently used. Then, we will focus on the modulatory role exerted by pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide, known as PACAP, on GBM malignancy. Specifically, we will describe PACAP ability to interfere with GBM cell proliferation, as well as the tumoral microenvironment. Considering its anti-oncogenic role in GBM, synthesis of PACAP agonist molecules may open new perspectives for combined therapy to existing gold standard treatment.</p>

	<p>Obesity has become a major public and individual health problem due to its high worldwide prevalence and its relation with comorbid conditions. According to previous studies, obesity is related to an increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. This systematic review aims to further examine the present state of the art about the association between obesity and gray matter volume (GMV) as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A search was conducted in Pubmed, SCOPUS and Cochrane of those studies released before 1 February 2021 including MRIs to assess the GMVs in obese participants. From this search, 1420 results were obtained, and 34 publications were finally included. Obesity was mainly measured by the body mass index, although other common types of evaluations were used (e.g., waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio and plasma leptin levels). The selected neuroimaging analysis methods were voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and cortical thickness (CT), finding 21 and 13 publications, respectively. There were 30 cross-sectional and 2 prospective longitudinal studies, and 2 articles had both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. Most studies showed a negative association between obesity and GMV. This would have important public health implications, as obesity prevention could avoid a potential risk of GMV reductions, cognitive impairment and dementia.</p>

	<p>Semantic dementia (SD) is a younger-onset neurodegenerative disease characterised by progressive deterioration of the semantic knowledge base in the context of predominantly left-lateralised anterior temporal lobe (ATL) atrophy. Mounting evidence indicates the emergence of florid socioemotional changes in SD as atrophy encroaches into right temporal regions. How lateralisation of temporal lobe pathology impacts the hedonic experience in SD remains largely unknown yet has important implications for understanding socioemotional and functional impairments in this syndrome. Here, we explored how lateralisation of temporal lobe atrophy impacts anhedonia severity on the Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale in 28 SD patients presenting with variable right- (SD-R) and left-predominant (SD-L) profiles of temporal lobe atrophy compared to that of 30 participants with Alzheimer’s disease and 30 healthy older Control participants. Relative to Controls, SD-R but not SD-L or Alzheimer’s patients showed clinically significant anhedonia, representing a clear departure from premorbid levels. Overall, anhedonia was more strongly associated with functional impairment on the Frontotemporal Dementia Functional Rating Scale and motivational changes on the Cambridge Behavioural Inventory in SD than in Alzheimer’s disease patients. Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed that anhedonia severity correlated with reduced grey matter intensity in a restricted set of regions centred on right orbitofrontal and temporopolar cortices, bilateral posterior temporal cortices, as well as the anterior cingulate gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus, bilaterally. Finally, regression and mediation analysis indicated a unique role for right temporal lobe structures in modulating anhedonia in SD. Our findings suggest that degeneration of predominantly right-hemisphere structures deleteriously impacts the capacity to experience pleasure in SD. These findings offer important insights into hemispheric lateralisation of motivational disturbances in dementia and suggest that anhedonia may emerge at different timescales in the SD disease trajectory depending on the integrity of the right hemisphere.</p>

	<p>Swallowing difficulties are a common complaint among patients with a variety of diseases. To address these concerns, a singing-enhanced swallowing protocol was constructed, and its differential benefits for two patient populations were investigated. Two patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and two patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) participated in this study. Each patient participated in 30-min individual sessions of a singing-enhanced swallowing protocol two times per week for 12 weeks. Following the intervention, laryngeal diadochokinesis and quality-of-life measurements were found to be higher in all four patients. However, the Videofluoroscopic Dysphagia Scale showed this improvement was associated with different swallowing tasks for each patient group. In addition, the maximum phonation time decreased for patients with HNC, while it increased for patients with PD. The findings support the use of a singing-enhanced swallowing protocol for patients whose swallowing difficulties are due to neurological or structural impairment. In addition, the study results suggest that different intervention components should be considered depending on the etiology of the patient’s swallowing difficulties.</p>

Here, the authors show that MnBi, a ferromagnet, bucks this trend, showing both large and non-saturating magnetoresistance, and high charge carrier motilities.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Grid cells in rodent medial entorhinal cortex are thought to play a key role for spatial navigation. When the animal is freely moving in an open arena the firing fields of each grid cell tend to form a highly regular, hexagonal lattice spanning the environment. However, firing rates vary from field to field and change under contextual modifications, whereas the field locations shift at most by a small amount under such “rate remapping.” The observed differences in firing rate could reflect overall activity changes or changes in the detailed spike-train statistics. As these two alternatives imply distinct neural coding schemes, we investigated whether temporal firing patterns vary from field to field and whether they change under rate remapping. Focusing on short time scales, we found that the proportion of bursts compared to all discharge events is similar in all firing fields of a given grid cell and does not change under rate remapping. For each cell, mean firing rates with bursts are proportional to mean firing rates without bursts. However, this ratio varies across cells. Additionally, we looked at how rate remapping relates to entorhinal theta-frequency oscillations. Theta-phase coding was preserved despite firing-rate changes from rate remapping but we did not observe differences between the first and second half of the theta cycle, as had been reported for CA1. Our results indicate that both, the heterogeneity between firing fields and rate remapping, are not due to altered firing patterns on short time scales but reflect location-specific changes at the firing-rate level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in individuals designated as clinically extremely vulnerable in Scotland [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Although COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to have high efficacy in the general population, it has not been established whether this applies to vulnerable groups. The objective of this study was to estimate the efficacy of vaccination in reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 among those designated as clinically extremely vulnerable in Scotland. Methods: In a matched case-control design (REACT-SCOT), all 111295 cases of COVID-19 in Scotland diagnosed from 1 December 2020 to 16 March 2021 were matched for age, sex and primary care practice to 1093449 controls from the general population. This was linked to national data on vaccinations and those designated as clinically extremely vulnerable and thus eligible for shielding support. Severe COVID-19 was defined as cases with entry to critical care or fatal outcome. Rate ratios associated with vaccination within risk groups were estimated by conditional logistic regression. Results: The rate ratio for severe COVID-19 associated with vaccination at least 14 days before was 0.29 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.37) in those eligible for shielding, compared with 0.29 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.34) in those ineligible for shielding. The rate ratio for hospitalized or fatal COVID-19 was 0.39 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.46) in those eligible and 0.37 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.41) in those not eligible for shielding. Examined by specific shielding conditions, the rate ratio for hospitalized or fatal COVID-19 ranged from 0.33 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.51) in those with specific cancers to 0.74 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.51) in solid organ transplant recipients, and 0.53 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.84) in others on immunosuppressants (excluding solid organ transplant recipients). Conclusions: These results are reassuring with respect to efficacy in clinically vulnerable individuals including immunocompromised individuals, but studies in larger populations are needed to estimate efficacy in solid organ transplant recipients.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Emergence of directional bias in tau deposition from axonal transport dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Justin Torok, Pedro D. Maia, Parul Verma, Christopher Mezias, Ashish Raj</p>

Defects in axonal transport may partly underpin the differences between the observed pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and that of other non-amyloidogenic tauopathies. Particularly, pathological tau variants may have molecular properties that dysregulate motor proteins responsible for the anterograde-directed transport of tau in a disease-specific fashion. Here we develop the first computational model of tau-modified axonal transport that produces directional biases in the spread of tau pathology. We simulated the spatiotemporal profiles of soluble and insoluble tau species in a multicompartment, two-neuron system using biologically plausible parameters and time scales. Changes in the balance of tau transport feedback parameters can elicit anterograde and retrograde biases in the distributions of soluble and insoluble tau between compartments in the system. Aggregation and fragmentation parameters can also perturb this balance, suggesting a complex interplay between these distinct molecular processes. Critically, we show that the model faithfully recreates the characteristic network spread biases in both AD-like and non-AD-like mouse tauopathy models. Tau transport feedback may therefore help link microscopic differences in tau conformational states and the resulting variety in clinical presentations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The kinetic landscape of nucleosome assembly: A coarse-grained molecular dynamics study</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Giovanni B. Brandani, Cheng Tan, Shoji Takada</p>

The organization of nucleosomes along the Eukaryotic genome is maintained over time despite disruptive events such as replication. During this complex process, histones and DNA can form a variety of non-canonical nucleosome conformations, but their precise molecular details and roles during nucleosome assembly remain unclear. In this study, employing coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state modeling, we characterized the complete kinetics of nucleosome assembly. On the nucleosome-positioning 601 DNA sequence, we observe a rich transition network among various canonical and non-canonical tetrasome, hexasome, and nucleosome conformations. A low salt environment makes nucleosomes stable, but the kinetic landscape becomes more rugged, so that the system is more likely to be trapped in off-pathway partially assembled intermediates. Finally, we find that the co-operativity between DNA bending and histone association enables positioning sequence motifs to direct the assembly process, with potential implications for the dynamic organization of nucleosomes on real genomic sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational Eurotransplant kidney allocation simulations demonstrate the feasibility and benefit of T-cell epitope matching</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthias Niemann, Nils Lachmann, Kirsten Geneugelijk, Eric Spierings</p>

The EuroTransplant Kidney Allocation System (ETKAS) aims at allocating organs to patients on the waiting list fairly whilst optimizing HLA match grades. ETKAS currently considers the number of HLA-A, -B, -DR mismatches. Evidently, epitope matching is biologically and clinically more relevant. We here executed ETKAS-based computer simulations to evaluate the impact of epitope matching on allocation and compared the strategies. A virtual population of 400,000 individuals was generated using the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) haplotype frequency dataset of 2011. Using this population, a waiting list of 10,400 patients was constructed and maintained during simulation, matching the 2015 Eurotransplant Annual Report characteristics. Unacceptable antigens were assigned randomly relative to their frequency using HLAMatchmaker. Over 22,600 kidneys were allocated in 10 years in triplicate using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations on 32-CPU-core cloud-computing instances. T-cell epitopes were calculated using the www.pirche.com portal. Waiting list effects were evaluated against ETKAS for five epitope matching scenarios. Baseline simulations of ETKAS slightly overestimated reported average HLA match grades. The best balanced scenario maintained prioritisation of HLA A-B-DR fully matched donors while replacing the HLA match grade by PIRCHE-II score and exchanging the HLA mismatch probability (MMP) by epitope MMP. This setup showed no considerable impact on kidney exchange rates and waiting time. PIRCHE-II scores improved, whereas the average HLA match grade diminishes slightly, yet leading to an improved estimated graft survival. We conclude that epitope-based matching in deceased donor kidney allocation is feasible while maintaining equal balances on the waiting list.
