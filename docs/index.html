              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07798">Risk and Protective Factors in Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.07798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the risk and protective factors associated with Parkinsons disease (PD) is crucial for improving outcomes for patients, individuals at risk, healthcare providers, and healthcare systems. Studying these factors not only enhances our knowledge of the disease but also aids in developing effective prevention, management, and treatment strategies. This paper reviews the key risk and protective factors associated with PD, with a particular focus on the biological mechanisms underlying these factors. Risk factors include genetic mutations, racial predispositions, and environmental exposures, all of which contribute to an increased likelihood of developing PD or accelerating disease progression. Conversely, protective factors such as regular physical exercise, adherence to a Mediterranean diet, and higher urate levels have demonstrated potential to reduce inflammation and support mitochondrial function, thereby mitigating disease risk. However, identifying and validating these factors presents significant challenges. To overcome challenges, we propose several solutions and recommendations. Future research should prioritize the development of standardized biomarkers for early diagnosis, investigate gene-environment interactions in greater depth, and refine animal models to better mimic human PD pathology. Additionally, we offer actionable recommendations for PD prevention and management, tailored to healthy individuals, patients diagnosed with PD, and healthcare systems. These strategies aim to improve clinical outcomes, enhance quality of life, and optimize healthcare delivery for PD.

                arXiv:2503.07640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early differentiation between AD and LBD is crucial because they require different treatment approaches, but this is challenging due to significant clinical overlap, heterogeneity, complex pathogenesis, and the rarity of LBD. While recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrate powerful learning capabilities and offer new hope for accurate diagnosis, existing methods primarily focus on designing "neural-level networks". Our work represents a pioneering effort in modeling system-level artificial neural network called BrainNet-MoE for brain modeling and diagnosing. Inspired by the brain's hierarchical organization of bottom-up sensory integration and top-down control, we design a set of disease-specific expert groups to process brain sub-network under different condition, A disease gate mechanism guides the specializa-tion of expert groups, while a transformer layer enables communication be-tween all sub-networks, generating a comprehensive whole-brain represen-tation for downstream disease classification. Experimental results show superior classification accuracy with interpretable insights into how brain sub-networks contribute to different neurodegenerative conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07150">Adaptive behavior with stable synapses</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.07150v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavioral changes in animals and humans, as a consequence of an error or a verbal instruction, can be extremely rapid. Improvement in behavioral performances are usually associated in machine learning and reinforcement learning to synaptic plasticity, and, in general, to changes and optimization of network parameters. However, such rapid changes are not coherent with the timescales of synaptic plasticity, suggesting that the mechanism responsible for that could be a dynamical network reconfiguration. In the last few years, similar capabilities have been observed in transformers, foundational architecture in the field of machine learning that are widely used in applications such as natural language and image processing. Transformers are capable of in-context learning, the ability to adapt and acquire new information dynamically within the context of the task or environment they are currently engaged in, without the need for significant changes to their underlying parameters. Building upon the notion of something unique within transformers enabling the emergence of this property, we claim that it could also be supported by input segregation and dendritic amplification, features extensively observed in biological networks. We propose an architecture composed of gain-modulated recurrent networks that excels at in-context learning, showing abilities inaccessible to standard networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19147">Functional Brain Network Identification in Opioid Use Disorder Using Machine Learning Analysis of Resting-State fMRI BOLD Signals</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.19147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the neurobiology of opioid use disorder (OUD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) may help inform treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes. Recent literature suggests time-frequency characteristics of rs-fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals may offer complementary information to traditional analysis techniques. However, existing studies of OUD analyze BOLD signals using measures computed across all time points. This study, for the first time in the literature, employs data-driven machine learning (ML) for time-frequency analysis of local neural activity within key functional networks to differentiate OUD subjects from healthy controls (HC). We obtain time-frequency features based on rs-fMRI BOLD signals from the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) for 31 OUD and 45 HC subjects. Then, we perform 5-fold cross-validation classification (OUD vs. HC) experiments to study the discriminative power of functional network features while taking into consideration significant demographic features. The DMN and SN show the most discriminative power, significantly (p < 0.05) outperforming chance baselines with mean F1 scores of 0.7097 and 0.7018, respectively, and mean AUCs of 0.8378 and 0.8755, respectively. Follow-up Boruta ML analysis of selected time-frequency (wavelet) features reveals significant (p < 0.05) detail coefficients for all three functional networks, underscoring the need for ML and time-frequency analysis of rs-fMRI BOLD signals in the study of OUD.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08069">Freezing chaos without synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.08069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaos is ubiquitous in high-dimensional neural dynamics. A strong chaotic fluctuation may be harmful to information processing. A traditional way to mitigate this issue is to introduce Hebbian plasticity, which can stabilize the dynamics. Here, we introduce another distinct way without synaptic plasticity. An Onsager reaction term due to the feedback of the neuron itself is added to the vanilla recurrent dynamics, making the driving force a gradient form. The original unstable fixed points supporting the chaotic fluctuation can then be approached by further decreasing the kinetic energy of the dynamics. We show that this freezing effect also holds in more biologically realistic networks, such as those composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The gradient dynamics are also useful for computational tasks such as recalling or predicting external time-dependent stimuli.

                arXiv:2503.08608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entorhinal-hippocampal formation is the mammalian brain's navigation system, encoding both physical and abstract spaces via grid cells. This system is well-studied in neuroscience, and its efficiency and versatility make it attractive for applications in robotics and machine learning. While continuous attractor networks (CANs) successfully model entorhinal grid cells for encoding physical space, integrating both continuous spatial and abstract spatial computations into a unified framework remains challenging. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by proposing a mechanistic model for versatile information processing in the entorhinal-hippocampal formation inspired by CANs and Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), a neuro-symbolic computing framework. The novel grid-cell VSA (GC-VSA) model employs a spatially structured encoding scheme with 3D neuronal modules mimicking the discrete scales and orientations of grid cell modules, reproducing their characteristic hexagonal receptive fields. In experiments, the model demonstrates versatility in spatial and abstract tasks: (1) accurate path integration for tracking locations, (2) spatio-temporal representation for querying object locations and temporal relations, and (3) symbolic reasoning using family trees as a structured test case for hierarchical relationships.

                arXiv:2503.08394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task optimization is typically characterized by a fixed and finite set of optimization tasks. The present paper relaxes this condition by considering a non-fixed and potentially infinite set of optimization tasks defined in a parameterized, continuous and bounded task space. We refer to this unique problem setting as parametric multi-task optimization (PMTO). Assuming the bounds of the task parameters to be ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$), a novel ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$)-PMTO algorithm is crafted to enable joint search over tasks and their solutions. This joint search is supported by two approximation models: (1) for mapping solutions to the objective spaces of all tasks, which provably accelerates convergence by acting as a conduit for inter-task knowledge transfers, and (2) for probabilistically mapping tasks to the solution space, which facilitates evolutionary exploration of under-explored regions of the task space. At the end of a full ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$)-PMTO run, the acquired models enable rapid identification of optimized solutions for any task lying within the specified bounds. This outcome is validated on both synthetic test problems and practical case studies, with the significant real-world applicability of PMTO shown towards fast reconfiguration of robot controllers under changing task conditions. The potential of PMTO to vastly speedup the search for solutions to minimax optimization problems is also demonstrated through an example in robust engineering design.

                arXiv:2503.07641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Deep ARTMAP, a novel extension of the ARTMAP architecture that generalizes the self-consistent modular ART (SMART) architecture to enable hierarchical learning (supervised and unsupervised) across arbitrary transformations of data. The Deep ARTMAP framework operates as a divisive clustering mechanism, supporting an arbitrary number of modules with customizable granularity within each module. Inter-ART modules regulate the clustering at each layer, permitting unsupervised learning while enforcing a one-to-many mapping from clusters in one layer to the next. While Deep ARTMAP reduces to both ARTMAP and SMART in particular configurations, it offers significantly enhanced flexibility, accommodating a broader range of data transformations and learning modalities.

                arXiv:2503.07693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Program synthesis with Large Language Models (LLMs) suffers from a "near-miss syndrome": the generated code closely resembles a correct solution but fails unit tests due to minor errors. We address this with a multi-agent framework called Synthesize, Execute, Instruct, Debug, and Repair (SEIDR). Effectively applying SEIDR to instruction-tuned LLMs requires determining (a) optimal prompts for LLMs, (b) what ranking algorithm selects the best programs in debugging rounds, and (c) balancing the repair of unsuccessful programs with the generation of new ones. We empirically explore these trade-offs by comparing replace-focused, repair-focused, and hybrid debug strategies. We also evaluate lexicase and tournament selection to rank candidates in each generation. On Program Synthesis Benchmark 2 (PSB2), our framework outperforms both conventional use of OpenAI Codex without a repair phase and traditional genetic programming approaches. SEIDR outperforms the use of an LLM alone, solving 18 problems in C++ and 20 in Python on PSB2 at least once across experiments. To assess generalizability, we employ GPT-3.5 and Llama 3 on the PSB2 and HumanEval-X benchmarks. Although SEIDR with these models does not surpass current state-of-the-art methods on the Python benchmarks, the results on HumanEval-C++ are promising. SEIDR with Llama 3-8B achieves an average pass@100 of 84.2%. Across all SEIDR runs, 163 of 164 problems are solved at least once with GPT-3.5 in HumanEval-C++, and 162 of 164 with the smaller Llama 3-8B. We conclude that SEIDR effectively overcomes the near-miss syndrome in program synthesis with LLMs.

                arXiv:2503.07823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph-based techniques relying on neural networks and embeddings have gained attention as a way to develop Recommender Systems (RS) with several papers on the topic presented at SIGIR 2022 and 2023. Given the importance of ensuring that published research is methodologically sound and reproducible, in this paper we analyze 10 graph-based RS papers, most of which were published at SIGIR 2022, and assess their impact on subsequent work published in SIGIR 2023. Our analysis reveals several critical points that require attention: (i) the prevalence of bad practices, such as erroneous data splits or information leakage between training and testing data, which call into question the validity of the results; (ii) frequent inconsistencies between the provided artifacts (source code and data) and their descriptions in the paper, causing uncertainty about what is actually being evaluated; and (iii) the preference for new or complex baselines that are weaker compared to simpler ones, creating the impression of continuous improvement even when, particularly for the Amazon-Book dataset, the state-of-the-art has significantly worsened. Due to these issues, we are unable to confirm the claims made in most of the papers we examined and attempted to reproduce.

                arXiv:2503.08301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many-task optimization scenarios, surrogate models are valuable for mitigating the computational burden of repeated fitness evaluations across tasks. This study proposes a novel meta-surrogate framework to assist many-task optimization, by leveraging the knowledge transfer strengths and emergent capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We formulate a unified framework for many-task fitness prediction, by defining a universal model with metadata to fit a group of problems. Fitness prediction is performed on metadata and decision variables, enabling efficient knowledge sharing across tasks and adaptability to new tasks. The LLM-based meta-surrogate treats fitness prediction as conditional probability estimation, employing a unified token sequence representation for task metadata, inputs, and outputs. This approach facilitates efficient inter-task knowledge sharing through shared token embeddings and captures complex task dependencies via multi-task model training. Experimental results demonstrate the model's emergent generalization ability, including zero-shot performance on problems with unseen dimensions. When integrated into evolutionary transfer optimization (ETO), our framework supports dual-level knowledge transfer -- at both the surrogate and individual levels -- enhancing optimization efficiency and robustness. This work establishes a novel foundation for applying LLMs in surrogate modeling, offering a versatile solution for many-task optimization.

                arXiv:2503.08482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Outdoor thermal comfort is a critical determinant of urban livability, particularly in hot desert climates where extreme heat poses challenges to public health, energy consumption, and urban planning. Mean Radiant Temperature ($T_{mrt}$) is a key parameter for evaluating outdoor thermal comfort, especially in urban environments where radiation dynamics significantly impact human thermal exposure. Traditional methods of estimating $T_{mrt}$ rely on field measurements and computational simulations, both of which are resource intensive. This study introduces a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach that integrates shortwave and longwave radiation modeling with deep learning techniques. By leveraging a multimodal dataset that includes meteorological data, built environment characteristics, and fisheye image-derived shading information, our model enhances predictive accuracy while maintaining physical consistency. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PINN framework outperforms conventional deep learning models, with the best-performing configurations achieving an RMSE of 3.50 and an $R^2$ of 0.88. This approach highlights the potential of physics-informed machine learning in bridging the gap between computational modeling and real-world applications, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for urban thermal comfort assessments.

                arXiv:2503.08502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent findings suggest that consecutive layers of neural networks with the ReLU activation function \emph{fold} the input space during the learning process. While many works hint at this phenomenon, an approach to quantify the folding was only recently proposed by means of a space folding measure based on Hamming distance in the ReLU activation space. We generalize this measure to a wider class of activation functions through introduction of equivalence classes of input data, analyse its mathematical and computational properties and come up with an efficient sampling strategy for its implementation. Moreover, it has been observed that space folding values increase with network depth when the generalization error is low, but decrease when the error increases. This underpins that learned symmetries in the data manifold (e.g., invariance under reflection) become visible in terms of space folds, contributing to the network's generalization capacity. Inspired by these findings, we outline a novel regularization scheme that encourages the network to seek solutions characterized by higher folding values.

                arXiv:2309.12862v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging from the pairwise attention in conventional Transformers, there is a growing interest in sparse attention mechanisms that align more closely with localized, contextual learning in the biological brain. Existing studies such as the Coordination method employ iterative cross-attention mechanisms with a bottleneck to enable the sparse association of inputs. However, these methods are parameter inefficient and fail in more complex relational reasoning tasks. To this end, we propose Associative Transformer (AiT) to enhance the association among sparsely attended input tokens, improving parameter efficiency and performance in various vision tasks such as classification and relational reasoning. AiT leverages a learnable explicit memory comprising specialized priors that guide bottleneck attentions to facilitate the extraction of diverse localized tokens. Moreover, AiT employs an associative memory-based token reconstruction using a Hopfield energy function. The extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that AiT requires significantly fewer parameters and attention layers outperforming a broad range of sparse Transformer models. Additionally, AiT outperforms the SOTA sparse Transformer models including the Coordination method on the Sort-of-CLEVR dataset.

                arXiv:2411.08798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the gradient flow dynamics of a neural network model that uses correlation loss to approximate a multi-index function on high-dimensional standard Gaussian data. Specifically, the multi-index function we consider is a sum of neurons $f^*(x) \!=\! \sum_{j=1}^k \! \sigma^*(v_j^T x)$ where $v_1, \dots, v_k$ are unit vectors, and $\sigma^*$ lacks the first and second Hermite polynomials in its Hermite expansion. It is known that, for the single-index case ($k\!=\!1$), overcoming the search phase requires polynomial time complexity. We first generalize this result to multi-index functions characterized by vectors in arbitrary directions. After the search phase, it is not clear whether the network neurons converge to the index vectors, or get stuck at a sub-optimal solution. When the index vectors are orthogonal, we give a complete characterization of the fixed points and prove that neurons converge to the nearest index vectors. Therefore, using $n \! \asymp \! k \log k$ neurons ensures finding the full set of index vectors with gradient flow with high probability over random initialization. When $ v_i^T v_j \!=\! \beta \! \geq \! 0$ for all $i \neq j$, we prove the existence of a sharp threshold $\beta_c \!=\! c/(c+k)$ at which the fixed point that computes the average of the index vectors transitions from a saddle point to a minimum. Numerical simulations show that using a correlation loss and a mild overparameterization suffices to learn all of the index vectors when they are nearly orthogonal, however, the correlation loss fails when the dot product between the index vectors exceeds a certain threshold.

                arXiv:2411.10573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widely used ReLU is favored for its hardware efficiency, {as the implementation at inference is a one bit sign case,} yet suffers from issues such as the ``dying ReLU'' problem, where during training, neurons fail to activate and constantly remain at zero, as highlighted by Lu et al. Traditional approaches to mitigate this issue often introduce more complex and less hardware-friendly activation functions. In this work, we propose a Hysteresis Rectified Linear Unit (HeLU), an efficient activation function designed to address the ``dying ReLU'' problem with minimal complexity. Unlike traditional activation functions with fixed thresholds for training and inference, HeLU employs a variable threshold that refines the backpropagation. This refined mechanism allows simpler activation functions to achieve competitive performance comparable to their more complex counterparts without introducing unnecessary complexity or requiring inductive biases. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that HeLU enhances model generalization across diverse datasets, offering a promising solution for efficient and effective inference suitable for a wide range of neural network architectures.

">Bidirectional crusher gradient method for estimating the labeling efficiency of pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling MRI in mice</a></h4>

              
                Pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) MRI is a widely used imaging technique for studying brain perfusion in health and disease due to its non-invasive and non-contrast nature. Accurate quantification of absolute perfusion values from pCASL signals requires the knowledge of labeling efficiency. However, to date, a reliable technique to measure pCASL labeling efficiency has not been available. In this study, we propose a method using bidirectional crusher gradients to modulate vascular signals in the azygos pericallosal artery (azPA) of the mouse brain, applied with and without pCASL labeling. The combination of corresponding signals allows the estimation of labeling efficiency. Upon systematic testing, optimal acquisition parameters included a labeling duration [&ge;] 1170 ms, a repetition time of 3 seconds, and an imaging slice thickness of 0.75 mm. In order to quantitatively estimate labeling efficiency, the bolus arrival time to azPA is required and found to be 218.7 +/- 13.3 ms. Typical labeling efficiencies in mouse pCASL scans were 0.780 +/- 0.048 (mean +/- standard deviation). Furthermore, faster arterial flow induced by hypercapnia was found to increase pCASL labeling efficiency. Our method can improve the accuracy of pCASL quantification in mice, offering great potential for advancing its applications in pathophysiological studies.

	<p>Background: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is considered as a rare disease. It is considered one of the most prevalent genetic disorders with multiple systemic and neuropsychological alterations. At present, there are few studies that define the linguistic profile in Spanish of children with this syndrome. Objectives: Therefore, the aim of the present study was to define the phonemic&amp;amp;ndash;phonological characteristics of people with 22q11.2 Syndrome. Method: Eight boys and girls between 5 and 16 years old participated in an evaluation using the following tests: Induced Phonological Register and Laura Bosh&amp;amp;rsquo;s Phonological Assessment and Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s Speech. Results: After analyzing the results obtained, it was observed that more than half of the participants presented a delay in the acquisition of phonemes. Conclusions: The conclusion of this study points out the importance of working on language, especially the phonetic-phonological area, throughout the development of people with 22q11.2 Syndrome.</p>

	<p>Background: Sleep disturbances are a core feature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), affecting up to 90% of patients and often persisting after standard PTSD treatment. As all the current interventions have limitations, amygdala-targeted neuromodulation may offer a novel treatment pathway. Methods: Secondary analysis of a prospective, single-arm trial (n = 58) was carried out evaluating Prism&amp;amp;trade; amygdala-derived-EEG-fMRI-Pattern neurofeedback (Amyg-EFP-NF). Sleep outcomes were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) sleep item, PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) sleep item, and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) sleep items at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Treatment consisted of 15 sessions over 8 weeks. Results: At 3-months&amp;amp;rsquo; follow-up, 63.79% of participants demonstrated clinically meaningful reduction in sleep disturbances (&amp;amp;ge;1 point reduction in CAPS-5 Item 20). Sleep improvement showed a moderate correlation with overall PTSD symptom reduction (r = 0.484, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and a balanced improvement pattern (&amp;amp;minus;15.1% early, &amp;amp;minus;9.1% late). Sleep responders sustained improvement across multiple measures and showed significant increases in cognitive reappraisal (mean change: +2.57 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.0, p = 0.006), while non-responders showed initial but un-sustained improvement in trauma-related dreams. Conclusions: Amyg-EFP-NF shows preliminary promise for treating PTSD-related sleep disturbances. Our exploratory analyses suggest distinct temporal patterns of sleep improvement and potential associations with enhanced cognitive reappraisal capacity that warrant rigorous investigation in future randomized controlled trials.</p>

	<p>Background and Objectives: End-stage renal failure (ESRF) patients are at an increased risk of various neurological complications, particularly after hemodialysis. The current case report describes a rare presentation of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) in a patient with ESRF caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: We present our case report. We also performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Scopus, and Dimensions for the current literature review. Results: A total of 296 unique articles were identified, and their full text was retrieved. However, only one case report was relevant to our study and is summarized thereunder. The treatment approach involved high-dose intravenous steroids, surgical evacuation of the cranial subdural collections, and epidural blood patches to seal the presumed dural defect. Conclusions: This case report describes a rare presentation of SIH in a young patient with ESRF due to SLE. Diagnostic imaging revealed extensive subdural and epidural fluid collections in the brain and spinal cord, respectively, along with a few T2 FLAIR hyperintensities noted in the right thalamus, left cerebellar hemisphere, and right occipital gyrus that subsequently resolved. The treatment approach involved high-dose intravenous steroids, surgical evacuation of the cranial subdural collections, and epidural blood patches to seal the presumed dural defect.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-467/v4?src=rss">Negative perceptions toward older adults and life satisfaction among community-dwelling older citizens in Japan [version 4; peer review: 2 approved, 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background With the rapid aging of the population, increasing life satisfaction among older adults is essential. Negative perceptions of older adults are internalized, leading to poor mental health. This study hypothesized that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults would have lower life satisfaction. Methods A cross-sectional survey of older adults was conducted across five wards and four cities in Tokyo, Japan. Participants responded to questions regarding demographics, life satisfaction, and negative perceptions of older adults. Data from 285 participants (264 women, M = 71.97 years) were analyzed. Results The intraclass correlation coefficient for life satisfaction concerning residential areas was. 03 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [-.03, .10]). Instead of multilevel models, a multiple regression model with life satisfaction as the dependent variable and negative perceptions of older adults and demographics as the independent variables yielded the best fit. Results indicated that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults reported lower life satisfaction (β = -.16, 95% CI = [-.28, -.04], p = .008), supporting our hypothesis. Conclusions This study was constrained by limited variance in residential areas and a predominantly female participant pool. Previous studies have shown that higher life satisfaction is associated with increased social participation and extended life expectancy, and interventions aimed at enhancing life satisfaction in older adults are significant. Further exploration is warranted to ascertain whether a causal relationship exists, wherein more negative perceptions of older adults diminish life satisfaction.

                One of the common forms of dental injury is anterior crown fractures, which mainly affect teenagers and young adults. Fractures of the coronal portion of the permanent incisors characterize 18–22% of total traumatic injuries to dental hard tissues, of which 96% of them comprise the maxillary incisors. An uncomplicated fracture of the crown is one of the most common types of dental traumatic injury. Dental trauma has an emotional impact on the patient’s overall health and can seriously harm to the dentition. The treatment, as well as prognosis of the fracture of the coronal portion, is a major challenge for a dentist because it has to accomplish various parameters like the need to obtain an aesthetical result that approaches itself to its natural form and measurement, opaqueness and translucency of the original tooth structure in obtaining an effective restoration. It is suggested that reattachment of the fractured fragment is the best procedure for restoring an uncomplicated crown fracture, if a fragment is present. Fragment reattachment offers superior aesthetics and function compared to composite restorations, preserving the tooth’s natural characteristics, like the tooth’s true shape, colour, intensity, and surface texture. Success depends on the fracture line’s direction and location; simple enamel or enamel-dentin fractures are ideal. However, reattached fragments remain vulnerable to subsequent trauma. The reattached fragments are susceptible to further fracture when the restored teeth undergo further trauma. The resistance of the fractured teeth that have been reattached is the subject of the majority of concerns. Preconditioning the fractured fragments with remineralizing agents may aid in hydration. Thus, a study will be conducted to evaluate the resistance of the fracture of a tooth that is reattached and pre-treated with remineralizing agents such as sodium fluoride and casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate and further reattached using one of the self-adhesive bioactive composite.

                Biopesticides are pest control products derived from natural sources such as microbes, macro-organisms (insects and pathogens), plant extracts, and certain minerals. Many biopesticides are considered environmentally safe and can complement or substitute conventional chemical pesticides. They can also be highly specific or broad spectrum with a unique mode of action controlling a wide range of pest species. Due to their target-specificity and low to no environmental residuality, biopesticides conform to the 3 pillars of Climate-Smart Agriculture, the Sustainable Development Goals, and, ultimately, the Paris Agreement. This review focuses largely on microbial biopesticides derived from fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes. It discusses (i) the various microbial biopesticide formulations, (ii) the mode of microbial biopesticide action, (iii) the factors that affect the potential efficacy of biopesticides, (iv) challenges to the adoption of microbial biopesticides, and (v) the role of microbial biopesticides in Integrated Pest Management programs. Finally, advancements in application techniques, as well as future research directions and gaps, are highlighted.

                Background Energy shortages and global warming have been significant issues throughout history. Therefore, the search for environmentally friendly renewable energy sources is crucial for achieving sustainability. Biomass energy is gaining global attention as a renewable energy option, particularly through the process of hydrothermal liquefaction, which converts wet biomass into bio-crude oil. Methods Hydrothermal liquefaction is a complex process that is challenging to explain, leading to research on machine learning models for this process. These models aim to predict values and investigate the impact of variables on the hydrothermal liquefaction process. These models aim to predict values and investigate the impact of variables on the hydrothermal liquefaction process. However, the development of machine learning in hydrothermal liquefaction is still limited due to its novelty and the time required for comprehensive study. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze relevant publications in the Scopus database, focusing on indexed ML and HTL keywords, to understand keyword associations and co-citations. Results The results reveal an increasing trend in the study of ML in the HTL process, with a growing interest from various countries. Conclusion Notably, China currently holds the largest share of ML research in HTL processes, with most published works falling within the field of engineering. The keyword “liquefaction” emerges as the most popular term in these publications.

Nontyphoidal <i>Salmonella</i> strains (NTS) are among the most common foodborne enteropathogens and constitute a major cause of global morbidity and mortality, imposing a substantial burden on global health. The increasing antibiotic resistance of NTS bacteria has attracted a lot of research on understanding their modus operandi during infection. Growth in the gut lumen is a critical phase of the NTS infection. This might offer opportunities for intervention. However, the metabolic richness of the gut lumen environment and the inherent complexity and robustness of the metabolism of NTS bacteria call for modeling approaches to guide research efforts. In this study, we reconstructed a thermodynamically constrained and context-specific genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) for <i>S.</i> Typhimurium SL1344, a model strain well-studied in infection research. We combined sequence annotation, optimization methods and in <i>vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experimental data. We used GEM to explore the nutritional requirements, the growth limiting metabolic genes, and the metabolic pathway usage of NTS bacteria in a rich environment simulating the murine gut. This work provides insight and hypotheses on the biochemical capabilities and requirements of SL1344 beyond the knowledge acquired through conventional sequence annotation and can inform future research aimed at better understanding NTS metabolism and identifying potential targets for infection prevention.

                <p>by Evangelos Sigalas, Camilo Libedinsky</p>

The functional properties of a network depend on its connectivity, which includes the strength of its inputs and the strength of the connections between its units, or recurrent connectivity. Because we lack a detailed description of the recurrent connectivity in the lateral prefrontal cortex of primates, we developed an indirect method to estimate it. This method leverages the elevated noise correlation of mutually-connected units. To estimate the connectivity of prefrontal regions, we trained recurrent neural network models with varying percentages of bump attractor connectivity and noise levels to match the noise correlation properties observed in two specific prefrontal regions: the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the frontal eye field. We found that models initialized with approximately 20% and 7.5% bump attractor connectivity closely matched the noise correlation properties of the frontal eye field and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, respectively. These findings suggest that the different percentages of bump attractor connectivity may reflect distinct functional roles of these brain regions. Specifically, lower percentages of bump attractor units, associated with higher-dimensional representations, likely support more abstract neural representations in more anterior regions.

                <p>by Xinyu Han, Kai Song</p>

In microbiome research, data sparsity represents a prevalent and formidable challenge. Sparse data not only compromises the accuracy of statistical analyses but also conceals critical biological relationships, thereby undermining the reliability of the conclusions. To tackle this issue, we introduce a machine learning approach for microbiome data imputation, termed TphPMF. This technique leverages Probabilistic Matrix Factorization, incorporating phylogenetic relationships among microorganisms to establish Bayesian prior distributions. These priors facilitate posterior predictions of potential non-biological zeros. We demonstrate that TphPMF outperforms existing microbiome data imputation methods in accurately recovering missing taxon abundances. Furthermore, TphPMF enhances the efficacy of certain differential abundance analysis methods in detecting differentially abundant (DA) taxa, particularly showing advantages when used in conjunction with DESeq2-phyloseq. Additionally, TphPMF significantly improves the precision of cross-predicting disease conditions in microbiome datasets pertaining to type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer.

                <p>by Callum Gray, Samir Chitnavis, Tamara Buja, Christopher D P Duffy</p>

Oxygenic photosynthesis is responsible for nearly all biomass production on Earth, and may have been a prerequisite for establishing a complex biosphere rich in multicellular life. Life on Earth has evolved to perform photosynthesis in a wide range of light environments, but with a common basic architecture of a light-harvesting <i>antenna</i> system coupled to a photochemical reaction centre. Using a generalized thermodynamic model of light-harvesting, coupled with an evolutionary algorithm, we predict the type of light-harvesting structures that might evolve in light of different intensities and spectral profiles. We reproduce qualitatively the pigment composition, linear absorption profile and structural topology of the antenna systems of multiple types of oxygenic photoautotrophs, suggesting that the same physical principles underlie the development of distinct antenna structures in various light environments. Finally we apply our model to representative light environments that would exist on Earth-like exoplanets, predicting that both oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis could evolve around low mass stars, though the latter would seem to work better around the coolest M-dwarfs. We see this as an interesting first step toward a general evolutionary model of basic biological processes and proof that it is meaningful to hypothesize on the nature of biology beyond Earth.

                <p>by Ruoxu Wang, Mykola Roiuk, Freya Storer, Aurelio A. Teleman, Marc Amoyel</p>

Stem cells have the unique ability among adult cells to give rise to cells of different identities. To do so, they must change gene expression in response to environmental signals. Much work has focused on how transcription is regulated to achieve these changes; however, in many cell types, transcripts and proteins correlate poorly, indicating that post-transcriptional regulation is important. To assess how translational control can influence stem cell fate, we use the <i>Drosophila</i> testis as a model. The testis niche secretes a ligand to activate the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway in two stem cell populations, germline stem cells (GSCs) and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs). We find that global translation rates are high in CySCs and decrease during differentiation, and that JAK/STAT signaling regulates translation. To determine how translation was regulated, we knocked down translation initiation factors and found that the cap binding complex, eIF4F, is dispensable in differentiating cells, but is specifically required in CySCs for self-renewal, acting downstream of JAK/STAT activity. Moreover, we identify eIF3d1 as a key regulator of CySC fate, and show that two eIF3d1 residues subject to regulation by phosphorylation are critical to maintain CySC self-renewal. We further show that Casein Kinase II (CkII), which controls eIF3d1 phosphorylation, influences the binding of eIF3d and eIF4F in mammalian cells, and that CkII expression is sufficient to restore CySC function in the absence of JAK/STAT. We propose a model in which niche signals regulate a specific translation programme in which only some mRNAs are translated. The mechanism we identify allows stem cells to switch between modes of translation, adding a layer of regulation on top of transcription and providing cells with the ability to rapidly change gene expression upon receiving external stimuli.

Many studies have linked genetic variation to behavior, but few connect to the intervening neural circuits that underlie the arc from sensation to action. Here, we used a combination of genome-wide association (GWA), developmental gene expression, and photoreceptor electrophysiology to investigate the architecture of mate choice behavior in <i>Heliconius cydno</i> butterflies, a clade where males identify preferred mates based on wing color patterns. We first found that the GWA variants most strongly associated with male mate choice were tightly linked to the gene controlling wing color in the <i>K</i> locus, consistent with previous mapping efforts. RNA-seq across developmental time points then showed that seven genes near the top GWA peaks were differentially expressed in the eyes, optic lobes, or central brain of white and yellow <i>H. cydno</i> males, many of which have known functions in the development and maintenance of synaptic connections. In the visual system of these butterflies, we identified a striking physiological difference between yellow and white males that could provide an evolutionarily labile circuit motif in the eye to rapidly switch behavioral preference. Using single-cell electrophysiology recordings, we found that some ultraviolet (UV)-sensitive photoreceptors receive inhibition from long-wavelength photoreceptors in the male eye. Surprisingly, the proportion of inhibited UV photoreceptors was strongly correlated with male wing color, suggesting a difference in the early stages of visual processing that could plausibly influence courtship decisions. We discuss potential links between candidate genes and this physiological signature, and suggest future avenues for experimental work. Taken together, our results support the idea that alterations to the evolutionarily labile peripheral nervous system, driven by genetic and gene expression differences, can significantly and rapidly alter essential behaviors.

                <p>by Jelle van den Ameele, Manuel Trauner, Eva Hörmanseder, Alex P. A. Donovan, Oriol Llorà-Batlle, Seth W. Cheetham, Robert Krautz, Rebecca Yakob, Anna Malkowska, John B. Gurdon, Andrea H. Brand</p>

Histone modifications play a key role in regulating gene expression and cell fate during development and disease. Current methods for cell-type-specific genome-wide profiling of histone modifications require dissociation and isolation of cells and are not compatible with all tissue types. Here we adapt Targeted DamID (TaDa) to recognize specific histone marks, by fusing chromatin-binding proteins or single-chain antibodies to Dam, an <i>Escherichia coli</i> DNA adenine methylase. When combined with TaDa, this enables cell-type-specific chromatin profiling in intact tissues or organisms. We first profiled H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27me3 and H4K20me1 in vivo in neural stem cells of the developing <i>Drosophila</i> brain. Next, we mapped cell-type-specific H3K4me3, H3K9ac and H4K20me1 distributions in the developing mouse brain. Finally, we injected RNA encoding DamID constructs into 1-cell stage <i>Xenopus</i> embryos to profile H3K4me3 distribution during gastrulation and neurulation. These results illustrate the versatility of TaDa to profile cell-type-specific histone marks throughout the genome in diverse model systems.

This study addresses this gap by developing an extended Trust-TAM-TPB model, providing a comprehensive framework to analyze digital payment adoption in emerging markets. Methods A quantitative approach was adopted, analyzing survey data from 509 respondents using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The extended model examines both technological factors (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use) and trust-related factors (trust’s influence on behavioral intention via subjective norms, attitude, and perceived behavioral control). Results Findings confirm that trust is a significant determinant of digital payment adoption, influencing both perceived usefulness and subjective norms. However, a negative relationship was found between perceived usefulness (PU) and attitude (ATT), suggesting that while users recognize the benefits of digital payments, their attitudes may still be shaped by traditional cash-based habits and security concerns. These insights challenge traditional TAM assumptions and emphasize the importance of trust in driving adoption. Conclusions This study contributes to technology acceptance literature by integrating trust into the TAM-TPB framework and highlighting its dual role in shaping both perceived usefulness and behavioral intention. Practically, the findings suggest that policymakers and financial institutions should prioritize trust-building strategies, including fraud prevention measures, financial literacy programs, and transparent transaction policies, to accelerate digital payment adoption in developing economies. These insights are particularly relevant for Vietnam’s Northern mountainous regions, where digital payment penetration remains low.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal was to analyze the progression of cerebral edema post-endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in large infarcts and its association with functional outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A secondary analysis of the Endovascular Therapy in Acute Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusive Patients with a Large Infarct Core trial was conducted in patients with large ischemic cores randomized to receive either EVT or medical management (MM) alone. Patients who had follow-up imaging within 7 days post-randomization were involved. The primary outcome was midline shift (MLS). Mediation analysis was performed with EVT as the independent variable, MLS as the mediator, and modified Rankin scale scores at 90 days served as the endpoint. An exploratory analysis was conducted on the progression of net water uptake (ΔNWU).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 434 patients, median age was 66.0 years (standard deviation [SD], 9.9), with 61.3% (266) being males. EVT was associated with an early increase in MLS at 24 (±12) hours after randomization (mean [SD], 3.0 [4.2] vs 2.4 [3.6]mm; <i>p</i> = 0.03) compared with the MM group, partially mediating poorer functional outcomes post-EVT (mediation proportion, −25%; 95% CI, −46.54 to −4.10), but did not negate the overall efficacy of thrombectomy. The progression of NWU remained slower after EVT throughout 7 days, inconsistent with MLS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with large infarct cores, EVT was associated with an early increased mass effect compared with MM, potentially mediating poorer functional outcomes. Despite the evident overall benefits from thrombectomy, accurate prediction and effective anti-edema interventions for the early mass effect post-EVT may further improve outcomes. The complex relationship between NWU and cerebral edema progression warrants further investigation. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Recent methods applying deep learning to model neural activity often rely on “black-box” approaches that lack an interpretable connection between neural activity and network parameters. Here, building on advances in interpretable AI, Tolooshams et al. propose a new method, deconvolutional unrolled neural learning (DUNL), and apply it to several datasets.

                <p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 11 March 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01851-9">doi:10.1038/s41593-024-01851-9</a></p>A new study challenges the classic view of memory consolidation as a delayed, offline process by showing that neural reactivation, which is crucial for memory consolidation, occurs rapidly during awake encoding intervals. These findings suggest that consolidation can occur dynamically in brief, task-related downtimes.

                <p>Scientific Data, Published online: 11 March 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04756-9">doi:10.1038/s41597-025-04756-9</a></p>The CARE Principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) were developed to ensure ethical stewardship of Indigenous data. However, their adaptability makes them an ideal framework for managing data related to vulnerable populations affected by armed conflicts. This essay explores the application of CARE principles to wartime contexts, with a particular focus on internally displaced persons (IDPs) and civilians living under occupation. These groups face significant risks of data misuse, ranging from privacy violations to targeted repression. By adapting CARE, data governance can prioritize safety, dignity, and empowerment while ensuring that data serves the collective welfare of affected communities. Drawing on examples from Indigenous data governance, open science initiatives, and wartime humanitarian challenges, this essay argues for extending CARE principles beyond their original scope. Such an adaptation highlights CARE’s potential as a universal standard for addressing the ethical complexities of data management in humanitarian crises and conflict-affected environments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90511">A neural correlate of individual odor preference in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Behavior varies even among genetically identical animals raised in the same environment. However, little is known about the circuit or anatomical origins of this individuality. Here, we demonstrate a neural correlate of <i>Drosophila</i> odor preference behavior in the olfactory sensory periphery. Namely, idiosyncratic calcium responses in projection neuron (PN) dendrites and densities of the presynaptic protein Bruchpilot in olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axon terminals correlate with individual preferences in a choice between two aversive odorants. The ORN-PN synapse appears to be a locus of individuality where microscale variation gives rise to idiosyncratic behavior. Simulating microscale stochasticity in ORN-PN synapses of a 3062 neuron model of the antennal lobe recapitulates patterns of variation in PN calcium responses matching experiments. Conversely, stochasticity in other compartments of this circuit does not recapitulate those patterns. Our results demonstrate how physiological and microscale structural circuit variations can give rise to individual behavior, even when genetics and environment are held constant.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95010">Unraveling the power of NAP-CNB’s machine learning-enhanced tumor neoantigen prediction</a></h4>

              
                In this study, we present a proof-of-concept classical vaccination experiment that validates the in silico identification of tumor neoantigens (TNAs) using a machine learning-based platform called NAP-CNB. Unlike other TNA predictors, NAP-CNB leverages RNA-seq data to consider the relative expression of neoantigens in tumors. Our experiments show the efficacy of NAP-CNB. Predicted TNAs elicited potent antitumor responses in mice following classical vaccination protocols. Notably, optimal antitumor activity was observed when targeting the antigen with higher expression in the tumor, which was not the most immunogenic. Additionally, the vaccination combining different neoantigens resulted in vastly improved responses compared to each one individually, showing the worth of multiantigen-based approaches. These findings validate NAP-CNB as an innovative TNA identification platform and make a substantial contribution to advancing the next generation of personalized immunotherapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96925">Propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunit B regulates anti-tumor T cells in a pancreatic cancer mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Most human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are not infiltrated with cytotoxic T cells and are highly resistant to immunotherapy. Over 90% of PDAC have oncogenic KRAS mutations, and phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are direct effectors of KRAS. Our previous study demonstrated that ablation of <i>Pik3ca</i> in KPC (<i>Kras</i><sup>G12D</sup>; <i>Trp53</i><sup>R172H</sup>; <i>Pdx1-Cre</i>) pancreatic cancer cells induced host T cells to infiltrate and completely eliminate the tumors in a syngeneic orthotopic implantation mouse model. Now, we show that implantation of <i>Pik3ca</i><sup>−/−</sup> KPC (named αKO) cancer cells induces clonal enrichment of cytotoxic T cells infiltrating the pancreatic tumors. To identify potential molecules that can regulate the activity of these anti-tumor T cells, we conducted an in vivo genome-wide gene-deletion screen using αKO cells implanted in the mouse pancreas. The result shows that deletion of propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunit B gene (<i>Pccb</i>) in αKO cells (named p-αKO) leads to immune evasion, tumor progression, and death of host mice. Surprisingly, p-αKO tumors are still infiltrated with clonally enriched CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but they are inactive against tumor cells. However, blockade of PD-L1/PD1 interaction reactivated these clonally enriched T cells infiltrating p-αKO tumors, leading to slower tumor progression and improve survival of host mice. These results indicate that <i>Pccb</i> can modulate the activity of cytotoxic T cells infiltrating some pancreatic cancers and this understanding may lead to improvement in immunotherapy for this difficult-to-treat cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98704">A delta-tubulin/epsilon-tubulin/Ted protein complex is required for centriole architecture</a></h4>

              
                Centrioles have a unique, conserved architecture formed by three linked, ‘triplet’, microtubules arranged in ninefold symmetry. The mechanisms by which these triplet microtubules are formed remain unclear but likely involve the noncanonical tubulins delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin. Previously, we found that human cells lacking delta-tubulin or epsilon-tubulin form abnormal centrioles, characterized by an absence of triplet microtubules, lack of central core protein POC5, and a futile cycle of centriole formation and disintegration (Wang et al., 2017). Here, we show that human cells lacking either TEDC1 or TEDC2 have similar abnormalities. Using ultrastructure expansion microscopy, we observed that mutant centrioles elongate to the same length as control centrioles in G2 phase and fail to recruit central core scaffold proteins. Remarkably, mutant centrioles also have an expanded proximal region. During mitosis, these mutant centrioles further elongate before fragmenting and disintegrating. All four proteins physically interact and TEDC1 and TEDC2 can form a subcomplex in the absence of the tubulins, supporting an AlphaFold Multimer model of the tetramer. TEDC1 and TEDC2 localize to centrosomes and are mutually dependent on each other and on delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin for localization. Our results demonstrate that delta-tubulin, epsilon-tubulin, TEDC1, and TEDC2 function together to promote robust centriole architecture, laying the foundation for future studies on the mechanisms underlying the assembly of triplet microtubules and their interactions with centriole structure.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101173">Translatome analysis reveals cellular network in DLK-dependent hippocampal glutamatergic neuron degeneration</a></h4>

              
                The conserved MAP3K12/Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase (DLK) plays versatile roles in neuronal development, axon injury and stress responses, and neurodegeneration, depending on cell-type and cellular contexts. Emerging evidence implicates abnormal DLK signaling in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, our understanding of the DLK-dependent gene network in the central nervous system remains limited. Here, we investigated the roles of DLK in hippocampal glutamatergic neurons using conditional knockout and induced overexpression mice. We found that dorsal CA1 and dentate gyrus neurons are vulnerable to elevated expression of DLK, while CA3 neurons appear less vulnerable. We identified the DLK-dependent translatome that includes conserved molecular signatures and displays cell-type specificity. Increasing DLK signaling is associated with disruptions to microtubules, potentially involving STMN4. Additionally, primary cultured hippocampal neurons expressing different levels of DLK show altered neurite outgrowth, axon specification, and synapse formation. The identification of translational targets of DLK in hippocampal glutamatergic neurons has relevance to our understanding of selective neuron vulnerability under stress and pathological conditions.

">An alternative explanation for reported integration and competition between space and time in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal place and time cells are thought to be part of the brain's spatial and temporal representation. In the article 'Integration and competition between space and time in the hippocampus', Chen et al. showed that hippocampal neurons with mixed selectivity for space and time shift their firing fields depending on the animal's speed. Here, we reproduce this phenomenon with a simple continuous line attractor that only integrates the animal's velocity. Since our model has no genuine time-encoding capabilities, it constitutes an alternative explanation for Chen et al. findings and challenges the claim that the observed firing field shifts are sufficient evidence for a competitive and integrated representation of space-time, as the authors suggested.

">The relationship between cortisol, grid-like representations and path integration</a></h4>

              
                Acute stress triggers the release of cortisol, which broadly affects cognitive processes. Path integration, a specific navigational process, relies heavily on grid cells in the entorhinal cortex (EC). The EC contains glucocorticoid receptors and is therefore likely to be influenced by cortisol, though little is known about this relationship. Given the role of the EC in neurological diseases such as Alzheimers Disease, investigating the effects of cortisol on this brain region may offer insights into how stress affects these diseases. In this study, we examined the effects of cortisol on human path integration in thirty-nine healthy participants across two sessions. On each day, they received either 20mg cortisol or a placebo and performed a virtual homing task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Cortisol markedly impaired path integration performance, independent of path distance or the presence of spatial cues. Additionally, cortisol altered navigational strategies, leading participants to navigate further away from landmarks, which was associated with worse performance. FMRI results showed that cortisol increased the activation of right caudate nucleus in the presence of landmarks. Using a representational similarity analysis, we observed grid-like representations in the right posterior-medial EC specifically on day one under placebo, but these were diminished by cortisol. Grid-like representations facilitated performance over short distances but hindered it over longer ones, suggesting that grid cells support PI specifically in case of short trajectories. Overall, the study indicates that cortisol-induced disruption in grid cell function in the EC may underly stress effects on path integration.

">Frequency-Specific Resting-State MEG Network Characteristics of Tinnitus Patients Revealed by Graph Learning</a></h4>

              
                Tinnitus, the perception of sound without an external source, affects a significant portion of the population, yet its impact on brain communication diagram known as the functional connectome, remains limited. Traditional functional connectivity (FC) methods, such as Pearson correlation, phase lag index and coherence rely on pairwise comparisons and are therefore limited in providing a holistic encoding of FC. Here, we employ an alternative approach to estimate the entire connectivity structure by analyzing all time-courses simultaneously. This approach is robust even for short-duration recordings, facilitating faster functional connectome identification and real-time applications. Using resting-state MEG recordings from controls and individuals with tinnitus, we demonstrated that the learned connectomes outperform correlation-based connectomes in fingerprinting, that is, identifying an individual from test-retest acquisitions. Group-level analysis revealed distinct altered FC in tinnitus across multiple frequency bands, affecting the default mode, auditory, visual, and salience networks, suggesting a reorganization of these large-scale networks beyond auditory areas. Our study reveals that tinnitus presents highly individualized and heterogeneous whole-brain connectome profiles, highlighting the need to focus on individual variability rather than group-level differences to gain a more nuanced understanding of tinnitus. Personalized FC could enable patient-specific tinnitus models, optimizing treatment strategies for individualized care.

">Direct cerebellar control over motor production in a species with extreme cerebellar enlargement</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum is thought to fine-tune movement without being required for its production. However, this textbook view derives mainly from studies of mammalian species with highly developed cerebral cortices. Here we examined cerebellar function in the elephant-nose fish, a member of a family of African weakly electric fish (Mormyridae) in which the cerebellum is massively enlarged. The elephant-nose fish is named for a flexible facial appendage that is used to probe surfaces and extract prey from substrate. Results from microstimulation, electrophysiological recordings, and lesions support a direct role for the C1 region of the mormyrid cerebellum in controlling movement of this appendage. These findings suggest that the cerebellum is capable of performing functions typically ascribed to the cerebral cortex, emphasizing the importance of evolutionary history on the functional specialization of brain regions.

">The intrinsic cortical geometry of reading</a></h4>

              
                Reading involves dual streams of sensory propagation that lie within a broader sensory-to-transmodal hierarchy. This study explores whether individual differences in this functional organization can be explained by cortical geometry. Through a modified connectome predictive modeling approach, we identified cortical distances (CD) measured along the cortical surface that predict reading performance. We found that interindividual variation in CD robustly predicts reading performance comparably to functional connectivity (FC). Moreover, combining CD and FC outperforms single-modality models, indicating that these measures offer complementary perspectives of cortical organization. Notably, the geodesic distances that drive our predictions align with the spatial layout of the dual-route hypothesis of reading. We note that within these streams, reading performance is predicted by shorter distances between the visual cortex and higher-order transmodal regions. We thus show how the geometry underlying reading supports an emerging hypothesis that individual differences in cortical geometry shape how we think and act.

">Synaptic Gpr85 influences cerebellar granule cells electrical properties and light-induced behavior.</a></h4>

              
                GPR85/SREB2 is an exceptionally well-conserved orphan 7TM receptor with unclear biological attributes. In this study, we used several zebrafish genetic models to investigate Gpr85 properties and functions throughout development and adulthood. We describe that, like in mammals, gpr85 is expressed by various neuronal populations throughout zebrafish development and adulthood in the central nervous system, retina and intestine. The overexpression of a fluorochrome-tagged version of the receptor in gpr85-expressing neurons provides the first in vivo evidence that Gpr85 is enriched at the synaptic level in the brain and retina. Transcriptomic analysis of Gpr85 knock-out zebrafish cerebellar granule cells revealed changes in gene expression related to enhanced neuronal activity. Further investigations using ex vivo cerebellar slices demonstrate that the electrophysiological activity of Gpr85 deficient granule cells are increased. We also observed that Gpr85 deficient larvae exhibit enhanced light-triggered startle responses in dark/light paradigm behavioral experiments. Altogether, our results provide evidence that, in zebrafish, Gpr85 is enriched at the synaptic level in vivo and influences granule cell electrophysiological properties as well as light-triggered motor responses.

">An intrinsic neuronal manifold underlies brain-wide hierarchical organization of behavior in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale neuronal recordings have revealed complex behavior-related activity patterns. Surprisingly, these patterns are broadly distributed across brain regions, including sensory areas. The origins and functions of such activity patterns are incompletely understood. Using whole-brain imaging in freely behaving C. elegans, we find rich and distributed brain activity. Within these dynamics, a low dimensional manifold encodes the major action sequence of C. elegans. This manifold originates largely from intrinsic dynamics, with minor contributions from movement-induced sensations. Moreover, multiple neurons encode faster time-scale motor patterns that are gated by the manifold, meaning that they selectively encode behavior during specific brain states. We therefore propose that one function of brain-wide dynamics is to enable hierarchical organization of behavior: information about major actions is broadcast via a distributed manifold, which enables the hierarchical nesting of granular motor patterns within those major actions.

">Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation of the anterior temporal lobe enhances semantic memory by modulating brain morphology, neurochemistry and neural dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Understanding neural functioning and plasticity of the brain is a fundamental goal of neuroscience. The ventromedial anterior temporal lobe (ATL) has been suggested as the centre-point of a core transmodal hub for semantic memory, playing a crucial role in the representation of coherent conceptual knowledge. However, non-invasive direct modulation of the ventromedial ATL has remained challenging. Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is an emerging neuromodulatory technique that delivers acoustic energy with high spatial precision, making it uniquely suited for targeting deep brain structures non-invasively. In this study, we investigated whether theta-burst TUS (tbTUS) to the ventromedial ATL could enhance semantic memory performance in the adult brain. Using a multimodal neuroimaging approach, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), functional MRI (fMRI), and voxel-based morphometry (VBM), we assessed tbTUS-induced changes in neurochemical concentrations, functional network connectivity, structural plasticity, and semantic memory performance. Compared to control stimulation (ventricle), tbTUS at the ventromedial ATL significantly improved semantic task performance in healthy individuals. MRS analysis revealed that tbTUS decreased GABA and increased Glx levels, reflecting shifts in excitation-inhibition balance. Additionally, tbTUS increased neurometabolites in the ATL, including NAA, creatine and choline, suggesting enhanced neuronal function and metabolism. fMRI analysis demonstrated that tbTUS reduced task-induced regional activity in the ATL and functionally connected semantic regions, while also enhancing intrinsic and effective connectivity across the semantic network. Structural analysis revealed increased grey matter volume in the ATL following tbTUS compared to control stimulation. These findings provide the first convergent evidence that tbTUS can modulate neurochemistry, functional dynamics, and brain morphology to enhance semantic memory function. Our results highlight TUS as a powerful neuromodulatory tool with potential applications in cognitive enhancement and neurorehabilitation, offering a promising intervention for dementia and neurodegenerative disorders.

">Ultrasound Directly Activates Sparse Neurons and Modulates Visual Circuits in Deafened Mice</a></h4>

              
                Focused ultrasound neuromodulation (FUN) is widely regarded as a next-generation technology for neural modulation, with applications spanning rodents, non-human primates, and humans. While mechanistic studies are advancing, a persistent confound-auditory interference-casts doubt on whether ultrasound exerts direct mechanical effects or merely indirect auditory responses. To resolve this, we engineered a circular ultrasound transducer compatible with two-photon calcium imaging and examined its effects on the primary visual cortex (V1) of surgically deafened mice, eliminating auditory contributions. Our results reveal that ultrasound directly activates a sparse subset of ultrasound-sensitive neurons (USSN) (response rate >30%) in V1, comprising only a small fraction of the total population and exhibiting a spatially sparse distribution. The proportion of USSN scale with ultrasound pressure, confirming a direct neuromodulatory effect independent of audition. Intriguingly, despite this sparse activation, ultrasound significantly modulates V1 circuitry: it alters the dynamics of light-sensitive neurons (LSN), with subsets showing excitation, inhibition, or no change in response to visual stimuli. These findings provide the first rigorous in-vivo evidence that FUN induces direct mechanical effects on neural activity, disentangling them from auditory confounds. By demonstrating both the specificity and broader circuit-level impact of ultrasound in deafened mice, this study reframes our understanding of FUN's mechanisms and strengthens its potential as a precise neuromodulatory tool.

">ARIH1 deficiency impairs spatial learning and memory via GIRK2 upregulation in hippocampal CaMKII-expressing neurons in mice</a></h4>

              
                Alterations of Ariadne RBR E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase 1 (ARIH1), a human homologue of Drosophila Ari, have been associated with a number of human diseases. Given the importance of ubiquitin-proteasome system in learning and memory, whether ARIH1 involves in the process has not been explored. Here we report that ARIH1-deficent mice exhibited a defect in learning and memory evidenced in Morris water maze and in novel object recognition tests without changes in basal motor activity, anxiety, and depressive behaviors. We found that ARIH1 deficiency resulted in an upregulation of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel 2 (GIRK2) in dorsal hippocampus that was attributed to the impaired ubiquitination and degradation. Locally injection of ARIH1-expressing lentivirus to restore the ARIH1 expression of dorsal hippocampus in ARIH1+/- mice restored the impaired learning and memory. Moreover, selective knockdown ARIH1 in dorsal hippocampal calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)-expressing neurons, but not for parvalbumin+ (PV) or somatostatin+ (SST) neurons, in naive mice was sufficient to mimic the damage in learning and memory of ARIH1+/- mice. Lastly, we demonstrated that systemically or locally inhibition of GIRK activity was able to improve ARIH1 deficiency-induced decline of learning and memory in ARIH1+/- mice. The present study discovered the clear role of ARIH1 in mediating learning and memory, defect of ARIH1 resulted in upregulation of GIRK2 in hippocampal CaMKII-expressing neurons via modulating the ubiquitination and degradation GIRK2.

">The extremely low mechanical force generated by nano-pulling induces global changes in the microtubule network, nuclear morphology, and chromatin transcription in neurons</a></h4>

              
                Mechanical force plays a pivotal role in every aspect of axon development. In this paper, we explore the use of nano-pulling, a technology that enables the intracellular generation of extremely low mechanical forces. We demonstrate that force-mediated axon growth also exerts global effects that extend to the nuclear level. Our mechanistic studies support a model in which exogenous forces induce stabilization of microtubules, and a significant remodeling of perinuclear microtubules, which preferentially align perpendicularly to the nuclear envelope. We observed an increase in the lateral tension of the nucleus, leading to substantial remodelling of nuclear morphology, characterized by an increase in nuclear grooves and higher sphericity index (indicating less flattened nuclei). Notably, these changes in nuclear shape are linked to chromatin remodelling, resulting in global transcriptional activation.

">Limitations of Dynamic Causal Modelling for Multistable Cortical Circuits</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) has been used extensively for inferring effective connectivity from neuroimaging data. However, it is unclear whether the DCM approach can reveal neural circuits with multistable dynamic states with global dynamical structures. In this work, we used excitatory-inhibitory cortical columnar neural mass models endowed with multistable dynamical states as ground truths to evaluate whether DCM can accurately identify their models' architecture and connectivity strengths. Specifically, we simulated three recurrently connected neural mass models with different types of multistability, and generated local field potential data for DCM. The first model has bistable fixed points and exhibiting binary decision-making behaviour, and the second model has co-existence of two stable oscillatory frequencies (period doubling). The third model exhibits deterministic chaos, with a continuum of confined states. For each of the three models, DCM's Bayesian model selection was able to correctly identify the correct model architecture among various options in model space. However, DCM's Bayesian model averaging of the winning model was unable to accurately elucidate all the models' extrinsic connectivity strengths, leading to the behaviours of the reconstructed models to differ substantially from their corresponding ground-truth models. Further, we found DCM's estimation was highly sensitive to the sampling frequency used during its training. Overall, this work reveals the limitations of DCM in evaluating complex, multistable neural dynamical states and hence caution its use under these conditions.

">Psychedelics Align Brain Activity with Context</a></h4>

              
                Psychedelics can profoundly alter consciousness by reorganising brain connectivity; however, their effects are context-sensitive. To understand how this reorganisation depends on the context, we collected and comprehensively analysed the largest psychedelic neuroimaging dataset to date. Sixty-two adults were scanned with fMRI and EEG during rest and naturalistic stimuli (meditation, music, and visual), before and after ingesting 19 mg of psilocybin. Half of the participants ranked the experience among the five most meaningful of their lives. Under psilocybin, fMRI and EEG signals recorded during eyes-closed conditions became similar to those recorded during an eyes-open condition. This change manifested as an increase in global functional connectivity in associative regions and a decrease in sensory areas. For the first time, we used machine learning to directly link the subjective effects of psychedelics to neural activity patterns characterised by low-dimensional embeddings. We show that psilocybin reorganised these low-dimensional trajectories into cohesive patterns of brain activity that were structured by context and quality of subjective experience, with stronger self- and boundary-related effects - which were linked to day-after mindset changes - leading to more structured and distinct neural representations. This reorganisation induces a state of 'embeddedness' - a coherent integration of brain networks that normally segregate internal and external processing - dissolving perceptual boundaries in a way that aligns neural dynamics with context. Beyond its transient expression, embeddedness serves as a construct for understanding the subjective and therapeutic effects of psychedelics. These findings provide a new account of the large-scale neurocognitive effects of psychedelics and demonstrate the utility of using machine learning methods in assessing state- and context-dependent neural dynamics and their association with psychological outcomes.

">Inhibitory effects of dopamine agonists on pain-responsive neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is a heterogenous region of primarily GABAergic neurons that contributes to numerous behaviors, including fear learning, feeding, reward, and pain. Dopaminergic inputs to the CeA have been shown to regulate many of these behaviors, but how dopamine exerts these effects at the cellular level has not been well characterized. We used the Targeted Recombination in Active Populations (TRAP) mouse line to fluorescently label pain-responsive CeA neurons, and then targeted these cells for patch-clamp recordings in acute slices to test the effects of dopamine agonists. The D1 agonist SKF-38393 and D2 agonist quinpirole both had inhibitory effects, reducing the input resistance and evoked firing and increasing rheobase of labeled CeA neurons. Both agents also inhibited the NMDA component of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked by basolateral amygdala (BLA) stimulation, but did not affect the AMPA component. D1 activation, but not D2, also appeared to have a presynaptic effect, increasing the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs. These results provide new insights into how dopamine regulates activity within pain-responsive CeA networks.

">Paradoxical ventral tegmental area GABA signaling drives enhanced morphine reward after adolescent nicotine</a></h4>

              
                Background: An important yet poorly understood risk factor for opioid use disorder is adolescent nicotine use. We investigated the neural mechanisms underlying this understudied interaction. Methods: Male and female adolescent mice received two-weeks of nicotine water (Adol Nic) or plain water (Adol Water). In adulthood, mice underwent three morphine tests: conditioned place preference (CPP), locomotor sensitization, and two-bottle choice. Ex vivo ventral tegmental area (VTA) brain slices were assessed via patch clamp for GABA and dopamine (DA) neuron morphine responses. Finally, VTA GABA neurons were chemogenetically inhibited during morphine CPP. Results: In adulthood, Adol Nic mice had greater morphine CPP, more morphine locomotor sensitization, and more choice-based oral morphine consumption vs. Adol Water mice. In contrast, adult mice given nicotine vs. water had similar morphine CPP. Patch clamp analysis of VTA neurons from adult Adol Water mice showed canonical cell-type responses to bath-applied morphine: fewer action potentials in GABA neurons and more in DA neurons. Paradoxically, VTA GABA and DA neurons from adult Adol Nic mice did not show these morphine responses. In support of a causal relationship between GABA neuron firing and reward behavior, chemogenetic inhibition of VTA GABA neurons in Adol Water mice during pairing increased morphine CPP. In contrast, inhibition of VTA GABA neurons in Adol Nic mice brought morphine CPP down to control levels. Conclusions: These data reveal an electrophysiological mechanism by which adolescent nicotine intake promotes morphine reward later in life, showing that adolescent nicotine exposure alters reward circuitry well into adulthood.

                Characterization of cell type emergence during human cortical development, which enables unique human cognition, has focused primarily on anatomical and transcriptional characterizations. Metabolic processes in the human brain that allow for rapid expansion, but contribute to vulnerability to neurodevelopmental disorders, remain largely unexplored. We performed a variety of metabolic assays in primary tissue and stem cell derived cortical organoids and observed dynamic changes in core metabolic functions, including an unexpected increase in glycolysis during late neurogenesis. By depleting glucose levels in cortical organoids, we increased outer radial glia, astrocytes, and inhibitory neurons. We found the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) was impacted in these experiments and leveraged pharmacological and genetic manipulations to recapitulate these radial glia cell fate changes. These data identify a new role for the PPP in modulating radial glia cell fate specification and generate a resource for future exploration of additional metabolic pathways in human cortical development.

Here we report that a single systemic administration of the serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin can durably promote social behaviour in the Cntnap2-knockout mouse model of autism. This effect can be blocked by pharmacological inhibition of DNA methyltransferase I, indicating an epigenetic mechanism underlying the long-lasting effect of psilocybin.

">Local and distributed information coding in the ventral stream</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscience is awash with studies showing how virtually every cognitive or neural function is distributed across many regions. Yet, it is left unclear whether findings of widespread information processing imply large-scale integrative computations or instead should be seen as showing multitudes of localized modules. To investigate this distinction, we used fMRI data (N=60) from participants viewing objects across four tasks, and we examined the relationships between regions in terms of information coding. We demonstrate that coding in the occipital lobe is overwhelmingly localized and small-scale population codes are the foundation of early perceptual representation. In contrast, different portions of the inferior temporal lobe coordinate as a distributed unit to produce multi-regional population codes for semantic information. No other brain area, neither the parietal nor prefrontal cortices, shows the preference for distributed coding seen in the inferior temporal lobe. The inferior temporal lobe additionally displays uniquely low levels of redundancy in its information coding across its constituent regions, and we demonstrate how this supports lobe-wide semantic processing. Taken together, these results outline a framework of how the ventral stream transitions from local to distributed neuronal coding as information progresses from perceptual to semantic representations.

">A functional anatomical shift from the lateral frontal pole to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in emotion action control underpins elevated levels of anxiety: partial replication and generalization of Bramson et al., 2023</a></h4>

              
                Flexible control over emotional behavior represents a promising target for novel interventions for mental disorders. Accumulating evidence has indicated a key role of the lateral frontal pole (FPl) and its connections with other cortical and subcortical systems in emotional action regulation. A recent study from Bramson et al., (2023) employed a multi-modal neuroimaging approach to demonstrate a functional-anatomical shift from FPI to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in a sample of anxious individuals during emotional action control. While these findings might represent a venue for interventions in anxiety disorders, conventional neuroimaging strategies are often limited with respect to generalizability and reproducibility. Against this background we capitalized previous large-scale fMRI data in n = 250 participants using an affective linguistic Go/NoGo paradigm to examine the robustness of the reported associations with trait social anxiety across samples, cultures and paradigms. Additionally, context-dependent functional connectivity patterns were explored to examine action control in different emotional contexts. In line with previous study, we found no difference between high- and non-anxious group on the behavioral congruency-effect. The neural results showed that non-social anxious group engaged the left FPl while the high-social anxious group specifically recruited the DLPFC, however in the absence of significant between-group differences. Importantly, the level of trait social anxiety was significantly positively related with DLPFC activity and negatively with left FPl activation across groups. Furthermore, context-dependent functional connectivity analyses revealed a negative context-specific neural shift from the sgACC-FPl to sgACC-DLPFC specifically in the high anxiety group. Together, the present study employed a different task paradigm, population and analytic methods, partially replicated the findings described by Bramson et al., (2023) and additionally determined context-specific changes in the communication with the sgACC in high anxiety. The findings provide further evidence for target-based interventions of persistent emotional control deficits in anxiety disorders.

">Towards an informed choice of diffusion MRI image contrasts for cerebellar segmentation</a></h4>

              
                The fine-grained segmentation of cerebellar structures is an essential step towards supplying increasingly accurate anatomically informed analyses, including, for example, white matter diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tractography. Cerebellar tissue segmentation is typically performed on structural magnetic resonance imaging data, such as T1-weighted data, while connectivity between segmented regions is mapped using diffusion MRI tractography data. Small deviations in structural to diffusion MRI data co-registration may negatively impact connectivity analyses. Reliable segmentation of brain tissue performed directly on diffusion MRI data helps to circumvent such inaccuracies. Diffusion MRI enables the computation of many image contrasts, including a variety of tissue microstructure maps. While multiple methods have been proposed for the segmentation of cerebellar structures using diffusion MRI, little attention has been paid to the systematic evaluation of the performance of different available input image contrasts for the segmentation task. In this work, we evaluate and compare the segmentation performance of diffusion MRI-derived contrasts on the cerebellar segmentation task. Specifically, we include spherical mean (diffusion-weighted image average) and b0 (non-diffusion-weighted image average) contrasts, local signal parameterization contrasts (diffusion tensor and kurtosis fit maps), and the structural T1-weighted MRI contrast that is most commonly employed for the task. We train a popular deep-learning architecture using a publicly available dataset (HCP-YA), leveraging cerebellar region labels from the atlas-based SUIT cerebellar segmentation pipeline. By training and testing using many diffusion-MRI-derived image inputs, we find that the spherical mean image computed from b=1000 s/mm2 shell data provides stable performance across different metrics and significantly outperforms the tissue microstructure contrasts that are traditionally used in machine learning segmentation methods for diffusion MRI.

">High throughput identification of genetic regulators of microglial inflammatory processes in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over a hundred genetic risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD), many of which are predominantly expressed in microglia. However, the pathogenic role for most of them remains unclear. To systematically investigate how AD GWAS variants influence human microglial inflammatory responses, we conducted CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) screens targeting 119 AD GWAS hits in hiPSC-derived microglia (iMGLs) and used the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to the viral mimic poly(I:C) as a functional readout. Top hits whose knockdown either increased or decreased ROS levels in response to poly(I:C) were further analyzed using Perturb-seq to integrate CRISPRi with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). This analysis identified 9 unique microglial clusters, including a poly(I:C)-driven inflammatory cluster 2. Emerging evidence supports a pathogenic role of viral infections in AD and cross comparison of our scRNA-seq data with iMGLs xenotransplanted into an AD mouse model shows significant overlap between our clusters and AD-relevant microglial clusters. Knockdown of MS4A6A and EED, which resulted in elevated ROS production in the presence of poly(I:C), increased the proportion of cluster 2 cells and induced functionally related changes in gene expression. In addition, KD of MS4A6 led to a reduction in the proportion of iMGLs in the DAM (disease associated microglia) cluster under all conditions, suggesting that this gene may modulate the DAM response. In contrast, KD of INPP5D or RAPEP1 which lead to low levels of ROS in the presence of poly(I:C), did not significantly affect the proportion of cells in cluster 2 but rather shaped the inflammatory response. This included the upregulation of an HLA-associated inflammatory cluster (cluster 6) by INPP5D knockdown under all conditions, independent of poly(I:C) stimulation. Importantly, KD of INPP5D or RAPEP1 had many shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under both vehicle and poly(I:C) treated conditions. Overall, our findings demonstrate that despite the diverse biological functions of AD GWAS variants, they converge functionally to regulate human microglial states and shape inflammatory responses relevant to AD pathology.

">Expectation management in humans and LLMs</a></h4>

              
                Mirative markers, such as "surprisingly", explicitly encode a violation of expectations. Such markers are used for expectation management during communication. Sensitivity to mirative markers relies on two abilities: i) updating expectations upon recognizing a mirative marker, and ii) identifying expectation violations warranting the use of a mirative marker. In this study we compared sensitivity to mirative markers in humans and large language models (LLMs). In part 1, we used a sentence-completion task, where humans and LLMs were presented with sentence fragments and asked to continue them. Results show that for both humans and LLMs, the presence of a mirative marker significantly increased response entropy and decreased top response probability, in line with theoretical proposals for mirative markers. In part 2, we created a novel task of mirative polarity selection where humans and LLMs are presented with a sentence pair and asked to select whether it was connected by a mirative marker ("surprisingly") or an anti-mirative marker ("unsurprisingly"). Results show that LLMs perform at an impressive human level. We conclude that both humans and LLMs use mirative markers as cues for calibrating their subsequent expectations during sentence processing.

">Inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway in astrocytes facilitates amyloid-β clearance by kallikrein-related peptidase 7</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-{beta} peptide (A{beta}). Decreased A{beta} clearance is observed in sporadic AD patients, suggesting that enhancing A{beta} clearance is a potential therapeutic approach for AD. We identified kallikrein-related peptidase 7 (KLK7) as an astrocyte-derived A{beta}-degrading protease, and its mRNA expression is reduced in AD brains. Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, upregulates KLK7 expression in astrocytes; however, the regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that the NMDA receptor signaling negatively regulates KLK7 mRNA expression via nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B). Inhibition of NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway in astrocytes increases KLK7 expression and promotes A{beta} degradation. Moreover, the mRNA expression level of the NF-{kappa}B family is elevated in AD brains and shows a negative correlation with KLK7 mRNA expression. Finally, the injection of an NF-{kappa}B inhibitor significantly upregulates Klk7 expression and reduces A{beta} levels in vivo. These findings suggest that the NMDA receptor-NF-{kappa}B signaling axis in astrocytes negatively regulates KLK7 expression and modulates KLK7-mediated A{beta} clearance.

">Diffusion MRI microstructure markers of changes in the human brain across the lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain develops, matures, ages, and declines is one of the fundamental questions facing neuroscience. Recent advances in diffusion MRI microstructure analysis have allowed for detailed descriptions of neuronal change in humans. However, it is essential that findings from these studies are appropriately contextualized to general age-related changes in the brain. This study uses 3-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution (3T-CSD) to examine the relationship between brain diffusion microstructure and chronological age. 3T-CSD is able to quantify signal fraction measurements at the voxel-wise level from three different tissue microenvironments found in the brain: extracellular free water, intracellular isotropic, and intracellular anisotropic. This study applies 3T-CSD analysis to the Nathanial Kline Institute's Rockland cohort, a large-scale community sample of brain MRI data across the lifespan. Microstructural measurements were taken in a number of structures throughout the white matter, subcortical gray matter, and lobar cortical regions while additionally evaluating lateral differences in microstructural measurements. The general trajectory of signal fraction measurements was a positive relationship with age and extracellular signal fraction, a negative relationship between age and intracellular isotropic signal fraction, and an inverted U-shaped trajectory for the intracellular anisotropic signal fraction. In individual sub-areas these trends tended to still be present, with some notable exceptions. However there were large differences in 3T-CSD microstructure measurements between individual structures, including significant lateral differences between hemispheres for each of the subcortical gray matter structures and for each of the cortical regions. These results demonstrate that 3T-CSD is able to describe age-related change across the brain and lifespan. By using a healthy population cohort this study can be used as a point of comparison for 3T-CSD analysis of microstructure changes in the presence of pathology. Finally, the detailed analysis of lateralized ROI results can inform diffusion microstructure studies examining cortical and subcortical regions.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The sense of agency, the feeling of being the author of one’s actions and outcomes, is critical for decision-making. While prior research has explored its neural correlates, most studies have focused on neutral tasks, overlooking moral decision-making. In addition, previous studies mainly used convenience samples, ignoring that some social environments may influence how authorship in moral decision-making is processed. This study investigated the neural correlates of sense of agency in civilians and military officer cadets, examining free and coerced choices in both agent and commander roles. Using a functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm where participants could either freely choose or follow orders to inflict a mild shock on a victim, we assessed sense of agency through temporal binding—a temporal distortion between voluntary and less voluntary decisions. Our findings suggested that sense of agency is reduced when following orders compared to acting freely in both roles. Several brain regions correlated with temporal binding, notably the occipital lobe, superior/middle/inferior frontal gyrus, precuneus, and lateral occipital cortex. Importantly, no differences emerged between military and civilians at corrected thresholds, suggesting that daily environments have minimal influence on the neural basis of moral decision-making, enhancing the generalizability of the findings.</span>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Chronotypes significantly influence sleep quality, daily performance, and overall activity levels. Although there is growing evidence indicating that individuals with a late chronotype are more likely to experience cognitive decline, the specific neural mechanisms that contribute to this risk remain unclear. This study aims to explore the relationship between morning and evening preferences and the volumes of subcortical structures in a young, healthy population. Methods: A total of 123 participants (80 females), aged between 18 and 35 years, were recruited. They underwent MRI scans and completed several self-reported assessments, including the morningness&amp;amp;ndash;eveningness scale of the Chronotype Questionnaire (ChQ-ME), the amplitude scale of the Chronotype Questionnaire (ChQ-AM), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Participants were classified into early chronotype (EC) and late chronotype (LC) groups based on their ChQ-ME scores. High-resolution T1-weighted imaging was utilized to analyze the volumes of subcortical structures and hippocampal subfields. Results: The volumetric analysis indicated that the LC group showed significant reductions in the right Caudate (p = 0.03) and the left SR-SL-SM (p = 0.03) compared to the EC group. Additionally, a notable leftward hemispheric laterality of the Subiculum (p = 0.048) was observed in the EC group relative to the LC group. Furthermore, the ChQ-AM revealed significant positive (r = 0.23) and negative (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.19) correlations with the volumes of the left thalamus and right amygdala, respectively. The PSQI demonstrated a significant negative correlation (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.21) with the right SR-SL-SM, while the ESS indicated a significant positive correlation (r = 0.24) with the left SR-SL-SM. Multiple regression analysis indicated that variations in daytime sleepiness are linked to the change of the left SR-SL-SM volume. Conclusions: Overall, the findings suggest that chronotype preferences are associated with the changes in the volumes of subcortical structures and hippocampal subfields and highlight the role of chronotypes in the neural mechanisms of these brain structures.</p>

	<p>As the final product of glycolysis, lactate serves as an energy substrate, metabolite, and signaling molecule in various diseases and mediates lactylation, an epigenetic modification that occurs under both physiological and pathological conditions. Lactylation is a crucial mechanism by which lactate exerts its functions, participating in vital biological activities such as glycolysis-related cellular functions, macrophage polarization, and nervous system regulation. Lactylation links metabolic regulation to central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, acute ischemic stroke, and schizophrenia, revealing the diverse functions of lactylation in the CNS. In the future, further exploration of lactylation-associated enzymes and proteins is needed to develop specific lactylation inhibitors or activators, which could provide new tools and strategies for the treatment of CNS diseases.</p>

	<p>Background: Astrocytes play a key role in the inflammatory process accompanying various neurological diseases. Extracellular ATP accompanies inflammatory processes in the brain, but its effect on lipid mediators (oxylipins) in astrocytes remains elusive. Metformin is a hypoglycemic drug with an anti-inflammatory effect that has been actively investigated in the context of therapy for neuroinflammation, but its mechanisms of action are not fully elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the effects of ATP on inflammatory markers and oxylipin profiles; determine the dependence of these effects on the adaptation of astrocytes to high glucose levels; and evaluate the possibility of modulating ATP effects using metformin. Methods: We estimated the ATP-mediated response of primary rat astrocytes cultured at normal (NG, 5 mM) and high (HG, 22.5 mM) glucose concentrations for 48 h before stimulation. Cell responses were assessed by monitoring changes in the expression of inflammatory markers (TNF&amp;amp;alpha;, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, iNOS, and COX-2) and the synthesis of oxylipins (41 compounds), assayed with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Intracellular pathways were assessed by analyzing the phosphorylation of p38; ERK MAPK; transcription factors STAT3 and NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B; and the enzymes mediating oxylipin synthesis, COX-1 and cPLA2. Results: The stimulation of cells with ATP does not affect the expression of pro-inflammatory markers, increases the activities of p38 and ERK MAPKs, and activates oxylipin synthesis, shifting the profiles toward an increase in anti-inflammatory compounds (PGD2, PGA2, 12-HHT, and 18-HEPE). The ATP effects are reduced in HG astrocytes. Metformin potentiated ATP-induced oxylipin synthesis (11-HETE, PGD2, 12-HHT, 15-HETE, 13-HDoHE, and 15-HETrE), which was predominantly evident in NG cells. Conclusions: Our data provide new evidence showing that ATP induces the release of anti-inflammatory oxylipins, and metformin enhances these effects. These results should be considered in the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating astrocyte function in various pathologies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-59/v2?src=rss">Thoroughness of philosophy and return to religion in Tanabe Hajime [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Japanese philosopher Tanabe Hajime (1885–1962) not only discussed religion in ways that were rooted in the fundamental claims of his writings, such as Shinran in Philosophy as Metanoetics (1946), but he also made proposals on religion, as in Demonstration of Christianity (1948), where he advocated for the need for a “second religious reformation.” For Tanabe, philosophy and religion (along with science) are fused in a specific way, and it is possible to find a vision of religion to be aimed for that is worth considering as a theory of religion among Japanese philosophers. To examine the theory of religion of Tanabe, this study focuses on the work, Demonstration of Christianity, and other works from the perspective of religious studies. In Demonstration of Christianity, the concept of absolute religion toward the second religious reformation is envisioned based on Tanabe’s dialectics of the absolute mediation, and a discussion on his world religion can be found, although it is limited to Christianity and some Buddhist sects. Reflecting his absolute dialectic, Tanabe says that this world religion was established through the absolute mediation of Christianity with “Nembutsu-Zen ” (the unification of Pure Land Buddhism and Zen Buddhism). One cannot deny the impression of Christocentrism in these discussions, but they are in the result of Tanabe’s thoroughness in philosophy. What can be drawn from these discussions is that Tanabe’s theory of religion is strongly connected to Platonism, which he considered the root of his dialectics. For example, the third article in Existence, Love, and Practice(1947), “Self-Transcendence in Platonism and Faith in Gospel.” Tanabe’s argument reveals the characteristics of conceiving a new religion that combines Buddhism and Christianity, philosophy, and religion through a creative interpretation of Platonism, the source of Western thought where philosophy and religion are inseparably linked.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-998/v2?src=rss">Exploring needs, perceptions, and preferences towards exercise video among overweight individuals - a qualitative study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The number of overweight people (BMI 25–29.9kg.m-2) in the world is increasing, which increases the risk of health problems and psychological difficulties. To reduce these risks, it is imperative to address unhealthy habits including food and exercise. This qualitative study aimed to explore the needs, perceptions, and preferences of overweight individuals on tailored exercise programs that incorporate educational videos. Methodology Forty Individuals between the age of 18-30 years with a BMI of 25-29.9kg.m-2 were included in the study using Purposive sampling from October 2023 to November 2023. Semi-structured in-depth interview was conducted for 45-60 minutes approximately among both active and inactive overweight individuals by a researcher trained in qualitative research. These interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was performed using inductive and deductive approaches to identify the recurrent patterns, themes, and insights in the transcribed interviews. Results 8 themes and 44 subthemes emerged from the analysis, helping to shed light on the needs, perceptions, and preferences that overweight individuals experience when it comes to their preference for a customized exercise program provided through educational video. The participants wanted personalized regimens that catered to their requirements and levels of fitness. Conclusion In summary, the findings emphasize the value of educational videos that are easy to use, visually appealing, and supported by science. These videos should emphasize technique, varying levels of difficulty, and brief sessions.

                Background This research investigates the unsteady magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow, heat, and mass transfer of tangent hyperbolic ternary hybrid nanofluids over a permeable stretching sheet. The study considers three types of nanoparticles—aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃), copper (Cu), and titanium oxide (TiO₂)—dispersed in a base fluid of ethylene glycol (C₂H₆O₂). This ternary hybrid nanofluid (Al₂O₃–Cu–TiO₂/C₂H₆O₂) has potential applications in cooling systems, biomedical uses for targeted drug delivery and hyperthermia treatments, heat exchangers, and polymer processing techniques like extrusion and casting. Methods This study will examine the combined effects of Weissenberg number, power law index, nanoparticle volume fraction, viscous dissipation, magnetic field, heat generation, nonlinear thermal radiation, temperature ratio, Joule heating, Brownian motion, thermophoresis, porous permeability, variable thermal conductivity, Eckert number, Prandtl number, Schmidt number, chemical reaction, velocity ratio, and Forchheimer number on the electrical conductivity of unsteady flow in tangent hyperbolic ternary hybrid nanofluids. The governing equations are transformed into similarity equations using appropriate transformations and solved numerically with the MATLAB BVP5C package. The results are validated against data from published articles to ensure reproducibility. Results The findings reveal that an increase in the Weissenberg and Forchheimer numbers reduces the velocity profile, while the temperature distribution increases. The variable thermal conductivity parameter (Γ) leads to a higher temperature profile, indicating improved heat transfer. Higher nanoparticle concentrations in the nanofluids and hybrid nanofluids result in enhanced skin friction, Nusselt number, and Sherwood number. Ternary hybrid nanofluids show the most significant improvement in heat transfer and thermal conductivity. Conclusions Ternary hybrid nanofluids significantly enhance heat and mass transfer, showing potential for applications in cooling systems, drug delivery, and polymer processing. The numerical results are consistent with previous research, confirming the reliability and reproducibility of the findings.

                Abstract Background Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) pose a significant global health threat, with increasing prevalence worldwide, including in Indonesia. Despite the public health impact, comprehensive data on the burden of CRE in Indonesia remains fragmented. This protocol outlines a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to estimate the prevalence of CRE in Indonesia, summarize trends over time, and identify key resistance mechanisms. Methods We will conduct a systematic search across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and local Indonesian databases, for studies reporting the prevalence of CRE in Indonesia from 2004 to 2024. Eligibility criteria include observational studies (cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control) and surveillance reports. Data extraction will focus on CRE prevalence, bacterial species, sample types, resistance mechanisms, and study settings (hospital vs. community). Quality assessment of studies will be performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Meta-analysis will be conducted using a random-effects model to estimate pooled prevalence, and subgroup analysis will explore variations by geographical region, period, and healthcare setting. Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide the first comprehensive overview of CRE prevalence in Indonesia, contributing to an improved understanding of the national burden and resistance patterns. The findings will guide public health policies and inform antimicrobial stewardship efforts in Indonesia. Registration PROSPERO CRD42024580177

                Background Globalization, urbanization, and economic development has had an influence on the dining out behaviour in general and fine dining in particular. The objective of this systematic review is identifying the factors affecting fine dining selection and to understand the fine dining restaurant dynamics. Methods In the context of fine dining, both quantitative and qualitative studies conducted in South Asian countries—Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka—were included in this review. The review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and summarised using narrative synthesis. The search was conducted on Scopus, Web of Science, MEDLINE (PubMed) and Google Scholar. The two-stage screening was independently done by two authors in two stages (titles/abstracts, and full texts) for inclusion, with discrepancies resolved by involvement of a third reviewer. Data was extracted using a piloted form and the results are presented as a narrative summary and in tabular format. Results Fourteen studies met the eligibility criteria after de-duplication and screening and were included in the review. These studies were conducted in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan and were mostly quantitative in nature. The outcomes assessed in the studies were factors affecting decision to choose fine dine restaurant, customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, willingness to pay, and food wastage. Conclusion There is limited literature on types of evidence available related to fine dining in South Asia. The substantial gap extends to the methodological aspect and the outcomes assessed in the fine dining restaurant segment.

                Background Traditional optimization methods often struggle to balance global exploration and local refinement, particularly in complex real-world problems. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel hybrid optimization strategy that integrates the Nelder-Mead (NM) technique and the Genetic Algorithm (GA), named the Genetic and Nelder-Mead Algorithm (GANMA). This hybrid approach aims to enhance performance across various benchmark functions and parameter estimation tasks. Methods GANMA combines the global search capabilities of GA with the local refinement strength of NM. It is first tested on 15 benchmark functions commonly used to evaluate optimization strategies. The effectiveness of GANMA is also demonstrated through its application to parameter estimation problems, showcasing its practical utility in real-world scenarios. Results GANMA outperforms traditional optimization methods in terms of robustness, convergence speed, and solution quality. The hybrid algorithm excels across different function landscapes, including those with high dimensionality and multimodality, which are often encountered in real-world optimization issues. Additionally, GANMA improves model accuracy and interpretability in parameter estimation tasks, enhancing both model fitting and prediction. Conclusions GANMA proves to be a flexible and powerful optimization method suitable for both benchmark optimization and real-world parameter estimation challenges. Its capability to efficiently explore parameter spaces and refine solutions makes it a promising tool for scientific, engineering, and economic applications. GANMA offers a valuable solution for improving model performance and effectively handling complex optimization problems.

                <p>by Elsje J Burgers, Raju P Sharma, Carl Joshua S Eugenio, Muriel M Heldring, Lukas S Wijaya, Bob van de Water, Joost B Beltman</p>

Cells exposed to toxicants, such as drugs, activate a wide variety of stress pathways, often simultaneously. Two important pathways that can influence cell fate and consequently adverse reactions are the Oxidative Stress Response (OSR) and the DNA Damage Response (DDR). Previous studies have presented evidence of crosstalk between the OSR and DDR. We aimed to develop computational models to describe experimentally observed dynamics of both OSR and DDR proteins in liver (HepG2) cells <i>in vitro</i> upon exposure to various concentrations of either diethyl maleate (DEM; an agent primarily invoking oxidative stress) or etoposide (an agent primarily causing DNA damage). With these models, we aimed to identify the key interactions that cause crosstalk and their importance in describing protein dynamics. We developed a new model for the OSR pathway, coupled it to a previously developed model for the DDR pathway, and extended the resulting combined model based on multiple potential modes of crosstalk described in the literature. The different models were applied to previously published data of HepG2 GFP-reporter cells with time-dynamic information on the relative amount of proteins important for the OSR (NRF2, SRXN1) or DDR (p53, p21, BTG2 and MDM2). The developed models properly described key OSR and DDR protein dynamics, and <i>in silico</i> knockdowns of key model components in most cases led to a moderate effect on the connected pathway. The largest effect occurred after knockdown of p21, which resulted in a substantial decrease in NRF2 and SRXN1. We expect these models could play a role in adversity predictions by coupling our models with other models that predict cell fate or adversity based on the expression of specific proteins.

                <p>by Larissa M. Oprysk, Maribel Vazquez, Troy Shinbrot</p>

Experiments demonstrate that individual cells that wander stochastically can migrate persistently as a cluster. We show by simulating cells and their interactions that collective migration by omnidirectional cells is a generic phenomenon that can be expected to arise whenever (a) leading and trailing cells migrate randomly, and (b) leading cells are more closely packed than trailing neighbors. The first condition implies that noise is essential to cluster motion, while the second implies that an internal cohesion gradient can drive external motion of a cluster. Unlike other swarming phenomena, we find that this effect is driven by cohesion asymmetry near the leading cell, and motion of interior cells contribute minimally – and in fact interfere with – a cluster’s persistent migration.

                Anthropomorphism studies have been conducted over the past decade; however, there is a void in the literature that provides an overview of anthropomorphism studies in business, management, and accounting. This article provides an in-depth analysis and mapping of major studies in the literature linked to anthropomorphism over the last 14 years by providing a topical classification consistent with present and future anthropomorphism research. The critical function of anthropomorphism in marketing communication tactics necessitates a thorough evaluation that is currently lacking, supplementing past studies to support academics’ and practitioners' interests in performing a thorough analysis of anthropomorphism in future marketing communication trends. This article summarizes studies on anthropomorphism in business, management, and accounting published in Scopus-indexed journals between 2010 and 2024 using Bibliometric-R and VOS viewer in compliance with the PRISMA protocol. The findings highlight significant trends in the articles, including the evolution of the literature (theories and methodologies employed), publications, authors, countries, journal performance, and trends in supporting research themes in the past, present, and future. Research on anthropomorphism has grown rapidly, particularly from 2022 to 2024. This paper provides a complete summary of the fragmented literature to guide future research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-280/v1?src=rss">The Prevalence Of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Complications Among Neonate [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Inserting a peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) is becoming essential. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of PICC line-related complications. Methods A retrospective observational cross-sectional study was conducted in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit between 2012 and 2019 at King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU), Khobar, Saudi Arabia. In total, 120 neonates were included in this study. Data on PICC line-related complications, including infection, thrombosis, occlusion, leakage, pericardial effusion, and neonatal death, were collected from medical records. Risk factors for PICC line-related complications were assessed using the chi-square test. Results PICC complications occurred in 28 (23.3%) of the 120 PICCs. The incidence of proven infection was (11.7%), leakage (10%), local infection (4.2%), and thrombosis (0.8%), and there were no deaths. The rate of complications was higher among neonates with low gestational age (24-26 weeks), extremely low birth weight, stay for 30 days or more, and older age (aged 10-14 days). Conclusion Findings from this study showed that one out of five neonates with PICC at the NICU experienced a PICC line-related complication, with infections and leakage being the most common complications. In the current study, PICC line-related complications were significantly associated with neonatal birth weight, gestational age, and length of stay.

                Background India records the highest number of suicide deaths globally, but suicide prevention efforts are hindered by a lack of trained personnel within the public health system. Given that an index suicide attempt is a strong predictor of future suicide, intervening with individuals who have recently attempted suicide is a targeted prevention approach that can be delivered within the public health system and has potential to be scaled up across low-resource settings. Aim To test the implementation and preliminary effectiveness of Contact and Safety Planning (CASP) in reducing suicidal behaviour and symptoms of depression among adults with a recent suicide attempt in Chhattisgarh. Methods We will carry out a non-randomized, controlled pilot study to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, adoption, reach, implementation (including cost) and preliminary effectiveness of CASP when delivered by health workers – emergency nurses and Community Health Officers – in two districts of Chhattisgarh (n=250). The control group will receive Enhanced Usual Care, consisting of telephonic counselling by trained District Mental Health (n=250) program staff. Data will be collected at baseline and at 6- and 12-month follow- up. Conclusion This study will shed light on the feasibility of CASP and inform its further refinement to address suicide at scale in India.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-278/v1?src=rss">Understanding networking behaviors among Indian startups: A qualitative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Networking plays a pivotal role in achieving business success and mitigating startup failures. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the networking experience of startup entrepreneurs for the growth of their businesses. Methods A qualitative semi-structured interview was conducted mainly in Bangalore and the Delhi regions of India. Using a cluster sampling method, interviews were held with 36 startup entrepreneurs. These startup owners were mainly from Bangalore and Delhi. The age group, gender, demographic profile, and popular startup sector of these startup owners have also been analyzed in this study. The data were analyzed using Atlas. Ti software. Results The qualitative findings revealed four overall themes related to networking, namely, the “role of networking for the success of the startups”, “supportive environment for networking”, “crucial stages of networking” and “role of past working experience of entrepreneurs”. It was found that most entrepreneurs leverage past work experience to interact effectively in business, utilizing skills such as communication, leadership, and market intelligence. Conclusion Entrepreneurs mainly prefer networking with colleagues and their ex-bosses in building and creating formal networking. During crises, network members provide expert advice, moral support, and connections to specialists, which helps them solve problems and access new opportunities. Networking is crucial mainly in the early stage of a startup, where connections and relationship structures are needed for navigating upcoming challenges.

                Background The rise of multidrug-resistant pathogens and emerging new microbes due to climate change highlight the urgent need for alternative antimicrobials. Plants, as they adapt to environmental shifts, produce diverse metabolites with potent antibacterial properties, offering a sustainable source to combat antibiotic resistance and emerging microbial threats. In this context, Citrullus colocynthis fruits, known for their antimicrobial activity and adaptation to the hot Gulf region, were screened to identify accessions with strong antibacterial activity and distinct metabolic profiles. Methods The rinds and pulps of three C. colocynthis accessions were screened for their effectiveness against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50) tests determined activity levels, and GC-MS/MS metabolic profiling analyzed the chemical composition of rind and pulp extracts. Enrichment and network analyses were performed to identify metabolic pathways and potential bacterial targets. Results Rind extracts demonstrated stronger antibacterial activity than pulp, with accession S2 showing the highest activity against S. aureus (MIC50 = 15.74 μg/ml), outperforming other accessions. Metabolic profiling revealed distinct metabolite clusters between rind and pulp, with the rind containing unique compounds like butyric acid, α-linolenic acid, and β-sitosterol. Enrichment analysis indicated that unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and other fatty acid metabolism pathways were enriched in the accession S2 rind, supporting its antibacterial potency. Network analysis pinpointed bacterial fatty acid synthase enzymes (FabZ, FabI, and FabH) as potential S. aureus targets of C. colocynthis rind fatty acids. Conclusions The distinct metabolic profiles and strong antibacterial activity of C. colocynthis rind, especially in accession S2, underscore its potential as a sustainable source for plant-based nutraceuticals. Its unique adaptability and antimicrobial properties present a promising strategy for combating multidrug-resistant pathogens.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27224?af=R">Network Localization of Pediatric Lesion‐Induced Dystonia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dystonia is a movement disorder defined by involuntary muscle contractions leading to abnormal postures or twisting and repetitive movements. Classically dystonia has been thought of as a disorder of the basal ganglia, but newer results in idiopathic dystonia and lesion-induced dystonia in adults point to broader motor network dysfunction spanning the basal ganglia, cerebellum, premotor cortex, sensorimotor, and frontoparietal regions. It is unclear whether a similar network is shared between different etiologies of pediatric lesion-induced dystonia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Three cohorts of pediatric patients with lesion-induced dystonia were identified. The lesion etiologies included hypoxia, kernicterus, and stroke versus comparison subjects with acquired lesions not associated with dystonia. Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping and lesion network mapping were used to evaluate the anatomy and networks associated with dystonia.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping showed that lesions of the putamen and globus pallidus were associated with dystonia (<i>r</i> = 0.41, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Lesion network mapping using normative connectome data from healthy children demonstrated that these regional findings occurred within a common brain-wide network that involves the basal ganglia, anterior and medial cerebellum, and cortical regions that overlap the cingulo-opercular action-mode and somato-cognitive-action networks.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We interpret these findings as novel evidence for a unified dystonia brain network that involves the somato-cognitive-action network, which is implicated in the coordination of movement. Elucidation of this network gives insight into the functional origins of dystonia and provides novel targets to investigate for therapeutic intervention. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                How do neurons cope with chronic stress? In a recent study using blind Drosophila models, Shekhar and colleagues uncovered that chronic sensory deprivation induces brain-wide accumulation of aggregates sequestering transcription factors of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). However, this protective mechanism prevents cells from triggering adapted transcriptional responses upon exogenous stress.

                Higginbotham et al. show that inflammatory pain increases opioid-evoked dopamine neuron activity to promote fentanyl use selectively in males. Ovarian hormones offer females protection, but estradiol’s role is pain-context dependent and sex specific. These findings highlight a unique interaction between hormonal and pain states that may underlie sex differences in opioid misuse liability.

One well-known proposal — integrated information theory — has recently been labeled as ‘pseudoscience’, which has caused a heated open debate. Here we discuss the case and argue that the theory is indeed unscientific because its core claims are untestable even in principle.

This multicellular bistability can provide robustness to developmental systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101125">Amidase and lysozyme dual functions in TseP reveal a new family of chimeric effectors in the type VI secretion system</a></h4>

              
                Peptidoglycan (PG) serves as an essential target for antimicrobial development. An overlooked reservoir of antimicrobials lies in the form of PG-hydrolyzing enzymes naturally produced for polymicrobial competition, particularly those associated with the type VI secretion system (T6SS). Here, we report that a T6SS effector TseP, from <i>Aeromonas dhakensis</i>, represents a family of effectors with dual amidase-lysozyme activities. In vitro PG-digestion coupled with LC-MS analysis revealed the N-domain’s amidase activity, which is neutralized by either catalytic mutations or the presence of the immunity protein TsiP. The N-domain, but not the C-domain, of TseP is sufficient to restore T6SS secretion in T6SS-defective mutants, underscoring its critical structural role. Using pull-down and secretion assays, we showed that these two domains interact directly with a carrier protein VgrG2 and can be secreted separately. Homologs in <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i> and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> exhibited analogous dual functions. Additionally, N- and C-domains display distinctive GC contents, suggesting an evolutionary fusion event. By altering the surface charge through structural-guided design, we engineered the TseP<sup>C4+</sup> effector that successfully lyses otherwise resistant <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> cells, enabling the T6SS to inhibit <i>B. subtilis</i> in a contact-independent manner. This research uncovers TseP as a new family of bifunctional chimeric effectors targeting PG, offering a potential strategy to harness these proteins in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100822">Dopamine increases protein synthesis in hippocampal neurons enabling dopamine-dependent LTP</a></h4>

              
                The reward and novelty-related neuromodulator dopamine plays an important role in hippocampal long-term memory, which is thought to involve protein-synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity. However, the direct effects of dopamine on protein synthesis, and the functional implications of newly synthesised proteins for synaptic plasticity, have not yet been investigated. We have previously reported that timing-dependent synaptic depression (t-LTD) can be converted into potentiation by dopamine application during synaptic stimulation (Brzosko et al., 2015) or postsynaptic burst activation (Fuchsberger et al., 2022). Here, we show that dopamine increases protein synthesis in mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons, enabling dopamine-dependent long-term potentiation (DA-LTP), which is mediated via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive adenylate cyclase (AC) subtypes 1/8, cAMP, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). We found that neuronal activity is required for the dopamine-induced increase in protein synthesis. Furthermore, dopamine induced a protein-synthesis-dependent increase in the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1, but not GluA2. We found that DA-LTP is absent in GluA1 knock-out mice and that it requires calcium-permeable AMPA receptors. Taken together, our results suggest that dopamine together with neuronal activity controls synthesis of plasticity-related proteins, including GluA1, which enable DA-LTP via a signalling pathway distinct from that of conventional LTP.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96591">Single-nucleus multiomics reveals the gene regulatory networks underlying sex determination of murine primordial germ cells</a></h4>

              
                Accurate specification of female and male germ cells during embryonic development is critical for sexual reproduction. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the bipotential precursors of mature gametes that commit to an oogenic or spermatogenic fate in response to sex-determining cues from the fetal gonad. The critical processes required for PGCs to integrate and respond to signals from the somatic environment in gonads are not well understood. In this study, we developed the first single-nucleus multiomics map of chromatin accessibility and gene expression during murine PGC development in both XX and XY embryos. Profiling of cell-type-specific transcriptomes and regions of open chromatin from the same cell captured the molecular signatures and gene networks underlying PGC sex determination. Joint RNA and ATAC data for single PGCs resolved previously unreported PGC subpopulations and cataloged a multimodal reference atlas of differentiating PGC clusters. We discovered that regulatory element accessibility precedes gene expression during PGC development, suggesting that changes in chromatin accessibility may prime PGC lineage commitment prior to differentiation. Similarly, we found that sexual dimorphism in chromatin accessibility and gene expression increased temporally in PGCs. Combining single-nucleus sequencing data, we computationally mapped the cohort of transcription factors that regulate the expression of sexually dimorphic genes in PGCs. For example, the gene regulatory networks of XX PGCs are enriched for the transcription factors, TFAP2c, TCFL5, GATA2, MGA, NR6A1, TBX4, and ZFX. Sex-specific enrichment of the forkhead-box and POU6 families of transcription factors was also observed in XY PGCs. Finally, we determined the temporal expression patterns of WNT, BMP, and RA signaling during PGC sex determination, and our discovery analyses identified potentially new cell communication pathways between supporting cells and PGCs. Our results illustrate the diversity of factors involved in programming PGCs toward a sex-specific fate.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100730">The asymmetric expression of HSPA2 in blastomeres governs the first embryonic cell-fate decision</a></h4>

              
                The first cell-fate decision is the process by which cells of an embryo take on distinct lineage identities for the first time, thus representing the beginning of developmental patterning. Here, we demonstrate that the molecular chaperone heat shock protein A2 (HSPA2), a member of the 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) family, is asymmetrically expressed in the late 2-cell stage of mouse embryos. The knockdown of <i>Hspa2</i> in one of the 2-cell blastomeres prevented its progeny predominantly towards the inner cell mass (ICM) fate. In contrast, the overexpression of <i>Hspa2</i> in one of the 2-cell blastomeres did not induce the blastomere to differentiate towards the ICM fate. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HSPA2 interacted with CARM1 and its levels correlated with ICM-associated genes. Collectively, our results identify HSPA2 as a critical early regulator of the first cell-fate decision in mammalian 2-cell embryos.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99548">Aminergic and peptidergic modulation of insulin-producing cells in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Insulin plays a critical role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Since metabolic demands are highly dynamic, insulin release needs to be constantly adjusted. These adjustments are mediated by different pathways, most prominently the blood glucose level, but also by feedforward signals from motor circuits and different neuromodulatory systems. Here, we analyze how neuromodulatory inputs control the activity of the main source of insulin in <i>Drosophila –</i> a population of insulin-producing cells (IPCs) located in the brain. IPCs are functionally analogous to mammalian pancreatic beta cells, but their location makes them accessible for in vivo recordings in intact animals. We characterized functional inputs to IPCs using single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis, anatomical receptor expression mapping, connectomics, and an optogenetics-based ‘intrinsic pharmacology’ approach. Our results show that the IPC population expresses a variety of receptors for neuromodulators and classical neurotransmitters. Interestingly, IPCs exhibit heterogeneous receptor profiles, suggesting that the IPC population can be modulated differentially. This is supported by electrophysiological recordings from IPCs, which we performed while activating different populations of modulatory neurons. Our analysis revealed that some modulatory inputs have heterogeneous effects on the IPC activity, such that they inhibit one subset of IPCs, while exciting another. Monitoring calcium activity across the IPC population uncovered that these heterogeneous responses occur simultaneously. Certain neuromodulatory populations shifted the IPC population activity towards an excited state, while others shifted it towards inhibition. Taken together, we provide a comprehensive, multi-level analysis of neuromodulation in the insulinergic system of <i>Drosophila</i>.

	<p>Background: Numerous individuals suffer from attentional issues, such as ADHD. While medication is considered the first-line treatment, it is unavailable to some. As a result, certain individuals are choosing to self-medicate with novel stimulants, a phenomenon that remains poorly understood. We aimed to investigate which NPSs are being used to self-medicate ADHD, evaluate their perceived effectiveness, and explore the experiences and motivations of those self-medicating. Methods: Data from respondents (n = 225) (mean age [SD] = 29.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.6; male = 83%; female = 12%; non-binary = 5%) were collected via an online survey, with nine participants (mean age = 31.4; male = 5; female = 1; non-binary = 3) undertaking further semi-structured interviews and the data being investigated using a framework analysis. Results: The most-used NPSs were 4F-MPH and 2-FMA. Some individuals perceived self-medication to be more effective than conventional treatment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). A framework analysis identified the following themes surrounding novel stimulant self-medication: (1) the use of NPS stimulants as a stopgap between treatments; (2) poor access to ADHD treatment; (3) a lack of openness and confidence in psychiatrists and healthcare providers. Conclusion: Novel stimulants are being used when access to ADHD treatment is poor. Interventions should aim to reduce long treatment wait times and issues surrounding geographical access. Careful consideration should be given before denying stimulant medication to individuals with co-occurring substance use and psychiatric comorbidity. Individuals desire a more patient-centred ADHD treatment with broader pharmacotherapies.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Activation of cannabinoid CB1 or CB2 receptors induces the death of glial progenitors from the chick retina in culture. Here, by using an enriched retinal glial cell culture, we characterized some mechanisms underlying glial death promoted by cannabinoids. Methods and Results: Retinal cultures obtained from 8-day-old (E8) chick embryos and maintained for 12&amp;amp;ndash;15 days (C12&amp;amp;ndash;15) were used. MTT assays revealed that the CB1/CB2 agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) decreased cell viability in the cultures in a time-dependent manner, with a concomitant increase in extracellular LDH activity, suggesting membrane integrity loss. Cell death was also dose-dependently induced by cannabidiol (CBD), &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and CP55940, another CB1/CB2 agonist. In contrast to WIN-induced cell death that was not blocked by either antagonist, the deleterious effect of CBD was blocked by the CB2 receptor antagonist SR144528, but not by PF514273, a CB1 receptor antagonist. WIN-treated cultures showed glial cells with large vacuoles in cytoplasm that were absent in cultures incubated with WIN plus 4-phenyl-butyrate (PBA), a chemical chaperone. Since cannabinoids induced the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2-alfa (eIF2&amp;amp;alpha;), these results suggest a process of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) swelling and stress. Incubation of the cultures with WIN for 4 h induced a ~five-fold increase in the number of cells labeled with the ROS indicator CM-H2DCFDA. WIN induced the phosphorylation of JNK but not of p38 in the cultures, and also induced an increase in the number of glial cells expressing cleaved-caspase 3 (c-CASP3). The decrease in cell viability and the expression of c-CASP3 was blocked by salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2&amp;amp;alpha; dephosphorylation. Conclusions: These data suggest that cannabinoids induce the apoptosis of glial cells in culture by promoting ROS production, ER stress, JNK phosphorylation, and caspase-3 processing.

	<p>Background: Middle-aged and elderly individuals may experience detrimental health effects due to ischemic stroke (IS). The inflammatory response triggered during IS exacerbates neuronal damage, becoming a barrier to effective IS treatment and leading to poor patient prognosis. Nevertheless, the specific role of microglia in the inflammatory response triggered by IS remains mostly unclear. The primary target of this investigation is to study the neuroinflammatory impact of lycorine (LYC) during the IS process. Our objective is to evaluate whether LYC deploys its anti-inflammatory effect with modulation of the NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B signaling pathway, thereby reducing IS symptoms. Methods: In this research, BV-2 cells were pre-treated with LYC for 24 h before LPS was added to induce inflammation. Results: It has been discovered that LYC suppresses BV-2 cell polarization and reduces the levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-6, TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;), showing its potential anti-inflammatory effects in vitro. Furthermore, I&amp;amp;kappa;B&amp;amp;alpha; and p65 play crucial roles in regulating the inflammatory response within the NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B signaling pathway. Mechanistic exploration indicates that LYC can activate the expression of I&amp;amp;kappa;B&amp;amp;alpha; in LPS-induced BV-2 cells. I&amp;amp;kappa;B&amp;amp;alpha; inhibits NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B by binding to its p65 subunit, sequestering it in the cytoplasm and preventing its translocation to the nucleus, thereby inhibiting inflammation. Additionally, p65 is a key transcription factor for pro-inflammatory genes, and its downregulation leads to decreased transcriptional activity of these genes. The combined effect of increased I&amp;amp;kappa;B&amp;amp;alpha; and decreased p65 results in significantly reduced NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B activity, thereby alleviating the inflammatory response. Meanwhile, in vivo studies indicate that LYC pre-treatment significantly reduces the infarct size caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. The assessment of cerebral infarction volume, neurological scores, brain edema rate and inflammation levels in MCAO rats pre-treated with LYC indicates positive therapeutic effects. Conclusions: In summary, our research indicates that LYC pre-treatment has significant anti-inflammatory effects by attenuating inflammation levels through NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B inhibition, which contributes to potential therapeutic benefits in ischemic stroke (IS) and may improve disease prognosis. LYC may serve as an adjunctive clinical pre-treatment for IS, which has to be confirmed by clinical trials in the future.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: In many societies, especially in highly masculine societies like Japan, being a man, getting older, engaging in knowledge work, and earning a high annual salary are seen as conditions for success. On the other hand, an increasing number of studies have shown that incorporating kawaii-ness into our lives can help maintain and improve happiness and well-being. Methods: Therefore, in this study, we employed a variable expressing the response to kawaii-ness together with four demographic variables (sex, age, income, and knowledge work), happiness, and fractional anisotropy brain healthcare quotient (FA-BHQ) which is derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images calculations to analyze the relationship between them. Results: The results of a path analysis using data obtained from 182 healthy men and women showed that kawaii-ness mediates the association between demographic variables and happiness, which is in turn associated with FA-BHQ. Furthermore, with the correlation analysis between happiness and individual FA regions, we were able to confirm that FA regions, including the limbic-thalamo-cortical pathway, which is responsible for emotional regulation, are related to happiness. Conclusions: These results indicate the following: Men, older people, people engaged in knowledge work, and people with high annual incomes avoid kawaii-ness; As a result, they are unable to obtain the sense of happiness that they should have; as a result, they are unable to keep their brains healthy, and their brain functions, including emotional regulation, are not functioning properly; This may prevent them from maintaining or improving their performance. This study is the first attempt to clarify the relationship between demographic scales, kawaii-ness, happiness, and brain conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27087?af=R">Congenital Titinopathy: Comprehensive Characterization of the Most Severe End of the Disease Spectrum</a></h4>

              
                <p>Congenital titinopathy has recently emerged as one of the most common congenital muscle disorders.</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To better understand the presentation and clinical needs of the under-characterized extreme end of the congenital titinopathy severity spectrum.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We comprehensively analyzed the clinical, imaging, pathology, autopsy, and genetic findings in 15 severely affected individuals from 11 families.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Prenatal features included hypokinesia or akinesia and growth restriction. Six pregnancies were terminated. Nine infants were born at or near term with severe-to-profound weakness and required resuscitation. Seven died following withdrawal of life support. Two surviving children require ongoing respiratory support. Most cohort members had at least 1 disease-causing variant predicted to result in some near-normal-length titin expression. The exceptions, from 2 unrelated families, had homozygous truncating variants predicted to induce complete nonsense mediated decay. However, subsequent analyses suggested that the causative variant in each family had an additional previously unrecognized impact on splicing likely to result in some near-normal-length titin expression. This impact was confirmed by minigene assay for 1 variant.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study confirms the clinical variability of congenital titinopathy. Severely affected individuals succumb prenatally/during infancy, whereas others survive into adulthood. It is likely that this variability is because of differences in the amount and/or length of expressed titin. If confirmed, analysis of titin expression could facilitate clinical prediction and increasing expression might be an effective treatment strategy. Our findings also further-support the hypothesis that some near-normal-length titin expression is essential to early prenatal survival. Sometimes expression of normal/near-normal-length titin is due to disease-causing variants having an additional impact on splicing. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:611–628</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27149?af=R">Inhibition of Bone Morphogenetic Protein Signaling Prevents Tau Pathology in iPSC Derived Neurons and PS19 Mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Many neurodegenerative disorders share a common pathologic feature involving the deposition of abnormal tau protein in the brain (tauopathies). This suggests that there may be some shared pathophysiologic mechanism(s). The largest risk factor for the majority of these disorders is aging, suggesting involvement of the aging process in the shared pathophysiology. We test the hypothesis that an increase in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling that occurs during aging contributes to the onset and progression of tauopathies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were used to investigate the effects of BMP signaling on tau phosphorylation and release and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Wildtype mice were used to examine effects of BMP signaling <i>in vivo</i>. P301S (PS19) mice were examined for the effects of BMP signaling in a model of tauopathy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here, we show that BMP signaling, mediated by non-canonical p38 signaling, increases tau phosphorylation and release of p-tau in human iPSC-derived AD neurons. Further, there is an interaction between BMP signaling and apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) that significantly increases tau phosphorylation and release compared with ApoE3 neurons. Inhibiting BMP signaling reduces the changes in tau in the cultured human neurons, and it limits tau pathology and prevents cognitive decline in PS19 mice.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study suggests that the age-related increase in BMP signaling may participate in the onset and progression of tau pathology. Thus, therapeutic interventions that reduce BMP signaling in the aging brain could potentially slow or prevent development of diseases involving tau hyperphosphorylation.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a major cause of perinatal brain injury. Creatine is a dietary supplement that can increase intracellular phosphocreatine to improve the provision of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to meet the increase in metabolic demand of oxygen deprivation. Here, we assessed prophylactic fetal creatine supplementation in reducing acute asphyxia-induced seizures, disordered electroencephalography (EEG) activity and cerebral inflammation and cell death histopathology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fetal sheep (118 ± 1 days’ gestational age [dGA]; 0.8 gestation) were implanted with electrodes to continuously record EEG and nuchal electromyogram activity. At 121 dGA, fetuses were randomly assigned to sham control (i.v. saline infusion without umbilical cord occlusion [UCO]; SalCon), continuous i.v. creatine infusion (6 mg/kg/h; CrUCO) or isovolumetric saline (SalUCO) followed by UCO at 128 ± 2 dGA that lasted until the mean arterial blood pressure reached 19 mmHg. Brain tissue was collected for histopathology after 72 hours of recovery.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Creatine supplementation had no effects on basal systemic or neurological physiology. UCO duration did not differ between CrUCO and SalUCO. After reperfusion, CrUCO fetuses had improved EEG power and frequency recovery and reduced electrographic seizure incidence (SalUCO, 86% vs CrUCO, 29%) and burden. At 72 hours after UCO, cell death in the cerebral cortex and astrogliosis in the periventricular white matter were reduced in CrUCO fetuses compared with SalUCO.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Creatine supplementation reduced post-asphyxial seizures and improved EEG recovery. Improvements in functional recovery with creatine were associated with regional reductions in cell death and astrogliosis. Prophylactic creatine treatment has the potential to mitigate functional indices of HIE in the late gestation fetal brain. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:673–687</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27151?af=R">Critical Care Decisions After Large Core Cerebral Infarctions: A Secondary Analysis From the SELECT2 Trial</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Among patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) and large ischemic cores, critical decisions often need to be made about decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) or early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST). In this study, we aimed to evaluate utilization of DHC and early WLST and factors associated with them in patients with large strokes from the SELECT2 trial.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed the entire SELECT2 trial population, which randomized 352 patients with stroke due to LVO and large ischemic cores to endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) or medical management. We used the as-treated principle to compare the use of DHC and early WLST within 7 days after randomization. We further assessed functional outcomes (modified Rankin Score) after these decisions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 352 patients enrolled in this study, 55 received DHC and 81 transitioned to early WLST. Patients treated with EVT were as likely to undergo DHC (16% vs 15%, adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 1.19, 95% CI:0.75–1.88, <i>p</i> = 0.46) or WLST (22% vs 24%, aRR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.66–1.34, <i>p</i> = 0.72) as those given medical management. DHC was used more frequently in younger patients and WLST more in older patients. EVT efficacy was maintained after adjusting for DHC (adjusted generalized odds ratio [aGenOR] = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.24–2.11, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with no interaction between DHC and treatment (p-interaction = 0.93). At 1 year, 21% of DHC-treated patients were ambulatory; the outcomes were universally poor after early WLST.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In the SELECT2 trial of patients with large ischemic core, DHC was performed in ~1 of 6 patients and early WLST in ~1 of 5 patients, without differences based on treatment with EVT or medical management, nor successful reperfusion. DHC or WLST did not detract from thrombectomy treatment benefit. Additionally, ~20% of patients achieved independent ambulation despite receiving DHC by the 1-year follow-up. The similar distribution of these critical care decisions provides reassurance that the overall trial outcomes were not biased by open-label treatment allocation.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is a serious neurologic condition associated with death or neurodevelopmental impairments. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely used for neuroprognostication, but there is substantial subjectivity and uncertainty about neurodevelopmental outcome prediction. We sought to develop an objective and automated approach for the analysis of newborn brain MRI to improve the accuracy of prognostication.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We created an anatomic MRI template from a sample of 286 infants treated with therapeutic hypothermia, and labeled the deep gray-matter structures. We extracted quantitative information, including shape-related information, and information represented by complex patterns (radiomic measures), from each of these structures in all infants. We then trained an elastic net model to use either only these measures, only the infants’ demographic and laboratory data, or both, to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes, as measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development at 18 months of age.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among those infants for whom Bayley scores were available for cognitive, language, and motor outcomes, we found sets of MRI-based measures that could predict their Bayley scores with correlations that were greater than the correlations based on only the demographic and laboratory data, explained more of the variance in the observed scores, and generated a smaller error; predictions based on the combination of the demographic-laboratory and MRI-based measures were similar or marginally better.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings show that machine learning models using MRI-based measures can predict neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy across all neurodevelopmental domains and across the full spectrum of outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:791–802</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27156?af=R">Association that Neuroimaging and Clinical Measures Have with Change in Arm Impairment in a Phase 3 Stroke Recovery Trial</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with rehabilitation therapy improved motor status compared to rehabilitation alone in the phase III VNS-REHAB stroke trial, but treatment response was variable and not associated with any clinical measures acquired at baseline, such as age or side of paresis. We hypothesized that neuroimaging measures would be associated with treatment-related gains, examining performance of regional injury measures versus global brain health measures in parallel with clinical measures.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in the VNS-REHAB trial were used to derive regional injury measures (extent of injury to corticospinal tract, the primary regional measure; plus extent of injury to precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus; lesion volume; and lesion topography) and global brain health measures (degree of white matter hyperintensities, the primary global brain measure; plus volumes of cerebrospinal fluid, cortical gray matter, white matter, each thalamus, and total brain). Eight clinical measures assessed at baseline were also evaluated (treatment group, age, race, gender, paretic side, pre-stroke dominant hand, time since stroke, and baseline Fugl-Meyer upper extremity score). Bivariate analyses compared each measure with the primary trial end point (change in Fugl-Meyer upper extremity score from baseline to end of 6 weeks of treatment) across all subjects, with secondary analyses examining trial groups separately.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>MRIs were available from 80 patients (age = 59.8 ± 9.5 years, 29 women). Across all patients, less white matter hyperintensities (<i>r</i> = −0.25, <i>p</i> = 0.028) at baseline was associated with larger Fugl-Meyer score change. In the VNS group, less white matter hyperintensities (<i>r</i> = −0.37, <i>p</i> = 0.018) and larger ipsilesional thalamus volume (<i>r</i> = 0.33, <i>p</i> = 0.046) were each associated with larger Fugl-Meyer score change. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) analyses tested the interaction that each baseline measure had with treatment group and found that the model examining white matter hyperintensities had a significant interaction term, indicating 2.3 less change in Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity (FM-UE) points in the VNS group relative to the control group for each point increase in modified Fazekas scale.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Neuroimaging measures are associated with extent of gains on the primary endpoint of a phase III stroke recovery trial. Among the neuroimaging measures examined, a measure of global brain health (extent of white matter hyperintensities) was better at explaining the change in arm impairment as compared with measures of regional injury; this was true when examining all study subjects as well as only those in the VNS group and is consistent with the global mechanism of action that VNS has throughout the cerebrum. Future studies can evaluate additional measures that further predict response to VNS therapy. The current findings suggest that individual patient neuroimaging results may be useful for a personalized medicine approach to stroke recovery therapeutics.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides unique insights into the brain and neurological diseases. However, the potential of CSF flow cytometry applied on a large scale remains unknown.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used data-driven approaches to analyze paired CSF and blood flow cytometry measurements from 8,790 patients (discovery cohort) and CSF only data from 3,201 patients (validation cohort) collected across neurological diseases in a real-world setting.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In somatoform controls (n = 788), activation of T cells increased with age in both CSF and blood, whereas double negative blood T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup>) decreased with age. A machine learning model of CSF and blood immune cells defined immune age, which correlated strongly with true biological age (<i>r</i> = 0.71). Classifying all diseases solely based on the CSF/blood parameters in 8,790 patients resulted in clusters of 4 disease categories: healthy, autoimmune, meningoencephalitis, and neurodegenerative. This clustering was validated in an analytically independent test dataset (8,790 patients) and in a temporally independent cohort (3,201 patients). Patients with multiple sclerosis were more likely to have progressive disease when assigned to the neurodegeneration cluster and to have lower disability in the autoimmune cluster. Patients with dementia in the neurodegeneration cluster showed more severe disease progression. Flow cytometry helped differentiate dementia from controls, thereby enhancing the diagnostic power of routine CSF diagnostics.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Flow cytometry of CSF and blood thus identifies site-specific aging patterns and disease-overarching patterns of neurodegeneration. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:779–790</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Remote identification of individuals with severe hyposmia may enable scalable recruitment of participants with underlying alpha-synuclein aggregation. We evaluated the performance of a staged screening paradigm using remote smell testing to enrich for abnormal dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography imaging (DAT-SPECT) and alpha-synuclein aggregation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) recruited participants for the prodromal cohort who were 60-years and older without a Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Participants were invited to complete a University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) independently through an online portal. Hyposmic participants were invited to complete DAT-SPECT, which determined eligibility for enrollment in longitudinal assessments and further biomarker evaluation including cerebrospinal fluid alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay (aSynSAA).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>As of January 29, 2024, 49,843 participants were sent an UPSIT and 31,293 (63%) completed it. Of UPSIT completers, 8,301 (27%) scored &lt;15th percentile. Of 1,546 who completed DAT-SPECT, 1,060 (69%) had DAT-SPECT binding &lt;100% expected for age and sex. Participants with an UPSIT &lt;10th percentile (n = 1,221) had greater likelihood of low DAT-SPECT binding compared to participants with an UPSIT in the 10th to 15th percentile (odds ratio, 3.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.85–4.91). Overall, 55% (198/363) of cases with UPSIT &lt;15th percentile and DAT-SPECT &lt;100% had positive aSynSAA, which increased to 70% (182/260) when selecting for more severe hyposmia (UPSIT &lt;10th percentile).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Remote screening for hyposmia and reduced DAT-SPECT binding identifies participants with a high proportion positive aSynSAA. Longitudinal data will be essential to define progression patterns in these individuals to ultimately inform recruitment into disease modification clinical trials.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) resting tremor is thought to be initiated in the basal ganglia and amplified in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. Because stress worsens tremor, the noradrenergic system may play a role in amplifying tremor. We tested if and how propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, reduces PD tremor and whether or not this effect is specific to stressful conditions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a cross-over, double-blind intervention study, participants with PD resting tremor received propranolol (40 mg, single dose) or placebo (counter-balanced) on 2 different days. During both days, we assessed tremor severity (with accelerometry) and tremor-related brain activity (with functional magnetic resonance imaging), as well as heart rate and pupil diameter, while subjects performed a stressful cognitive load task that has been linked to the noradrenergic system. We tested for effects of drug (propranolol vs placebo) and stress (cognitive load vs rest) on tremor power and tremor-related brain activity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 27 PD patients with prominent resting tremor. Tremor power significantly increased during cognitive load versus rest (<i>F</i>[1,19] = 13.8; <i>p</i> = 0.001; ηp2 = 0.42) and decreased by propranolol versus placebo (<i>F</i>[1,19] = 6.4; <i>p</i> = 0.02; ηp2 = 0.25), but there was no interaction. We observed task-related brain activity in a stress-sensitive cognitive control network and tremor power-related activity in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. Propranolol significantly reduced tremor-related activity in the motor cortex compared to placebo (<i>F</i>[1,21] = 5.3; <i>p</i> = 0.03; ηp2 = 0.20), irrespective of cognitive load.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings indicate that propranolol has a general, context-independent, tremor-reducing effect that may be implemented at the level of the primary motor cortex. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:741–752</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27161?af=R">Early‐Life Adversity Predicts Markers of Aging‐Related Neuroinflammation, Neurodegeneration, and Cognitive Impairment in Women</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the overwhelming evidence for profound and longstanding effects of early-life stress (ELS) on inflammation, brain structure, and molecular aging, its impact on human brain aging and risk for neurodegenerative disease is poorly understood. We examined the impact of ELS severity in interaction with age on blood-based markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, brain volumes, and cognitive function in middle-aged women.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited 179 women (aged 30–60 years) with and without ELS exposure before the onset of puberty. Using Simoa technology, we assessed blood-based markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, including serum concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL). We further obtained T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images to assess brain volumes and we assessed cognitive performance sensitive to early impairments associated with the development of dementia, using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Test Battery. We used generalized additive models to examine nonlinear interaction effects of ELS severity and age on these outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Analyses revealed significant nonlinear interaction effects of ELS severity and age on NfL and GFAP serum concentrations, total and subcortical gray matter volume loss, increased third ventricular volume, and cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that ELS profoundly exacerbates peripheral, neurostructural, and cognitive markers of brain aging. Our results are critical for the development of novel early prevention strategies that target the impact of developmental stress on the brain to mitigate aging-related neurological diseases.
