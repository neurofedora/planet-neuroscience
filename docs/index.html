	<p>Brain networks based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provide a crucial perspective for diagnosing brain diseases. Representation learning has recently attracted tremendous attention due to its strong representation capability, which can be naturally applied to brain disease analysis. However, traditional representation learning only considers direct and local node interactions in original brain networks, posing challenges in constructing higher-order brain networks to represent indirect and extensive node interactions. To address this problem, we propose the Continuous Dictionary of Nodes model and Bilinear-Diffusion (CDON-BD) network for brain disease analysis. The CDON model is innovatively used to learn the original brain network, with its encoder weights directly regarded as latent features. To fully integrate latent features, we further utilize Bilinear Pooling to construct higher-order brain networks. The Diffusion Module is designed to capture extensive node interactions in higher-order brain networks. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CDON-BD demonstrates competitive classification performance on two real datasets. Moreover, the higher-order representations learned by our method reveal brain regions relevant to the diseases, contributing to a better understanding of the pathology of brain diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/8/ENEURO.0215-24.2024?rss=1">Effects of Age on Responses of Principal Cells of the Mouse Anteroventral Cochlear Nucleus in Quiet and Noise</a></h4>

              
                <p>Older listeners often report difficulties understanding speech in noisy environments. It is important to identify where in the auditory pathway hearing-in-noise deficits arise to develop appropriate therapies. We tested how encoding of sounds is affected by masking noise at early stages of the auditory pathway by recording responses of principal cells in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) of aging CBA/CaJ and C57BL/6J mice in vivo. Previous work indicated that masking noise shifts the dynamic range of single auditory nerve fibers (ANFs), leading to elevated tone thresholds. We hypothesized that such threshold shifts could contribute to increased hearing-in-noise deficits with age if susceptibility to masking increased in AVCN units. We tested this by recording the responses of AVCN principal neurons to tones in the presence and absence of masking noise. Surprisingly, we found that masker-induced threshold shifts decreased with age in primary-like units and did not change in choppers. In addition, spontaneous activity decreased in primary-like and chopper units of old mice, with no change in dynamic range or tuning precision. In C57 mice, which undergo early-onset hearing loss, units showed similar changes in threshold and spontaneous rate at younger ages, suggesting they were related to hearing loss and not simply aging. These findings suggest that sound information carried by AVCN principal cells remains largely unchanged with age. Therefore, hearing-in-noise deficits may result from other changes during aging, such as distorted across-channel input from the cochlea and changes in sound coding at later stages of the auditory pathway.</p>

                <p>by Mahraz Behbood, Louisiane Lemaire, Jan-Hendrik Schleimer, Susanne Schreiber</p>

Slow brain rhythms, for example during slow-wave sleep or pathological conditions like seizures and spreading depolarization, can be accompanied by oscillations in extracellular potassium concentration. Such slow brain rhythms typically have a lower frequency than tonic action-potential firing. They are assumed to arise from network-level mechanisms, involving synaptic interactions and delays, or from intrinsically bursting neurons. Neuronal burst generation is commonly attributed to ion channels with slow kinetics. Here, we explore an alternative mechanism generically available to all neurons with class I excitability. It is based on the interplay of fast-spiking voltage dynamics with a one-dimensional slow dynamics of the extracellular potassium concentration, mediated by the activity of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. We use bifurcation analysis of the complete system as well as the slow-fast method to reveal that this coupling suffices to generate a hysteresis loop organized around a bistable region that emerges from a saddle-node loop bifurcation–a common feature of class I excitable neurons. Depending on the strength of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, bursts are generated from pump-induced shearing the bifurcation structure, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolarization block. We suggest that transitions between these dynamics can result from disturbances in extracellular potassium regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. The identified minimal mechanistic model outlining the sodium-potassium pump’s generic contribution to burst dynamics can, therefore, contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of pathologies such as epilepsy syndromes and, potentially, inform therapeutic strategies.

                <p>by William F. Dean, Tomasz J. Nawara, Rose M. Albert, Alexa L. Mattheyses</p>

Most essential cellular functions are performed by proteins assembled into larger complexes. Fluorescence Polarization Microscopy (FPM) is a powerful technique that goes beyond traditional imaging methods by allowing researchers to measure not only the localization of proteins within cells, but also their orientation or alignment within complexes or cellular structures. FPM can be easily integrated into standard widefield microscopes with the addition of a polarization modulator. However, the extensive image processing and analysis required to interpret the data have limited its widespread adoption. To overcome these challenges and enhance accessibility, we introduce OOPS (Object-Oriented Polarization Software), a MATLAB package for object-based analysis of FPM data. By combining flexible image segmentation and novel object-based analyses with a high-throughput FPM processing pipeline, OOPS empowers researchers to simultaneously study molecular order and orientation in individual biological structures; conduct population assessments based on morphological features, intensity statistics, and FPM measurements; and create publication-quality visualizations, all within a user-friendly graphical interface. Here, we demonstrate the power and versatility of our approach by applying OOPS to punctate and filamentous structures.

                <p>by Xiafang Zhang, Nianxia Xie, Guo Ding, Dongdong Ning, Wei Dai, Zijun Xiong, Wenjiang Zhong, Dashuang Zuo, Jie Zhao, Pei Zhang, Chengyuan Liu, Qiye Li, Hao Ran, Weiwei Liu, Guojie Zhang</p>

Phenotypic plasticity displayed by an animal in response to different environmental conditions is supposedly crucial for its survival and reproduction. The female adults of some ant lineages display phenotypic plasticity related to reproductive role. In pharaoh ant queens, insemination induces substantial physiological/behavioral changes and implicates remarkable gene regulatory network (GRN) shift in the brain. Here, we report a neuropeptide <i>neuroparsin A</i> (<i>NPA</i>) showing a conserved expression pattern associated with reproductive activity across ant species. Knock-down of <i>NPA</i> in unmated queen enhances ovary activity, whereas injection of NPA peptide in fertilized queen suppresses ovary activity. We found that NPA mainly affected the downstream gene <i>JHBP</i> in the ovary, which is positively regulated by NPA and suppression of which induces elevated ovary activity, and <i>shadow</i> which is negatively regulated by NPA. Furthermore, we show that NPA was also employed into the brain–ovary axis in regulating the worker reproductive changes in other distantly related species, such as <i>Harpegnathos venator</i> ants.

                <p>by Kazuma Mori, Robert Zatorre</p>

Music can evoke pleasurable and rewarding experiences. Past studies that examined task-related brain activity revealed individual differences in musical reward sensitivity traits and linked them to interactions between the auditory and reward systems. However, state-dependent fluctuations in spontaneous neural activity in relation to music-driven rewarding experiences have not been studied. Here, we used functional MRI to examine whether the coupling of auditory-reward networks during a silent period immediately before music listening can predict the degree of musical rewarding experience of human participants (<i>N</i> = 49). We used machine learning models and showed that the functional connectivity between auditory and reward networks, but not others, could robustly predict subjective, physiological, and neurobiological aspects of the strong musical reward of chills. Specifically, the right auditory cortex-striatum/orbitofrontal connections predicted the reported duration of chills and the activation level of nucleus accumbens and insula, whereas the auditory-amygdala connection was associated with psychophysiological arousal. Furthermore, the predictive model derived from the first sample of individuals was generalized in an independent dataset using different music samples. The generalization was successful only for state-like, pre-listening functional connectivity but not for stable, intrinsic functional connectivity. The current study reveals the critical role of sensory-reward connectivity in pre-task brain state in modulating subsequent rewarding experience.

                Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) mainly affects the respiratory tract, but different organs may be involved including the kidney. Data on acute kidney injury (AKI) in critical forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce. We aimed to assess the incidence, risk factors and prognostic impact of AKI complicating critical forms of COVID-19. Methods A retrospective descriptive case/control monocentric study conducted in a medical intensive care unit of a tertiary teaching hospital over a period of 18 months. Results We enrolled 144 patients, with a mean age of 58±13 years old and a male predominance (sex-ratio: 1.25). Forty-one (28%) developed AKI within a median of 4 days (Q1: 3, Q3: 8.5) after hospitalization. It was staged KDIGO class 3, in about half of the cases. Thirteen patients underwent renal replacement therapy and renal function improved in seven cases. Diabetes (OR: 6.07; 95% CI: (1,30-28,4); p: 0.022), nephrotoxic antibiotics (OR: 21; 95% CI: (3,2-146); p: 0.002), and shock (OR: 12.21; 95% CI: (2.87-51.85); p: 0.031,) were the three independent risk factors of AKI onset. Mortality was significantly higher in AKI group (OR: 3.94; 95% CI: (1.65-9.43); p<10−3) but AKI didn’t appear to be an independent risk factor of poor outcome. In fact, age (p: 0.004), shock (p: 0.045) and MV (p<10−3) were the three prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. Conclusions The incidence of AKI was high in this study and associated to an increased mortality. Diabetes, use of nephrotoxic antibiotics and shock contributed significantly to its occurrence. This underlines the importance of rationalizing antibiotic prescription and providing adequate management of patients with hemodynamic instability in order to prevent consequent AKI.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-580/v2?src=rss">Use of pumice stone and silica fume as precursor material for the design of a geopolymer [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Geopolymers are alternative materials to cement because they require less energy in their production process; hence, they contribute to the reduction in CO2 emissions. This study aims to evaluate the possibility of using industrial residues such as silica fume (SF) to improve the physical and mechanical properties of a pumice stone (PS)-based geopolymer. Methods Through an experimental methodology, the process starts with the extraction, grinding, and sieving of the raw material to carry out the physical and chemical characterization of the resulting material, followed by the dosage of the geopolymer mixture considering the factors that influence the resistance mechanical strength. Finally, the physical and mechanical properties of the geopolymer were characterized. This research was carried out in four stages: characterization of the pumice stone, design of the geopolymer through laboratory tests, application according to the dosage of the concrete, and analysis of the data through a multi-criteria analysis. Results It was determined that the optimal percentage of SF replacement is 10%, which to improves the properties of the geopolymer allowing to reach a maximum resistance to compression and flexion of 14.10 MPa and 4.78 MPa respectively, showing that there is a direct relationship between the percentage of SF and the resistance. Conclusions Geopolymer preparation involves the use of PS powder with a composition rich in silicon and aluminum. The factors influencing strength include the ratio of sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide, water content, temperature, curing time, molarity of sodium hydroxide, and binder ratio. The results showed an increase in the compression and flexural strength with 10% SF replacement. The geopolymer’s maximum compressive strength indicates its non-structural use, but it can be improved by reducing the PS powder size.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-755/v2?src=rss">RBP-Tar – a searchable database for experimental RBP binding sites [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a critical role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific sites on RNA molecules. Identifying these binding sites is crucial for understanding the many functions of RBPs in cellular function, development and disease. Current experimental methods for identifying RBP binding sites, such as ultra-violet (UV) crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP), and especially the enhanced CLIP (eCLIP) protocol, were developed to identify authentic RBP binding sites experimentally. Methods: To make this data more accessible to the scientific community, we have developed RBP-Tar (https://ncbr.muni.cz/RBP-Tar), a web server and database that utilises eCLIP data for 167 RBPs mapped on the human genome. The web server allows researchers to easily search and retrieve binding site information by genomic location and RBP name. Use case: Researchers can produce lists of all known RBP binding sites on a gene of interest, or produce lists of binding sites for one RBP on different genomic loci. Conclusions: Our future goal is to continue to populate the web server with additional experimental datasets from CLIP experiments as they become available and processed, making it an increasingly valuable resource for the scientific community.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-918/v1?src=rss">Laboratory findings predictive of critical illness in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Tunisia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background COVID-19 disease has spread rapidly worldwide, causing high mortality. Accessible biomarkers capable of early identification of patients at risk of severe form are needed in clinical practice. The aim of the study was to determine the biological markers that predict a critical condition. Methods Retrospective study including patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized between September 2020 and June 2021. The primary endpoint was progression to critical status within 7 days from admission. We defined two groups: Critical group: Patients who developed a critical condition or died or transferred to the ICU before or at 7th day. Non-critical group: Patients who remained in non-critical respiratory status until 7th day or discharged before or at 7th day. Results Our study included 456 patients, with a sex ratio of 1.32 and an average age of 62 years. At the 7th day of hospitalization, 115 (25.2%) patients were in the critical group and 341 (74.8%) patients were in the non-critical group. The univariate logistic regression indicated that laboratory findings between non-critical and critical groups showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) (p=0.047), D-Dimer (p=0.011), creatinine (0.026), creatine kinase (p=0.039), lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.04), and troponin (p=0.001) were all higher among patients in critical group. However, lymphocyte (p<0.001) and platelet (p<0.001) counts were significantly lower among the critical group. Multivariate logistic regression model, identified four independent risk factors: lymphopenia (OR=2.771, 95%CI=1.482-5.181, p=0.001), Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (OR=2.286, 95%CI=1.461-3.578, p<0.001), thrombocytopenia (OR=1.944, 95%CI=1.092-3.459, p=0.024), and CRP>71.5 (OR=1.598, 95% CI=1.042-2.45, p=0.032) were associated to critical group. Conclusions Our results show the predictive value of some biological markers to evaluate the prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. A prognostic score could be proposed for guiding clinical care and improving patient outcomes.

                Background The World Health Organization recommends that Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) should be administered to all People living with Human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) not currently suffering from tuberculosis (TB) to reduce the incidence of the same. The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of PLHIV who contracted TB after receiving 6 months of IPT (followed up for ≥ 2 years), the incidence of PLHIV who developed tuberculosis when not on IPT, and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions due to IPT. Methods A Retrospective Cohort study was conducted in two ART centers in Mangalore, which included PLHIV who had completed 6 months of IPT from January 2017 to May 2018 and were followed up until May 2020; patients in the comparison group consisted of those attending ART centers during the same period who did not receive IPT. These data were retrieved from the case files of these patients from June to November 2020, entered into MS Excel, and analyzed using statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 25. Results The study included 1014 patients: 525 (51.8%) received IPT and 489 (48.2%) did not. Eight (1.5%) patients developed TB after IPT completion compared to 32 (6.5%) patients who developed TB from the non-IPT group. There was a 77% reduction in the incidence of developing TB in those patients who received IPT as compared to those who haven’t receive IPT (RR of 0.23, p value <0.0001). The reason for stopping IPT were due to side effects of IPT, experienced by 77 (14.6%) patients. Conclusions This study indicated that the completion of IPT significantly reduced the TB burden, showing significant protection against TB for a minimum duration of 2 years. Thus, implementation of IPT should be strengthened, and strict compliance should be ensured to reduce TB infection among PLHIV.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected global health systems and daily life, exacerbating vulnerabilities, particularly in Indonesia. This study investigates the impact of anxiety and education level on mental health, with spiritual intelligence as an intervening variable among post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional design was employed, analyzing data from 390 post-COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. Structured questionnaires were used to assess anxiety, education level, spiritual intelligence, and mental health. Results The findings indicate that anxiety significantly affects both spiritual intelligence and mental health, with spiritual intelligence acting as a mediating factor. Additionally, higher educational attainment is positively associated with enhanced spiritual intelligence and improved mental health outcomes. Conclusions The study underscores the importance of incorporating spiritual development practices into mental health interventions and educational programs to boost resilience and overall well-being in the post-pandemic era. These practices can help mitigate the adverse effects of anxiety and educational disparities on mental health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-974/v3?src=rss">Predictors of mortality for blunt trauma patients in intensive care: A retrospective cohort study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Major trauma places substantial demand on critical care services, is a leading cause of death in under 40-year-olds and causes significant morbidity and mortality across all age groups. Various factors influence patient outcome and predefining these could allow prognostication. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of mortality from major trauma in intensive care. Methods: This was a retrospective study of adult trauma patients admitted to general intensive care between January 2018 and December 2019. We assessed the impact on mortality of patient demographics, patterns of injury, injury scores (Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), Charlson’s comorbidity index (CCI), Acute Physiology and Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Probability of Survival Score (Ps19)), number of surgeries and mechanism of injury using logistic regression. Results: A total of 414 patients were included with a median age of 54 years (IQR 34–72). Overall mortality was 18.6%. The most common mechanism of injury was traffic collision (46%). Non-survivors were older, had higher ISS scores with lower GCS on admission and probability of survival scores. Factors independently predictive of mortality were increasing age (OR 1.06, p <0.001) and GCS <15 on admission (OR 7.21, p <0.001). Ps19 was the best predictor of mortality (p <0.001 for each score category), with an AUROC of 0.90. Conclusions: The significant mortality predictors were age, fall from <2 metres, injury of head or limbs, GCS <15 and Ps19. Contrary to previous studies CCI and APACHE II did not significantly predict mortality. Although Ps19 was found to be the best current prognostic score, trauma prognostication would benefit from a single validated scoring system incorporating both physiological variables and injury patterns.

                Evenly spaced “mosaics” of retinal neurons were discovered a century ago, but how mosaics form remains unknown. Here, Kozlowski et al. show that developing mouse starburst amacrine cells use MEGF10, a repulsive cell-surface molecule, to exclude neighboring somata from their dendritic territories. This repulsion establishes uniform spacing within the mosaic.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89926">Semaphorin7A patterns neural circuitry in the lateral line of the zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                In a developing nervous system, axonal arbors often undergo complex rearrangements before neural circuits attain their final innervation topology. In the lateral line sensory system of the zebrafish, developing sensory axons reorganize their terminal arborization patterns to establish precise neural microcircuits around the mechanosensory hair cells. However, a quantitative understanding of the changes in the sensory arbor morphology and the regulators behind the microcircuit assembly remain enigmatic. Here, we report that Semaphorin7A (Sema7A) acts as an important mediator of these processes. Utilizing a semi-automated three-dimensional neurite tracing methodology and computational techniques, we have identified and quantitatively analyzed distinct topological features that shape the network in wild-type and Sema7A loss-of-function mutants. In contrast to those of wild-type animals, the sensory axons in Sema7A mutants display aberrant arborizations with disorganized network topology and diminished contacts to hair cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of a secreted form of Sema7A by non-hair cells induces chemotropic guidance of sensory axons. Our findings propose that Sema7A likely functions both as a juxtracrine and as a secreted cue to pattern neural circuitry during sensory organ development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88733">Periaqueductal gray activates antipredatory neural responses in the amygdala of foraging rats</a></h4>

              
                Pavlovian fear conditioning research suggests that the interaction between the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) acts as a prediction error mechanism in the formation of associative fear memories. However, their roles in responding to naturalistic predatory threats, characterized by less explicit cues and the absence of reiterative trial-and-error learning events, remain unexplored. In this study, we conducted single-unit recordings in rats during an ‘approach food-avoid predator’ task, focusing on the responsiveness of dPAG and BLA neurons to a rapidly approaching robot predator. Optogenetic stimulation of the dPAG triggered fleeing behaviors and increased BLA activity in naive rats. Notably, BLA neurons activated by dPAG stimulation displayed immediate responses to the robot, demonstrating heightened synchronous activity compared to BLA neurons that did not respond to dPAG stimulation. Additionally, the use of anterograde and retrograde tracer injections into the dPAG and BLA, respectively, coupled with c-Fos activation in response to predatory threats, indicates that the midline thalamus may play an intermediary role in innate antipredatory-defensive functioning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92948">Prdm1 positively regulates liver Group 1 ILCs cancer immune surveillance and preserves functional heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                Group 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) comprise conventional natural killer (cNK) cells and type 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1s). The main functions of liver cNK cells and ILC1s not only include directly killing target cells but also regulating local immune microenvironment of the liver through the secretion of cytokines. Uncovering the intricate mechanisms by which transcriptional factors regulate and influence the functions of liver cNK cells and ILC1s, particularly within the context of liver tumors, presents a significant opportunity to amplify the effectiveness of immunotherapies against liver malignancies. Using Ncr1-drived conditional knockout mouse model, our study reveals the regulatory role of <i>Prdm1</i> in shaping the composition and maturation of cNK cells. Although <i>Prdm1</i> did not affect the killing function of cNK cells in an in vivo cytotoxicity model, a significant increase in cancer metastasis was observed in <i>Prdm1</i> knockout mice. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), granzyme B, and perforin secretion decreased significantly in <i>Prdm1</i>-deficient cNK cells and liver ILC1s. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data also provided evidences that Prdm1 maintains functional subsets of cNK cells and liver ILC1s and facilitates communications between cNK cells, liver ILC1s, and macrophages. The present study unveiled a novel regulatory mechanism of Prdm1 in cNK cells and liver ILC1s, showing promising potential for developing innovative immune therapy strategies against liver cancer.

">A novel candidate neuromarker of central motor dysfunction in childhood apraxia of speech</a></h4>

              
                Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is conceived as an impairment of the central motor system s ability to program multiple speech movements, resulting in inaccurate transitions between and relative timing across speech sounds. However, the extant neuroimaging evidence base is scant and inconclusive and the neurophysiological origins of these motor planning problems remain highly underspecified. In the first magnetoencephalography study of this disorder, we measured brain activity from typically developing children (N = 19) and children with CAS (N=7) during performance of a speech task designed to interrogate function of the speech areas of primary sensorimotor cortex. Relative to their typically developing peers, our sample of CAS children showed abnormal speech-related responses within the mu-band motor rhythm, and beamformer source reconstruction analyses specify a brain origin of this speech rhythm in the left cerebral hemisphere, within or near pre-Rolandic motor areas crucial for the planning and control of speech and oromotor movements. These results provide a new and specific candidate mechanism for the core praxic features of CAS point to a novel and robust neurophysiological marker of typical and atypical expressive speech development; and support an emerging neuroscientific consensus which assigns a central role for programming and coordination of speech movements to the motor cortices of the precentral gyrus.

">Genetic analysis of retinal cell types reveals synaptic pathology in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Importance: As an accessible part of the central nervous system, the retina provides a unique window to study pathophysiological mechanisms of brain disorders in humans. Imaging and electrophysiological studies have revealed retinal alterations across several neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. However, it remains largely unclear whether primary disease mechanisms within the retina contribute to the observed retinal alterations and which specific retinal cell types and biological mechanisms are involved. Objective: To determine whether specific retinal cell types are affected by genomic risk for neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders and to explore the mechanisms through which genomic risk converges in these cell types. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this study, we combined findings from genome-wide association studies in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and stroke with retinal single-cell transcriptomic data sets from humans, macaques, and mice. To identify susceptible cell types, we applied MAGMA cell type enrichment analyses and performed subsequent pathway analyses. Furthermore, we translated the cellular top hit to the structural level by using retinal optical coherence tomography and genotyping data in the large population-based UK Biobank cohort (n = 36,349). Main Outcomes and Measures: Cell type-specific enrichment of genetic risk loading for neuropsychiatric and neurological disorder traits in the gene expression profiles of retinal cells. Results: Amacrine cells (interneurons within the retina) were robustly enriched in schizophrenia genetic risk across mammalian species and in different developmental stages. This enrichment was primarily driven by genes involved in synapse biology. On the structural level, higher polygenic risk for schizophrenia was associated with thinning of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer, which contains dendrites and synaptic connections of amacrine cells. Moreover, retinal immune cell populations were enriched in multiple sclerosis genetic risk. No consistent cell type associations were found for bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Parkinson and Alzheimer disease, or stroke. Conclusions and Relevance: This study provides novel insights into the cellular underpinnings of retinal alterations in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders and highlights the retina as a potential proxy to study synaptic pathology in schizophrenia.

">Superiority of Rhythmic Auditory Signals over Electrical Stimulation to Entrain Behavior</a></h4>

              
                Neural tracking (entrainment) of auditory rhythms enhances perception. We previously demonstrated that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can enhance or suppress entrainment to rhythmic auditory stimuli, depending on the timing between the electrical and auditory signals, although tACS effects are primarily modulatory. This study further investigated entrainment to tACS and auditory rhythms when the electrical and auditory signals were presented together (Experiment 1, N = 34) or independently (Experiment 2, N = 24; Experiment 3, N = 12). We hypothesized that tACS effects would be more pronounced when the auditory rhythm was made less perceptually salient to reduce the competition with the electrical rhythm. Participants detected silent gaps in modulated or unmodulated noise stimuli. In Experiment 1, auditory stimuli predominated in entraining behavior. While behavioral entrainment to sound rhythms was affected by the modulation depth of the auditory stimulus, entrainment to tACS was not. In Experiment 2, with no rhythmic information from the sound, 16 of 24 participants showed significant behavioral entrainment to tACS, although the most effective tACS frequency varied across participants. An oscillator model with a free parameter for the individual resonance frequency produced profiles similar to those we observed behaviorally. In Experiment 3, both neural and behavioral entrainment to rhythmic sounds were affected by the auditory stimulus frequency, but again the most effective entraining frequency varied across participants. Our findings suggest that tACS effects depend on the individual's preferred frequency when there is no competition with sensory stimuli, emphasizing the importance of targeting individual frequencies in tACS experiments. When both sensory and electrical stimuli are rhythmic and compete, sensory stimuli prevail, indicating the superiority of sensory stimulation in modulating behavior.

">Microglia are Required for Developmental Specification of AgRP Innervation in the Hypothalamus of Offspring Exposed to Maternal High Fat Diet During Lactation</a></h4>

              
                Nutritional fluctuations that occur early in life dictate metabolic adaptations that will affect susceptibility to weight gain and obesity later in life. The postnatal period in mice represents a time of dynamic changes in hypothalamic development and maternal consumption of a high fat diet during the lactation period (MHFD) changes the composition of milk and leads to enhanced susceptibility to obesity in offspring. Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) react to changes in multiple metabolic signals and distribute neuroendocrine information to other brain regions, such as the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), which is known to integrate a variety of signals that regulate body weight. Development of neural projections from AgRP neurons to the PVH occurs during the lactation period and these projections are reduced in MHFD offspring, but underlying developmental mechanisms remain largely unknown. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system and are involved in refinement of neural connections and modulation of synaptic transmission. Because high fat diet exposure causes activation of microglia in adults, a similar activation may occur in offspring exposed to MHFD and play a role in sculpting hypothalamic feeding circuitry. Genetically targeted axonal labeling and immunohistochemistry were used to visualize AgRP axons and microglia in postnatal mice derived from MHFD dams and morphological changes quantified. The results demonstrate regionally localized changes to microglial morphology in the PVH of MHFD offspring that suggest enhanced surveillance activity, and are temporally restricted to the period when AgRP neurons innervate the PVH. In addition, axon labeling experiments confirm a significant decrease in AgRP innervation of the PVH in MHFD offspring and provide direct evidence of synaptic pruning of AgRP inputs to the PVH. Microglial depletion with the Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor PLX5622 determined that the decrease in AgRP innervation observed in MHFD offspring is dependent on microglia, and that microglia are required for weight gain that emerges as early as weaning in offspring of MHFD dams. However, these changes do not appear to be dependent on the degree of microglial mediated synaptic pruning. Together, these findings suggest that microglia are activated by exposure to MHFD and interact directly with AgRP axons during development to permanently alter their density, with implications for developmental programming of metabolic phenotype.

">EEG-based analysis of intrinsic brain network function in chronic pain: Insights from a comprehensive multi-data set study</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain is associated with alterations in brain function. A better understanding of these alterations might help to develop new approaches for the diagnosis, prediction, and treatment of chronic pain. Here, we analyzed associations between chronic pain and alterations of intrinsic brain network function using resting-state electroencephalography. We included data from 537 people with chronic pain obtained from various research groups worldwide. We found strong evidence for associations between pain intensity and intrinsic brain network connectivity, but the replicability of these associations in independent data was mostly low. However, a mega-analysis revealed associations of chronic pain with salience-somatomotor network connectivity at theta frequencies and with more complex patterns of intrinsic brain network connectivity. These findings provide novel insights into brain network function in chronic pain. Moreover, they highlight the need for collaborative multi-center studies, which can be guided by the present approach to promote replicability and consistency of findings.

">Modelling inflammation-induced peripheral sensitization in a dish - more complex than expected?</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral sensitization of nociceptors is believed to be a key driver of chronic pain states. Here, we sought to study the effects of a modified version of inflammatory soup on the excitability of human stem-cell derived sensory neurons. For this, we used a pre-existing and a novel stem cell line, modified to stably express the calcium sensor GCamP6f. Upon treatment with inflammatory soup, we observed no changes in neuronal transcription or functional responses upon calcium imaging, and only a very minor increase in resting membrane potential via whole cell patch clamping. Similarly small changes were observed when treating mouse primary sensory neurons with inflammatory soup. A semi-systematic re-examination of past literature further indicated that observed effects of inflammatory mediators on dissociated sensory neuron cultures are generally very small. We conclude that modelling inflammation-induced peripheral sensitization in vitro is non-trivial and will require careful selection of mediators and/or more complex, longitudinal multi-cellular setups. Especially in the latter, our novel GCamP6f induced-pluripotent stem cell line may be of value.

">The BDNF/TrkB pathway in Somatostatin-expressing neurons suppresses cocaine-seeking behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Cocaine addiction is a highly debilitating condition consisting of compulsive self-administration and seek for the substance of abuse, and its most challenging feature is the high rate of relapse. Addiction and relapse share similarities with neural plasticity which acts through the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and its receptor TrkB. Somatostatin (SST) expressing interneurons are involved in neuronal plasticity and are important in modulating cocaine-seeking behaviour in mice. We tested the role of TrkB in Somatostatin (SST)-expressing neurons in the extinction of cocaine-seeking behaviour, using mice in which TrkB has been knocked out specifically in SST neurons. We have observed that in these mice, once a cocaine-conditioned place preference is acquired, its extinction through seven days of extinction training is impaired, showing how this process relies on neural plasticity in SST neurons. When we promoted plasticity during extinction training using a light-activable TrkB in SST neurons in the prefrontal cortex of cocaine-conditioned mice, relapse of cocaine-seeking was prevented. Our data identify the critical role of TrkB-mediated plasticity within SST neurons in the extinction of and relapse to cocaine addiction.

">Mnemonic brain state engagement is diminished in healthy aging</a></h4>

              
                Healthy older adults typically show impaired episodic memory -- memory for when and where an event occurred -- but intact semantic memory -- knowledge for general information and facts. As older adults also have difficulty inhibiting the retrieval of prior knowledge from memory, their selective decline in episodic memory may be due to a tendency to over engage the retrieval state, a brain state in which attention is focused internally in an attempt to access prior knowledge. The retrieval state trades off with the encoding state, a brain state which supports the formation of new memories. Therefore, episodic memory declines in older adults may be the result of differential engagement in mnemonic brain states. Our hypothesis is that older adults are biased toward a retrieval state. We recorded scalp electroencephalography while young, middle-aged and older adults performed a memory task in which they were explicitly directed to either encode the currently presented object stimulus or retrieve a previously presented, categorically-related object stimulus. We used multivariate pattern analysis of spectral activity to decode engagement in the retrieval vs. encoding state. We find that all three age groups can follow top-down instructions to selectively engage in encoding or retrieval and that we can decode mnemonic states for all age groups. However, we find that mnemonic brain state engagement is diminished for older adults relative to middle-aged adults. Our interpretation is that a combination of executive control deficits and a modest bias to retrieve modulates older adults' mnemonic state engagement. Together, these findings suggest that differential mnemonic state engagement may underlie age-related memory changes.

">Longitudinal deformation based morphometry pipeline to study neuroanatomical differences in structural MRI based on SyN unbiased templates</a></h4>

              
                Morphometric measures in humans derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have provided important insights into brain differences and changes associated with development and disease in vivo. Deformation-based morphometry (DBM) is a registration-based technique that has been shown to be useful in detecting local volume differences and longitudinal brain changes while not requiring a priori segmentation or tissue classification. Typically, DBM measures are derived from registration to common template brain space (one-level DBM). Here, we present a two-level DBM technique: first, the Jacobian determinants are calculated for each individual input MRI at the subject level to capture longitudinal individual brain changes; then, in a second step, an unbiased common group space is created, and the Jacobians co registered to enable the comparison of individual morphological changes across subjects or groups. This two-level DBM is particularly suitable for capturing longitudinal intra-individual changes in vivo, as calculating the Jacobians within-subject space leads to superior accuracy. Using artificially induced volume differences, we demonstrate that this two-level DBM pipeline is 4.5x more sensitive in detecting longitudinal within-subject volume changes compared to a typical one-level DBM approach. It also captures the magnitude of the induced volume change much more accurately. Using 150 subjects from the OASIS-2 dataset, we demonstrate that the two-level DBM is superior in capturing cortical volume changes associated with cognitive decline across patients with dementia and cognitively healthy individuals. This pipeline provides researchers with a powerful tool to study longitudinal brain changes with superior accuracy and sensitivity. It is publicly available and has already been used successfully, proving its utility.

                Prospect theory has suggested that decisions reflect a bias toward avoidance of loss compared to equivalent gains. In our study we examine whether a similar bias is found in decisions regarding whether a loss associated stimulus or a gain associated stimulus is given priority in perception. We find that for most people, gains are given priority over loss in the decision of which of the two stimuli occurs first. We also ask whether gains are reflected in greater activity in limbic systems related to emotion. In an fMRI study, we find that most people show greater emotional response to gains, not losses. We consider how these findings might be related to risk aversion in studies of decision making.

">The role of TRPV4 in acute sleep deprivation-induced fear memory impairment</a></h4>

              
                Acute sleep deprivation (ASD) negatively impacts fear memory, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), a cation channel which is closely correlated with the concentration of Ca2+, and neuronal Ca2+ overloading is a crucial inducement of learning and memory impairment. This study utilized an acute sleep-deprived mouse model combined with fear conditioning to investigate these mechanisms. mRNA sequencing revealed increased expression of TRPV4 in mice with ASD-induced fear memory impairment. Notably, knockdown of TRPV4 reversed ASD-induced fear memory impairment. ASD leads to the increased concentration of Ca2+. Additionally, we observed a reduction in spine density and a significant decrease in postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), which is associated with synaptic plasticity, in sleep-deprived fear memory impairment mice. This indicates that ASD may cause overloaded Ca2+, disrupting synaptic plasticity and impairing fear memory. Moreover, TRPV4 knockdown significantly decreased Ca2+ concentration, mitigated the loss of dendritic spines and reduction of PSD95, contributing to the restoration of fear memory. These findings indicate a potential protective role of TRPV4 knockdown in counteracting ASD-induced fear memory deficits. Collectively, our results highlight that TRPV4 may be a potential therapeutic target in mediating fear memory impairment due to ASD and underscore the importance of sleep management for conditions like PTSD.

">A posture subspace in primary motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                To generate movements, the brain must combine information about movement goal and body posture. Motor cortex (M1) is a key node for the convergence of these information streams. How are posture and goal information organized within M1's activity to permit the flexible generation of movement commands? To answer this question, we recorded M1 activity while monkeys performed a variety of tasks with the forearm in a range of postures. We found that posture- and goal-related components of neural population activity were separable and resided in nearly orthogonal subspaces. The posture subspace was stable across tasks. Within each task, neural trajectories for each goal had similar shapes across postures. Our results reveal a simpler organization of posture information in M1 than previously recognized. The compartmentalization of posture and goal information might allow the two to be flexibly combined in the service of our broad repertoire of actions.

">Perceived multisensory common cause relations shape the ventriloquism effect but only marginally the trial-wise aftereffect</a></h4>

              
                Combining multisensory cues is fundamental for perception and action, and reflected by two frequently-studied phenomena: multisensory integration and sensory recalibration. In the context of audio-visual spatial signals, these are exemplified by the ventriloquism effect and its aftereffect. The ventriloquism effect occurs when the perceived location of a sound is biased by a concurrent visual stimulus, while the aftereffect manifests as a recalibration of sound localization after exposure to spatially discrepant stimuli. The relationship between these processes - whether recalibration is a direct consequence of integration or operates independently - remains debated. This study investigates the role of causal inference in these processes by examining whether trial-wise judgments of audio-visual stimuli as originating from a common cause influence both the ventriloquism effect and the immediate aftereffect. Using a spatial paradigm, participants made explicit judgments about the common cause of stimulus pairs, and their influence on both perceptual biases was assessed. Our results indicate that while multisensory integration is contingent on common cause judgments, the immediate recalibration effect is not. This suggests that recalibration can occur independently of the perceived commonality of the multisensory stimuli, challenging the notion that recalibration is solely a byproduct of integration.

">Time Makes Space: Emergence of Place Fields in Networks Encoding Temporally Continuous Sensory Experiences</a></h4>

              
                The vertebrate hippocampus is believed to use recurrent connectivity in area CA3 to support episodic memory recall from partial cues. This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated arenas. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as continuously varying, high-dimensional, sensory experience maps (spatially smoothed Gaussian random fields). Training our autoencoder to accurately pattern-complete and reconstruct sensory experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network's hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and d) slow representational drift of place fields. We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces.

">Brain-like border ownership signals support prediction of natural videos</a></h4>

              
                To make sense of visual scenes, the brain must segment foreground from background. This is thought to be facilitated by neurons in the primate visual system that encode border ownership (BOS), i.e. whether a local border is part of an object on one or the other side of the border. It is unclear how these signals emerge in neural networks without a teaching signal of what is foreground and background. In this study, we investigated whether BOS signals exist in PredNet, a self-supervised artificial neural network trained to predict the next image frame of natural video sequences. We found that a significant number of units in PredNet are selective for BOS. Moreover these units share several other properties with the BOS neurons in the brain, including robustness to scene variations that constitute common object transformations in natural videos, and hysteresis of BOS signals. Finally, we performed ablation experiments and found that BOS units contribute more to prediction than non-BOS units for videos with moving objects. Our findings indicate that BOS units are especially useful to predict future input in natural videos, even when networks are not required to segment foreground from background. This suggests that BOS neurons in the brain might be the result of evolutionary or developmental pressure to predict future input in natural, complex dynamic visual environments.

">Serpina1e mediates the exercise-induced enhancement of hippocampal memory</a></h4>

              
                The exercise induced enhancement of learning and memory is thought to be regulated by interactions between body and brain via secretory proteins in the blood plasma. Given the prominent role that skeletal muscle plays during exercise, the beneficial effects of exercise on cognitive functions appear to be mediated by muscle derived secretory factors including myokines. However, the specific myokines that exert beneficial effects on cognitive functions remain to be elucidated. Here, we reveal that a novel myokine, Serpina1e, acts a molecular mediator that directly supports long term memory formation in the hippocampus. Using an in vivo myokine labeling mouse model, proteomic analysis revealed that the Serpina1 family of proteins are the myokines whose levels increased the most in plasma after chronic aerobic exercise for 4 weeks. Systemic delivery of recombinant Serpina1e into sedentary mice was sufficient for reproducing the beneficial effect of exercise on hippocampus associated cognitive functions. Moreover, plasma Serpina1e can cross the blood cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) barrier and blood brain barrier to reach the brain, thereby influencing hippocampal function. Indeed, an increase in the plasma level of Serpina1e promoted hippocampal neurogenesis, increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and induced neurite growth. Our findings reveal that Serpina1e is a myokine that migrates to the brain and mediates exercise induced memory enhancement by triggering neurotrophic growth signaling in the hippocampus. This discovery elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of exercise on cognitive function and may have implications for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for alleviating cognitive disorders.

">Local Synthesis of Reticulon-1C Lessens the Outgrowth of Injured Axons by Controlling Spastin Activity</a></h4>

              
                The regenerative potential of developing cortical axons following injury depends on intrinsic mechanisms, such as axon-autonomous protein synthesis, that are still not fully understood. An emerging factor in this regenerative process is the bi-directional interplay between microtubule dynamics and structural proteins of the axonal endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, we hypothesize that locally synthesized structural proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum may regulate microtubule dynamics and the outgrowth of injured cortical axons. This hypothesis is supported by RNA data-mining, which identified Reticulon-1 as the sole ER-shaping protein consistently present in axonal transcriptomes and found it to be downregulated following cortical axon injury. Using compartmentalized microfluidic chambers, we demonstrate that local knockdown of Reticulon-1 mRNA enhances outgrowth while reducing the distal tubulin levels of injured cortical axons. Additionally, live cell imaging shows injury-induced reductions in microtubule growth rate and length, which are fully restored by axonal Reticulon-1 knockdown. Interestingly, axonal inhibition of the microtubule-severing protein Spastin fully prevents the effects of local Reticulon-1 knockdown on outgrowth and tubulin levels, while not affecting microtubule dynamics. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting that the Reticulon-1C isoform is locally synthesized in injured axons and associates with Spastin to inhibit its severing activity. Our findings reveal a novel injury-dependent mechanism in which a locally synthesized ER-shaping protein lessens microtubule dynamics and the outgrowth of cortical axons.

">Efficient modular system identification provides a high-resolution assay of temporal processing and reveals the multilevel effects of attention along the human auditory pathway</a></h4>

              
                Human studies of auditory temporal processing and the effects therein of aging, hearing loss, musicianship, and other auditory processing disorders have conventionally employed brainstem evoked potentials (e.g., FFRs/EFRs targeting specific modulation frequencies). Studies of temporal processing in forebrain structures are fewer and are often restricted to the 40 Hz steady-state response. One factor contributing to the limited investigation is the lack of a fast and reliable method to characterize temporal processing non-invasively in humans over a wide range of modulation frequencies. Here, we use a system-identification approach where white noise, modulated using an extended maximum-length sequence (em-seq), is employed to target stimulus energy toward a modulation-frequency range of interest and efficiently obtain a robust auditory modulation-temporal response function or `mod-TRF'. The mod-TRF can capture activity from sources in the early processing pathway (5-7 ms latency), middle-latency region (MLR), and late latency region (LLR). The mod-TRF is a high-resolution, modular assay of the temporal modulation transfer function (tMTF) in that the distinct neural components contributing to the tMTF can be separated on the basis of their latency, modulation frequency band, and scalp topography. This decomposition provides the insight that the seemingly random individual variation in the shape of the tMTF can be understood as arising from individual differences in the weighting and latency of similar underlying neural sources in the composite scalp response. We measured the mod-TRF under different states of attention and found a reduction in latency or enhancement of amplitude of the response from specific sources. Surprisingly, we found that attention effects can extend to the earliest parts of the processing pathway (~5ms) in highly demanding tasks. Taken together, the mod-TRF is a promising tool for dissecting auditory temporal processing and obtain further insight into a variety of phenomenon such as aging, hearing loss, and neural pathology.

">Subsets of extraocular motoneurons produce kinematically distinct saccades during hunting and exploration.</a></h4>

              
                Animals construct diverse behavioural repertoires by moving a limited number of body parts with varied kinematics and patterns of coordination. There is evidence that distinct movements can be generated by changes in activity dynamics within a common pool of motoneurons, or by selectively engaging specific subsets of motoneurons in a task-dependent manner. However, in most cases we have an incomplete understanding of the patterns of motoneuron activity that generate distinct actions and how upstream premotor circuits select and assemble such motor programmes. In this study, we used two closely related but kinematically distinct types of saccadic eye movement in larval zebrafish as a model to examine circuit control of movement diversity. In contrast to the prevailing view of a final common pathway, we found that in oculomotor nucleus, distinct subsets of motoneurons were engaged for each saccade type. This type-specific recruitment was topographically organised and aligned with ultrastructural differences in motoneuron morphology and afferent synaptic innervation. Medially located motoneurons were active for both saccade types and circuit tracing revealed a type-agnostic premotor pathway that appears to control their recruitment. By contrast, a laterally located subset of motoneurons was specifically active for hunting-associated saccades and received premotor input from pretectal hunting command neurons. Our data support a model in which generalist and action-specific premotor pathways engage distinct subsets of motoneurons to elicit varied movements of the same body part that subserve distinct behavioural functions.

">Functional Electrical Stimulation and Brain-Machine Interfaces for Simultaneous Control of Wrist and Finger Flexion</a></h4>

              
                Brain-machine interface (BMI) controlled functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a promising treatment to restore hand movements to people with cervical spinal cord injury. Recent intracortical BMIs have shown unprecedented successes in decoding user intentions, however the hand movements restored by FES have largely been limited to predetermined grasps. Restoring dexterous hand movements will require continuous control of many biomechanically linked degrees-of-freedom in the hand, such as wrist and finger flexion, that would form the basis of those movements. Here we investigate the ability to restore simultaneous wrist and finger flexion, which would enable grasping with a controlled hand posture and assist in manipulating objects once grasped. We demonstrate that intramuscular FES can enable monkeys with temporarily paralyzed hands to move their fingers and wrist across a functional range of motion, spanning an average 88.6 degrees at the metacarpophalangeal joint flexion and 71.3 degrees of wrist flexion, and intramuscular FES can control both joints simultaneously in a real-time task. Additionally, we demonstrate a monkey using an intracortical BMI to control the wrist and finger flexion in a virtual hand, both before and after the hand is temporarily paralyzed, even achieving success rates and acquisition times equivalent to able-bodied control with BMI control after temporary paralysis in two sessions. Together, this outlines a method using an artificial brain-to-body interface that could restore continuous wrist and finger movements after spinal cord injury.

">YTHDF1 mediates translational control by m6A mRNA methylation in adaptation to environmental challenges</a></h4>

              
                Animals adapt to environmental challenges with long-term changes at the behavioral, circuit, cellular, and synaptic levels which often require new protein synthesis. The discovery of reversible N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications of mRNA has revealed an important layer of post-transcriptional regulation which affects almost every phase of mRNA metabolism and therefore translational control. Many in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the significant role of m6A in cell differentiation and survival, but its role in adult neurons is understudied. We used cell-type specific gene deletion of Mettl14, which encodes one of the subunits of the m6A methyltransferase, and Ythdf1, which encodes one of the cytoplasmic m6A reader proteins, in dopamine D1 receptor expressing or D2 receptor expressing neurons. Mettl14 or Ythdf1 deficiency blunted responses to environmental challenges at the behavioral, cellular, and molecular levels. In three different behavioral paradigms, gene deletion of either Mettl14 or Ythdf1 in D1 neurons impaired D1-dependent learning, whereas gene deletion of either Mettl14 or Ythdf1 in D2 neurons impaired D2-dependent learning. At the cellular level, modulation of D1 and D2 neuron firing in response to changes in environments was blunted in all three behavioral paradigms in mutant mice. Ythdf1 deletion resembled impairment caused by Mettl14 deletion in a cell type-specific manner, suggesting YTHDF1 is the main mediator of the functional consequences of m6A mRNA methylation in the striatum. At the molecular level, while striatal neurons in control mice responded to elevated cAMP by increasing de novo protein synthesis, striatal neurons in Ythdf1 knockout mice didn't. Finally, boosting dopamine release by cocaine drastically increased YTHDF1 binding to many mRNA targets in the striatum, especially those that encode structural proteins, suggesting the initiation of long-term neuronal and/or synaptic structural changes. While the m6A-YTHDF1 pathway has similar functional significance at cellular level, its cell type specific deficiency in D1 and D2 neurons often resulted in contrasting behavioral phenotypes, allowing us to cleanly dissociate the opposing yet cooperative roles of D1 and D2 neurons.

	<p>Background: The purpose of this study was to explore the specific regions of abnormal cortical communication efficiency in patients with mild subcortical stroke and to investigate the relationship between these communication efficiency abnormalities and multidimensional cognition. Methods: The research involved 35 patients with mild strokes affecting the basal ganglia and 29 healthy controls (HC). Comprehensive neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessments were conducted. Stroke patients were categorized into post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) (MoCA &amp;amp;le; 22) and non-cognitively impaired stroke patients (NPSCI) (MoCA &amp;amp;ge; 23) based on their cognitive performance. Additionally, 22 patients were reassessed three months later. Results: PSCI patients, compared to HC and NPSCI groups, had significantly higher communication efficiency in specific brain regions. A notable finding was the significant correlation between increased communication efficiency in the medioventral occipital cortex and multidimensional cognitive decline. However, this increased communication efficiency in PSCI patients lessened during the three-month follow-up period. Conclusions: the heightened communication efficiency in the medio-ventral occipital cortex may represent a compensatory mechanism for cognitive impairment in PSCI patients, which undergoes adjustment three months after stroke.</p>

	<p>Diet-induced obesity is a global phenomenon that affects the population worldwide with manifestations at both the phenotypic and genotypic levels. Cognitive function decline is a major global health challenge. The relation between obesity and cognitive function is a debatable issue. The main goal of the current research was to study the implications of obesity on cognitive function and gut microbiota diversity and its impact on plasma and brain metabolic parameters in rats. Obesity was induced in rats by feeding on a high-fat (HF) or a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet. The results reveal that both the HF (0.683) and HFHS (0.688) diets were effective as obesity inducers, which was confirmed by a significant increase in the body mass index (BMI). Both diet groups showed dyslipidemia and elevation of oxidative stress, insulin resistance (IR), and inflammatory markers with alterations in liver and kidney functions. Obesity led to a reduction in cognitive function through a reduction in short-term memory by 23.8% and 30.7% in the rats fed HF and HFHS diets, respectively, and learning capacity and visuo-spatial memory reduced by 8.9 and 9.7 s in the rats fed an HF or HFHS diet, respectively. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Spirochaetes phyla were detected. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B) significantly decreased in the HF group, while it increased in the HFHS group compared to the normal control. The two species, Bacteroides acidifaciens and Bacteroides ovatus, which are associated with IR, were drastically compromised by the high-fat/high-sucrose diet. Some species that have been linked to reduced inflammation showed a sharp decrease in the HFHS group, while Prevotella copri, which is linked to carbohydrate metabolism, was highly enriched. In conclusion: Obesity led to cognitive impairment through changes in short-term and visuo-spatial memory. A metagenomic analysis revealed alterations in the abundance of some microbial taxa associated with obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance in the HF and HFHS groups.</p>

">Relative phase of distributed oscillatory dynamics implements a working memory in a simple brain</a></h4>

              
                We report the existence of a working memory system in the nematode C. elegans that is employed for deferred action in a sensory-guided decision-making process. We find that the turn direction of discrete reorientations during navigation is under sensory-guided control and relies on a working memory that can persist over an intervening behavioral sequence. This memory system is implemented by the phasic interaction of two distributed oscillatory dynamical components. The interaction of oscillatory neural ensembles may be a conserved primitive of cognition across the animal kingdom.

">AmygdalaGo-BOLT3D: A boundary learning transformer for tracing human amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Automated amygdala segmentation is one of the most common tasks in human neuroscience research. However, due to the small volume of the human amygdala, especially in developing brains, the precision and consistency of the segmentation results are often affected by individual differences and inconsistencies in data distribution. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm for learning boundary contrast of 427 manually traced amygdalae in children and adolescents to generate a transformer, AmygdalaGo-BOLT3D, for automatic segmentation of human amygdala. This method focuses on the boundary to effectively address the issue of false positive recognition and inaccurate edges due to small amygdala volume. Firstly, AmygdalaGo-BOLT3D develops a basic architecture for an adaptive cooperation network with multiple granularities. Secondly, AmygdalaGo-BOLT3D builds the self-attention-based consistency module to address generalizability problems arising from individual differences and inconsistent data distributions. Third, AmygdalaGo-BOLT3D adapts the original sample-mask model for the amygdala scene, which consists of three parts, namely a lightweight volumetric feature encoder, a 3D cue encoder, and a volume mask decoder, to improve the generalized segmentation of the model. Finally, AmygdalaGo-BOLT3D implements a boundary contrastive learning framework that utilizes the interaction mechanism between a prior cue and the embedded magnetic resonance images to achieve effective integration between the two. Experimental results demonstrate that predictions of the overall structure and boundaries of the human amygdala exhibit highly improved precision and help maintain stability in multiple age groups and imaging centers. This verifies the stability and generalization of the algorithm designed for multiple tasks. AmygdalaGo-BOLT3D has been deployed for the community (GITHUB_LINK) to provide an open science foundation for its applications in population neuroscience.

">Neural Sequences Underlying Directed Turning in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Complex behaviors like navigation rely on sequenced motor outputs that combine to generate effective movement. The brain-wide organization of the circuits that integrate sensory signals to select and execute appropriate motor sequences is not well understood. Here, we characterize the architecture of neural circuits that control C. elegans olfactory navigation. We identify error-correcting turns during navigation and use whole-brain calcium imaging and cell-specific perturbations to determine their neural underpinnings. These turns occur as motor sequences accompanied by neural sequences, in which defined neurons activate in a stereotyped order during each turn. Distinct neurons in this sequence respond to sensory cues, anticipate upcoming turn directions, and drive movement, linking key features of this sensorimotor behavior across time. The neuromodulator tyramine coordinates these sequential brain dynamics. Our results illustrate how neuromodulation can act on a defined neural architecture to generate sequential patterns of activity that link sensory cues to motor actions.

	<p>The distinct clinical and radiological characteristics of right temporal variant FTD have only been recently recognized. Methods: Eight patients with right temporal variant FTD were prospectively recruited and underwent a standardised neuropsychological assessment, clinical MRI, and quantitative neuroimaging. Results: Our voxelwise grey analyses captured bilateral anterior and mesial temporal grey matter atrophy with a clear right-sided predominance. Bilateral hippocampal involvement was also observed, as well as disease burden in the right insular and opercula regions. White matter integrity alterations were also bilateral in anterior temporal and sub-insular regions with a clear right-hemispheric predominance. Extra-temporal white matter alterations have also been observed in orbitofrontal and parietal regions. Significant bilateral but right-predominant thalamus, putamen, hippocampus, and amygdala atrophy was identified based on subcortical segmentation. The clinical profile of our patients was dominated by progressive indifference, decline in motivation, loss of interest in previously cherished activities, incremental social withdrawal, difficulty recognising people, progressive language deficits, increasingly rigid routines, and repetitive behaviours. Conclusions: Right temporal variant FTD has an insidious onset and may be mistaken for depression at symptom onset. It manifests in a combination of apathy, language, and behavioural features. Quantitative MR imaging captures a characteristic bilateral but right-predominant temporal imaging signature with extra-temporal frontal and parietal involvement.</p>

	<p>Background: Anticholinergic adverse effects pose a relevant threat to patients, in particular elderly and cognitively impaired patients. Patients with Parkinsonian syndromes are especially at risk from anticholinergic adverse effects due to the often-required complex drug therapy. Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effect of the anticholinergic burden on motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease and atypical Parkinsonian syndromes. Methods: This cross-sectional, monocentric retrospective data analysis included 151 patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), 63 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and 36 with multiple system atrophy (MSA). The anticholinergic burden of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; medications was determined using two established scores: the Anticholinergic Drug Scale (ADS) and the German Anticholinergic Burden Scale (GABS). These scores were compared between the different diseases and correlated with several disease-specific scores. Results: Anticholinergic burden was higher in patients with PD, in particular, compared to PSP. In the PD group, anticholinergic burden showed a weak correlation with almost all analyzed clinical scores and the number of administered drugs. The UMSARS I and II showed a significant correlation with the anticholinergic burden in MSA patients. In general, the GABS-measured anticholinergic burden was significantly higher compared to the ADS-measured. Conclusions: The calculated anticholinergic burden affected motor and non-motor symptoms in patients with various Parkinsonian syndromes poorly. Since the GABS also contains basic anti-parkinsonian drugs, this score tended to overestimate the anticholinergic burden in patients with Parkinsonian syndromes and, therefore, seemed less appropriate for this application.</p>

                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex condition that can resolve over time but all too often leads to persistent symptoms, and the risk of poor patient outcomes increases with aging. TBI damages neurons and long axons within white matter tracts that are critical for communication between brain regions; this causes slowed information processing and neuronal circuit dysfunction. This review focuses on white matter injury after TBI and the multifactorial processes that underlie white matter damage, potential for recovery, and progression of degeneration. A multiscale perspective across clinical and preclinical advances is presented to encourage interdisciplinary insights from whole-brain neuroimaging of white matter tracts down to cellular and molecular responses of axons, myelin, and glial cells within white matter tissue.

">Neural Mechanism Underlying Successful Classification of Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment Using Multi-Sensory-Evoked Potentials</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The diagnosis, prognosis, and management of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) remains challenging. Early detection of aMCI is crucial for timely interventions. Method: This study combines scalp recordings of auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli with a flexible and interpretable support vector machine classification pipeline to differentiate individuals diagnosed with aMCI from healthy controls. Results: Event-related potentials (ERPs) and functional connectivity (FC) matrices from each modality successfully predicted aMCI. We got optimal classification accuracy (96.1%), sensitivity (97.7%) and specificity (94.3%) when combining information from all sensory conditions than when using information from a single modality. Reduced ERP amplitude, higher FC in frontal region which predicted worse cognitive performance, and lower FC in posterior regions from delta to alpha frequency in aMCI contributed to classification. Conclusions: The results highlight the clinical potential of sensory-evoked potentials in detecting aMCI, with optimal classification using both amplitude and oscillatory-based FC measures from multiple modalities.

">The inattentional rhythm in audition</a></h4>

              
                The detection of temporally unpredictable visual targets depends on the preceding phase of alpha oscillations (~7-12 Hz). In audition, however, such an effect seemed to be absent. Due to the transient nature of its input, the auditory system might be particularly vulnerable to information loss that occurs if relevant information coincides with the low excitability phase of the oscillation. We therefore hypothesised that effects of oscillatory phase in audition will be restored if auditory events are made task-irrelevant and information loss can be tolerated. To this end, we collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from 29 human participants (21F) while they detected pure tones at one sound frequency and ignored others. Confirming our hypothesis, we found that the neural response to task-irrelevant but not to task-relevant tones depends on the pre-stimulus phase of neural oscillations. Alpha oscillations modulated early stages of stimulus processing, whereas theta oscillations (~3-7 Hz) affected later components, possibly related to distractor inhibition. We also found evidence that alpha oscillations alternate between sound frequencies during divided attention. Together, our results suggest that the efficacy of auditory oscillations depends on the context they operate in, and demonstrate how they can be employed in a system that heavily relies on information unfolding over time.

">Type I TARPs regulate Kv7.2 potassium channels andsusceptibility to seizures</a></h4>

              
                The M-current is a low-threshold potassium current that modulates neuronal excitability and suppresses repetitive firing. However, the mechanisms regulating M-channel function remain unclear. We identified type I Transmembrane AMPA receptor Regulatory Proteins (TARPs) as M-channel Kv7.2 subunit interactors in cortical neurons, with their interaction increasing upon neuronal depolarization. Co-expression of TARPs with Kv7.2 increased channel surface expression and Kv7.2-mediated currents, while disrupting TARP-{gamma}2 expression in neurons perturbed dendritic Kv7.2 nano-clusters and decreased M-currents. Knock-in mice with an intellectual disability-associated TARP-{gamma}2 variant showed reduced hippocampal M-currents and increased seizure susceptibility, indicating that disrupting TARP-{gamma}2 regulation of Kv7.2-M-channels is epileptogenic. These findings show that TARP-{gamma}2, a synaptic protein crucial for excitatory transmission, also controls intrinsic excitability via M-channels. This discovery provides a link between synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability, with implications for disease, as the interplay between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity is pivotal to how the brain adapts to varying input signals.

">Correlation and Matching Representations of Binocular Disparity across the Human Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Seeing three-dimensional objects requires multiple stages of representational transformation, beginning in the primary visual cortex (V1). Here, neurons compute binocular disparity from the left and right retinal inputs through a mechanism similar to local cross-correlation. However, correlation-based representation is ambiguous because it is sensitive to disparities in both similar and dissimilar features between the eyes. Along the visual pathways, the representation transforms to a cross-matching basis, eliminating responses to falsely matched disparities. We investigated this transformation across the human visual areas using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computational modeling. By fitting a linear weighted sum of cross-correlation and cross-matching model representations to the brain's representational structure of disparity, we found that areas V1-V3 exhibited stronger cross-correlation components, V3A/B, V7, and hV4 were slightly inclined towards cross-matching, and hMT+ was strongly engaged in cross-matching. To explore the underlying mechanism, we identified a deep neural network optimized for estimating disparity in natural scenes that matched human depth judgment in the random-dot stereograms used in the fMRI experiments. Despite not being constrained to match fMRI data, the network units' responses progressed from cross-correlation to cross-matching across layers. Activation maximization analysis on the network suggests that the transformation incorporates three phases, each emphasizing different aspects of binocular similarity and dissimilarity for depth extraction. Our findings suggest a systematic distribution of both components throughout the visual cortex, with cross-matching playing a greater role in areas anterior to V3, and that the transformation exploits responses to false matches rather than discarding them.

">Spatial transcriptomic data reveals pure cell types via the mosaic hypothesis</a></h4>

              
                Neurons display remarkable diversity in their anatomical, molecular, and physiological properties. Although observed stereotypy in subsets of neurons is a pillar of neuroscience, clustering in high-dimensional feature spaces, such as those defined by single cell RNA-seq data, is often inconclusive and cells seemingly occupy continuous, rather than discrete, regions. In the retina, a layered structure, neurons of the same discrete type avoid spatial proximity with each other. While this principle, which is independent of clustering in feature space, has been a gold standard for retinal cell types, its applicability to the cortex has been only sparsely explored. Here, we provide evidence for such a mosaic hypothesis by developing a statistical point process analysis framework for spatial transcriptomic data. We demonstrate spatial avoidance across many excitatory and inhibitory neuronal types. Spatial avoidance disappears when cell types are merged, potentially offering a gold standard metric for evaluating the purity of putative cell types.

">Lipidomic and Proteomic Insights from Extracellular Vesicles in Postmortem Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Reveal Substance Use Disorder-Induced Brain Changes</a></h4>

              
                Substance use disorder (SUD) significantly increases the risk of neurotoxicity, inflammation, oxidative stress, and impaired neuroplasticity. The activation of inflammatory pathways by substances may lead to glial activation and chronic neuroinflammation, potentially mediated by the release of extracellular particles (EPs), such as extracellular condensates (ECs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs). These particles, which reflect the physiological, pathophysiological, and metabolic states of their cells of origin, might carry molecular signatures indicative of SUD. In particular, our study investigated neuroinflammatory signatures in SUD by isolating EVs from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) Brodmann's area 9 (BA9) in postmortem subjects. We isolated BA9-derived EVs from postmortem brain tissues of eight individuals (controls: n=4, SUD: n=4). The EVs were analyzed for physical properties (concentration, size, zeta potential, morphology) and subjected to integrative multi-omics analysis to profile the lipidomic and proteomic characteristics. We assessed the interactions and bioactivity of EVs by evaluating their uptake by glial cells. We further assessed the effects of EVs on complement mRNA expression in glial cells as well as their effects on microglial migration. No significant differences in EV concentration, size, zeta potential, or surface markers were observed between SUD and control groups. However, lipidomic analysis revealed significant enrichment of glycerophosphoinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) in SUD EVs. Proteomic analysis indicates downregulation of SERPINB12, ACYP2, CAMK1D, DSC1, and FLNB, and upregulation of C4A, C3, and ALB in SUD EVs. Gene ontology and protein-protein interactome analyses highlight functions such as cell motility, focal adhesion, and acute phase response signaling that is associated with the identified proteins. Both control and SUD EVs increased C3 and C4 mRNA expression in microglia, but only SUD EVs upregulated these genes in astrocytes. SUD EVs also significantly enhanced microglial migration in a wound healing assay.This study successfully isolated EVs from postmortem brains and used a multi-omics approach to identify EV-associated lipids and proteins in SUD. Elevated C3 and C4 in SUD EVs and the distinct effects of EVs on glial cells suggest a crucial role in acute phase response signaling and neuroinflammation.

	<p>Suicidality in adolescents has been associated with emotional distress, stressful life events, relationship issues, and nightmares to name a few. This study explored the actual dream content and the mood at pre-sleep, during a reported dream, and in the morning in 33 adolescents admitted to the hospital on account of a suicide attempt. In all aspects, hospitalized adolescents were compared to 33 matched adolescents who had followed the same protocol. In accordance with the Continuity and the Threat Simulation theories of dream formation, it was hypothesized that the waking-life experiences of suicidal adolescents would transpire in both dream mood and content as well as in the frequency of nightmares. Dreams were analyzed by independent judges using traditional dream content scales, including for the presence of negative and destructive themes and types of interpersonal relationships. As predicted, more suicidal adolescents experienced frequent nightmares, which was significant. A higher negative mood at pre-sleep, within dreams, and at post-sleep was also observed. Furthermore, their dreams contained a higher prevalence of destructive themes and failures, as well as self-directed and death-resulting aggressions. Regression analyses indicated that morning mood was most accurately predicted by positive and negative dream mood in the normative adolescents, whereas only negative dream mood appeared to predict subsequent waking affect in suicidal participants. Our results underline the valuable potential of implementing nightmare-reducing therapies in the presence of suicidal adolescents who suffer from frequent nightmares.</p>

	<p>Mental fatigue is a variation in the psychophysiological state that subjects encounter during or after prolonged cognitive activity periods, affecting top-down attention and cognitive control. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of mental fatigue on attention in the context of the three attention networks according to the Posnerian model (alerting, orienting, and executive networks) by combining the Attentional Network Test (ANT) and event-related potentials technique. Thirty healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. A continuous arithmetic task lasting one hour induced mental fatigue, and EEG recordings were conducted before and after the task while subjects were performing the ANT. The efficiencies of three networks were comparable between groups, while RTs shortened only in the control group and the accuracy related to the alerting and conflict networks declined only after mental effort. Mental fatigue reduced N1 amplitude during alerting network engagement and p3 amplitude during orienting. It also reduced N2 and P3 amplitude during the conflict, particularly the incongruent target-locked response. These findings underscore the covert effects of mental fatigue on attention, suggesting that even in healthy young subjects, compensatory mechanisms may maintain adequate overt performances, but fatigue still has a detrimental effect on top-down attentional mechanisms.</p>

	<p>The presence of artificial light at night has emerged as an anthropogenic stressor in recent years. Various sources of light pollution have been shown to affect circadian physiology with serious consequences for metabolic pathways, possibly disrupting pineal melatonin production with multiple adverse health effects. The suppression of melatonin at night may also affect human mental health and contribute to the development or exacerbation of psychiatric disorders in vulnerable individuals. Due to the high burden of circadian disruption in affective disorders, it has been hypothesized that light pollution impacts mental health, mainly affecting mood regulation. Hence, the aim of this review was to critically summarize the evidence on the effects of light pollution on mood symptoms, with a particular focus on the role of circadian rhythms in mediating this relationship. We conducted a narrative review of the literature in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science datasets. After the screening process, eighteen papers were eligible for inclusion. The results clearly indicate a link between light pollution and the development of affective symptoms, with a central role of sleep disturbances in the emergence of mood alterations. Risk perception also represents a crucial topic, possibly modulating the development of affective symptoms in response to light pollution. The results of this review should encourage a multidisciplinary approach to the design of healthier environments, including lighting conditions among the key determinants of human mental health.</p>

                <p>The electrophysiological response to rewards recorded during laboratory tasks has been well documented, yet little is known about the neural response patterns in a more naturalistic setting. Here, we combined a mobile-EEG system with an augmented reality headset to record event-related brain potentials (ERPs) while participants engaged in a naturalistic operant task to find rewards. Twenty-five participants were asked to navigate toward a west or east goal location marked by floating orbs, and once participants reached the goal location, the orb would then signify a reward (5 cents) or no-reward (0 cents) outcome. Following the outcome, participants returned to a start location marked by floating purple rings, and once standing in the middle, a 3 s counter signaled the next trial, for a total of 200 trials. Consistent with previous research, reward feedback evoked the reward positivity, an ERP component believed to index the sensitivity of the anterior cingulate cortex to reward prediction error signals. The reward positivity peaked ~230 ms with a maximal at channel FCz (M = &ndash;0.695 &mu;V, &plusmn;0.23) and was significantly different than zero (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.01). Participants took ~3.38 s to reach the goal location and exhibited a general lose-shift (68.3% &plusmn;3.5) response strategy and posterror slowing. Overall, these novel findings provide support for the idea that combining mobile-EEG with augmented reality technology is a feasible solution to enhance the ecological validity of human electrophysiological studies of goal-directed behavior and a step toward a new era of human cognitive neuroscience research that blurs the line between laboratory and reality.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-915/v1?src=rss">Publisher preferences for a journal transparency tool: A modified three-round Delphi study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background We propose the creation of a journal transparency tool (JTT), which will allow users to obtain information about a given scholarly journal’s operations and policies. We are obtaining preferences from different stakeholders to inform the development of this tool. This study aimed to identify the publishing community’s preferences for the JTT. Methods We conducted a modified three-round Delphi survey. Representatives from publishing houses and journal publishers were recruited through purposeful and snowball sampling. The first two Delphi rounds involved an online survey with items about JTT metrics and user features. During the third round, participants discussed and voted on JTT metric items that did not reach consensus after round 2 within a virtual consensus meeting. We defined consensus as 80% agreement to include or exclude an item in the JTT. Results Eighty-six participants completed the round 1 survey, and 43 participants (50% of round 1) completed the round 2 survey. In both rounds, respondents voted on JTT user feature and JTT metric item preferences and answered open-ended survey questions regarding the JTT. In round 3, a total of 21 participants discussed and voted on JTT metric items that did not reach consensus after round 2 during an online consensus group meeting. Fifteen out of 30 JTT metric items and none of the four JTT user feature items reached the 80% consensus threshold after all rounds of voting. Analysis of the round 3 online consensus group transcript resulted in two themes: ‘factors impacting support for JTT metrics’ and ‘suggestions for user clarity.’ Conclusions Participants suggested that the publishing community’s primary concerns for a JTT are to ensure that the tool is relevant, user-friendly, accessible, and equitable. The outcomes of this research will contribute to developing and refining the tool in accordance with publishing preferences.

                Background Anxiety has been reported to be one of the most common epidemics in recent years. The present study focused on understanding the association between early menarche and the prevalence of anxiety and anxiety symptoms among adult undergraduate students. Methods This was an observational, case-control study. The sample included 146 young female adults aged more than or equal to 18 years pursuing the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) and Bachelor of Dental Sciences (BDS). Using an online questionnaire, participants were asked to recall and enter the age at which they attained menarche. We used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7- Item Questionnaire (GAD-7) to measure the severity of their present anxiety symptoms. Results The results showed a significant increase in anxiety symptoms in participants who had early menarche compared to those who did not have early menarche. The mean score on the GAD-7 Questionnaire for the cases was 9.93 and the control group was 6.89. The GAD-7 scores among the cases group were significantly higher in the GAD-7 scores than in the control group. Conclusions This study concluded that early menarche is associated with higher anxiety levels in young adults.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-281/v2?src=rss">Osseointegrative and antimicrobial properties of graphene oxide nano coated dental implants: A systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Osseointegration stands as a pivotal concept within the realm of dental implants, signifying the intricate process through which a dental implant integrates with the adjoining bone tissue. Graphene oxide (GO) has been shown to promote osseointegration, the process by which the implant fuses with the surrounding bone. The objective of this study was to assess the osseointegrative and antimicrobial properties of GO nano coated dental implants. Methods A systematic search was conducted using electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) to identify relevant studies published. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies that evaluated the effects of GO nano coating on osseointegrative and antimicrobial characteristics of dental implants. Studies not written in English and published before 2012 were excluded. Results The initial search yielded a total of 127 potential studies, of which six met the inclusion criteria and five were included in the review. These studies provided data on GO nano coated dental implants and their osseointegrative and antimicrobial properties. All the included studies showed moderate risk of bias. None of the studies provided information related to sample size calculation or sampling technique. Discussion The findings from the included studies demonstrated that GO nano coating had a positive impact on osseointegrative properties of dental implants. Enhanced bone-implant contact and increased bone density were observed in animals and humans receiving GO nano coated implants. Furthermore, the antimicrobial properties of GO nano coating were found to inhibit bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on the implant surface, reducing the risk of implant-associated infections. Conclusion The findings indicate that GO nano coating holds promise in enhancing the success rate and longevity of dental implants. However, more studies with larger sample sizes, are needed to further strengthen the evidence and determine the long-term effects of GO nano coated dental implants.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1364/v3?src=rss">Factors contributing to online child sexual abuse in Bangladesh: A qualitative inquiry [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Children globally, including in Bangladesh, are facing various forms of online sexual abuse including sextortion, exploitation, body shaming, and blackmail. They are also coerced into engaging in intimate activities, harassed through the sending of sexual content, among other forms of abuse. We aimed to explore the root cause of online child sexual abuse (OCSA) in Bangladesh. Methods This qualitative research design utilized in-depth interviews (IDIs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) between February and April 2022. The study sample comprised 21 school-going children aged 13−17 years, selected from two different geographical settings (10 from rural areas and 11 from urban areas) in Bangladesh using purposive sampling techniques. They participated in in-depth interviews (IDIs) while additional data was obtained through key informant interviews (KIIs) with 11 multidisciplinary stakeholders. Results Children from both rural and urban areas reported facing abuse in various ways, such as being asked to send naked photos, being invited to be naked in video calls, and being invited to have virtual sex, among others, over the internet. Conclusions The government should consider integrating OCSA education into secondary levels. Additionally, there should be efforts to ensure a safe online environment through content scrutiny, promotion of outdoor activities, and community campaigns. An anonymous reporting system must be implemented, and strict measures under the Children's Act must be enforced against perpetrators. Further intervention studies are needed to ensure effective child protection measures in Bangladesh.

                Background Graphene is the thinnest, strongest, and stiffest imaginable material. The biocompatible property of graphene oxide can initiate and facilitate cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of periodontal ligament, osteogenic, and oral epithelial cells. Furthermore, the antibiofilm and anti-adhesion properties of graphene oxide in the prevention of dental biofilm infections, dental caries, and dental erosion as well as for implant surface modification and as an anti-quorum sensing agent. Composites are the most often utilized materials for restoration in the field of dentistry due to adhesive resins' improved mechanical and cosmetic properties. To safeguard the dentin and prevent dental cavities, dentin adhesives are utilized to affix hydrophobic resin composites to hydrophilic dentin tissue. Materials and Method Dental adhesives have a harder time adhering to dentin because it contains more water and is less mineralized than enamel. This makes the method more sensitive. Result As a result, it was chosen to assess and contrast the impact of 5% Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles and 2% Graphene oxide nanoparticles, both separately and together, on the Micro tensile bond strength of 5th generation adhesive. Conclusion Graphene oxide is the most versatile form of Graphite in structural and functional configuration. Graphene oxide possesses extraordinary physical, chemical, optical, electrical and mechanical properties. Among the graphene family nanomaterials, the reduced form of Graphite adding the oxygenated functional group to the structure increases the surface area and therefore exhibits enviable excellent interaction ability with metal and ions as well as organic species. Graphene oxide in dentistry has provided outstanding results in antimicrobial action, regenerative dentistry, bone tissue engineering, drug delivery, physicochemical properties, enhancement of dental biomaterials and oral cancer treatment.

                Background Pain is a complication in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). There are several mechanisms underlying pain in people with thalassemia and low hemoglobin at the end of the transfusion cycle was the most etiology. Pain can develop into chronic pain and interfere with the quality of life. The Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) can help identify pain in people with TDT. The present study aimed to compare pain before and after transfusion in adult TDT patients. Methods It was an analytical observational study using a cross-sectional design on adult TDT patients with pain who came to the Haemato-Oncology Clinic of Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital Bandung. This study was conducted from December 2020 to July 2021. All subjects were assisted in filling out the Indonesian version of the BPI-SF questionnaire hemoglobin levels were examined and before and after transfusion, then paired test analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon Test. Results This study is conducted on 60 adult TDT patients with symptoms of pain. The median value of pain intensity and pain interferes with life obtained from the Indonesian version of the BPI-SF score after transfusion decreased significantly compared to before transfusion (NRS 5 vs. 0 and 2.8 vs. 0; p=0.0001). Conclusion There is a significant difference in pain intensity and pain interfere with life in adults with TDT before and after transfusion. It is necessary to carry out pain assessments for thalassemia patients.

                Background Microbial communities are mainly composed of bacteria, archaea, viruses and fungi, and are present in the gut, mouth, nose, skin, lungs, vagina, and bladder, among other places. In recent years, research has highlighted the critical role that these highly complex communities play in health and disease. Advances in sequencing technology have resulted in the development of high-dimensional data, which are challenging to effectively analyze and visualize. In this context, traditional stacked bar-plot visualizations, while widely used, fall short of conveying the fundamental phylogenic relationships between community members and are thus difficult to interpret. Methods StackbarExtended is implemented in native R, required version (≥ 4.0), and is platform independent, with its source code available on GitHub and archived on Zenodo. Results StackbarExtended allows for the plotting of relative abundance at user-defined taxonomic levels while displaying phylogenetic information using color gradients. Additionally, StackbarExtended integrates differential abundance statistics directly into the visualization process and performs clustering of low-abundance taxa. Conclusions StackbarExtended offers researchers a user-friendly tool for rapid visualization, presentation, and analysis of the microbiota composition.

                <p>by Simon Syga, Harish P. Jain, Marcus Krellner, Haralampos Hatzikirou, Andreas Deutsch</p>

Cancer is a significant global health issue, with treatment challenges arising from intratumor heterogeneity. This heterogeneity stems mainly from somatic evolution, causing genetic diversity within the tumor, and phenotypic plasticity of tumor cells leading to reversible phenotypic changes. However, the interplay of both factors has not been rigorously investigated. Here, we examine the complex relationship between somatic evolution and phenotypic plasticity, explicitly focusing on the interplay between cell migration and proliferation. This type of phenotypic plasticity is essential in glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of brain tumor. We propose that somatic evolution alters the regulation of phenotypic plasticity in tumor cells, specifically the reaction to changes in the microenvironment. We study this hypothesis using a novel, spatially explicit model that tracks individual cells’ phenotypic and genetic states. We assume cells change between migratory and proliferative states controlled by inherited and mutation-driven genotypes and the cells’ microenvironment. We observe that cells at the tumor edge evolve to favor migration over proliferation and vice versa in the tumor bulk. Notably, different genetic configurations can result in this pattern of phenotypic heterogeneity. We analytically predict the outcome of the evolutionary process, showing that it depends on the tumor microenvironment. Synthetic tumors display varying levels of genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, which we show are predictors of tumor recurrence time after treatment. Interestingly, higher phenotypic heterogeneity predicts poor treatment outcomes, unlike genetic heterogeneity. Our research offers a novel explanation for heterogeneous patterns of tumor recurrence in glioblastoma patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-913/v1?src=rss">The Nexus of Climate Change, Food Insecurity, and Conflict in Somalia: A Comprehensive Analysis of Multifaceted Challenges and Resilience Strategies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Climate change poses a significant threat to Somalia’s food security and stability. This review examines the complex interplay between climate change impacts, food insecurity, and conflict in Somalia. Recent climate data and forecasts paint a concerning picture: the rainfall probabilistic forecast for April- June 2024 indicates a high likelihood of above-normal rainfall across much of Somalia, thus increasing the flood risks. Concurrently, temperature forecasts project above-normal temperatures, potentially exacerbating drought conditions between the rainy seasons. Historical climatology data reveal Somalia’s vulnerability, with average temperatures ranging from 25°C to 30°C and significant seasonal variations affecting agriculture and water resources. These climate trends, combined with ongoing political instability and weak governance, have created a storm of challenges. This perspective explores how recurrent droughts and floods disrupt agricultural production, decimate livestock, and displace vulnerable populations, particularly those affecting rural and nomadic communities. It also examines how environmental stress exacerbates poverty and conflict, thereby creating a vicious cycle of vulnerability. This analysis draws on recent data on poverty rates, food expenditure patterns, and climate-related displacement, to illustrate the multifaceted nature of the crisis. Finally, this perspective proposed recommendations for building climate resilience, enhancing food security, and promoting sustainable development in Somalia, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches that combine immediate humanitarian assistance with long-term adaptation strategies.

<p>This Expression of Concern for the above article published online on 16 January 2002, in Wiley Online Library (<a target="_blank"
   title="Link to external resource"
   href="http://wileyonlinelibrary.com">wileyonlinelibrary.com</a>), has been published by agreement between the journal Editors-in-Chief, Cristina A. Ghiani and J. Paula Warrington; and Wiley Periodicals LLC. The Expression of Concern has been agreed following concerns raised regarding suspected duplication between the two images, Tau23-GFP (72 hours) presented in Figure 4a and Tau 24 (174-383)-GFP (24 hours) presented in Figure 5a. The authors acknowledge the duplication but due to the length of time that has elapsed since the study was conducted and published, they were unable to provide an explanation or the original data. The journal has decided to issue an Expression of Concern to alert the readers.</p>

                Marked dysregulation of the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) characterises a variety of anxiety disorders, and its amelioration is a key feature of treatment success. Overall treatment response, however, is highly variable, and about a third of patients are resistant to treatment. In this review we hypothesise that a major contributor to this variation in treatment response are the multiple faces of anxiety induced by distinct forms of frontal cortex dysregulation. Comparison of findings from humans and non-human primates reveals marked similarity in the functional organisation of threat regulation across the frontal lobes. This organisation is discussed in relation to the ‘predatory imminence continuum’ model of threat and the differential engagement of executive functions at the core of both emotion generation and regulation strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86181">Combining mutation and recombination statistics to infer clonal families in antibody repertoires</a></h4>

              
                B-cell repertoires are characterized by a diverse set of receptors of distinct specificities generated through two processes of somatic diversification: V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutations. B cell clonal families stem from the same V(D)J recombination event, but differ in their hypermutations. Clonal families identification is key to understanding B-cell repertoire function, evolution and dynamics. We present HILARy (High-precision Inference of Lineages in Antibody Repertoires), an efficient, fast and precise method to identify clonal families from single- or paired-chain repertoire sequencing datasets. HILARy combines probabilistic models that capture the receptor generation and selection statistics with adapted clustering methods to achieve consistently high inference accuracy. It automatically leverages the phylogenetic signal of shared mutations in difficult repertoire subsets. Exploiting the high sensitivity of the method, we find the statistics of evolutionary properties such as the site frequency spectrum and &#x1D451;&#x1D441;∕&#x1D451;&#x1D446; ratio do not depend on the junction length. We also identify a broad range of selection pressures spanning two orders of magnitude.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88675">Circulating small extracellular vesicle RNA profiling for the detection of T1a stage colorectal cancer and precancerous advanced adenoma</a></h4>

              
                It takes more than 20 years for normal colorectal mucosa to develop into metastatic carcinoma. The long time window provides a golden opportunity for early detection to terminate the malignant progression. Here, we aim to enable liquid biopsy of T1a stage colorectal cancer (CRC) and precancerous advanced adenoma (AA) by profiling circulating small extracellular vesicle (sEV)-derived RNAs. We exhibited a full RNA landscape for the circulating sEVs isolated from 60 participants. A total of 58,333 annotated RNAs were detected from plasma sEVs, among which 1,615 and 888 sEV-RNAs were found differentially expressed in plasma from T1a stage CRC and AA compared to normal controls (NC). Then we further categorized these sEV-RNAs into six modules by a weighted gene coexpression network analysis and constructed a 60-gene t-SNE model consisting of the top 10 RNAs of each module that could well distinguish T1a stage CRC/AA from NC samples. Some sEV-RNAs were also identified as indicators of specific endoscopic and morphological features of different colorectal lesions. The top-ranked biomarkers were further verified by RT-qPCR, proving that these candidate sEV-RNAs successfully identified T1a stage CRC/AA from NC in another cohort of 124 participants. Finally, we adopted different algorithms to improve the performance of RT-qPCR-based models and successfully constructed an optimized classifier with 79.3% specificity and 99.0% sensitivity. In conclusion, circulating sEVs of T1a stage CRC and AA patients have distinct RNA profiles, which successfully enable the detection of both T1a stage CRC and AA via liquid biopsy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94573">The transcriptional landscape underlying larval development and metamorphosis in the Malabar grouper (Epinephelus malabaricus)</a></h4>

              
                Most teleost fishes exhibit a biphasic life history with a larval oceanic phase that is transformed into morphologically and physiologically different demersal, benthic, or pelagic juveniles. This process of transformation is characterized by a myriad of hormone-induced changes, during the often abrupt transition between larval and juvenile phases called metamorphosis. Thyroid hormones (TH) are known to be instrumental in triggering and coordinating this transformation but other hormonal systems such as corticoids, might be also involved as it is the case in amphibians. In order to investigate the potential involvement of these two hormonal pathways in marine fish post-embryonic development, we used the Malabar grouper (<i>Epinephelus malabaricus</i>) as a model system. We assembled a chromosome-scale genome sequence and conducted a transcriptomic analysis of nine larval developmental stages. We studied the expression patterns of genes involved in TH and corticoid pathways, as well as four biological processes known to be regulated by TH in other teleost species: ossification, pigmentation, visual perception, and metabolism. Surprisingly, we observed an activation of many of the same pathways involved in metamorphosis also at an early stage of the larval development, suggesting an additional implication of these pathways in the formation of early larval features. Overall, our data brings new evidence to the controversial interplay between corticoids and thyroid hormones during metamorphosis as well as, surprisingly, during the early larval development. Further experiments will be needed to investigate the precise role of both pathways during these two distinct periods and whether an early activation of both corticoid and TH pathways occurs in other teleost species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96523">Endocannabinoids and their receptors modulate endometriosis pathogenesis and immune response</a></h4>

              
                Endometriosis (EM), characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, is the leading cause of chronic pelvic pain and infertility in females of reproductive age. Despite its high prevalence, the molecular mechanisms underlying EM pathogenesis remain poorly understood. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is known to influence several cardinal features of this complex disease including pain, vascularization, and overall lesion survival, but the exact mechanisms are not known. Utilizing CNR1 knockout (k/o), CNR2 k/o, and wild-type (WT) mouse models of EM, we reveal contributions of ECS and these receptors in disease initiation, progression, and immune modulation. Particularly, we identified EM-specific T cell dysfunction in the CNR2 k/o mouse model of EM. We also demonstrate the impact of decidualization-induced changes on ECS components, and the unique disease-associated transcriptional landscape of ECS components in EM. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) analysis revealed distinct features of the microenvironment between CNR1, CNR2, and WT genotypes in the presence or absence of decidualization. This study, for the first time, provides an in-depth analysis of the involvement of the ECS in EM pathogenesis and lays the foundation for the development of novel therapeutic interventions to alleviate the burden of this debilitating condition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87881">Revealing unexpected complex encoding but simple decoding mechanisms in motor cortex via separating behaviorally relevant neural signals</a></h4>

              
                In motor cortex, behaviorally relevant neural responses are entangled with irrelevant signals, which complicates the study of encoding and decoding mechanisms. It remains unclear whether behaviorally irrelevant signals could conceal some critical truth. One solution is to accurately separate behaviorally relevant and irrelevant signals at both single-neuron and single-trial levels, but this approach remains elusive due to the unknown ground truth of behaviorally relevant signals. Therefore, we propose a framework to define, extract, and validate behaviorally relevant signals. Analyzing separated signals in three monkeys performing different reaching tasks, we found neural responses previously considered to contain little information actually encode rich behavioral information in complex nonlinear ways. These responses are critical for neuronal redundancy and reveal movement behaviors occupy a higher-dimensional neural space than previously expected. Surprisingly, when incorporating often-ignored neural dimensions, behaviorally relevant signals can be decoded linearly with comparable performance to nonlinear decoding, suggesting linear readout may be performed in motor cortex. Our findings prompt that separating behaviorally relevant signals may help uncover more hidden cortical mechanisms.

	<p>Although free-floating thrombus (FFT) poses a significant risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), optimal management strategies are uncertain. To determine the state-of-the-art of medical interventions for FFT, we conducted a systematic review of the efficacy of various medical interventions and factors influencing FFT resolution and recurrence. A comprehensive search of Embase, PubMed, and ScienceDirect identified 61 studies encompassing 179 patients with FFT-related stroke or TIA treated with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or their combinations. Primary outcomes assessed were stroke recurrence and thrombus resolution. Statistical analyses (Fisher&amp;amp;rsquo;s exact test, chi-square test, Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney test, and Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis test) utilized significance set at p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05. Over a median follow-up of 7 months, thrombus resolution occurred in 65% of patients, while 11.2% experienced recurrence, primarily as TIAs. Cardioembolism was significantly less common in resolved cases (p = 0.025). Combination therapy (antiplatelets, anticoagulants, and statins) significantly enhanced clot resolution (OR 11.4; 95% CI 1.436&amp;amp;ndash;91.91; p = 0.021) compared to monotherapies. Ulcerated plaque was a significant predictor of recurrence (OR 8.2; 95% CI 1.02&amp;amp;ndash;66.07; p = 0.048). These findings underscore the superiority of combination therapy in FFT management and highlight the need for targeted interventions in patients with ulcerated plaques to mitigate recurrence risk.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is the second-most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting 1% of people aged over 60. Currently, there is only symptomatic relief for PD patients, with levodopa being the gold standard of PD treatment. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical option to treat PD patients. DBS improves motor functions and may also allow a significant reduction in dopaminergic medication. Important parameters for DBS outcomes are the disease duration, the age of disease onset, responsiveness to levodopa and cognitive or psychiatric comorbidities. Emerging data also highlight the need to carefully consider the genetic background in the preoperative assessment of PD patients who are candidates for DBS, as genetic factors may affect the effectiveness of DBS in these patients. This review article discusses the role of genetics in DBS for PD patients, in an attempt to better understand inter-individual variability in DBS response, control of motor PD symptoms and appearance of non-motor symptoms, especially cognitive decline.</p>

	<p>Cerebral vascular angiography, or digital subtraction angiography (DSA), is essential for diagnosing neurological conditions but poses radiation risks. This study aims to analyze the impact of examination parameters and patient characteristics on the radiation dose received during DSA to optimize safety and minimize exposure. A retrospective analysis of 251 DSA procedures using the GE Innova IGS 630 dual-plane instrument was conducted. Data on dose area product (DAP) and air kerma (KERMA), along with patient and examination details, were collected. Statistical analyses, including Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney, Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis, and Spearman rank correlation tests, assessed the relationships between variables and radiation dose outcomes. Significant correlations were found between the sides examined (left, right, or both) and DAP (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) and KERMA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) values, with bilateral studies showing the highest values. The post hoc Dunn tests showed that the &amp;amp;lsquo;L + P&amp;amp;rsquo; group significantly differs from both the right group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001 and the left group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). There is no significant difference between the &amp;amp;lsquo;P&amp;amp;rsquo; group and the &amp;amp;lsquo;L&amp;amp;rsquo; group (p-value = 0.53). These results suggest that the right and left (both) group have unique KERMA mGy values compared to the other two groups. A strong correlation (rS = 0.87) existed between DAP and KERMA. The number of projections significantly impacted radiation dose (rS = 0.61). Tube parameters (kV and mA) and skull size had low correlations with DAP and KERMA. Optimizing imaging protocols and individualizing parameters can significantly enhance patient safety and diagnostic efficacy while also reducing occupational exposure for medical staff.</p>

	<p>Background: Augmenting auditory feedback through an error-augmentation paradigm could facilitate the perception and correction of gait asymmetry in stroke survivors, but how such a paradigm should be tailored to individual asymmetry profiles remains unclear. Before implementing the paradigm in rehabilitation, we need to investigate the instantaneous effects of distorted footstep sound feedback on gait symmetry in healthy young adults. Methods: Participants (n = 12) walked on a self-paced treadmill while listening to their footstep sounds, which were distorted unilaterally according to five conditions presented randomly: small delay; small advance; large delay; large advance; or unmodified (control). The primary outcomes were swing time ratio (SWR) and step length ratio (SLR). Secondary outcomes included walking speed, bilateral swing time, step length, and maximum toe height, as well as hip, knee, and ankle angle excursions. Results: SWR (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) but not SLR (p &amp;amp;ge; 0.05) was increased in all distorted feedback conditions compared to the control condition. Increased swing time on the perturbed side ipsilateral to feedback distortion was observed in the advanced conditions (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), while swing time increased bilaterally in the delayed conditions (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) but to a larger extent on the unperturbed side contralateral to feedback distortion. Increases in swing time were accompanied by larger maximum toe height as well as larger hip and knee joint excursions (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05 to p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). No differences in any outcomes were observed between small and large feedback distortion magnitudes. Conclusions: Distorted footstep sound feedback successfully elicits adaptation in temporal gait symmetry (SWR), with distinct modulation patterns for advanced vs. delayed footstep sounds. Spatial symmetry (SLR) remains unaltered, likely because auditory feedback primarily conveys temporal information. This research lays the groundwork to implement personalized augmented auditory feedback in neurorehabilitation.</p>

	<p>Hyperacusis is a condition that is characterized by hypersensitivity to normal everyday sounds or reduced sound tolerance and can affect patients in distressing ways. Sound therapy is a treatment intervention that is used to desensitize patients. However, as yet, there is a lack of understanding on how it is used in clinical practice, the different types of devices, or how to use them. The aim of this scoping review was to establish the current use of sound therapy in adults with hyperacusis and identify any factors that may influence treatment. Methodology: An established methodological framework was used to formulate the research question and guide the search strategy and reporting. The inclusion criteria were studies reporting adult (&amp;amp;gt;18 years) populations with hyperacusis and sound therapy treatments which were published in any language. Searches of electronic databases (CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Medline (EBSCO), Scopus, PsycINFO) identified 31 studies that met the inclusion criteria (completed in April 2024). Data from included records were collated and summarized descriptively.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this study was to analyze the cross-linguistic influence of previously learned languages and working memory capacities on the vocabulary performance of two different typological languages. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare the working memory capacities of bilingual adults in relation to the vocabulary performance of two different languages never learned by the participants, and (2) to analyze to what extent the typology of previously learned languages influences working memory capacities in relation to the vocabulary performance of French and Nahuatl. A group of 43 Mexican Spanish college students participated in this experimental study. The participants completed a series of working memory tasks in Nahuatl and French. The results showed that working memory capacities were lower in Nahuatl than in French. Thus, a correlation was found between their first and second language and vocabulary performance in French. We can consider the influence of previously learned languages as a significant factor in vocabulary acquisition in accordance with the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; working memory capacities.</p>

                <p>Recent neurophysiological studies provide inconsistent results of frontoparietal network (FPN) stimulation for altering working memory (WM) capacity. This study aimed to boost WM capacity by manipulating the activity of the FPN via dual-site high&ndash;definition transcranial direct current stimulation. Forty-eight participants were randomly assigned to three stimulation groups, receiving either simultaneous anodal stimulation of the frontal and parietal areas (double stimulation), or stimulation of the frontal area only (single stimulation), or the placebo stimulation (sham) to frontal and parietal areas. After the stimulation, we used an operation span task to test memory accuracy, mathematical accuracy, time of calculation and memorizing, and recall response time across the three groups. The results revealed an enhancement of memory accuracy and a reduction of time of calculation in the double stimulation group compared with that in others. In addition, recall response time was significantly decreased in the double and single stimulation groups compared with that in sham. No differences in mathematical accuracy were observed. Our results confirm the pivotal role of the FPN in WM and suggest its functional dissociation, with the frontal component more implicated in the retrieval stage and the parietal component in the processing and retention stages.</p>

                <p>Single-unit (SU) activity&mdash;action potentials isolated from one neuron&mdash;has traditionally been employed to relate neuronal activity to behavior. However, recent investigations have shown that multiunit (MU) activity&mdash;ensemble neural activity recorded within the vicinity of one microelectrode&mdash;may also contain accurate estimations of task-related neural population dynamics. Here, using an established model-fitting approach, we compared the spatial codes of SU response fields with corresponding MU response fields recorded from the frontal eye fields (FEFs) in head-unrestrained monkeys (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) during a memory-guided saccade task. Overall, both SU and MU populations showed a simple visuomotor transformation: the visual response coded target-in-eye coordinates, transitioning progressively during the delay toward a future gaze-in-eye code in the saccade motor response. However, the SU population showed additional secondary codes, including a predictive gaze code in the visual response and retention of a target code in the motor response. Further, when SUs were separated into regular/fast spiking neurons, these cell types showed different spatial code progressions during the late delay period, only converging toward gaze coding during the final saccade motor response. Finally, reconstructing MU populations (by summing SU data within the same sites) failed to replicate either the SU or MU pattern. These results confirm the theoretical and practical potential of MU activity recordings as a biomarker for fundamental sensorimotor transformations (e.g., target-to-gaze coding in the oculomotor system), while also highlighting the importance of SU activity for coding more subtle (e.g., predictive/memory) aspects of sensorimotor behavior.</p>

                Background SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 45 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 who have DM have a higher risk compared to those without DM. Among COVID-19 patients with DM admitted to hospitals, they were older compared to those without DM and prothrombin time values similar but slightly higher in COVID-19 patients with DM.

                Background To ensure the validity and therapeutic utility of the Neck disability index (NDI) scale, translations, cultural adaptations and psychometric evidence is necessary. This study aimed to address the absence of a suitable and validated Hindi version of the NDI for the rural population. The specific objectives were to translate, adapt, and evaluate the psychometric properties of the newly developed Hindi version of the NDI. Methods Following guidelines provided by the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons, the original English NDI scale was cross-culturally adapted into Hindi. The adaptation process included translations (forward and backward), expert committee review, pre-testing and cognitive debriefing with 30 individuals experiencing chronic non-specific neck pain. The outcome of this process was the creation of the Hindi version of the NDI, termed NDI-Hi. Subsequently, NDI-Hi was administered to 211 participants with neck pain from multiple centers for psychometric testing. The evaluation involved test-retest reliability over a 48-hour interval, factor analysis, assessment of internal reliability measures, and criterion-related validity by comparing it with the NPAD-Hindi version. Results The NDI-Hi version exhibited favorable psychometric properties, including good test-retest reliability with an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.87. Internal consistency of the scale was high, indicated by Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (α) of 0.96. The standard error of measurement (SEM) was determined to be 2.58, and the minimal detectable change (MDC) was calculated to be 7.15. Furthermore, the NDI-Hi showed significant correlation with the NPAD-Hindi version, with a correlation coefficient (rho) of 0.86, and a p-value of less than 0.001. Conclusions The NDI-Hi demonstrated validity and reliability as an outcome tool for assessing neck disability. It can be effectively utilized in clinical practice and research settings involving Hindi-speaking individuals with chronic non-specific neck pain. The adapted scale is particularly well-suited for the rural Northern Indian Hindi-speaking population.

                Introduction Antiphospholipids syndrome is a rare autoimmune whose Clinical manifestations are very wide and different. Vaso-occlusive manifestations are the most frequent ones. Vessels of all organs can be involved. Ocular involvement is among the rarest. We report a case of retinal arterial thrombosis in the context of APS. Case report A 46-year-old patient with no previous medical history was admitted to the ophthalmology department for visual field amputation of the right eye without other associated signs. On the fundus, the left side was without abnormality and the right side was the site of a mixed arterial and superior temporal venous occlusion. Retinal angiography revealed a retinal focus in the superior temporal region with mixed occlusion of arterial and venous branches with ischemia of the superior temporal quadrant on the right and a retinal focus in the superficial inferior temporal region without occlusion on the left. Optical coherence tomography revealed ischemia of the superficial layers with alteration of the macular microvascularization in the right superior temporal quadrant. Immunological work-up showed antinuclear antibodies to be positive at 160 and anti-bgp1 positive with an IgG level of 118 IgM higher than 118 IgA at 101. The patient was put on effective anticoagulation with good clinical evolution. Conclusion Ocular involvement is rare in APS and associated with poor prognosis, it seems to be difficult to diagnose but also to manage. Larger studies are required to establish guidelines on how and when to screen asymptomatic APS patients for ocular damage, but also on how to prevent and treat it.

                ‘Research capacity strengthening’ (RCS) is an umbrella term that can be used to describe a wide variety of activities conducted in support of diverse objectives premised upon distinct, potentially opposing, views. Despite this, the ultimate objective of RCS activities is rarely made explicit which can be problematic when diverse objectives are possible. By ‘ultimate’ objective we are referring to the overarching (often long-term) goal an RCS initiative is intended to contribute towards (e.g. better population health) as opposed to the more immediate ‘proximate’ (often short-term) objectives of any such activity (e.g. improved capacity to undertake infectious disease research). We argue a need for those funding, designing and implementing RCS initiatives to make clear statements as to the ultimate objective that they foresee their respective initiative contributing towards as well as the proposed pathway and associated assumptions that underlie their approach. Examples of distinct ultimate objectives for RCS initiatives are presented alongside fictitious examples of how they may be transparently reported from both a funder and implementor perspective. Such transparency should be routine within the scope of funding calls for RCS activities (even when such activities are only a minor component of the call), subsequent applications to those calls and any description of an applied RCS activity/ies and/or the associated outcomes thereof. The process of determining one’s ultimate objective will further cause funders and actors to think through their respective initiatives more thoroughly and make informed choices and better designed RCS projects. Doing so would reduce any ambiguity associated with the use of the term ‘research capacity strengthening’ and would provide a stronger foundation for robust programme evaluation.

                Background Dental caries is a common chronic oral disease, posing a serious public health issue. By analyzing large datasets, machine learning shows potential in addressing this problem. This study employs bibliometric analysis to explore emerging topics, collaborations, key authors, and research trends in Southeast Asia related to the application of machine learning in dental caries management. Methods A comprehensive selection using the Scopus database to obtain relevant research, covering publications from inception to July 2024 was done. We employed the Bibliometric approaches, including co-authorship networks, yearly publishing trends, institutional and national partnerships, keyword co-occurrence analysis, and citation analysis, for the collected data. To explore the visualization and network analysis, we employed the tools such as VOSviewer and Bibliometrix in R package. Results The final bibliometric analysis included 246 papers. We found that Malaysia became the top contributor with 59 publications, followed by Indonesia (37) and Thailand (29). Malaysia had the highest Multiple Country Publications (MCP) ratio at 0.407. Top institutions including the Universiti Sains Malaysia led with 39 articles, followed by Chiang Mai University (36) and the National University of Singapore (30) became the leader. Co-authorship analysis using VOSviewer revealed six distinct clusters. A total of 1220 scholars contributed to these publications. The top 10 keywords, including ‘human’ and ‘dental caries,’ indicated research hotspots. Conclusion We found growing evidence of machine learning applications to address dental caries in Southeast Asia. The bibliometric analysis highlights key authors, collaborative networks, and emerging topics, revealing research trends since 2014. This study underscores the importance of bibliometric analysis in tackling this public health issue.

                <p>by Keyvan Mahjoory, Andreas Bahmer, Molly J. Henry</p>

Human listeners have the ability to direct their attention to a single speaker in a multi-talker environment. The neural correlates of selective attention can be decoded from a single trial of electroencephalography (EEG) data. In this study, leveraging the source-reconstructed and anatomically-resolved EEG data as inputs, we sought to employ CNN as an interpretable model to uncover task-specific interactions between brain regions, rather than simply to utilize it as a black box decoder. To this end, our CNN model was specifically designed to learn pairwise interaction representations for 10 cortical regions from five-second inputs. By exclusively utilizing these features for decoding, our model was able to attain a median accuracy of 77.56% for within-participant and 65.14% for cross-participant classification. Through ablation analysis together with dissecting the features of the models and applying cluster analysis, we were able to discern the presence of alpha-band-dominated inter-hemisphere interactions, as well as alpha- and beta-band dominant interactions that were either hemisphere-specific or were characterized by a contrasting pattern between the right and left hemispheres. These interactions were more pronounced in parietal and central regions for within-participant decoding, but in parietal, central, and partly frontal regions for cross-participant decoding. These findings demonstrate that our CNN model can effectively utilize features known to be important in auditory attention tasks and suggest that the application of domain knowledge inspired CNNs on source-reconstructed EEG data can offer a novel computational framework for studying task-relevant brain interactions.

                <p>by Yunfeng Xiong, Chuntian Wang, Yuan Zhang</p>

Human behaviors have non-negligible impacts on spread of contagious disease. For instance, large-scale gathering and high mobility of population could lead to accelerated disease transmission, while public behavioral changes in response to pandemics may effectively reduce contacts and suppress the peak of the outbreak. In order to understand how spatial characteristics like population mobility and clustering interplay with epidemic outbreaks, we formulate a stochastic-statistical environment-epidemic dynamic system (SEEDS) via an agent-based biased random walk model on a two-dimensional lattice. The “popularity” and “awareness” variables are taken into consideration to capture human natural and preventive behavioral factors, which are assumed to guide and bias agent movement in a combined way. It is found that the presence of the spatial heterogeneity, like social influence locality and spatial clustering induced by self-aggregation, potentially suppresses the contacts between agents and consequently flats the epidemic curve. Surprisedly, disease responses might not necessarily reduce the susceptibility of informed individuals and even aggravate disease outbreak if each individual responds independently upon their awareness. The disease control is achieved effectively only if there are coordinated public-health interventions and public compliance to these measures. Therefore, our model may be useful for quantitative evaluations of a variety of public-health policies.

                <p>by Yuqing Qian, Quan Zou, Mengyuan Zhao, Yi Liu, Fei Guo, Yijie Ding</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool in genomics research, enabling the analysis of gene expression at the individual cell level. However, scRNA-seq data often suffer from a high rate of dropouts, where certain genes fail to be detected in specific cells due to technical limitations. This missing data can introduce biases and hinder downstream analysis. To overcome this challenge, the development of effective imputation methods has become crucial in the field of scRNA-seq data analysis. Here, we propose an imputation method based on robust and non-negative matrix factorization (scRNMF). Instead of other matrix factorization algorithms, scRNMF integrates two loss functions: <i>L</i><sub>2</sub> loss and C-loss. The <i>L</i><sub>2</sub> loss function is highly sensitive to outliers, which can introduce substantial errors. We utilize the C-loss function when dealing with zero values in the raw data. The primary advantage of the C-loss function is that it imposes a smaller punishment for larger errors, which results in more robust factorization when handling outliers. Various datasets of different sizes and zero rates are used to evaluate the performance of scRNMF against other state-of-the-art methods. Our method demonstrates its power and stability as a tool for imputation of scRNA-seq data.

Although depolymerization of complex carbohydrates is a growth-limiting bottleneck for microbial decomposers, we still lack understanding about how the production of different types of extracellular enzymes affect individual microbes and in turn the performance of whole decomposer communities. In this work we use a theoretical model to evaluate the potential trade-offs faced by microorganisms in biopolymer decomposition which arise due to the varied biochemistry of different depolymerizing enzyme classes. We specifically consider two broad classes of depolymerizing extracellular enzymes, which are widespread across microbial taxa: exo-enzymes that cleave small units from the ends of polymer chains and endo-enzymes that act at random positions generating degradation products of varied sizes. Our results demonstrate a fundamental trade-off in the production of these enzymes, which is independent of system’s complexity and which appears solely from the intrinsically different temporal depolymerization dynamics. As a consequence, specialists that produce either exo- or only endo-enzymes limit their growth to high or low substrate conditions, respectively. Conversely, generalists that produce both enzymes in an optimal ratio expand their niche and benefit from the synergy between the two enzymes. Finally, our results show that, in spatially-explicit environments, consortia composed of endo- and exo-specialists can only exist under oligotrophic conditions. In summary, our analysis demonstrates that the (evolutionary or ecological) selection of a depolymerization pathway will affect microbial fitness under low- or high substrate conditions, with impacts on the ecological dynamics of microbial communities. It provides a possible explanation why many polysaccharide degraders in nature show the genetic potential to produce both of these enzyme classes.

                <p>by Ioana Bouros, Edward M. Hill, Matt J. Keeling, Sam Moore, Robin N. Thompson</p>

The rapid development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 altered the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In most countries, vaccinations were initially targeted at high-risk populations, including older individuals and healthcare workers. Now, despite substantial infection- and vaccine-induced immunity in host populations worldwide, waning immunity and the emergence of novel variants continue to cause significant waves of infection and disease. Policy makers must determine how to deploy booster vaccinations, particularly when constraints in vaccine supply, delivery and cost mean that booster vaccines cannot be administered to everyone. A key question is therefore whether older individuals should again be prioritised for vaccination, or whether alternative strategies (e.g. offering booster vaccines to the individuals who have most contacts with others and therefore drive infection) can instead offer indirect protection to older individuals. Here, we use mathematical modelling to address this question, considering SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a range of countries with different socio-economic backgrounds. We show that the population structures of different countries can have a pronounced effect on the impact of booster vaccination, even when identical booster vaccination targeting strategies are adopted. However, under the assumed transmission model, prioritising older individuals for booster vaccination consistently leads to the most favourable public health outcomes in every setting considered. This remains true for a range of assumptions about booster vaccine supply and timing, and for different assumed policy objectives of booster vaccination.

<i>In silico</i> clinical trials (ISCTs) are an emerging method in modeling and simulation where medical interventions are evaluated using computational models of patients. ISCTs have the potential to provide cost-effective, time-efficient, and ethically favorable alternatives for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. However, ensuring the credibility of ISCT results is a significant challenge. This paper aims to identify unique considerations for assessing the credibility of ISCTs and proposes an ISCT credibility assessment workflow based on recently published model assessment frameworks. First, we review various ISCTs described in the literature, carefully selected to showcase the range of methodological options available. These studies cover a wide variety of devices, reasons for conducting ISCTs, patient model generation approaches including subject-specific versus ‘synthetic’ virtual patients, complexity levels of devices and patient models, incorporation of clinician or clinical outcome models, and methods for integrating ISCT results with real-world clinical trials. We next discuss how verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification apply to ISCTs, considering the range of ISCT approaches identified. Based on our analysis, we then present a hierarchical workflow for assessing ISCT credibility, using a general credibility assessment framework recently published by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Overall, this work aims to promote standardization in ISCTs and contribute to the wider adoption and acceptance of ISCTs as a reliable tool for evaluating medical devices.

In life sciences, tracking objects from movies enables researchers to quantify the behavior of single particles, organelles, bacteria, cells, and even whole animals. While numerous tools now allow automated tracking from video, a significant challenge persists in compiling, analyzing, and exploring the large datasets generated by these approaches. Here, we introduce CellTracksColab, a platform tailored to simplify the exploration and analysis of cell tracking data. CellTracksColab facilitates the compiling and analysis of results across multiple fields of view, conditions, and repeats, ensuring a holistic dataset overview. CellTracksColab also harnesses the power of high-dimensional data reduction and clustering, enabling researchers to identify distinct behavioral patterns and trends without bias. Finally, CellTracksColab also includes specialized analysis modules enabling spatial analyses (clustering, proximity to specific regions of interest). We demonstrate CellTracksColab capabilities with 3 use cases, including T cells and cancer cell migration, as well as filopodia dynamics. CellTracksColab is available for the broader scientific community at https://github.com/CellMigrationLab/CellTracksColab.

                <p>by Wade R. Roberts, Adam M. Siepielski, Andrew J. Alverson</p>

A principal goal in ecology is to identify the determinants of species abundances in nature. Body size has emerged as a fundamental and repeatable predictor of abundance, with smaller organisms occurring in greater numbers than larger ones. A biogeographic component, known as Bergmann’s rule, describes the preponderance, across taxonomic groups, of larger-bodied organisms in colder areas. Although undeniably important, the extent to which body size is the key trait underlying these patterns is unclear. We explored these questions in diatoms, unicellular algae of global importance for their roles in carbon fixation and energy flow through marine food webs. Using a phylogenomic dataset from a single lineage with worldwide distribution, we found that body size (cell volume) was strongly correlated with genome size, which varied by 50-fold across species and was driven by differences in the amount of repetitive DNA. However, directional models identified temperature and genome size, not cell size, as having the greatest influence on maximum population growth rate. A global metabarcoding dataset further identified genome size as a strong predictor of species abundance in the ocean, but only in colder regions at high and low latitudes where diatoms with large genomes dominated, a pattern consistent with Bergmann’s rule. Although species abundances are shaped by myriad interacting abiotic and biotic factors, genome size alone was a remarkably strong predictor of abundance. Taken together, these results highlight the cascading cellular and ecological consequences of macroevolutionary changes in an emergent trait, genome size, one of the most fundamental and irreducible properties of an organism.

                Background To evaluate the NETosis biomarkers citrullinated histone H3 (citH3), neutrophil elastase (ELA), calprotectin (CALPRO), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) as indicators of inflammation in the severe stages of periodontitis III and IV in both (smokers and nonsmokers) patients, and to determine the correlation between NETosis biomarkers and clinical periodontal parameters. Methods This study recruited male subjects with an age range of (20-60) years; 60 were stage III and stage IV periodontitis patients, 30 were cigarette smoker, and 30 were nonsmokers. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria to evaluate their eligibility for recruitment, 25 control subjects with a healthy periodontal status and good oral hygiene maintenance were included. Unstimulated saliva was obtained and evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the following periodontal parameters were documented: [plaque index, bleeding on probing, periodontal pocket depth, and clinical attachment loss]. Results The mean levels of all salivary NETosis biomarkers citH3, ELA, CALPRO, and MPO were elevated in the periodontitis groups (smokers and nonsmokers) than in controls. Moreover, the mean NETosis biomarker‘s mean levels were significantly higher in smoker than in nonsmokers. In addition, the correlations were significant between CALPRO and CitH3 in smokers and between ELA and CitH3 in nonsmokers. Conclusions The results of this study showed that the chosen salivary biomarkers of NETosis revealed elevated clinical accuracy in differentiating the studied periodontitis groups (smokers and nonsmokers) from controls. In addition, cigarette smoking increases the risk of periodontitis, and neutrophils in smokers with periodontitis exhibited more susceptibility to form neutrophil extracellular traps when compared with nonsmokers.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a triplet repeat expansion within the gene huntingtin (<i>HTT</i>). Antagonistic pleiotropy is a theory of aging that posits that some genes, facilitating individual fitness early in life through adaptive evolutionary changes, also augment detrimental aging-related processes. Antagonistic pleiotropy theory may explain a positive evolutionary pressure toward functionally advantageous brain development that is vulnerable to rapid degeneration. The current study investigated antagonistic pleiotropy in HD using a years-to-onset paradigm in a unique sample of children and young adults at risk for HD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cognitive, behavioral, motor, and brain structural measures from premanifest gene-expanded (n = 79) and gene nonexpanded (n = 112) participants (6–21 years) in the Kids-HD study were examined. All measures in the gene-expanded group were modeled using a mixed-effects regression approach to assess years-to-onset-based changes while controlling for normal growth. Simultaneously, structure–function associations were also examined.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Decades from motor onset, gene-expanded participants showed significantly better cognitive, behavioral, and motor scores versus gene nonexpanded controls, along with larger cerebral volumes and cortical features. After this initial peak, a prolonged deterioration was observed in both functional and structural measures. Far from onset, brain measures were positively correlated with functional measures, supporting the view that functional advantages were mediated by structural differences.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Mutant <i>HTT</i> may drive the development of a larger than normal brain that subserves superior early-life function. These findings support the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of <i>HTT</i> in HD, where this gene drives early advantage followed by accelerated aging processes. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Complex mechanisms govern the transport and action of oxytocin (Oxt), a neuropeptide and hormone that mediates diverse physiologic processes. While Oxt exerts site-specific and rapid effects in the brain via axonal and somatodendritic release, volume transmission via CSF and the neurovascular interface can act as an additional mechanism to distribute Oxt signals across distant brain regions on a slower timescale. This review focuses on modes of Oxt transport and action in the CNS, with particular emphasis on the roles of perivascular spaces, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and circumventricular organs in coordinating the triadic interaction among circulating blood, CSF, and parenchyma. Perivascular spaces, critical conduits for CSF flow, play a pivotal role in Oxt diffusion and distribution within the CNS and reciprocally undergo Oxt-mediated structural and functional reconstruction. While the BBB modulates the movement of Oxt between systemic and cerebral circulation in a majority of brain regions, circumventricular organs without a functional BBB can allow for diffusion, monitoring, and feedback regulation of bloodborne peripheral signals such as Oxt. Recognition of these additional transport mechanisms provides enhanced insight into the systemic propagation and regulation of Oxt activity.

                Zhao et al. discover that mRNA and protein expression of phosphate importer SLC20A2 is compromised by intronic mutations, which resulted in increased cryptic-exon incorporation. Splice-switching ASOs targeting cryptic exons restore SLC20A2 expression and brain phosphate homeostasis and suppress brain calcification, providing a therapeutic strategy for PFBC patients with SLC20A2 haploinsufficiency.

                Drainas et al. identify GCN2 as a factor influencing small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) response to the WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775. AZD1775 directly activates the GCN2 stress response pathway, increasing its effectiveness in killing SCLC cells. Thus, activating the GCN2 pathway presents a novel opportunity to enhance WEE1 inhibitor efficacy in SCLC.

                Yu et al. demonstrate that, in the absence of Rab27a, endosomal Toll-like receptors are retained at amphisomes and CpG internalization is delayed. CpG-stimulated Rab27a-deficient neutrophils present selective defects in cytokine secretion. Defective nucleic acid sensing and altered cytokine secretion in Rab27a deficiency contribute to infection susceptibility and inflammatory disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/80687">BRCA1/BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 regulate DNA repair pathway engagement during C. elegans meiosis</a></h4>

              
                The preservation of genome integrity during sperm and egg development is vital for reproductive success. During meiosis, the tumor suppressor BRCA1/BRC-1 and structural maintenance of chromosomes 5/6 (SMC-5/6) complex genetically interact to promote high fidelity DNA double strand break (DSB) repair, but the specific DSB repair outcomes these proteins regulate remain unknown. Using genetic and cytological methods to monitor resolution of DSBs with different repair partners in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, we demonstrate that both BRC-1 and SMC-5 repress intersister crossover recombination events. Sequencing analysis of conversion tracts from homolog-independent DSB repair events further indicates that BRC-1 regulates intersister/intrachromatid noncrossover conversion tract length. Moreover, we find that BRC-1 specifically inhibits error prone repair of DSBs induced at mid-pachytene. Finally, we reveal functional interactions of BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 in regulating repair pathway engagement: BRC-1 is required for localization of recombinase proteins to DSBs in <i>smc-5</i> mutants and enhances DSB repair defects in <i>smc-5</i> mutants by repressing theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ). These results are consistent with a model in which some functions of BRC-1 act upstream of SMC-5/6 to promote recombination and inhibit error-prone DSB repair, while SMC-5/6 acts downstream of BRC-1 to regulate the formation or resolution of recombination intermediates. Taken together, our study illuminates the coordinate interplay of BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 to regulate DSB repair outcomes in the germline.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94842">Differential conformational dynamics in two type-A RNA-binding domains drive the double-stranded RNA recognition and binding</a></h4>

              
                Trans-activation response (TAR) RNA-binding protein (TRBP) has emerged as a key player in the RNA interference pathway, wherein it binds to different pre-microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), each varying in sequence and/or structure. We hypothesize that TRBP displays dynamic adaptability to accommodate heterogeneity in target RNA structures. Thus, it is crucial to ascertain the role of intrinsic and RNA-induced protein dynamics in RNA recognition and binding. We have previously elucidated the role of intrinsic and RNA-induced conformational exchange in the double-stranded RNA-binding domain 1 (dsRBD1) of TRBP in shape-dependent RNA recognition. The current study delves into the intrinsic and RNA-induced conformational dynamics of the TRBP-dsRBD2 and then compares it with the dsRBD1 study carried out previously. Remarkably, the two domains exhibit differential binding affinity to a 12-bp dsRNA owing to the presence of critical residues and structural plasticity. Furthermore, we report that dsRBD2 depicts constrained conformational plasticity when compared to dsRBD1. Although, in the presence of RNA, dsRBD2 undergoes induced conformational exchange within the designated RNA-binding regions and other residues, the amplitude of the motions remains modest when compared to those observed in dsRBD1. We propose a dynamics-driven model of the two tandem domains of TRBP, substantiating their contributions to the versatility of dsRNA recognition and binding.

	<p>Bodily self-consciousness (BSC), a subject of interdisciplinary interest, refers to the awareness of one&amp;amp;rsquo;s bodily states. Previous studies have noted the existence of individual differences in BSC, while neglecting the underlying factors and neural basis of such individual differences. Considering that BSC relied on integration from both internal and external self-relevant information, we here review previous findings on individual differences in BSC through a three-level-self model, which includes interoceptive, exteroceptive, and mental self-processing. The data show that cross-level factors influenced individual differences in BSC, involving internal bodily signal perceptibility, multisensory processing principles, personal traits shaped by environment, and interaction modes that integrate multiple levels of self-processing. Furthermore, in interoceptive processing, regions like the anterior cingulate cortex and insula show correlations with different perceptions of internal sensations. For exteroception, the parietal lobe integrates sensory inputs, coordinating various BSC responses. Mental self-processing modulates differences in BSC through areas like the medial prefrontal cortex. For interactions between multiple levels of self-processing, regions like the intraparietal sulcus involve individual differences in BSC. We propose that diverse experiences of BSC can be attributed to different levels of self-processing, which moderates one&amp;amp;rsquo;s perception of their body. Overall, considering individual differences in BSC is worth amalgamating diverse methodologies for the diagnosis and treatment of some diseases.</p>

	<p>Aggression is a fundamental behavior with essential roles in dominance assertion, resource acquisition, and self-defense across the animal kingdom. However, dysregulation of the aggression circuitry can have severe consequences in humans, leading to economic, emotional, and societal burdens. Previous inconsistencies in aggression research have been due to limitations in techniques for studying these neurons at a high spatial resolution, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying aggression. Recent advancements in optogenetics, pharmacogenetics, single-cell RNA sequencing, and in vivo electrophysiology have provided new insights into this complex circuitry. This review aims to explore the aggression-provoking stimuli and their detection in rodents, particularly through the olfactory systems. Additionally, we will examine the core regions associated with aggression, their interactions, and their connection with the prefrontal cortex. We will also discuss the significance of top-down cognitive control systems in regulating atypical expressions of aggressive behavior. While the focus will primarily be on rodent circuitry, we will briefly touch upon the modulation of aggression in humans through the prefrontal cortex and discuss emerging therapeutic interventions that may benefit individuals with aggression disorders. This comprehensive understanding of the neural substrates of aggression will pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and clinical interventions. This approach contrasts with the broader perspective on neural mechanisms of aggression across species, aiming for a more focused analysis of specific pathways and their implications for therapeutic interventions.</p>

                <p>NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) are widely recognized as master regulators of synaptic plasticity, most notably for driving long-term changes in synapse size and strength that support learning. NMDARs are unique among neurotransmitter receptors in that they require binding of both neurotransmitter (glutamate) and co-agonist (e.g., <scp>d</scp>-serine) to open the receptor channel, which leads to the influx of calcium ions that drive synaptic plasticity. Over the past decade, evidence has accumulated that NMDARs also support synaptic plasticity via ion flux-independent (non-ionotropic) signaling upon the binding of glutamate in the absence of co-agonist, although conflicting results have led to significant controversy. Here, we hypothesized that a major source of contradictory results might be attributed to variable occupancy of the co-agonist binding site under different experimental conditions. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated co-agonist availability in acute hippocampal slices from mice of both sexes. We found that enzymatic scavenging of endogenous co-agonists enhanced the magnitude of long-term depression (LTD) induced by non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling in the presence of the NMDAR pore blocker MK801. Conversely, a saturating concentration of <scp>d</scp>-serine completely inhibited LTD and spine shrinkage induced by glutamate binding in the presence of MK801 or Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Using a Fo&#x0308;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay in cultured neurons, we further found that <scp>d</scp>-serine completely blocked NMDA-induced conformational movements of the GluN1 cytoplasmic domains in the presence of MK801. Our results support a model in which <scp>d</scp>-serine availability serves to modulate NMDAR signaling and synaptic plasticity even when the NMDAR is blocked by magnesium.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/32/e0170242024?rss=1">Astrocyte D1/D5 Dopamine Receptors Govern Non-Hebbian Long-Term Potentiation at Sensory Synapses onto Lamina I Spinoparabrachial Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent work demonstrated that activation of spinal D1 and D5 dopamine receptors (D1/D5Rs) facilitates non-Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) at primary afferent synapses onto spinal projection neurons. However, the cellular localization of the D1/D5Rs driving non-Hebbian LTP in spinal nociceptive circuits remains unknown, and it is also unclear whether D1/D5R signaling must occur concurrently with sensory input in order to promote non-Hebbian LTP at these synapses. Here we investigate these issues using cell-type&ndash;selective knockdown of D1Rs or D5Rs from lamina I spinoparabrachial neurons, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, or astrocytes in adult mice of either sex using Cre recombinase-based genetic strategies. The LTP evoked by low-frequency stimulation of primary afferents in the presence of the selective D1/D5R agonist SKF82958 persisted following the knockdown of D1R or D5R in spinoparabrachial neurons, suggesting that postsynaptic D1/D5R signaling was dispensable for non-Hebbian plasticity at sensory synapses onto these key output neurons of the superficial dorsal horn (SDH). Similarly, the knockdown of D1Rs or D5Rs in DRG neurons failed to influence SKF82958-enabled LTP in lamina I projection neurons. In contrast, SKF82958-induced LTP was suppressed by the knockdown of D1R or D5R in spinal astrocytes. Furthermore, the data indicate that the activation of D1R/D5Rs in spinal astrocytes can either retroactively or proactively drive non-Hebbian LTP in spinoparabrachial neurons. Collectively, these results suggest that dopaminergic signaling in astrocytes can strongly promote activity-dependent LTP in the SDH, which is predicted to significantly enhance the amplification of ascending nociceptive transmission from the spinal cord to the brain.</p>

                <p>MicroRNAs are emerging as crucial regulators within the complex, dynamic environment of the synapse, and they offer a promising new avenue for the treatment of neurological disease. These small noncoding RNAs modify gene expression in several ways, including posttranscriptional modulation via binding to complementary and semicomplementary sites on target mRNAs. This rapid, finely tuned regulation of gene expression is essential to meet the dynamic demands of the synapse. Here, we provide a detailed review of the multifaceted world of synaptic microRNA regulation. We discuss the many mechanisms by which microRNAs regulate gene expression at the synapse, particularly in the context of neuronal plasticity. We also describe the various factors, such as age, sex, and neurological disease, that can influence microRNA expression and activity in neurons. In summary, microRNAs play a crucial role in the intricate and quickly changing functional requirements of the synapse, and context is essential in the study of microRNAs and their potential therapeutic applications.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/32/e0463242024?rss=1">Decreased Beta Power and OFC-STN Phase Synchronization during Reactive Stopping in Freely Behaving Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>During natural behavior, an action often needs to be suddenly stopped in response to an unexpected sensory input&mdash;referred to as reactive stopping. Reactive stopping has been mostly investigated in humans, which led to hypotheses about the involvement of different brain structures, in particular the hyperdirect pathway. Here, we directly investigate the contribution and interaction of two key regions of the hyperdirect pathway, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and subthalamic nucleus (STN), using dual-area, multielectrode recordings in male rats performing a stop-signal task. In this task, rats have to initiate movement to a go-signal, and occasionally stop their movement to the go-signal side after a stop-signal, presented at various stop-signal delays. Both the OFC and STN show near-simultaneous field potential reductions in the beta frequency range (12&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) compared with the period preceding the go-signal and the movement period. These transient reductions (~200&nbsp;ms) only happen during reactive stopping, which is when the stop-signal was received after action initiation, and are well timed after stop-signal onset and before the estimated time of stopping. Phase synchronization analysis also showed a transient attenuation of synchronization between the OFC and STN in the beta range during reactive stopping. The present results provide the first direct quantification of local neural oscillatory activity in the OFC and STN and interareal synchronization specifically timed during reactive stopping.</p>
