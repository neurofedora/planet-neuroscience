">Subcellular interactions of neuropeptide Y and corticotropin-releasing factor in the central nucleus of the amygdala in the mouse</a></h4>

              
                Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is ubiquitously distributed throughout the central nervous system. Recognized as a mediator of stress resilience, NPY has been shown to counteract the excitatory effects of the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), that orchestrates the stress response. In the mouse, while NPY and CRF exhibit a high degree of neuroanatomical association in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) indicating potential significant interactions, the synaptic organizations of these neuropeptides have not been elucidated. In the present study, we determined the interactions between NPY and CRF in the CeA. Immunofluorescence microscopy presented that NPY-immunoreactive varicose processes were distributed throughout the CeA and contacted CRF-containing neurons. Using electron microscopy, immunoperoxidase labeling for NPY and gold-silver labeling for CRF showed that NPY-labeled axon terminals (NPY-t) form synapses with CRF-labeled dendrites (CRF-d). Semi-quantitative analysis revealed that 163 of NPY-t directly target CRF-d. In addition, approximately 85% of NPY-t form symmetric synapses with CRF-d while approximately 1% form asymmetric synapses. These findings provide the first ultrastructural evidence that NPY-containing axon terminals make direct contact with CRF-containing dendrites in the CeA. This suggests that the CRF-containing neurons in the CeA may be a key site for NPY action, potentially influencing brain regions involved in stress responses and stress-related psychiatric disorders, and alcohol use disorders.

">Subclinical anxiety is associated with reduced self-distancing and enhanced guilt-related connectivity between anterior temporal and subgenual cingulate cortices</a></h4>

              
                Excessive self-blaming emotions are commonly observed in anxiety disorders, with mounting evidence indicating the presence of qualitatively similar symptomatology in subclinical and clinical populations. Prior work points to a central role of the superior anterior temporal lobe (sATL) in the guilt processing circuitry, together with network organisation differences associated with subclinical anxiety. This study aimed to extend these findings by exploring links of trait-anxiety with (i) self-blaming emotions and associated behaviours, and (ii) guilt-dependent neural activity and connectivity. We also explored the role of resting-state fMRI in linking these phenomena. Increased anxiety was linked to stronger self-blaming emotions, and more pronounced self-attacking and hiding. When experiencing negative emotions about themselves (i.e. shame and self-anger), anxious individuals were also less likely to disengage from self-focused thoughts. These behavioural findings were paralleled by enhanced guilt-related connectivity between the left sATL and bilateral posterior subgenual cingulate cortex. The relevance of temporal lobe activity for self-blaming emotions was also evident in the resting-state data. Interestingly, while the approach-avoidance motivation towards guilt memories was unrelated to anxiety, this emotional dimension showed distinct contributions of the left and right sATL, with task-related activity of the former and connectivity of the latter associated with, respectively, more approach and avoidance. As such, the results of the current study link the self-blaming bias of anxious individuals to specific maladaptive patterns of behaviour. Furthermore, the work provides robust evidence for the important role of ATL-related circuitry in guilt processing, supporting its broader involvement in social conceptual processing.

">Mirror manifolds: partially overlapping neural subspaces for speaking and listening</a></h4>

              
                Participants in conversations need to associate words their speakers but also retain those words general meanings. For example, someone talking about their hand is not referring to the other speakers hand, but the word hand still carries speaker-general information (e.g., having five fingers). These two requirements impose a cross-speaker generalization / differentiation dilemma that is not well addressed by existing theories. We hypothesized that the brain resolves the dilemma by use of a vectorial semantic code that blends collinear and orthogonal coding subspaces. To test this hypothesis, we examined semantic encoding in populations of hippocampal single neurons recorded during conversations between epilepsy patients and healthy partners in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU). We found clear semantic encoding for both spoken and heard words, with strongest encoding just around the time of utterance for production, and just after it for reception. Crucially, hippocampal neurons codes for word meaning were poised between orthogonalized and collinearized. Moreover, different semantic categories were orthogonalized to different degrees; body parts and names were most differentiated between speakers; function words and verbs were least differentiated. Finally, the hippocampus used the same coding principle to separate different partners in three-person conversations, with greater orthogonalization between self and other than between two others. Together, these results suggest a new solution to the problem of binding word meanings with speaker identity.

">Neuronal Activity in Orbitofrontal Cortex during Trinary Choices under Risk</a></h4>

              
                Economic choice entails computing and comparing the subjective values of different goods. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is thought to contribute to both operations. However, previous work focused almost exclusively on binary choices, raising the question of whether current notions hold for multinary choices. Here we recorded from rhesus monkeys making trinary choices. Offers varied on three dimensions -- juice flavor, quantity, and probability. In these experiments, quantity and probability varied continuously within a preset range. Animal choices were generally risk seeking and satisfied independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) -- a fundamental assumption in standard economic theory. Different neurons encoded the values of individual offers, the choice outcome, and the chosen value -- i.e., the same variables previously identified under binary choices. In addition, other cell groups encoded the chosen probability and the chosen hemifield. Notably, the activity of offer value cells reflected the risk attitude and fluctuated from session to session in ways that matched fluctuations observed behaviorally. In other words, the activity of these neurons reflected the subjective nature of value. Importantly, the representation of decision variables in OFC was invariant to changes in menu size -- a property that effectively implies IIA.

">System-Level Computations Underlie Visual Field Heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                Visual perception varies with eccentricity and polar angle. We investigated whether and how system-level computations, which transform visual input into perception, underlie these heterogeneities. Using the equivalent noise method and perceptual template model, we estimated gain, internal noise, and nonlinearity for orientation discrimination across eccentricity (fovea, parafovea and perifovea) and around polar angle. Performance declined with eccentricity due to decreased gain and nonlinearity and increased internal noise. Observers with stronger eccentricity effects showed greater gain decrease. Only gain varied with polar angle, higher along the horizontal than vertical meridian, and lower than upper vertical meridian, paralleling performance asymmetries. This dissociation aligns with known variations in neuronal count and tuning, suggesting that neural correlations and neural noise contribute to these system-level computations. By revealing distinct system-level computations underlying the eccentricity effect and polar angle asymmetries, our findings provide a link between perceptual heterogeneity across the visual field and neural architecture.

">Not a global map, but a local hash: grid cells decorrelate the representation of position and scramble long-range distance information</a></h4>

              
                Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex construct an intriguing multiperiodic representation of space whose properties have been the subject of much theoretical speculation. Here we combine modeling with analyses of neural population data from mice and rats to show that the grid cell representation is ideally set up to decorrelate and assign easily distinguishable labels to inputs, thus acting as a pattern separation device, much like a hash function in computing rather than a global map or metric. The multiple modules of the grid cell system allow the threshold for pattern separation to be controlled. We also extend these arguments to show how grid cells can perform pattern separation in abstract and higher-dimensional spaces. This pattern separation ability may serve to enhance episodic memory in the hippocampal formation by reducing interference between similar patterns.

">Prenatal Polysubstance Exposure Alters Behaviour in Zebrafish Larvae</a></h4>

              
                Substance use during pregnancy has been linked to various adverse outcomes in infants, including congenital disabilities, neurodevelopmental delays, and long-term effects such as learning difficulties. An additional concern is that newborns are often exposed to multiple substances in utero. The biological consequences of such exposure remain largely unknown. Zebrafish offer an exciting alternative to fill this gap and deepen our understanding of the biological impact of prenatal multidrug exposure. We utilized zebrafish's scalability to expose embryos to some of the most commonly used substances: nicotine, alcohol, opioids, and all their possible combinations. After embryonic drug exposure, we conducted a detailed behavioural analysis across three developmental stages. Our results revealed drug-specific outcomes, including both synergistic and antagonistic effects. Furthermore, we identified distinctive effects across development, highlighting potential developmental shifts and individual differences in resilience. Overall, these findings demonstrate that prenatal polydrug exposure results in complex, stage-dependent effects, sometimes antagonistic, which cannot be predicted from single-drug outcomes. Our study emphasizes the value of zebrafish as a model for investigating polydrug interactions and provides a framework for exploring biomarkers of vulnerability and resilience in offspring.

">DUSP5 Downregulation in Nucleus Accumbens Core Correlates with Synaptic Plasticity and Cue-Induced Cocaine Reinstatement</a></h4>

              
                The United States is currently facing a drug overdose epidemic, with substance use disorder (SUD) characterized by cyclical phases of drug use, withdrawal, and relapse. The nucleus accumbens core (NAcore), a brain region critical for reward and aversion behaviors, undergoes structural and functional synaptic adaptations in response to chronic drug exposure. These changes, particularly in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs), are implicated in drug-seeking behaviors and synaptic plasticity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptations remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of dual-specificity phosphatase 5 (DUSP5), an phosphatase known to deactivate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), in cocaine-induced neuroplasticity. While prior research has linked other DUSP family members to various drugs of abuse, the specific role of DUSP5 in cocaine addiction remains unexplored. We hypothesized that lack of DUSP5 contributes to NAcore synaptic plasticity during cue-induced cocaine reinstatement. To test this, we employed a rat cocaine self-administration model, integrated molecular analyses, and mined publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data from cocaine-treated NAcore. Our findings aim to elucidate the potential involvement of DUSP5 in cocaine-related synaptic adaptations and behavior, addressing a significant gap in the mechanistic understanding of SUD.

">Indistinguishability domains of neural microcircuit motifs mapped through classification scores of postsynaptic spike counts</a></h4>

              
                In the kinetic modeling of a chemical synapse, the reversal potential (Esyn) and conductance amplitude (gsyn) of the synapse jointly regulate the spike-induced activity of the postsynaptic neuron. We simulate two-neuron microcircuit motifs of feedforward and feedback types using random external current pulses provided only at the presynaptic neuron. For combinations of Esyn and gsyn, corresponding to an excitatory synapse, a supervised machine learning method for classification distinguishes the motifs perfectly with a score of 1.0 when using binned counts of postsynaptic spikes as the input. Strongly inhibitory combinations of these parameters result in no postsynaptic response in both types of microcircuit motifs; hence, the classifier does not improve upon a random assignment with a score of 0.5. In other domains of the parameter space spanned by Esyn and gsyn, corresponding to diminished excitation/inhibition, the classifier fails (0.5 < score < 1), indicating the challenge in identifying the nature of the synapse inferred exclusively from postsynaptic spikes. For this task, gradient boosting gives higher classification accuracies that improve with further training, compared to other classifiers explored in this study.

">Elevated Thalamic Blood Flow in Self-Limited Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes</a></h4>

              
                Children with self-limited epilepsy syndrome with centrotemporal spikes (SeLECTS) exhibit altered thalamocortical connectivity, but whether thalamic function itself is abnormal remains unclear. We investigated whether thalamic blood flow, a marker of metabolism, differs between children with SeLECTS and controls, and examined the effects of spike distribution and antiseizure medications (ASMs) on thalamic perfusion. In this retrospective cohort study, we identified consecutive children with SeLECTS who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for epilepsy evaluation (n = 44) and age- and sex-matched children who underwent MRI for non-epilepsy indications (n = 35). We quantified thalamic blood flow via manual segmentation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) sequences obtained from arterial spin labeling MRI. Clinical variables including sedation use during MRI, daily ASM use, and spike distribution (unilateral or bilateral) were extracted from medical records. Children with SeLECTS demonstrated elevated thalamic blood flow compared to controls, with the most pronounced differences in specific subgroups. Children with unilateral spikes showed the highest CBF, particularly in the thalamus contralateral to spike activity. ASM use significantly modulated thalamic blood flow: children taking oxcarbazepine showed the highest CBF, while those on levetiracetam had CBF similar to controls. Unmedicated children showed intermediate elevations. These findings demonstrate that elevated thalamic blood flow may be intrinsic to SeLECTS pathophysiology, with different ASMs producing distinct neurobiological effects. The differential medication effects may relate to their clinical efficacy and provide neurobiological rationale for treatment selection in this common childhood epilepsy syndrome.

">The use of Artificial Intelligence in Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Epilepsy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Background. The application of artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) to MRI can be a powerful tool to streamline clinical decision-making, yet variability amongst MRI sequences and algorithms have hindered appropriate assessment of reliability and generalizability. Methods. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the ability of current AI/ML models operating on MRI data for: 1) epilepsy diagnosis, 2) temporal lobe epilepsy lateralization, 3) lesion localization, and 4) post-surgical outcome prediction. Searches were conducted across PubMed, Medline, and Embase databases from inception until January 1, 2025. We selected studies that employed AI/ML models trained on any MRI modality to classify at least ten patients across the four main objectives for qualitative assessment, and further included in the meta-analysis if they reported an accuracy rate. The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was the overall accuracy of AI/ML models trained on MRI data. The secondary outcome was the concomitant risk of bias evaluation using PROBAST. Results. We identified 158 studies for qualitative evaluation and 127 studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis. AI/ML on multimodal MRI could accurately distinguish epilepsy patients from healthy controls (overall accuracy: 88% [85-90]), lateralize temporal lobe epilepsy (90% [87-93]), localize epileptogenic lesions (82% [74-88]), and predict post-surgical seizure-freedom (83% [78-87]). Overall, a high risk of bias remains in the literature; participant bias remained high across all outcomes (64-87%), as well as predictor (88-100%) and analysis (83-100%) bias. Outcome bias was low only for AI/ML studies predicting post-surgical outcomes. Conclusion. Our results support promising accuracy of AI/ML models in epilepsy diagnostics and prognostics but remain highly susceptible to bias in participants, predictors, outcome, and analysis domains which limits current translation to routine clinical practice. We encourage closer interdisciplinary collaboration between clinical and scientific groups to improve validation studies based on thorough study design, analysis, and reporting.

">The curriculum effect in visual learning: the role of readout dimensionality</a></h4>

              
                Generalization of visual perceptual learning (VPL) to unseen conditions varies across tasks. Previous work suggests that training curriculum may be integral to generalization, yet a theoretical explanation is lacking. We propose an explanatory theory of visual learning generalization and curriculum effects by leveraging an artificial neural network (ANN) model of VPL in comparison with humans. We found that easy-to-hard sequential training improved generalization in both humans and ANNs. However, when easy and hard conditions were interleaved, humans and ANNs showed different behaviors: while ANNs performed worse than with sequential training, humans maintained good performance but with large inter-individual variability. Investigating ANN models trained with different curricula, we demonstrated that models relying on low-dimensional neural populations showed superior generalization. This readout subspace dimensionality was directly determined by curriculum: learners who learned from easy tasks early formed lower-dimensional subspaces and generalized better. Our theory provides a mechanistic framework linking curriculum design to VPL generalization through neural population dimensionality.

">Eye-Head Coordination During Rapid Gaze Shifts in Soccer Scanning</a></h4>

              
                The visual exploratory behavior involving rapid gaze shifts that supports cognitive processes is called scanning. Scanning in soccer is a foundational behavior that enables players to explore their environment, supporting rapid and accurate decision-making. However, since most previous studies have focused on head movements, the coordination structure of gaze shifts, including the ocular contribution, is insufficiently understood. This study aimed to determine the coordinated roles of the eye and head during scanning. Twenty male collegiate soccer players performed a passing task paired with video-based situational judgments while eye and head movements were recorded by a 200 Hz sampling rate using an eye tracker system with a built-in gyroscope. We detected eye and head velocities and amplitudes during rapid gaze shifts. As a result, peak eye velocity was significantly higher than peak head velocity (d = 4.09, p < .001). The cross-correlation (CC) between gaze and eye velocities (0.98) was significantly greater than that between gaze and head velocities (0.90). These results indicate that gaze shifts were driven primarily by eye movements rather than head movements. Furthermore, eye and head velocities were negatively correlated (r = -.60, p = .005), whereas their velocity-control profiles (mean velocity normalized by amplitude) were positively correlated (r = .90, p < .001), indicating individual strategy-dependent allocation of effort while preserving control capability of eye and head movements. Our findings provide a characterization of the eye-head coordination structure of gaze shifts in soccer scanning, suggesting the need for comprehensive assessments beyond head-motion metrics alone.

">Tau oligomers modulate synapse fate by eliciting progressive bipartite synapse dysregulation and synapse loss</a></h4>

              
                Background Synapse function is critical for cognition, and synapse loss is highly correlated with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Tau oligomers, which accumulate in the brain in Alzheimer's disease, can acutely inhibit synaptic plasticity and cause synapse loss. Coordinated presynaptic and postsynaptic function is essential for effective synaptic transmission, and both compartments can be dysregulated by pathogenic tau. However, the series of pathophysiological events triggered by tau oligomers to cause the dysfunction and deterioration of presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic sites remain unclear. Methods We developed a proximity labeling tool to map the postsynaptic proteome by fusing PSD-95 with APEX2 (APEX2-PSD-95) which was expressed in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. We used APEX2-PSD-95 to map the dynamic changes in the postsynaptic proteome with precise temporal resolution after an acute exposure of human iPSC-derived neurons to recombinant tau oligomers for 30 min. Leveraging immunocytochemistry, electrophysiology and electron microscopy, we further delineated the impact of the acute tau oligomer exposure on presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments over time for up to 14 days. Results The brief exposure of human iPSC-derived neurons to tau oligomers caused a progressive deterioration of synapses, marked by both presynaptic and postsynaptic dysregulation. Postsynaptic proteome mapping revealed an immediate tau oligomer-triggered downregulation of the postsynaptic actin motor proteins Myosin-Va and Myosin-10, which coincided with impaired AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking during synaptic plasticity. This was followed 24 hours later by the upregulation of disease-related proteins, including GSK3B; at postsynaptic sites. The loss of PSD-95-labeled postsynaptic sites at 7 days after tau oligomer exposure preceded the loss of Synapsin-labeled presynaptic terminals at 14 days. The postsynaptic sites that remained exhibited a long-term downregulation of postsynaptic AMPAR levels and sustained synaptic plasticity impairment. Moreover, the remaining presynaptic terminals contained less clusters of vesicles at the presynaptic active zone which was associated with reduced vesicle release probability at synapses. Conclusion Our findings reveal the series of events underlying tau oligomer-induced bipartite synapse deterioration. The progressive decline of synapses involves the emergence of two synapse fates. One synapse fate involves the persistent weakening of both presynaptic and postsynaptic function, and the other results in synaptic loss.

">Neuroelectrophysiological correlates of extended cessation of consciousness in advanced meditators: A multimodal EEG and MEG study</a></h4>

              
                In some contemplative traditions, "extended cessation" (EC) refers to a state of advanced meditation in which the meditator intentionally suppresses their own consciousness and re-emerges with a profound sense of clarity and equanimity. Here, we present the first electrophysiological study of EC, in which five meditators underwent concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording. EC significantly reduced alpha power. EC also tended to increase neural complexity, unlike other states in which consciousness is absent (e.g., sleep, anesthesia, disorders of consciousness). Our results indicate that the neural correlates of EC are distinct from other states that induce loss of consciousness and that complexity is not a sufficient condition for consciousness, while also providing new insights into the implications of advanced meditation for human flourishing.

">Network dynamics underlying activity-timescale differences between cortical regions</a></h4>

              
                Network-level dynamics are thought to be central to computation in the cerebral cortex. Yet, how these dynamics differ across areas remains poorly understood. We leveraged an intrinsic property of cortical regions to tackle this problem - the timescales over which they spontaneously sustain activity. We first co-registered functional and spatial transcriptomics datasets to show that timescales across the mouse cortex are predicted by many transcript categories, including those that regulate circuit wiring. Next, we used simultaneous two-photon imaging and optogenetics in mice to ask how these putative differences in connectivity lead to distinct network responses to brief, focal excitatory input to a short-timescale visual area, VISp, and a long-timescale frontal area, MOs. MOs neurons were more likely to respond to photostimulation of their neighbors. Moreover, the evoked dynamics of the overall network were much longer lasting in MOs than VISp, due to the more prevalent recruitment of late-responding neurons, which formed reliable activity sequences. Overall, our findings show that, beyond single-neuron timescales, different cortical areas are distinctly wired to sustain input over varying time windows via network dynamics, with important implications for our understanding of cortical computation.

">Cortical tension as a mechanical barrier to safeguard against premature differentiation during neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal differentiation requires coordinated gene reprogramming and morphodynamic remodeling. How mechanical forces integrate with nuclear gene programs during neurogenesis remains unresolved. Here, we identify cortical tension as a mechanical barrier that safeguards against premature neuronal differentiation. Deletion of Plexin-B2, a guidance receptor controlling actomyosin contractility, lowers this barrier, enabling neurite outgrowth and accelerating neuronal lineage commitment. We show that coupling of extrinsic differentiation cues with intrinsic morphodynamics is essential for stabilizing neuronal fate and that cortical barrier and epigenetic barrier act in concert to regulate developmental timing. In cerebral organoids, Plexin-B2 ablation triggered premature cell-cycle exit and differentiation, resulting in progenitor pool depletion and neuroepithelial disorganization, phenotypes echoing intellectual disability in patients with rare pathogenic PLXNB2 variants. Our studies demonstrate that cortical tension functions as mechano-checkpoint that regulates the onset of neurogenesis. Lowering this barrier may provide a strategy to accelerate induced neuron generation and maturation for CNS disease modeling.

">Memory-specific E-I balance supports diverse replay and mitigates catastrophic forgetting</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is the brain's central locus for memory processing. In a widely accepted hypothesis, the hippocampus stores short-term memories in attractor states, which are then consolidated in the neocortex as long-term memories. Hippocampal replay activities play a pivotal role in memory consolidation, but memories are only transiently, not persistently, replayed, casting doubt on the attractor memory hypothesis. Concepts like memory capacity, the upper bound on the number of storable stable memories in a neural network, may also need to be revised if their offline transient activation is more essential for memory consolidation. Here, we explore the biologically plausible mechanism of offline memory processing by asking a recurrent spiking network to replay reliably as many stored assemblies as possible. We demonstrate the importance of memory-assembly-specific inhibitory plasticity for replaying diverse memory assemblies. Furthermore, our results highlight the role of transient memory states in mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

">Theory of Mind and Discourse Production in Schizotypy: An fMRI Study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Schizotypy (ST) reflects subclinical traits linked to schizophrenia spectrum disorders and associated cognitive and social impairments. Theory of Mind (ToM) and discourse production deficits are well documented in schizophrenia (SZ), yet the neural basis of discourse-related ToM processes in ST remains unclear. This study investigated brain activation during narrative planning and production in individuals with schizotypal traits. Methods: Thirty young adults (mean age = 18.8 years) completed standardized assessments, including the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire Brief Revised (SPQBR), adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), depression (PHQ9), and dissociation (DESB). Participants performed a discourse task in an fMRI scanner, describing nine-panel cartoons requiring inference of character intentions. Behavioral discourse metrics included total and inferred events. fMRI analyses examined activation during planning and production phases, with SPQBR positive, negative, and disorganized traits entered as regressors. Results: Schizotypal traits correlated with multiple psychosocial risk factors, including elevated depression, ACEs, and dissociation (r = .48 .82, p < .01). During planning, canonical ToM/self-referential regions (vmPFC, precuneus, insula) were recruited. Positive traits correlated with increased activation in the right temporo-parietal junction, precuneus, and lingual gyrus, whereas disorganized traits were associated with reduced activation in the precuneus and lingual gyri. During production, networks spanning vmPFC, hippocampus, right TPJ, and basal ganglia were engaged. Negative traits correlated with increased motor/premotor activation, while disorganized traits correlated with reduced activation in lingual gyrus, SMA, and cerebellum. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate distinct neural correlates of schizotypal traits during discourse planning and production, supporting models of schizophrenia spectrum risk emphasizing disrupted inference and integration processes.

                Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent, chronic inflammatory skin disease with diverse clinical presentations, often overlapping with other dermatoses. Its diagnosis remains largely dependent on clinical expertise, leading to variability and limited diagnostic accuracy, particularly among general practitioners. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) model that integrates lesion image analysis and structured anamnesis to improve AD diagnosis. Methods This diagnostic study was conducted in two phases: Phase 1 used retrospective data from 2021–2024, and Phase 2 involved prospective external validation from multiple hospitals in 2025. Patients with AD or related skin conditions were included, with diagnoses based on AAD 2014 criteria. Multimodal fusion combined ResNet50-extracted image features and MPNet-based anamnesis text features using a late fusion model. This approach mimics clinical reasoning by integrating visual and contextual clinical information to classify cases as AD or non-AD. Results and Discussion The multimodal AI model integrating ResNet50 (image) and MPNet (anamnesis) achieved 98.28% accuracy in classifying AD vs non-AD, outperforming image-or text-only models. It offers clinical advantages by mimicking physician reasoning, improving diagnostic consistency, reducing subjectivity, and enabling mass triage. However, real-world generalizability remains a challenge due to limited training diversity, potential language constraints (Bahasa Indonesia), and narrow differential diagnoses. External validation and explainable AI (XAI) are critical for broader application. Despite limitations, the model aligns with emerging literature, showing multimodal AI can approach or surpass expert-level performance in dermatological diagnosis when rigorously validated. Conclusions The multimodal ResNet50-MPNet model shows near-perfect accuracy in diagnosing AD by mimicking clinician reasoning. It offers consistent, holistic assessment but requires external validation and improved interpretability for clinical adoption. Continued AI-clinician collaboration is vital to translating this promising technology into real-world dermatological care.

                Background Comparing non-randomized groups, such as COVID-19 vaccinated and unvaccinated, even in the presence of seemingly relevant control variables, is challenging, but in this study, using English data, I show an achievable approach. Methods First, I estimated age-standardized all-cause mortality among vaccinated and unvaccinated ten years and older, covering 26 months from Apr 21 to May 23. Then, I estimated mortality not involving COVID-19, and finally, I contrasted the calculations. Results First, I found that all-cause mortality among unvaccinated was higher than among vaccinated. But, as the pattern was similar concerning mortality not involving COVID-19, the discrepancy may be attributed mainly to unvaccinated having inferior health at the outset. There were nonetheless indications of significant protection for vaccinated between July 21 and Jan 22. In the absence of control variables as a means to compare non-randomized groups, I reached that conclusion by contrasting all-cause mortality with mortality not involving COVID-19. However, while mortality not involving COVID-19 decreased among unvaccinated compared to the first observation month, it remained high among vaccinated, indicating a relative increase. Conclusions An interpretation is that vaccination, despite a potential temporary protection, may have increased mortality. Strengthening the interpretation was relatively high mortality among vaccinated not involving COVID-19 counterintuitively following periods of excess mortality. Further strengthening the interpretation was the relatively high mortality not involving COVID-19 among vaccinated, corresponding with excess mortality during much of the same period. Future research should include data over a longer period than those available for this study. Also, future research should examine different age groups, vaccination types, and the number of doses given.

                Introduction Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health concern, with the greatest burden observed in lower-middle-income countries. Monitoring AMR through a One Health approach is essential to understand the link between clinical, animal, and environmental sources and to develop targeted interventions. Objectives This systematic review aimed to assess the impact of antibiotics on gene expression in Pseudomonas spp. within the East African Community (EAC). Methodology A thorough literature search across Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed yielded 284 articles, of which 11 met the inclusion criteria after screening. The selected studies came from five EAC countries. Findings showed a high prevalence of AMR in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with over 90% resistance to most antibiotics, except Amikacin, which remained effective likely due to limited usage. Results and discussion Common resistance genes identified included carbapenemases such as blaNDM-1 and blaVIM. The disc diffusion method was the most commonly used technique (50%).Multidrug-resistant clones like ST244 and ST357 were frequently reported. Environmental isolates had lower resistance rates (54%) compared to clinical strains (73%), suggesting differing selection pressures. Most studies originated from Kenya and Uganda (each 30%), reflecting differences in research capacity and healthcare infrastructure across the region. Conclusion These results underscore the urgent need for expanded AMR surveillance, stronger antimicrobial stewardship, and further research to inform public health responses in East Africa.

                Background There is a limited range of treatment options for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a cancer known for its aggressiveness; therefore, innovative alternative therapies are required. A link between TNBC progression and bacterial dysbiosis in the gut microenvironment has been demonstrated. Thai traditional formulary medicine (TTFM), comprising bioactive natural products and medicinal plants, exhibits anti-cancer properties. However, the effectiveness of TTFM against breast cancer (BC) has not been clarified. The present study aimed to identify the secondary metabolites of TTFM and investigate its effects on BC both in vitro and in vivo. Methods The metabolite profiles of TTFM extracts were investigated using LC-MS/MS analysis. The anti-cancer activities were examined using a cell viability assay. The effects on the apoptosis pathway and gene expression profiles were also investigated using an apoptosis assay and RNA sequencing analysis. Next, TTFM extracts were examined in 4T1 xenografted mouse models. The gut microbiota profiles and tumor gene expression were investigated by 16S rDNA sequencing and nanoString, respectively. Results LC-MS/MS identified 302 compounds in the TTFM extract. In breast cancer cells, TTFM inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Additionally, TTFM treatment partially restored the gut microbiota balance, increasing the abundance of Butyrivibrio hungatei and reducing Clostridium saccharolyticum. NanoString analysis showed that TTFM modulated immune responses by upregulating the Pias1 gene and downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1r2, IL-1β, IL-2) and cancer-related genes (Ccno, Nkd1). Conclusion This study highlights the anti-cancer potential of TTFM extracts, suggesting its future use in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for breast cancer.

Astrocytes engage in local interactions with neurons, synapses, other glial cell types, and the vasculature through intricate cellular and molecular processes, playing an important role in brain information processing, plasticity, cognition, and behavior. This study advances understanding of local interactions and self-organization of neuron-astrocyte networks and contributes to the broader investigation of their potential relationship with global activity regimes and overall brain function. We present six new contributions: (1) the development of a new model-building framework for neuron-astrocyte networks, (2) the introduction of connectivity concepts for tripartite neuron-astrocyte interactions in biological neural networks, (3) the design of a scalable architecture capable of simulating networks with up to a million cells, (4) a formalized description of neuron-astrocyte modeling that facilitates reproducibility, (5) the integration of experimental data to a greater extent than existing studies, and (6) simulation results demonstrating how neuron-astrocyte interactions drive the emergence of synchronization in local neuronal groups. Specifically, we develop a new technology for representing astrocytes and their interactions with neurons in distributed simulation code for large-scale spiking neuronal networks. This includes an astrocyte model with calcium dynamics, an extended neuron model receiving calcium-dependent signals from astrocytes, and a parallelized connectivity generation scheme for tripartite interactions between pre- and postsynaptic neurons and astrocytes. We verify the efficiency of our reference implementation through benchmarks varying in computing resources and network sizes. Our <i>in silico</i> experiments reproduce experimental data on astrocytic effects on neuronal synchronization, demonstrating that astrocytes consistently induce local synchronization in groups of neurons across various connectivity schemes and global activity regimes. By adjusting the strength of neuron-astrocyte interactions, we can switch the global activity regime from asynchronous to network-wide synchronization. This work represents an advancement in neuron-astrocyte modeling, introducing a novel framework that enables large-scale simulations of astrocytic influence on neuronal networks.

                <p>by Leandro P. L. Jacob, Sydney M. Bailes, Stephanie D. Williams, Carsen Stringer, Laura D. Lewis</p>

The brain exhibits rich oscillatory dynamics that play critical roles in vigilance and cognition, such as the neural rhythms that define sleep. These rhythms continuously fluctuate, signaling major changes in vigilance, but the widespread brain dynamics underlying these oscillations are difficult to investigate. Using simultaneous EEG and fast fMRI in humans who fell asleep inside the scanner, we developed a machine learning approach to investigate which fMRI regions and networks predict fluctuations in neural rhythms. We demonstrated that the rise and fall of alpha (8–12 Hz) and delta (1–4 Hz) power—two canonical EEG bands critically involved with cognition and vigilance—can be predicted from fMRI data in subjects that were not present in the training set. This approach also identified predictive information in individual brain regions across the cortex and subcortex. Finally, we developed an approach to identify shared and unique predictive information, and found that information about alpha rhythms was highly separable in two networks linked to arousal and visual systems. Conversely, delta rhythms were diffusely represented on a large spatial scale primarily across the cortex. These results demonstrate that EEG rhythms can be predicted from fMRI data, identify large-scale network patterns that underlie alpha and delta rhythms, and establish a novel framework for investigating multimodal brain dynamics.

                <p>by Azka Javaid, H. Robert Frost</p>

The accurate cell-level characterization of cytokine activity is important for understanding the signaling processes underpinning a wide range of immune-mediated conditions such as auto-immune disease, cancer and response to infection. We previously proposed the SCAPE (Single cell transcriptomics-level Cytokine Activity Prediction and Estimation) method to address the challenges associated with cytokine activity estimation in human single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. Here, we propose a new method MouSSE (Mouse-Specific Single cell transcriptomics level cytokine activity prediction and Estimation) for performing cytokine activity estimation in murine scRNA-seq and ST data. MouSSE estimates the cell-level activity of 86 distinct cytokines using a gene set scoring approach. The cytokine-specific gene sets used by MouSSE are constructed using experimental cytokine stimulation data from the Immune Dictionary and cell-level scores are computed using a modification of the Variance-adjusted Mahalanobis (VAM) technique that supports both positive and negative gene weights. MouSSE is validated using data from both the Immune Dictionary via stratified cross-validation and external scRNA-seq and ST datasets against 10 cytokine activity estimation methods. These results demonstrate that MouSSE outperforms comparable methods for cell-level cytokine activity estimation in mouse scRNA-seq and ST data. An example vignette and installation instructions for the MouSSE R package are provided at https://github.com/azkajavaid/MousseR-package.

                <p>by Anton Iyer, Adrian Alva, Adrián E. Granada, Shaon Chakrabarti</p>

Drug tolerant persisters (DTPs) drive cancer therapy resistance by temporarily evading drug action, allowing multiple routes to eventual permanent resistance. Despite clear evidence for DTPs, the timing of their emergence, proliferative nature, and how their population dynamics arise from measured single-cell kinetics remain poorly understood. Here we use time-lapse microscopy data from two cancer cell lines, integrating single-cell and population measurements, to develop a quantitative description of drug persistence. Contrary to the expectation that increasing levels of genotoxic stress should lead to slower times to division and faster times to death, we observe minor changes in the single-cell intermitotic and death time distributions upon increasing cisplatin concentration. Yet, population decay rates increase 3-fold, suggesting a surprising independence of the overall dynamics from the measured birth and death rates. To explain this phenomenon, we argue that the observed lineage correlations and concentration-dependent decay rates imply cell-state dependent fate choices made <i>both</i> pre and post-cisplatin as opposed to just post-drug birth/death rate-based competitive fate choices. We demonstrate that these cell-states, present in the pre-drug ancestors of DTP and sensitive cells, exhibit no difference in cycling speed and are inherited across at least 2-3 cellular generations. Post-drug survival versus death fates are decided with high probability by these pre-existing cell-states, but get modulated to some extent by the drug, leading to a drug concentration dependent state-fate map. A stochastic model implementing these rules simultaneously recapitulates the observed decay rates and cell-fate lineage correlations. The model also demonstrates how the use of barcode diversity change before and after drug might lead to misleading interpretations of the timing of persister fate decisions. Our results provide a conceptual framework for quantifying pre versus post-drug contributions to cell fate, without requiring knowledge of the underlying molecular architecture of the heterogeneous cell states.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78029?af=R">Clinical–Radiological Spectrum of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy‐Related Inflammation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify clinical and radiological features of cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation (CAA-ri), and compare these features with those of sporadic CAA, to improve the understanding, diagnosis, and clinical care of CAA-ri.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively reviewed routine clinical data from 37 patients with CAA-ri and 158 patients with sporadic CAA, including conventional vascular risk factors and comorbidities. We assessed brain magnetic resonance imaging for: radiological markers of CAA; features of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema/effusion (ARIA-E) including parenchymal white matter hyperintensities, sulcal hyperintensities, and gyral swelling; and evidence of neurodegeneration (medial temporal atrophy and global cortical atrophy).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared with patients with sporadic CAA, patients with CAA-ri had more numerous lobar cerebral microbleeds (median 207[IQR 33-811] vs 19[IQR 7-58], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and higher rates of medial temporal and global cortical atrophy. In comparison with sporadic CAA, all ARIA-E features were much more common in patients with CAA-ri (parenchymal hyperintensities 89% vs 3%, sulcal hyperintensities 78% vs 9%, and gyral swelling 86% vs 0.6%), as were conventional vascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia) and long-term comorbidities (inflammatory and infectious disorders, autoimmune or connective tissue disorders, or malignancies).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Features of ARIA-E (parenchymal white matter hyperintensities, sulcal hyperintensities, and gyral swelling) are more common in CAA-ri in comparison with “non-inflammatory” sporadic CAA, suggesting shared mechanisms with Alzheimer's disease immunotherapy and a potential role in improving diagnostic accuracy for CAA-ri. The high prevalence of atrophy and lobar cerebral microbleeds suggests a potential mechanistic role for capillary CAA, Alzheimer's disease, or both, in CAA-ri. Cardiovascular risk factors and other long-term comorbidities may also be relevant to the underlying mechanisms of CAA-ri. ANN NEUROL 2025 ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>Reversing the aging process may yield significant benefits in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), as accelerated biological aging is observed in this population. Secondary analyses of 2 previously conducted dietary interventions including a 6-month modified ketogenic diet in 39 participants and an 8-week randomized comparison of intermittent and daily calorie restriction versus a weight-stable regimen in 36 participants demonstrated significant decreases in metabolomic age (mAge) following the ketogenic diet (<i>p</i> = 0.009) and intermittent calorie restriction (<i>p</i> = 0.04), whereas daily calorie reduction had no effect. These findings indicate that fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) can reverse accelerated metabolomic aging in PwMS. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-949/v1?src=rss">Behavioral Finance in the sphere of investment: Systematic Review of Literature between 2020 and 2025 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Behavioral finance is a growing field that explores how cognitive biases and psychological factors—such as emotions, heuristics, and social influence—affect financial decision-making. This paper investigates how behavioral biases have evolved and influenced investment behavior in light of recent technological and market developments. Methods A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted, focusing on peer-reviewed publications from 2020 to 2025. A total of 30 studies were analyzed, selected from databases such as Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Emerald using criteria including relevance, recency, and empirical focus. The selected literature was categorized based on psychological biases, methodological approaches, and emerging themes in investor behavior. Results The findings highlight that traditional biases such as overconfidence, herding, anchoring, and loss aversion continue to dominate investment behavior. Moreover, the review identifies automation bias—a newer bias arising from investor over-reliance on AI and fintech platforms. Studies show that technological innovation, the COVID-19 pandemic, and rising retail investor activity have intensified behavioral distortions. Conclusion Behavioral finance remains essential for understanding real-world investment behavior. Enhancing financial literacy, incorporating behavioral nudges, and updating regulatory frameworks are critical for mitigating the negative effects of these biases. The study offers a forward-looking perspective on integrating behavioral insights into investment strategies and calls for future research into AI-driven finance, cross-cultural effects, and the role of fintech in shaping investor psychology. This study conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of research published between 2020 and 2025. This review identifies key behavioral biases, such as overconfidence, herding, anchoring, and loss aversion, that continue to dominate investor behavior. It also highlights emerging biases, including automation bias, resulting from increased reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) and fintech platforms. This study analyzed 30 peer-reviewed articles using various methodologies, including surveys, experiments, and econometric models.

                Background Bariatric surgery, particularly sleeve gastrectomy (SG), has emerged as an effective long-term treatment for morbid obesity. Despite its benefits, howver, it may result in severe complications. One rare but serious postoperative issue is the development of a gastrobronchial fistula (GBF), a condition with a challenging diagnosis and management pathway due to its insidious nature. Case Presentation We report the case of a 36-year-old woman who underwent sleeve gastrectomy in 2015. The early postoperative course was complicated by a gastric fistula that was managed with double pigtail stents. Subsequently, the patient developed recurrent bronchopulmonary infections, and imaging in 2017 revealed a GBF connecting the gastric remnant to the bronchial tree. Initial endoscopic management with stenting failed because of migration. Definitive surgical management involved complex adhesiolysis and creation of tension-free fistula-jejunal anastomosis. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient remains asymptomatic. Discussion Gastrothoracic fistula post-bariatric surgery is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. Their development is often linked to the insufficient treatment of early gastric leaks or collections. Diagnosis is frequently delayed owing to nonspecific respiratory symptoms. Endoscopic approaches have show limited success, and surgical management, often complex, is frequently necessary. Multidisciplinary strategies, including endoscopic and surgical options, are vital for achieving favorable outcomes. Conclusion Gastrobronchial fistulas represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge following sleeve gastrectomy. A high index of suspicion, long-term follow-up, and tailored multidisciplinary approach are essential for effective management and resolution. Awareness of this rare complication should prompt early detection and intervention to reduce the morbidity and mortality.

                Introduction Textiloma refers to a retained surgical textile material within the body after surgery. It is a rare but serious iatrogenic complication that may remain asymptomatic for years. Case Presentation We report a case of a 38-year-old woman with a history of open ovarian cystectomy 15 years earlier, presenting with persistent abdominal pain. Imaging revealed a complex pelvic mass with abscess formation and enteric fistula. Despite interventional drainage and antibiotic therapy, the patient developed signs of sepsis. Endoscopic evaluation revealed a retained surgical textile in the rectum, which was extracted. The patient subsequently developed generalized peritonitis and underwent emergency laparotomy revealing two retained textilomas and multiple intestinal perforations. Despite aggressive surgical intervention, the patient succumbed to septic shock on postoperative day one. Conclusion Textiloma should be considered in patients with atypical abdominal masses and previous surgical history. Preventive strategies and early recognition are critical to avoid fatal outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-699/v2?src=rss">The antimicrobial activity of EDTA in combination with Meropenem, Amikacin, and Piperacillin-Tazobactam against hospital-multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                The escalating global threat of antimicrobial resistance presents a critical challenge to public health. In Iraq, the increasing rise of resistance strains further confirms the need for innovative treatment strategies. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) has shown promise in enhancing antibiotic efficacy via destabilizing bacterial membranes and disrupting biofilms. Objectives This study examines the effects of combining EDTA with commonly used antibiotics on multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from a major hospital in Baghdad, Iraq. Additionally, it assesses the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in these bacterial strains. The main goal is to improve treatment outcomes and address the growing challenges of antimicrobial resistance in healthcare settings. Methods This experimental in vitro study evaluates the effects of combining EDTA with meropenem, amikacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam on multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from clinical samples. Results The results show that EDTA enhanced the antibiotics’ effectiveness, increasing inhibition zone diameters and improving bacterial susceptibility. The inhibition zone expanded by approximately 2 to 5 millimeters. Resistance patterns shifted, with some previously resistant or intermediate strains becoming susceptible when treated with the combined therapy. In conclusion, EDTA increases the efficacy of meropenem, amikacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam against multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. Conclusion This presents a promising approach to improve treatment options for infections caused by resistant pathogens. Further research is needed to understand EDTA’s mechanisms and clinical applications.

                Background The heavy metal contamination of water leads to major environmental and health problems throughout the Mantaro River basin area. The study assesses the adsorption capacity of surface-modified chak’o nano-clay for extracting lead (Pb2+) and arsenic (As5+). Methods Surface modifications of unmodified nano-clay were achieved using through Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), iron oxide (Fe3O4), and combined APTES + Fe3O4 modifications of unmodified nano-clay particles. Adsorption performance was assessed through batch experiments over 8 hours. BET and XPS analyses were conducted to determine surface area, pore volume, and functional group availability. Adsorption kinetics were modeled using a pseudo-second-order model, and equilibrium data were analyzed using the Langmuir isotherm. Results The dual surface modification produced maximum removal capacities which led to a 95–100% removal performance of Pb2+ and As5+ over 8 hours. The BET and XPS analysis demonstrated that surface area (300 m2/g to 375 m2/g) and pore volume (0.420 cm3/g to 0.600 cm3/g) as well as functional group availability increased substantially thus resulting in improved adsorption. The pseudo-second-order model fit well for adsorption kinetic data while equilibrium data fit Langmuir isotherm behavior to describe monolayer adsorption. The dual treatment of APTES in combination with iron oxide generated an adsorbent with better magnetic properties and electrical conductivity thus improving its recovery potential and structural stability. The dual-modified nano-clay showed high stability during three cycles through desorption tests because it maintained more than 90% of its original adsorption capacity throughout the process. Conclusion The research shows that specialized surface treatments deliver advanced heavy metal absorption abilities to chak’o nano-clay which positions it as a leading choice for sustainable water system heavy metal remediation.

                The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rapidly digitising educational system due to advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have made a change in leadership imperative. A key framework for improving organisational effectiveness in handling these changes is digital leadership. It combines technological competencies with traditional leadership. Even with increased scholarly interest, there remains a gap in the thorough analysis of the field’s intellectual framework, thematic evolution, and collaborative dynamics. This study addresses this gap by conducting a bibliometric analysis of digital leadership research in education from 1993 to 2024, employing RStudio to map publication trends, influential sources, author productivity, conceptual themes, and social structures. Data from 338 Scopus-indexed documents reveal a significant rise in publications post-2010, peaking in 2023, with core journals such as Education and Information Technologies and Cogent Education dominating the field. However, the notable decline observed in 2024 indicates that the decline in publications may be due to research saturation, a change in research priorities, or funding. Prolific authors like Karakose T., Altinay F., and Z. underscore the centrality of collaborative research, while thematic mapping identifies key clusters: digital competence, virtual leadership, and institutional innovation. Thematic evolution highlights a post-pandemic pivot toward digital transformation and AI integration, though niche areas like K-12 digital leadership remain underdeveloped. Social network analysis reveals dispersed yet growing global collaborations, with the United States, Turkey, and the United Kingdom as dominant hubs, while disparities persist in Global South participation. The study’s implications emphasize the need for interdisciplinary research, equitable global partnerships, and policy frameworks that prioritize digital leadership training for educators. Practitioners are encouraged to implement adaptive strategies to leverage emerging technologies, ensuring sustainable learning outcomes. This analysis provides a foundation for future research and practice in digital leadership by delineating the field’s conceptual and social networks, thereby bridging the divides between theory, policy, and institutional practice.

                Background Although Spigelian hernia is rare, it should not be underestimated because of its significant risk of strangulation. The scarcity of studies and the absence of large, comprehensive case series on this pathology often makes clinical decision-making, despite appearing straightforward, both challenging and ambiguous. Methods This is a retrospective, monocentric study, conducted between January 2013 and December 2022, involving 14 patients who underwent surgery for a Spigelian hernia in the General Surgery Department of Charles Nicole Hospital in Tunis. Various epidemiological, clinical, radiological, and therapeutic factors were analysed using univariate analysis and logistic regression analyses. Results Fourteen patients with Spigelian hernia were recruited. The mean patient age was 62 years. All patients had predisposing factors for increased intra-abdominal pressure, and 50% had a history of abdominal surgery. The most common symptom was lateralized abdominal pain. Diagnosis was supported by imaging in 85.7% of cases, with CT scans being particularly helpful in emergency settings. Surgical repair was performed in all patients, predominantly via an open approach (92.8%). Primary suture repair was used in 64.2% of cases, while mesh repair was performed in 35.7%. The postoperative course was uneventful in 85.7% of patients. Morbidity was 14.2%, with no mortality. One recurrence was observed during follow-up. Conclusions Despite its rarity, Spigelian hernia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of localized abdominal pain. Imaging, particularly CT, plays a key role in diagnosis. Surgical repair, whether by suture or mesh, offers favorable outcomes with low morbidity and recurrence rates.

                Background Syphilis is a cosmopolitan infection, with recent infections (primary or secondary syphilis <1 year) posing the highest risk of mother-to-child transmission. In such cases, early treatment is crucial in determining obstetric prognosis. Objective This study aims to present current data of syphilis in pregnant women and improve the management of syphilis in pregnant women in the city of Kisangani. Methods This is an analytical case-control study covering the period from July 1, 2023, to December 1, 2023. The study was conducted at Makiso Kisangani General Referral Hospital, with a study population of 290 pregnant women. A non-exhaustive sampling method was used, selecting, in the obstetrical department, a sample of 145 pregnant women diagnosed with syphilis and 145 others diagnosed with out syphilis. Data were analyzed using R software version 4.3. Results The most represented age group was 20 to 34 years (61.4%). The majority of pregnant women with syphilis were married (61.4%), in monogamous relationships (72.4%), and had unemployed partners (26.9%). The most common risk factors were having a partner who was a driver (OR: 3.31; p = 0.028), a trader (OR: 8.08; p <0.001), and having a history of STIs (p <0.001) or multiple sexual partners (p = 0.011). In 75% of cases, pregnancy resulted in the birth of a live fetus and 25% cases result in the birth of a died fetus. Conclusion Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with syphilis could be reduced through early detection and standard treatment of syphilis for pregnant women and their husbands/sexual partners.

                Background Based on signs prohibiting certain actions, people warn others using imperative forms of verbs or give a soft warning using politeness strategies. This study clarified how native Japanese speakers and Uzbek Japanese learners perform warnings based on prohibited signs. Methods After clarifying the difference between prohibition and warning, we proposed a classification scheme for the latter speech act in terms of politeness. Data were elicited using a discourse completion task. We prepared tasks for how participants verbally warn people who are about to perform prohibited acts in museums and hospitals, based on the prohibited signs. Results Native Japanese speakers tended to mitigate warnings by using two politeness strategies. The first politeness strategy was the use of rule-based expressions such as “It is forbidden.” However, such expressions may make the hearer feel that the speaker is an overbearing person who wields authority. To avoid this risk, Japanese speakers used the second politeness strategy of hedging inference, as in “Looks like it is forbidden.” They made it clear that the power to forbid does not rest with them, but with the public authorities, and furthermore, that it is only a possibility of their own speculation. The Uzbek learners of Japanese, on the other hand, were more direct in their warnings than the Japanese, and implemented a politeness strategy of apology as compensation. In some cases, the Japanese group and the Uzbek Japanese learners’ group did not warn. They did not warn strangers. Conclusions The characteristics of Uzbek learners of Japanese were found to follow the general characteristics of the learners’ language. This study presented a framework for classifying warnings about prohibited acts. This framework is applicable to languages other than Japanese, Uzbek, and Japanese spoken by Uzbek learners of Japanese.

                Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) constitute a major public health challenge globally. The increase in the prevalence of non-communicable diseases in South Africa continues to impact mortality and morbidity, including disability, necessitating the need to explore the growing burden of NCDs and their implications for public health. NCDs like cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and respiratory diseases are associated with various factors, ranging from lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and socioeconomic differences. Therefore, this review will explore and describe the prevalence of NCDs, associated risk factors, and the impact on the South African public healthcare system. Methods The five-step review described by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review methodology: (1) determining the research question, (2) comprehensive database search, (3) inclusion criteria, (4) data extraction, and (5) analysis and presentation of the results, will be used for this study. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and the Meta-Analysis (PRISMA-P) will guide this scoping review protocol. The selection of studies for the review is anticipated to be completed within 10 weeks, from 15 October to 31 December 2025. Literature search will be conducted across multiple electronic databases: PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and grey literature. The literature search timeline is between 2000 and 2025. The eligibility of articles will be determined using a two-stage screening process. All articles will be individually assessed for eligibility by two reviewers, while any disagreements will be resolved by consensus. The extracted data from eligible articles will be synthesized and presented using charts and narrative summaries. Conclusion This scoping review will provide an evidence map of research available on the prevalence of NCDs in South Africa, with a description of the risk factors and interventions to prevent and control NCDs in South Africa, while also informing the development of targeted public health policies and interventions for NCDs in South Africa.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-944/v1?src=rss">Hydrotherapy as a complementary intervention for academic stress in higher education: A public health perspective [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The global rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has heightened the urgency to tackle modifiable risk factors, including chronic psychological stress. Faculty members in higher education institutions are increasingly experiencing academic stress due to heavy workloads, administrative demands, and insufficient institutional support. Despite this, the well-being of faculty is often neglected as a crucial element in fostering knowledge and innovation, leading to burnout, reduced productivity, and a greater susceptibility to NCDs. This paper contends that hydrotherapy, long appreciated for its physiological and psychophysiological advantages, should be acknowledged as a non-pharmacological, evidence-based, and scalable solution for managing chronic academic stress. Hydrotherapy provides a comprehensive, proactive approach to faculty wellness by influencing stress-related biological pathways, especially the hypothalamic (pituitary) axis. Based on emerging clinical evidence and public health models, we propose the strategic incorporation of hydrotherapy into institutional wellness programs, viewing it not just as a relaxation method, but as a transformative intervention with the potential to improve long-term institutional vitality and public health outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-943/v1?src=rss">Antibiotic treatment of severe bacterial pneumonia: a scoping review to characterise the evidence for current treatment options [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The FAIR project is evaluating flagellin aerosol therapy (FLAMOD) as an adjunct to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) pneumonia. Our scoping review characterises the existing evidence for the antibiotic treatment of patients with severe bacterial pneumonia (SBP) to inform future health economic modelling of FLAMOD versus standard-of-care. Methods A systematic search identified relevant publications (January 2001 to July 2021) in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and other sources. Clinical trials and cohort studies of antibiotic treatments in hospitalised patients with SBP reporting clinical efficacy, mortality, or length of hospital stay were eligible. Two reviewers independently applied the review methods. The study data were extracted into a bespoke Microsoft Access database. Results Over half of the 327 included studies were retrospective cohort studies and the remainder were RCTs (20%) or prospective cohort studies (23%). Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was the most common type of pneumonia (39%). Among 144 studies that treated specific bacteria, gram-negative pathogens (22.2%), Acinetobacter baumannii (20.1%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.4%) were the most common. In 236 studies reporting treatment with specific antibiotics, 44% used an antibiotic from the WHO reserve list of antibiotics and a third mapped to a single drug class (commonly polymyxins, 20 studies). Mortality was the most frequently reported outcome (27.9% of studies on severe CAP). Conclusion We characterised evidence for antibiotic treatment in patients with SBP. Our database provides us with the flexibility to identify evidence for a future economic model to assess whether FLAMOD can be a cost-effective adjunct to conventional antibiotic treatment of AMR. Evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics in SBP is plentiful, but heterogeneous. We highlight challenges for evidence synthesis, including difficulties in identifying studies specifically on severe pneumonia, lack of clear reporting about whether treatment is empirical or definitive, and inconsistent reporting of the line of therapy and levels of antibiotic resistance.

[version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved wit</a></h4>

              
                Background Good care and conscious, mindful parenting are the essential requirements of the early childhood period. Good care in early childhood consists of mindful handling of children’s needs like hunger, care in sickness, socio-emotional needs, safety, love and affection. Good care promotes children’s development and provides a favourable environment for learning. It’s a well-known fact that hospitalization is a stressful situation for child of any age. Play is an integral part of early childhood period which is virtually restricted in hospital settings. This study will try to explore the effectiveness of play therapy delivered in hospital settings, on early child development (ECD). Methods This will be a randomized control trial conducted in the Paediatrics department of a tertiary care hospital in Wardha, India. The sample size will be 360 children, 180 each in intervention and control arm. The hospitalized children from intervention arm will receive customized Play Therapy sessions from trained research assistants and will be followed up at scheduled monthly home visits for one year from the date of enrolment. All children will be assessed for changes in cognitive, motor and socio-emotional development scores. The differences in development scores between intervention and control groups will be compared and effect sizes of changes will be calculated. Discussion Implementation of play stimulation activities have been reported as useful strategies for promoting child development and good recovery during hospitalization. This trial will attempt to explore the effectiveness of play therapy on changes in child development scores of children from intervention group compared to the control group. The customized play therapy program will be adapted to paediatric inpatient settings, and attempts will be made to improve the Play Therapy kit for hospitalized children.

                Numerous studies in humans have demonstrated a strong link between heart and brain function at different timescales. We conceptualize this functional coupling using different dimensions of brain–body states, formed through the integration of the central and peripheral nervous systems (PNS and CNS, respectively). Using concepts from dynamical systems theory, we discuss how patterns of brain–body dimensions traverse a state space. Attractors signify stable configurations, which we categorize as micro-, meso-, or macro-states according to their duration and reversibility. These reflect different underlying mechanisms, such as neural interactions, hormonal signaling, and structural plasticity. Longer-lasting states restrict the space of possible (shorter-term) brain–body states underlying the mutual dependence of cardiovascular and brain function over the lifespan and in the development of diseases such as hypertension and depression. These considerations, which can be further generalized to include immunological and metabolic dimensions of brain–body states, have broad conceptual and clinical implications.

                Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) restores voluntary motor control after paralysis, but this experimental observation remains unexplained. In this study, Balaguer et al. show that residual brain inputs transform subthreshold, SCS-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials into action potentials, producing SCS-entrained motoneuron firing. The brain can regulate this entrainment, thereby mimicking volitional firing rate control.

                How multiciliated cells (MCCs) generate hundreds of centrioles for multiciliation has remained an unresolved problem in cell biology. Lu et al. show that the MCC “master” transcriptional regulator, MCIDAS, not only functions in the nucleus to induce genes for multiciliation but also undergoes cytoplasmic translocation to organize explosive centriole biogenesis.

                Leach et al. utilize mutant zebrafish lines to identify microglia as a critical immune cell type involved in ocular tissue regeneration after retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) ablation. Phagocytic clearance of injury site debris and il34 were identified as immune-related mechanisms driving the RPE regenerative response.

                Ottenhoff et al. demonstrate that non-directional reaching behavior can be decoded from brain-wide movement-related neural activity. A goal-centric reference frame enabled the decoder to predict distance-to-target, indicating that low-frequency activity is involved in higher-order processing. This work provides avenues for brain-computer interfaces for individuals with a compromised motor cortex.

Furthermore, IC3A correlates with the severity biomarker serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).

                TDP-43 mislocalization and pathology occurs across a range of neurodegenerative diseases, but the pathways that modulate TDP-43 in neurons are not well understood. We generated a Halo-TDP-43 knock-in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line and performed a genome-wide CRISPR interference FACS-based screen to identify modifiers of TDP-43 levels in neurons. A meta-analysis of our screen and publicly available screens identified both specific hits and pathways present across multiple screens, the latter likely responsible for generic protein level maintenance. We identified BORC, a complex required for anterograde lysosome transport, as a specific modifier of TDP-43 protein, but not mRNA, levels in neurons. BORC loss led to longer half-life of TDP-43 and other proteins, suggesting lysosome location is required for proper protein turnover. As such, lysosome location and function are crucial for maintaining TDP-43 protein levels in neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106508">Blue-shifted ancyromonad channelrhodopsins for multiplex optogenetics</a></h4>

              
                Light-gated ion channels from protists (channelrhodopsins or ChRs) are optogenetic tools widely used for controlling neurons and cardiomyocytes. Multiplex optogenetic applications require spectrally separated molecules, which are difficult to engineer without disrupting channel function. Scanning numerous sequence databases, we identified three naturally blue-shifted ChRs from ancyromonads. They form a separate branch on the phylogenetic tree and contain residue motifs characteristic of anion ChRs (ACRs). However, only two conduct chloride, whereas the closely related <i>Nutomonas longa</i> homolog generates inward cation currents in mammalian cells under physiological conditions, significantly exceeding those by previously known tools with similar spectral maxima (peak absorption at ~440 nm). Measurements of transient absorption changes and pH titration of purified proteins combined with mutant analysis revealed the roles of the residues in the photoactive site. Ancyromonad ChRs could be activated by near-infrared two-photon illumination, a technique that enables the deeper-tissue optogenetic activation of specific neurons in three dimensions. Both ancyromonad ACRs allowed optogenetic silencing of mouse cortical neurons in brain slices. <i>Ancyromonas sigmoides</i> ACR (<i>Ans</i>ACR) expression in cholinergic neurons enabled photoinhibition of pharyngeal muscle contraction in live worms. Overall, our results deepen the mechanistic understanding of light-gated channel function and expand the optogenetic toolkit with potent, blue-shifted ChRs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106481">Human single-neuron activity is modulated by intracranial theta burst stimulation of the basolateral amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Direct electrical stimulation of the human brain has been used for numerous clinical and scientific applications. At present, however, little is known about how intracranial stimulation affects activity at the microscale. In this study, we recorded intracranial EEG data from a cohort of patients with medically refractory epilepsy as they completed a visual recognition memory task. During the memory task, brief trains of intracranial theta burst stimulation (TBS) were delivered to the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Using simultaneous microelectrode recordings, we isolated neurons in the hippocampus, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex and tested whether stimulation enhanced or suppressed firing rates. Additionally, we characterized the properties of modulated neurons, clustered presumed excitatory and inhibitory neurons by waveform morphology, and examined the extent to which modulation affected memory task performance. We observed a subset of neurons (~30%) whose firing rate was modulated by TBS, exhibiting highly heterogeneous responses with respect to onset latency, duration, and direction of effect. Notably, location and baseline activity predicted which neurons were most susceptible to modulation, although the impact of this neuronal modulation on memory remains unclear. These findings advance our limited understanding of how focal electrical fields influence neuronal firing at the single-cell level.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100749">Membrane binding properties of the cytoskeletal protein bactofilin</a></h4>

              
                Bactofilins are a widespread family of cytoskeletal proteins that are essential for bacterial morphogenesis, chromosome organization, and motility. They assemble into non-polar filaments independently of nucleotides and typically associate with the cytoplasmic membrane. Their membrane interaction is thought to involve a short N-terminal peptide, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we clarify the complete membrane-targeting sequence (MTS) of the <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> bactofilin BacA and identify residues critical for its function. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that its affinity for membranes arises from hydrophobic residue-driven water exclusion and electrostatic interactions with negatively charged phospholipid headgroups. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that this mode of membrane binding is conserved across diverse bacterial phyla. Importantly, we observe that BacA polymerization and membrane binding stimulate each other, and both of these processes are necessary for recruiting the membrane-bound client protein PbpC, a cell wall synthase that interacts with BacA via its N-terminal cytoplasmic region. PbpC can functionally replace the MTS of BacA when overproduced, demonstrating that client proteins contribute to the bactofilin-membrane association. Thus, bactofilin assembly and localization are determined by a complex interplay of different factors, thereby enabling the adaptation of these processes to the needs of the systems they control.

">Verbal Episodic Processing in Newborns</a></h4>

              
                During the first period of life, human infants rapidly and effortlessly acquire the languages they are exposed to. Although memory is central to this process, the nature of early verbal memory systems and the factors that determine retention and forgetting remain largely unknown. Behavioural and brain measures have demonstrated memory formation in newborns. However, word traces fade in the face of acoustic overlap, leading to interference and forgetting. Here, we investigate whether speakers' identity changes facilitate the separation into distinct acoustic episodes and the creation of non-overlapping verbal memories. Newborns (0-4 days-old) were tested in a familiarization-interference-test protocol, while neural cortical activity was recorded using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). The results showed higher neural activation for novel words compared to familiar ones in the test phase, indicating that the infants recognized the familiar words despite the presence of potentially interfering sounds. The recognition response was measured over the left inferior frontal (IFG) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) areas, known to be crucial for encoding auditory information and language processing. The neural response also involved the right IFG and STG, involved in interpreting vocal social cues and speaker recognition. These data show that speaker identity is a key feature of speech, enabling episodic-like memories from birth and evolutionary advantages at the outset of human communication.

">Population coupling of V1 and V4 neurons and its relation to local cortical state fluctuations and attention in macaque monkey</a></h4>

              
                Neurons couple to various degrees to the activity level of the local neighboring population whereby strongly coupled 'choristers' and weakly coupled 'soloists' have been identified as two extremes of a continuous spectrum. At the same time neuronal populations undergo coordinated On and Off cortical state activity fluctuations, which are locally modulated by attention. The population coupling of soloists and choristers suggests that soloists should show limited alignment with cortical state fluctuations, while choristers should exhibit profound alignment. To test this, we recorded neurons across cortical layers in macaque areas V1 and V4, while animals performed a feature based spatial attention task. As expected, we found a wide range of population coupling strength of neurons. In line with our prediction, coupling of choristers to cortical state changes (ON-OFF transitions) was generally stronger than that of soloists. The strength of population coupling of neurons was similar during spontaneous and stimulus driven activity. Allocation of attention to the receptive field reduced the population coupling strength. Attentional modulation of neurons was positively correlated with population coupling strength. While neurons on averaged retained their coupling strengths across conditions, some neurons can change coupling strength condition dependent, thereby potentially enhancing the coding abilities of cortical circuits.

">Sensitivity of the human temporal voice areas to nonhuman primate vocalizations</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, research on voice processing in the human brain - particularly the study of temporal voice areas (TVA) - was dedicated almost exclusively to conspecific vocalizations. To characterize commonalities and differences regarding primate vocalization representations in the human brain, the inclusion of closely related nonhuman primates - namely chimpanzees and bonobos - is needed. We hypothesized that neural commonalities would depend on both phylogenetic and acoustic proximities, with chimpanzees ranking closest to Homo. Presenting human participants (N=23) with the vocalizations of four primate species (rhesus macaques, chimpanzees, bonobos and humans) and regressing-out relevant acoustic parameters using three distinct analyses, we observed within-TVA, sample-specific, bilateral anterior superior temporal gyrus activity for chimpanzee vocalizations compared to: all other species; nonhuman primates; human vocalizations. Within-TVA activity was also observed for macaque vocalizations. Our results provide evidence for subregions of the TVA that respond principally - but not exclusively - to phylogenetically and acoustically close nonhuman primate vocalizations, namely those of chimpanzees.

">Spatial predictive coding in visual cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Predictive coding is a theoretical framework that can explain how animals build internal models of their sensory environments by predicting sensory inputs. Predictive coding may capture either spatial or temporal relationships between sensory objects. While the original theory by Rao and Ballard, 1999 described spatial predictive coding, much of the recent experimental data has been interpreted as evidence for temporal predictive coding. Here we directly tested whether the "mismatch" neural responses in sensory cortex are due to a spatial or a temporal internal model. We adopted two common paradigms to study predictive coding: one based on virtual-reality and one based on static images. After training mice with repeated visual stimulation for several days, we performed multiple manipulations, including: 1) we introduced a novel stimulus, 2) we replaced a stimulus with a novel gray wall, 3) we duplicated a trained stimulus, or 4) we altered the order of the stimuli. The first two manipulations induced a substantial mismatch response in neural populations of up to 20,000 neurons recorded across primary and higher-order visual cortex, while the third and fourth ones did not. Thus, a mismatch response only occurred if a new spatial -- not temporal -- pattern was introduced.

">Gait adaptation to asymmetric foot-ground compliance applied by robotic footwear</a></h4>

              
                Perturbing foot-ground interaction dynamics has shown promise for eliciting adaptations to inter-limb weight-bearing symmetry, a critical target for rehabilitation of asymmetrical neuromotor deficits affecting gait. To date, this perturbation paradigm has been delivered via adjustable stiffness treadmills, in which the treadmill deck displaces under the foot during the stance phase of gait. Recently, we developed robotic footwear capable of delivering asymmetrical ground stiffness perturbations during walking, offering a portable experimental platform for asymmetrical ground stiffness perturbations, allowing it to be executed overground and on conventional treadmills. In this study, we quantified kinetic and spatio-temporal gait adaptation to a foot-ground compliance perturbation delivered by the novel robotic footwear. We found that participants shifted their vertical ground reaction force impulse, vertical pushoff peak, and peak braking force toward the unperturbed limb after the perturbation was removed, indicating a shift in neuromotor control elicited by the perturbation. We conclude that the robotic footwear can elicit weight bearing adaptations similar to adjustable stiffness treadmills, and that the dissipative mechanical properties of the shoes likely play a key role in the direction of the adaptation.

">Accelerated rTMS for Enhancing Intact Cognition: An Examination of Dose Effects on Electrocortical Indicators of Attention and Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND AND AIMS Improvements in cognition (e.g., attention, working memory) are common after repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment and have also been observed in non-clinical samples. This study investigated whether rTMS can enhance cognitive resilience in individuals who perform in high-stress environments using cognitive measures and electroencephalography (EEG) to explore potential neural mechanisms of rTMS-induced cognitive change. METHODS 40 college-educated adults not reporting cognitive or psychiatric concerns underwent a 5-day accelerated (10 sessions/ day) rTMS treatment and pre-post cognitive assessment. Participants were assigned to 1 of 10 doses defined as number of active vs. sham stimulation sessions/ day (total active pulses = 3,000-30,000). To assess cognitive effects, standard batteries (NIH Toolbox, Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows [WinSCAT]) were administered-and a subset (n=21) also did an N-Back working memory task with EEG measurement-before, immediately after, and 1 month after rTMS. For all indices, linear and quadratic correlations of pre-to-post-rTMS change with dose were examined to test if an optimal dose was achieved. RESULTS From pre- to post-rTMS, participants improved in fluid cognition (working memory, processing speed) as measured by NIH toolbox, t(39)=8.4, p<.001, d=1.3, and WinSCAT, t(39)=4.1, p<.001, d=.65; and, improvement in the latter related linearly to rTMS dose, r(39)=.40, p=.01. Regarding EEG, subjects who received high (6+ active sessions/day) also showed increased amplitudes of an event-related marker of stimulus-directed attention (P300) whether it was elicited by simple task targets, t(10)=3.1, p=.01, d=.95, or task-unrelated noise stimuli played during the task as probes of peripheral attention, t(10)=3.6, p=.005, d=1.1. Additionally, there were linear relationships between change magnitude and rTMS dose for simple task target-related, r(20)=.45, p=.04, and peripheral noise-related, r(20)=.54, p=.009, P300s. CONCLUSIONS rTMS improved fluid reasoning abilities and also changed how dynamic attention is deployed during high-demand challenges as a potential mediator of fluid cognition improvements. While linear dose-response relationships support that changes were rTMS-elicited, absence of a response curve asymptote also suggests that still-higher doses could be warranted to achieve maximal effects in non-clinical samples.

">Secondary nucleation of α-Synuclein drives Mitochondria dysfunctions and Lewy body formation in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                The seeding of -Synuclein (Syn) is a key driver of Lewy pathology propagation in Parkinson's disease (PD) and forms the basis for recent diagnostic advances. However, it remains unclear how the structural and biochemical features of Syn seeds dictate their propagation efficiency, capacity to induce Lewy body formation, and resulting cellular toxicity. Using genetic and idiopathic PD cell models, we map the pathogenic cascade beginning with the seed-driven conversion of endogenous Syn, followed by impaired degradation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately Lewy body formation. By coupling kinetic modelling of aggregation with functional readouts, we identify secondary nucleation as the predominant mechanism generating toxic Syn aggregation intermediates, identifying the critical process that links seeding to pathology. Extending this framework to PD brain, we quantitatively correlate seeding capacity with the spatiotemporal spread and severity of Lewy pathology, revealing a mechanistic connection between Syn aggregation dynamics and disease progression at molecular, cellular, and anatomical levels. By unifying molecular mechanism with clinicopathological progression, our work identifies catalytic Syn fibrillar seeds as tractable targets for both disease-modifying therapy and biomarker development in PD.

">Bodily Self in Macaque Monkeys and Human Infants</a></h4>

              
                Whether monkeys possess the concept of bodily self remains controversial. We found that macaque monkeys trained for mirror self-recognition (MSR) could spontaneously recognize themselves when viewing video images of their back from a third-person perspective (3PP), but this generalization required a few minutes of "exploration". In contrast, through visual-tactile synchronization training similar to that used in human out-of-body studies, naive monkeys could recognize themselves from 3PP back images and demonstrated MSR within seconds. Interestingly, in human infants, we found that 3PP back self-recognition developed spontaneously several months after MSR. These results demonstrate the existence of hierarchical bodily self in macaques and similar stepwise development of bodily self in human infants, offering insights into the emergence and manifestation of bodily self in natural and artificial intelligence.

">Optimizing and assessing multichannel TMS focality</a></h4>

              
                Background: Multichannel transcranial magnetic stimulation (mTMS) enables electronic steering of induced electric fields across multiple cortical targets without physical coil repositioning, addressing key limitations of conventional single-channel TMS (sTMS). However, determining optimal input currents for focal stimulation remains challenging, and different mTMS systems have not been systematically compared under realistic hardware constraints. Objective: To develop an user-centric framework for optimizing and assessing mTMS focality by introducing a generic optimization algorithm, establishing meaningful focality metrics, and comparing mTMS coil arrays with traditional single-channel TMS across cortical targets. Methods: We developed a fast optimization framework incorporating target E-field constraints via parametrization of degenerated hyperellipsoids, explicitly integrating current-rate limits, for example from stimulator electronics and coil heating. Using high-resolution finite-element models of nine individual brains, we compared two mTMS designs (5-channel planar and 6/12-channel spherical systems) with standard sTMS figure-of-eight coils. Three complementary metrics quantified performance: Focality, Target2Max, and OverstimulatedArea. Results: Despite using a single optimized placement for all region-of-interest targets, mTMS achieved focality comparable to repositioned single-channel TMS. For superficial targets, single-channel TMS showed slightly better focality, but for deeper cortical targets (>25mm skin-cortex distance), mTMS performed similarly. More stimulation channels improved focality but required stronger current-rate constraints. The planar design performed better for deeper targets, while spherical designs improved with additional channels. Conclusion: mTMS systems demonstrate remarkable performance comparable to standard TMS, enabling efficient multi-target stimulation without repositioning. Our open-source framework provides practical tools for designing and evaluating mTMS systems, supporting goal-directed mTMS development and effective application.

">Multisensory attenuation of the pupil light response in autistic and non-autistic children</a></h4>

              
                Autonomic responses to sensory stimuli are altered in autism, yet little is known about how multisensory input modulates these responses. This study examined whether auditory stimuli affect the pupil light reflex (PLR), a parasympathetically driven response to light, in autistic and non-autistic children. Pupillometry was used to measure responses to visual-only (V), auditory-only (A), and audiovisual (AV) stimuli in 72 children aged 6-14 years (34 non-autistic, 38 autistic). We hypothesized that auditory input would attenuate pupil constriction in non-autistic children and that this cross-modal modulation might differ in autism, reflecting altered sensory-autonomic functioning. Across groups, results revealed a consistent pattern: auditory stimuli elicited pupil dilation, visual stimuli evoked constriction, and simultaneous audiovisual stimuli led to attenuated constriction relative to visual-only trials. This attenuation lends support to prior findings of multisensory attenuation of the PLR. Time-binned analysis revealed a group effect during the 500-1000 ms post-stimulus window: autistic children showed significantly more positive baseline-corrected pupil responses across conditions (i.e., less constriction in V/AV and greater dilation in A), suggesting group differences in the dynamic trajectory of the pupil response. Contrary to expectations, autistic and non-autistic children did not differ significantly on peak constriction or constriction latency within visual conditions. Findings support the presence of cross-modal modulation of the PLR in both autistic and non-autistic children and suggest that auditory signals influence early-stage visual-autonomic processing similarly across groups. Pupillometry may provide a promising, noninvasive tool for probing sensory-autonomic interactions in autism. Future studies with paradigms optimized for pupil measurement may reveal more nuanced group differences and clarify links to real-world sensory challenges.

">Vascular-Perfusable Human 3D Brain-on-Chip</a></h4>

              
                Development and delivery of treatments for neurological diseases are limited by the tight and selective human blood-brain barrier (BBB). Although animal models have been important research and preclinical tools, the rodent BBB exhibits species differences and fails to capture the complexity of human genetics. Microphysiological systems incorporating human-derived cells hold great potential for modeling disease and therapeutic development, with advantages in screening throughput, real-time monitoring, and tunable genetic backgrounds when combined with induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology. Existing 3D BBB-on-chip systems have incorporated iPSC-derived endothelial cells but not the other major brain cell types from iPSCs, each of which contributes to brain physiology and disease. Here we developed a 3D Brain-Chip system incorporating endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, neurons, microglia, and oligodendroglia from iPSCs. To enable this multicellular 3D co-culture in-chip, we designed a GelChip microfluidic platform using a 3D printing-based approach and dextran-based engineered hydrogel. Leveraging this platform, we co-cultured and characterized iPSC-derived brain-on-chips and modeled the brain microvasculature of APOE4, the strongest known genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimers disease. These 3D brain-on-chips provide a versatile system to assess BBB vascular morphology and function, investigate downstream neurological effects in disease, and screen therapeutics to optimize delivery to the brain.

                <p>Understanding how neural circuits integrate sensory and state information to support context-dependent behavior is a central challenge in neuroscience. Oviposition is a complex process during which a fruit fly integrates context and sensory information to choose an optimal location to lay her eggs. The circuit that controls oviposition is known, but how the oviposition circuit integrates multiple sensory modalities and internal states is not. Using the Hemibrain connectome, we identified the oviposition inhibitory neuron (oviIN) as a key hub in the oviposition circuit and analyzed its inputs to uncover potential parallel pathways that may be responsible for computations related to sensory integration and decision-making. We applied a network analysis to the subconnectome of inputs to the oviIN to identify clusters of interconnected neurons&mdash;many of which are uncharacterized cell types. Our findings indicate that the inputs to oviIN form multiple parallel pathways through the unstructured neuropils of the superior protocerebrum, a region implicated in context-dependent processing.</p>

     alt="Cellular Composition of the Brain of a Northern Minke Whale"/>
<p>Avelino-de-Souza et al. show that the minke whale has 3.2 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex, as predicted for a generic cetartiodactyl species, which places it and other cetaceans between monkeys and great apes in a ranking of mammal and bird species by total numbers of neurons in the pallium/cerebral cortex. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The largest mammalian brains belong to cetacean species among the cetartiodactyls. Stereological analyses have estimated cetacean numbers of cerebral cortical neurons to be more than the average 16 billion of humans, yet isotropic fractionator estimates in artiodactyls predict that even the largest cetacean brains should have no more than a few billion cortical neurons. Here, we used the isotropic fractionator to investigate these contrasting estimates of neuronal numbers by determining the numbers of neurons and non-neuronal cells forming the brain of a northern minke whale, previously estimated using stereology as containing 12.8 billion cortical neurons (Eriksen and Pakkenberg 2007), and comparing it to our dataset of several dozen mammalian species analyzed with the same method. We report that, with 3.2 billion neurons, the minke whale cerebral cortex conforms to the quantitative scaling rules that apply to other mammals, especially the closely related artiodactyls. The same brain contained a total of 57.4 billion neurons, of which 54.2 billion were cerebellar neurons, matching the expected numbers of a hypothetical artiodactyl brain of similar cerebellar mass. In addition, we found that the northern minke whale brain, with a mass of 2683.9 g, contained 173.4 billion non-neuronal cells, following the universal scaling rules that apply to the brain in all therian mammals examined to date. Thus, how non-neuronal cells are added to the mammalian brain is conserved across therian mammals and is not affected by the transition to an obligatory aquatic life history. Strikingly, we find that the minke whale is an outlier amongst mammals in having almost 18 cerebellar neurons for every neuron in the cerebral cortex, compared to the average ratio of 4, which might be related to infrasonic communication. In addition, with only approximately 88 million neurons, the remainder of the brain (brainstem/diencephalon/subcortical telencephalon) of the northern minke whale exhibited the lowest relative neuronal density of these regions reported in mammalian brains, which might be related to the absence of limbs compared to all other mammalian species. Our results indicate that the number of neurons in cetacean brains has been grossly overestimated by stereological accounts, and place whale brains on par with highly cognitively capable macaws, macaques, baboons, and elephants, but below great apes and humans, in terms of numbers of cortical neurons.</p>

                Introduction NeuroAiD, also known as MLC601 or MLC901, is a Chinese herbal combination used worldwide for stroke treatment. It contains herbal components and five hewan components. MLC601 contains herbal components and hewan components, while MLC901 has a similar herbal composition. NeuroAiD is used to support neurologic recovery after stroke and to aid cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease. Studies show that NeuroAiD has potential in treating Alzheimer’s disease and is beneficial in both local and global stroke models and in the Kortikal culture. However, there is limited bibliometric research on NeuroAiD, which is a method of collecting data from published articles to analyze developments and trends in the field of research. This research contributes significantly to the literature and helps develop more effective stroke treatment strategies. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords neuroaid. Data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis Results The research trend found are documents by year, most relevant sources, factorial map of the most cited documents, factorial map of The documents with the highest contributes, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by subject area, documents by affiliation, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, topic dendogram, and world cloud. Conclusions The study investigates the potential of Neuroaid, a neuroprotective drug, for stroke prevention and cognitive function enhancement. It uses terms like “cognition” and “neurogenesis” to highlight its potential. While the study’s focus may be limited, it provides valuable insights into research direction and potential areas of neuroaid for stroke treatment.

                Background Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is a clinically aggressive disease requiring intensive treatment. The two principal curative approaches are radical cystectomy (RC) and bladder preservation therapy, most commonly trimodal therapy (TMT), which combines maximal transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) with concurrent chemoradiation. While both strategies have demonstrated comparable oncologic outcomes in select patient populations, their impact on health-related quality of life (QoL) remains a crucial differentiator—particularly in real-world, resource-constrained settings where cultural and logistical considerations shape patient preferences and treatment access. Objectives The QUEST (Quality of life and Evaluation of Survival in Treatment of bladder cancer) study aims to evaluate and compare QoL outcomes and survival metrics in MIBC patients undergoing either RC or bladder preservation. It seeks to generate institution-specific data using validated patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), thereby supporting individualized, evidence-informed decision-making. Methods This prospective, single-center, observational cohort study will enroll 94 patients with non-metastatic MIBC (cT2–T4aN0M0) who are eligible for either treatment approach. Participants will self-select their treatment modality following multidisciplinary counselling. QoL will be assessed longitudinally using the Bladder Cancer Index (BCI) and EORTC QLQ-C30 at baseline and multiple post-treatment intervals. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and correlation of PROM scores with survival. Stratification and statistical adjustments will address inherent selection bias. Discussion The QUEST study will provide critical insights into the lived experiences and clinical outcomes of MIBC patients in eastern India. By integrating PROMs into routine oncologic evaluation, it will help bridge the gap between survival-centric and patient-centric care models. The findings are expected to inform future guidelines, promote shared decision-making, and enhance long-term care strategies for bladder cancer in similar healthcare settings.

                This study evaluated the performance of the sub-base material of High Court Road, Kabale, Uganda, using the California Bearing Ratio and Triaxial Compression Tests. Optimizing sub-base material selection is expected to enhance road longevity, minimize maintenance costs, and ensure sustainable, value-for-money construction, ultimately improving infrastructure reliability and reducing long-term performance. Field samples were collected at one-meter depth and tested for California Bearing Ratio and shear strength parameters of cohesion, angle of internal friction, and stress-strain behavior of the soil under varying axial loads, to evaluate the overall suitability under estimated loading conditions. Laboratory tests indicate that the sub-base consists predominantly of fine-grained soil, classified as high-plasticity clay based on the Unified Soil Classification System. Compaction results show maximum dry densities between 16.05 kN/m3 and 18.03 kN/m3, with Optimum Moisture Content between 18.9% and 23.3%. Shear strength parameters indicate cohesion values ranging from 67.5 kPa to 95.2 kPa, which fall below the recommended minimum of 100 kPa for stable sub-base performance. The angle of internal friction ranges from 9.00° to 19.71°, lower than the 26°–29° range typically required for stability and high bearing capacity. The CBR values range from 2% to 13%, significantly below the recommended minimum of 30% for sub-base layers. This confirms that the current sub-base material has poor load-bearing capacity and is unsuitable for supporting expected traffic loads. To support the anticipated traffic load, the study recommends construction using a 450 mm thick sub-base material embedded in the 950 mm thick pavement, attaining a minimum of 98% compaction, stabilization using lime/cement, and reinforcement of the sub-base with geosynthetics. An alternative pavement design comprising a 225 mm sub-base, in a 725 mm thick pavement, is also recommended, particularly in instances where granular material and crushed stones are more readily available

                The cardiac Purkinje network plays a vital role in the heart’s electrical conduction system, ensuring efficient and synchronized ventricular contraction. When impaired—particularly by ischemia—it can trigger life-threatening arrhythmias. In this study, we present an advanced computational model of the Purkinje network that integrates cell-level heterogeneity, spatial organization, and localized ischemic zones with customizable severity gradients. Developed in Python using open-source libraries (NumPy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn), the model generates rich visualizations of network structure, conduction velocities, ischemia severity, and electrophysiological parameters. Simulations demonstrate how ischemia alters conduction and refractoriness in a spatially dependent manner, providing insights into arrhythmogenic risk. This modeling framework can advance understanding of cardiac conduction under pathological conditions and support therapeutic development.

                Background Behavioral expression rarely depends on a single determinant; it emerges from the convergence of neural, hormonal, and contextual factors. The lordosis reflex in female rats is a well-studied model requiring hypothalamic circuits, ovarian hormones, and somatosensory input, yet these findings have been framed qualitatively without a formal law specifying how the factors combine. Methods I propose a candidate law of convergence, formalized by the ARCH × Φ framework, in which behavior is modeled as a multiplicative product of Archetype (A: neural substrate), Drive (D: hormonal priming), Context (C: tactile stimulation), and a modulatory threshold field (Φ: arousal, neuromodulation, stress). Drawing on decades of lesion, hormone, and tactile manipulation studies, I evaluate three necessity tests of lordosis: loss of the ventromedial hypothalamus (A), ovariectomy without estradiol–progesterone replacement (D), and removal of flank stimulation (C). Results Across these tests, lordosis fails when any single factor is absent, even when the others are intact. This supports conjunctive necessity rather than additive sufficiency. Incorporating Φ explains modulatory influences such as dopamine, serotonin, stress, and development, which shift the threshold for expression. Conclusions This synthesis reframes lordosis as a model system for testing a general principle of conjunctive behavioral control. The proposed law of convergence generates falsifiable predictions, integrates disparate findings across neuroendocrinology and ethology, and may extend to other motivated behaviors, including aggression, caregiving, and social bonding. By moving from description to quantitative formulation, the ARCH × Φ framework advances toward a predictive field theory of behavior.

Simulating within-host virus sequence evolution allows for the investigation of factors such as the role of recombination in virus diversification and the impact of selective pressures on virus evolution. Here, we provide a new software to simulate virus within-host evolution called wavess (within-host adaptive virus evolution sequence simulator), a discrete-time individual-based model and a corresponding user-friendly R package. The underlying model simulates recombination, a latent infected cell reservoir, and three forms of selection: conserved sites fitness and replicative fitness in comparison to a reference sequence, and immune fitness including cross-reactivity imposed by a co-evolving immune response. In the R package, we also provide functions to generate model inputs from empirical data, as well as functions to analyze the simulation outputs. At user-defined time points, the software returns various counts related to the virus population(s) and a set of sampled virus sequences. We applied this model to investigate the selection pressures on HIV-1 <i>env</i> sequences longitudinally collected from 11 individuals. The best-fitting immune cost differed across individuals, mirroring the real-world expectation of heterogeneous immune responses among human hosts. Furthermore, the phylogenies reconstructed from these simulated sequences were similar to the phylogenies reconstructed from the real sequences for all summary statistics tested. To our knowledge, compared to other similar models, wavess has been more rigorously validated against real within-host virus sequences, and is the first to be implemented as an R package. The wavess R package can be downloaded from https://github.com/MolEvolEpid/wavess.

                <p>by Israël Tankam Chedjou, Ruairí Donnelly, Christopher A. Gilligan</p>

Cassava viral diseases, including Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) and Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), pose significant threats to global food security, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This study explores the potential of varietal mixtures as a sustainable disease management strategy by introducing CropMix, a novel web-based application. The application encodes a flexible insect-borne plant pathogen transmission model to predict and optimize yields under scenarios of varietal mixtures. For instance, we use the application to evaluate the ability of virus-resistant cassava varieties (which may have lower yields in the absence of disease) to protect more susceptible varieties against CMD and CBSD, and we also consider mixtures involving tolerant varieties and non-host crops. For CMD, the high transmission rates of cassava mosaic virus (genus <i>Begomovirus</i>) limits the efficacy of mixtures, with susceptible monocultures emerging as more productive than susceptible-resistant mixtures whatever the whitefly pressure. In contrast, for CBSD, varietal mixtures demonstrate substantial benefits, with resistant varieties shielding susceptible ones and mitigating severe yield losses under moderate or high insect pressure. Management strategies involving non-host crops and complementary control measures, such as roguing, can further enhance outcomes. The model’s simplicity and adaptability make it suitable for tailoring recommendations to diverse insect-borne crop viral diseases and agroecological contexts. The study emphasizes the need for integrating real-world data and participatory frameworks to refine and implement disease management strategies. We discuss the critical balance between agronomic potential and farmer acceptability, underscoring the importance of collaborative efforts to ensure sustainable cassava production.

Macrophages require rapid and tightly controlled regulatory mechanisms to respond to environmental disruptions. While transcriptional regulation has been well characterized, the mechanisms underlying translational control in macrophages remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the dynamics of mRNA translation in mouse macrophages during acute, intermediate, and prolonged LPS exposure. Our results reveal clear phase-specific translational regulation during macrophage polarization, which initially increases the synthesis of inflammatory mediators and cytokines, while simultaneously suppressing the expression of cell cycle-related genes. Mechanistically, we observed pervasive upstream translation in the 5′ UTRs of cell cycle-related mRNAs, which contributes to cell cycle arrest during the early phase of inflammatory response. Notably, we identified a unique codon preference toward A/U in the third position of codons in macrophages, which contrasts with the G/C preference commonly observed in other tissues. AU codon preference increases the stability and translation efficiency of cell cycle-related mRNAs, promoting cell cycle restoration after extended LPS exposure. These findings reveal that uORF translation and codon usage bias are critical components of translational regulation during macrophage polarization, highlighting a potential therapeutic intervention for modulating immune activation via macrophage-specific codon optimization.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003378">Humans have a longer period of cortical maturation across depth and hierarchy than macaques</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Monami Nishio, Xingyu Liu, Allyson P. Mackey, Michael J. Arcaro</p>

Postnatal brain development in primates involves prolonged structural maturation of the cortex, laying the foundation for advanced perceptual and cognitive functions. In humans, cortical development is thought to progress along a hierarchical gradient from early-maturing sensorimotor regions to later-developing association areas. However, developmental changes across cortical depth, which contribute to both local computation and large-scale network integration, have been largely unexplored. It also remains unclear which features of these maturational trajectories are conserved across primates and how they may have been further extended or modified in humans. Using the T1-weighted/T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) MRI ratio as a noninvasive measure of cortical microarchitecture, we systematically compared depth-dependent and regional developmental trajectories in humans and macaques. We identified a conserved “inside-out” gradient of maturation, with deeper cortical depths exhibiting steeper increases in T1w/T2w ratio and earlier plateaus than superficial depths. This depth-dependent pattern was embedded within a broader hierarchical gradient of maturation across the cortical surface, extending from sensorimotor regions to association cortex. While the spatial structure of these gradients was shared across species, humans exhibited markedly prolonged development across the entire cortical hierarchy, including both sensory and association cortices, and across cortical depths. These findings suggest that conserved developmental gradients are elaborated in humans to support an extended window of postnatal plasticity, enabling the experience-dependent refinement of cortical circuits that underlie the complex, integrative functions central to human perception and cognition.

Scientific communities need to understand and eliminate barriers that prevent people with diverse backgrounds from contributing to and participating in science. However, the combined impact of individuals’ linguistic, economic, and gender backgrounds on their scientific productivity is poorly understood. Using a survey of 908 environmental scientists, we show that being a woman is associated with up to a 45% reduction in the number of English-language publications, compared to men. Being a woman, a non-native English speaker, and from a low-income country is associated with up to a 70% reduction, compared to male native English speakers from a high-income country. The linguistic and economic productivity gap narrows when based on the total number of English- and non-English-language publications. We call for an explicit effort to consider linguistic, economic, and gender backgrounds and incorporate non-English-language publications when assessing the performance and contribution of scientists.

                Background Ovarian tumors remain one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies due to delayed diagnosis. Differentiating benign from malignant adnexal masses is crucial to guide clinical management. While ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality, its limitations in certain indeterminate cases justify the use of MRI, particularly through the O-RADS classification (Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System). However, challenges remain in interpreting solid components and enhancement curves. Methods This retrospective study included 89 patients with 116 adnexal masses deemed indeterminate on ultrasound. All patients underwent pelvic MRI using a standardized protocol, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and ADC mapping. Adnexal masses were classified according to O-RADS, and ADC values were used to refine classifications between categories 3–4 and 4–5. Final diagnoses were confirmed by histopathological analysis after surgical resection. Results Integration of ADC values improved diagnostic accuracy. Six masses initially classified as O-RADS 3 were upgraded to O-RADS 4 based on ADC cut-offs, and 18 O-RADS 4 masses were reclassified as O-RADS 5. Additionally, eight lesions initially classified as O-RADS 4 were reclassified to O-RADS 3. The integrated O-RADS/ADC strategy demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance, with sensitivity reaching 100%, specificity of 95.1%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 97.4%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%. The diagnostic accuracy, calculated using Youden’s index, was 0.95. Furthermore, the use of non-contrast-enhanced MRI sequences (T2-weighted imaging, DWI, and ADC mapping) alone also provided robust diagnostic performance, achieving a sensitivity of 98.67% and a specificity of 90.48%. Conclusions: Incorporating ADC values into the O-RADS classification enhances the diagnostic performance of MRI in evaluating adnexal masses. This refined approach enables more accurate stratification of malignancy risk, improves clinical decision-making, and may help avoid unnecessary surgery, particularly in women where fertility preservation is a concern.

                This study analyzed international research on systems thinking in science education from 2014 to 2025. Systems thinking, as it points out the links between parts of complex systems, is being seen as an important skill for managing issues such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, and sustainability. Despite its importance, genetics is introduced differently in education around the world. Using Scopus data, we study the main contributors to this field, emerging research themes, and how different institutions are teaming up, with sustainability, STEM education, and interdisciplinary learning being areas that are gaining importance. This information highlights the need for international research partnerships and support for teachers to teach systems thinking and improve students’ skills to face real-life problems. The results can help improve how policymakers, educators, and researchers introduce systems thinking into classrooms.

                Background Critical thinking is a collection of dispositions and abilities related to individuals’ analytical, creative, and practical cognitive and decision-making skills. The development of optimal critical thinking skills better prepares students for college and their careers. The measurement of critical thinking actual abilities like inquisitiveness, open-mindedness, or systemic thinking among college students is limited. Similarly, the assessment of all types of critical thinking like creative or practical from the perspectives of students is meager. Methods This research utilizes original data collected from 803 college students between 2020 and 2021 after securing institutional review approval for the research. Self-reported data on 30 items instrument measuring students’ ratings of their analytical, creative, and practical thinking is used. Descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, and correlation analysis all were used to estimate the prevalence of critical thinking, and whether gender or language influence it or not. Results Results indicate that undergraduate students rated their abilities in critical thinking is very high. On all three types of critical thinking (analytical thinking, creative thinking, practical thinking), students scored between 117 and 123 on a 30-150 scale, indicating a high score. Additionally, gender and language have little to no influence over critical thinking scores. Further, analytical, creative, and practical thinking are independent from each other evident in the low correlations among all three elements. The results suggest the emergence of the Dunning-Kruger effect concerning students’ critical thinking assessment. Conclusions There is a colossal gap between students- self-reported ratings and their actual performance on critical thinking instruments. More rigorous assessments of dispositions and abilities are needed utilizing existing validated instruments in literature.

                Epilepsy affects approximately 70 million people globally, with nearly 80% living in low- and middle-income countries. From 1990 to 2021, childhood idiopathic epilepsy cases increased by 26.34%. Despite treatment advancements, stigma, fear, and misconceptions, especially in schools, hinder the inclusion of learners with epilepsy. School-based educational interventions have emerged as a vital strategy to raise awareness and reduce stigma. This scoping review aims to identify and map the types of epilepsy-related curricula in primary and secondary schools and special education settings worldwide, evaluating their effectiveness. Using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology, a comprehensive search strategy will be implemented across electronic databases and grey literature sources. Eligible studies will include various research designs focusing on educational interventions for learners, educators, or school communities. Study selection and data extraction will be performed independently by two reviewers, with a third reviewer resolving any disagreements. The findings will be synthesized through thematic analysis. The review is expected to reveal significant variation in the design and evaluation of epilepsy curricula, with many lacking standardized implementations. It aims to inform the development of relevant and scalable education strategies, ultimately supporting inclusive, equitable, and stigma-free learning environments for students with epilepsy.

                The study explores the factors that influence entrepreneurial intention and action among university students in five Latin American countries, integrating correlation analyses, multiple regressions, and visualizations through Raincloud Plots. Although numerous emotional, cognitive, and contextual profile variables were measured, this report presents only those that showed significant differences between countries or were identified as relevant predictors of entrepreneurial intention and action. Key variables such as entrepreneurial attitude, self-efficacy, entrepreneurial action in its discovery phase, university training, and empathy were identified as significant predictors of entrepreneurial intention. Self-awareness, self-efficacy, and entrepreneurial attitude explained the discovery phase. In contrast, financial knowledge, emotional well-being, flow at work, self-efficacy, and low cognitive load were determinants in the exploitation phase. The findings highlight the need for an adaptive curriculum that incorporates emotional competencies, training pathways differentiated by entrepreneurial stage, and support strategies that include mentoring, early diagnosis, and well-being management.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Sensitive behavioral measures are needed for clinical trials in ataxias and other neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesized that quantitative analysis of eye movements during a natural multi-component task (passage reading) could produce a measure capable of capturing subclinical signs and disease progression.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Binocular gaze sampled at 1000 hertz (Hz) was collected from 102 individuals with ataxia (including 36 spinocerebellar ataxias, 12 Friedreich's ataxia, and 5 multiple system atrophy) and 70 healthy controls. Longitudinal data were available for 26 participants with ataxia in the ongoing Neurobooth natural history study. The Reading Eye Abnormality Digital (READ) score was developed by training a regression model to aggregate saccade and fixation kinematics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Mean displacement of fixations, the number and frequency of saccades, and the proportion of regressive saccades were related to oculomotor dysfunction, speech dysfunction, and overall ataxia severity. The READ score was reliable (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.96, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and correlated with Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS) total score (<i>r</i> = 0.82, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), oculomotor (<i>r</i> = 0.52, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and speech (<i>r</i> = 0.73, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) subscores, and patient reports of function including patient-reported outcome measures (PROM)-Ataxia (<i>r</i> = 0.51, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and the Dysarthria Impact Scale (DIS; <i>r</i> = 0.53, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The READ score detected subclinical oculomotor (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.69, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and speech signs (AUC = 0.72, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and disease progression (<i>d</i> = 0.36, <i>p</i> = 0.03). The BARS total did not reach statistical significance in capturing progression between study visits in this cohort (<i>d</i> = 0.27, <i>p</i> = 0.08).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Digital measures of eye movements are a promising approach for sensitively measuring ataxia in clinical trials (including early-stage disease) and may have utility in other neurodegenerative diseases affecting speech or ocular control. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<p>Recapitulative schema of different exploratory levels of the evolutionary impact on human neurological diseases.
</p>
<br/>
<p>Clinical neuroscience focuses on the mechanisms of brain function, but this approach falls short of insights into how the central nervous system (CNS) evolved, both in health and disease. Here, we discuss evolutionary concepts relevant to understanding human brain diseases, on the genetic, subcellular, cellular, connectomic, behavioral, and cultural levels. By revisiting common neurological diseases, we discuss evolved residues from our ancestors, mechanisms of exaptation, antagonistic pleiotropy, and human longevity with the consequent outpacing of biological evolution by cultural evolution. An evolution-based conceptual framework can propel transdisciplinary research targeting the constraints imposed by and compensatory adaptations involved in human-specific neurological diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-934/v1?src=rss">Eye health promotion in multi-sectoral settings: A systematic review of intervention types and effectiveness [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Multi-sectoral settings such as hospitals, health care centres, clinics, schools, workplaces, community events, and online platforms play an important role in reaching individuals from various socioeconomic backgrounds and delivering health promotion interventions that change behaviour and improve health outcomes. The aim of this review was to systematically review the nature and effectiveness of eye health promotion interventions implemented by eye health professionals across various multi-sectoral settings. Method This review was conducted using the Centre for Review and Dissemination guidelines for conducting systematic reviews and reported in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 statement. A comprehensive and systematic search was conducted on electronic databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Medline, CINAHL and Academic Search Complete hosted on EBSCOHost and supplemented with a hand search for relevant studies published between 1999 and 2024. Two independent reviewers screened eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed study quality using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) 2018. The eligibility criterion was met by 80 studies out of 15 554 screened. Results Eye health promotion interventions identified among studies were categorised as health education, health counselling, vision screening, eye screening and training programmes, health prevention, health promotion, health policy, ophthalmic intervention programmes, comprehensive eye examination and screening for diabetic retinopathy. Most studies showed a significant impact of eye health promotion interventions. Conclusion Overall, studies demonstrated a diverse range of strategies that have shown significant effectiveness across various settings. This systematic review highlights the effectiveness of eye health promotion interventions, whilst identifying gaps in compliance, follow-up systems, and policy integration. Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42022354299.

                Mapping mammalian neural circuits is limited by inefficient labeling and signal loss with depth. Zhong et al. develop LINCS, a chemical labeling toolkit for rapid, ultrabright neural visualization. This accessible pipeline provides robust and uniform connectivity analysis, from single neurons in cleared brains to circuits spanning the entire mouse body.

                Hyslop et al. identify CD7 as a tissue-specific receptor essential for maintaining terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells during chronic infection. CD7 is highly expressed on a CD101+Tim3low liver-resident subset, supports persistence via regulation of apoptosis, and is similarly upregulated on PD-1+CD39+ TILs in human head and neck cancer.

                Rossi-Smith et al. investigated how the amino acid taurine modulates inflammation. They show that NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggers taurine loss from macrophages, disrupting cellular ion balance and amplifying inflammation. Blocking taurine export restores balance, revealing a potential therapeutic target for hyperinflammatory diseases.

Using ex vivo calcium imaging combined with pharmacological profiling of the locus coeruleus, the authors identify a combination of projection-selective GPCR agonists. In vivo, this combination synergistically enhances antinociception by dampening the noradrenergic projection to the medial prefrontal cortex.
