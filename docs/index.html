              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04928">Evolutionary emergence of biological intelligence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.04928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterising the intelligence of biological organisms is challenging. This work considers intelligent algorithms developed evolutionarily within neural systems. Mathematical analyses unveil a natural equivalence between canonical neural networks, variational Bayesian inference under a class of partially observable Markov decision processes, and differentiable Turing machines, by showing that they minimise the shared Helmholtz energy. Consequently, canonical neural networks can biologically plausibly equip Turing machines and conduct variational Bayesian inferences of external Turing machines in the environment. Applying Helmholtz energy minimisation at the species level facilitates deriving active Bayesian model selection inherent in natural selection, resulting in the emergence of adaptive algorithms. In particular, canonical neural networks with two mental actions can separately learn transition mappings of multiple Turing machines. These propositions were corroborated by numerical simulations of algorithm implementation and neural network evolution. These notions offer a universal characterisation of biological intelligence emerging from evolution in terms of Bayesian model selection and belief updating.

                arXiv:2409.05386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we review a class of neuro-mimetic computational models that we place under the label of spiking predictive coding. Specifically, we review the general framework of predictive processing in the context of neurons that emit discrete action potentials, i.e., spikes. Theoretically, we structure our survey around how prediction errors are represented, which results in an organization of historical neuromorphic generalizations that is centered around three broad classes of approaches: prediction errors in explicit groups of error neurons, in membrane potentials, and implicit prediction error encoding. Furthermore, we examine some applications of spiking predictive coding that utilize more energy-efficient, edge-computing hardware platforms. Finally, we highlight important future directions and challenges in this emerging line of inquiry in brain-inspired computing. Building on the prior results of work in computational cognitive neuroscience, machine intelligence, and neuromorphic engineering, we hope that this review of neuromorphic formulations and implementations of predictive coding will encourage and guide future research and development in this emerging research area.

                arXiv:2409.04946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse connectivity is a hallmark of the brain and a desired property of artificial neural networks. It promotes energy efficiency, simplifies training, and enhances the robustness of network function. Thus, a detailed understanding of how to achieve sparsity without jeopardizing network performance is beneficial for neuroscience, deep learning, and neuromorphic computing applications. We used an exactly solvable model of associative learning to evaluate the effects of various sparsity-inducing constraints on connectivity and function. We determine the optimal level of sparsity achieved by the $l_0$ norm constraint and find that nearly the same efficiency can be obtained by eliminating weak connections. We show that this method of achieving sparsity can be implemented online, making it compatible with neuroscience and machine learning applications.

                arXiv:2403.00033v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The excessive consumption of marijuana can induce substantial psychological and social consequences. In this investigation, we propose an elucidative framework termed high-order graph attention neural networks (HOGANN) for the classification of Marijuana addiction, coupled with an analysis of localized brain network communities exhibiting abnormal activities among chronic marijuana users. HOGANN integrates dynamic intrinsic functional brain networks, estimated from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), using graph attention-based long short-term memory (GAT-LSTM) to capture temporal network dynamics. We employ a high-order attention module for information fusion and message passing among neighboring nodes, enhancing the network community analysis. Our model is validated across two distinct data cohorts, yielding substantially higher classification accuracy than benchmark algorithms. Furthermore, we discern the most pertinent subnetworks and cognitive regions affected by persistent marijuana consumption, indicating adverse effects on functional brain networks, particularly within the dorsal attention and frontoparietal networks. Intriguingly, our model demonstrates superior performance in cohorts exhibiting prolonged dependence, implying that prolonged marijuana usage induces more pronounced alterations in brain networks. The model proficiently identifies craving brain maps, thereby delineating critical brain regions for analysis

                arXiv:2408.16570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the linguistic problem of the sequential arrangement of a head and its dependents from an information theoretic perspective. In particular, we consider the optimal placement of a head that maximizes the predictability of the sequence. We assume that dependents are statistically independent given a head, in line with the open-choice principle and the core assumptions of dependency grammar. We demonstrate the optimality of harmonic order, i.e., placing the head last maximizes the predictability of the head whereas placing the head first maximizes the predictability of dependents. We also show that postponing the head is the optimal strategy to maximize its predictability while bringing it forward is the optimal strategy to maximize the predictability of dependents. We unravel the advantages of the strategy of maximizing the predictability of the head over maximizing the predictability of dependents. Our findings shed light on the placements of the head adopted by real languages or emerging in different kinds of experiments.

                arXiv:2409.04478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A popular new method in mechanistic interpretability is to train high-dimensional sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on neuron activations and use SAE features as the atomic units of analysis. However, the body of evidence on whether SAE feature spaces are useful for causal analysis is underdeveloped. In this work, we use the RAVEL benchmark to evaluate whether SAEs trained on hidden representations of GPT-2 small have sets of features that separately mediate knowledge of which country a city is in and which continent it is in. We evaluate four open-source SAEs for GPT-2 small against each other, with neurons serving as a baseline, and linear features learned via distributed alignment search (DAS) serving as a skyline. For each, we learn a binary mask to select features that will be patched to change the country of a city without changing the continent, or vice versa. Our results show that SAEs struggle to reach the neuron baseline, and none come close to the DAS skyline. We release code here: https://github.com/MaheepChaudhary/SAE-Ravel

                arXiv:2409.05778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trading and investing in stocks for some is their full-time career, while for others, it's simply a supplementary income stream. Universal among all investors is the desire to turn a profit. The key to achieving this goal is diversification. Spreading investments across sectors is critical to profitability and maximizing returns. This study aims to gauge the viability of machine learning methods in practicing the principle of diversification to maximize portfolio returns. To test this, the study evaluates the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model across nine different sectors and over 2,200 stocks using Vanguard's sector-based ETFs. The R-squared value across all sectors showed promising results, with an average of 0.8651 and a high of 0.942 for the VNQ ETF. These findings suggest that the LSTM model is a capable and viable model for accurately predicting directional changes across various industry sectors, helping investors diversify and grow their portfolios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have sparked considerable interest in the integration of these two cutting-edge fields. Among the various ML techniques, reinforcement learning (RL) stands out for its ability to address complex sequential decision-making problems. RL has already demonstrated substantial success in the classical ML community. Now, the emerging field of Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) seeks to enhance RL algorithms by incorporating principles from quantum computing. This paper offers an introduction to this exciting area for the broader AI and ML community.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08896">Migrant Resettlement by Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2310.08896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Migration has been a universal phenomenon, which brings opportunities as well as challenges for global development. As the number of migrants (e.g., refugees) increases rapidly in recent years, a key challenge faced by each country is the problem of migrant resettlement. This problem has attracted scientific research attention, from the perspective of maximizing the employment rate. Previous works mainly formulated migrant resettlement as an approximately submodular optimization problem subject to multiple matroid constraints and employed the greedy algorithm, whose performance, however, may be limited due to its greedy nature. In this paper, we propose a new framework MR-EMO based on Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization, which reformulates Migrant Resettlement as a bi-objective optimization problem that maximizes the expected number of employed migrants and minimizes the number of dispatched migrants simultaneously, and employs a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) to solve the bi-objective problem. We implement MR-EMO using three MOEAs, the popular NSGA-II, MOEA/D as well as the theoretically grounded GSEMO. To further improve the performance of MR-EMO, we propose a specific MOEA, called GSEMO-SR, using matrix-swap mutation and repair mechanism, which has a better ability to search for feasible solutions. We prove that MR-EMO using either GSEMO or GSEMO-SR can achieve better theoretical guarantees than the previous greedy algorithm. Experimental results under the interview and coordination migration models clearly show the superiority of MR-EMO (with either NSGA-II, MOEA/D, GSEMO or GSEMO-SR) over previous algorithms, and that using GSEMO-SR leads to the best performance of MR-EMO.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14157">Genetic Algorithms with Neural Cost Predictor for Solving Hierarchical Vehicle Routing Problems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2310.14157v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When vehicle routing decisions are intertwined with higher-level decisions, the resulting optimization problems pose significant challenges for computation. Examples are the multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP), where customers are assigned to depots before delivery, and the capacitated location routing problem (CLRP), where the locations of depots should be determined first. A simple and straightforward approach for such hierarchical problems would be to separate the higher-level decisions from the complicated vehicle routing decisions. For each higher-level decision candidate, we may evaluate the underlying vehicle routing problems to assess the candidate. As this approach requires solving vehicle routing problems multiple times, it has been regarded as impractical in most cases. We propose a novel deep-learning-based approach called Genetic Algorithm with Neural Cost Predictor (GANCP) to tackle the challenge and simplify algorithm developments. For each higher-level decision candidate, we predict the objective function values of the underlying vehicle routing problems using a pre-trained graph neural network without actually solving the routing problems. In particular, our proposed neural network learns the objective values of the HGS-CVRP open-source package that solves capacitated vehicle routing problems. Our numerical experiments show that this simplified approach is effective and efficient in generating high-quality solutions for both MDVRP and CLRP and has the potential to expedite algorithm developments for complicated hierarchical problems. We provide computational results evaluated in the standard benchmark instances used in the literature.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03725">Deep Oscillatory Neural Network</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.03725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel, brain-inspired deep neural network model known as the Deep Oscillatory Neural Network (DONN). Deep neural networks like the Recurrent Neural Networks indeed possess sequence processing capabilities but the internal states of the network are not designed to exhibit brain-like oscillatory activity. With this motivation, the DONN is designed to have oscillatory internal dynamics. Neurons of the DONN are either nonlinear neural oscillators or traditional neurons with sigmoidal or ReLU activation. The neural oscillator used in the model is the Hopf oscillator, with the dynamics described in the complex domain. Input can be presented to the neural oscillator in three possible modes. The sigmoid and ReLU neurons also use complex-valued extensions. All the weight stages are also complex-valued. Training follows the general principle of weight change by minimizing the output error and therefore has an overall resemblance to complex backpropagation. A generalization of DONN to convolutional networks known as the Oscillatory Convolutional Neural Network is also proposed. The two proposed oscillatory networks are applied to a variety of benchmark problems in signal and image/video processing. The performance of the proposed models is either comparable or superior to published results on the same data sets.

Abstract: Two simple yet powerful optimization algorithms, named the Best-Mean-Random (BMR) and Best-Worst-Random (BWR) algorithms, are developed and presented in this paper to handle both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems. These algorithms are free of metaphors and algorithm-specific parameters. The BMR algorithm is based on the best, mean, and random solutions of the population generated for solving a given problem, and the BWR algorithm is based on the best, worst, and random solutions. The performances of the proposed two algorithms are investigated by implementing them on 26 real-life nonconvex constrained optimization problems given in the Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2020 competition, and comparisons are made with those of the other prominent optimization algorithms. The performances on 12 constrained engineering problems are also investigated, and the results are compared with those of very recent algorithms (in some cases, compared with more than 30 algorithms). Furthermore, computational experiments are conducted on 30 unconstrained standard benchmark optimization problems, including 5 recently developed benchmark problems with distinct characteristics. The results demonstrated the superior competitiveness and superiority of the proposed simple algorithms. The optimization research community may gain an advantage by adapting these algorithms to solve various constrained and unconstrained real-life optimization problems across various scientific and engineering disciplines. The codes of the BMR and BWR algorithms are available at https://sites.google.com/view/bmr-bwr-optimization-algorithm/home?authuser=0.

Abstract: Recent advances in retinal neuroscience have fueled various hardware and algorithmic efforts to develop retina-inspired solutions for computer vision tasks. In this work, we focus on a fundamental visual feature within the mammalian retina, Object Motion Sensitivity (OMS). Using DVS data from EV-IMO dataset, we analyze the performance of an algorithmic implementation of OMS circuitry for motion segmentation in presence of ego-motion. This holistic analysis considers the underlying constraints arising from the hardware circuit implementation. We present novel CMOS circuits that implement OMS functionality inside image sensors, while providing run-time re-configurability for key algorithmic parameters. In-sensor technologies for dynamical environment adaptation are crucial for ensuring high system performance. Finally, we verify the functionality and re-configurability of the proposed CMOS circuit designs through Cadence simulations in 180nm technology. In summary, the presented work lays foundation for hardware-algorithm re-engineering of known biological circuits to suit application needs.

Abstract: In the present paper, I describe a spiking neural network (SNN) architecture which, can be used in wide range of supervised learning classification tasks. It is assumed, that all participating signals (the classified object description, correct class label and SNN decision) have spiking nature. The distinctive feature of this architecture is a combination of prototypical network structures corresponding to different classes and significantly distinctive instances of one class (=columns) and functionally differing populations of neurons inside columns (=layers). The other distinctive feature is a novel combination of anti-Hebbian and dopamine-modulated plasticity. The plasticity rules are local and do not use the backpropagation principle. Besides that, as in my previous studies, I was guided by the requirement that the all neuron/plasticity models should be easily implemented on modern neurochips. I illustrate the high performance of my network on a task related to model-based reinforcement learning, namely, evaluation of proximity of an external world state to the target state.

Abstract: This work investigates a practical and novel method for automated unsupervised fault detection in vehicles using a fully convolutional autoencoder. The results demonstrate the algorithm we developed can detect anomalies which correspond to powertrain faults by learning patterns in the multivariate time-series data of hybrid-electric vehicle powertrain sensors. Data was collected by engineers at Ford Motor Company from numerous sensors over several drive cycle variations. This study provides evidence of the anomaly detecting capability of our trained autoencoder and investigates the suitability of our autoencoder relative to other unsupervised methods for automatic fault detection in this data set. Preliminary results of testing the autoencoder on the powertrain sensor data indicate the data reconstruction approach availed by the autoencoder is a robust technique for identifying the abnormal sequences in the multivariate series. These results support that irregularities in hybrid-electric vehicles' powertrains are conveyed via sensor signals in the embedded electronic communication system, and therefore can be identified mechanistically with a trained algorithm. Additional unsupervised methods are tested and show the autoencoder performs better at fault detection than outlier detectors and other novel deep learning techniques.

Abstract: We show that off-the-shelf text-based Transformers, with no additional training, can perform few-shot in-context visual imitation learning, mapping visual observations to action sequences that emulate the demonstrator's behaviour. We achieve this by transforming visual observations (inputs) and trajectories of actions (outputs) into sequences of tokens that a text-pretrained Transformer (GPT-4 Turbo) can ingest and generate, via a framework we call Keypoint Action Tokens (KAT). Despite being trained only on language, we show that these Transformers excel at translating tokenised visual keypoint observations into action trajectories, performing on par or better than state-of-the-art imitation learning (diffusion policies) in the low-data regime on a suite of real-world, everyday tasks. Rather than operating in the language domain as is typical, KAT leverages text-based Transformers to operate in the vision and action domains to learn general patterns in demonstration data for highly efficient imitation learning, indicating promising new avenues for repurposing natural language models for embodied tasks.

                arXiv:2405.07541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The L\'evy walk, a type of random walk characterized by linear step lengths that follow a power-law distribution, is observed in the migratory behaviors of various organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans. Notably, L\'evy walks with power exponents close to two are frequently observed, though their underlying causes remain elusive. This study introduces a simplified, abstract random walk model designed to produce inverse square L\'evy walks, also known as Cauchy walks and explores the conditions that facilitate these phenomena. In our model, agents move toward a randomly selected destination in multi-dimensional space, and their movement strategy is parameterized by the extent to which they pursue the shortest path. When the search cost is proportional to the distance traveled, this parameter effectively reflects the emphasis on minimizing search costs. Our findings reveal that strict adherence to this cost minimization constraint results in a Brownian walk pattern. However, removing this constraint transitions the movement to an inverse square L\'evy walk. Therefore, by modulating the prioritization of search costs, our model can seamlessly alternate between Brownian and Cauchy walk dynamics. This model has the potential to be utilized for exploring the parameter space of an optimization problem.

                arXiv:2405.11657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Cascades (RNC) are the class of recurrent neural networks with no cyclic dependencies among recurrent neurons. Their subclass RNC+ with positive recurrent weights has been shown to be closely connected to the star-free regular languages, which are the expressivity of many well-established temporal logics. The existing expressivity results show that the regular languages captured by RNC+ are the star-free ones, and they leave open the possibility that RNC+ may capture languages beyond regular. We exclude this possibility for languages that include an identity element, i.e., an input that can occur an arbitrary number of times without affecting the output. Namely, in the presence of an identity element, we show that the languages captured by RNC+ are exactly the star-free regular languages. Identity elements are ubiquitous in temporal patterns, and hence our results apply to a large number of applications. The implications of our results go beyond expressivity. At their core, we establish a close structural correspondence between RNC+ and semiautomata cascades, showing that every neuron can be equivalently captured by a three-state semiautomaton. A notable consequence of this result is that RNC+ are no more succinct than cascades of three-state semiautomata.

                arXiv:2406.12383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subset selection with cost constraints aims to select a subset from a ground set to maximize a monotone objective function without exceeding a given budget, which has various applications such as influence maximization and maximum coverage. In real-world scenarios, the budget, representing available resources, may change over time, which requires that algorithms must adapt quickly to new budgets. However, in this dynamic environment, previous algorithms either lack theoretical guarantees or require a long running time. The state-of-the-art algorithm, POMC, is a Pareto optimization approach designed for static problems, lacking consideration for dynamic problems. In this paper, we propose BPODC, enhancing POMC with biased selection and warm-up strategies tailored for dynamic environments. We focus on the ability of BPODC to leverage existing computational results while adapting to budget changes. We prove that BPODC can maintain the best known $(\alpha_f/2)(1-e^{-\alpha_f})$-approximation guarantee when the budget changes. Experiments on influence maximization and maximum coverage show that BPODC adapts more effectively and rapidly to budget changes, with a running time that is less than that of the static greedy algorithm.

">Three Subtypes Of Autism Spectrum Disorder With Transcriptomic Signatures Derived From Morphometric Similarity Networks</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent and highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder. Previous studies have attempted to identify ASD subgroups by analyzing isolated cortical structural features. However, these studies have not considered the relationship between multiple structural features, which provide information on the structural organization of the brain. Morphometric similarity network (MSN), a structural brain network contributed by multiple anatomical features (gray matter volume, mean cortical thickness, surface area, mean curvature, Gaussian curvature, curvature index, and fold index), strongly relates to cytoarchitectonic and genomic measures of histological similarity between cortical areas. We applied K-means clustering on MSN from 236 individuals with ASD and identified three subtypes. Subtype-1 showed relatively similar MSN values with typically developmental individuals (TD). Subtype-2 showed higher morphometric similarities in the lateral frontal and temporal cortical regions and lower in anterior prefrontal and occipital regions compared to TD. These patterns were the opposite in subtype-3. Behaviorally, subtype-3 had more severe verbal and social deficits compared to subtype-2. The weaker resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) between the language and salience networks was observed between subtype-2 and TD. Subtype-3 had stronger rs-FC between salience and default mode networks (DMN), between frontoparietal and visual networks, and between language and dorsal attention networks, while weaker rs-FC within DMN, within sensorimotor, and within salience networks. In addition, genes with expression patterns associated with regional MS changes in ASD subtypes were functionally enriched in neuron-specific biological processes related to nervous system development, synaptic signaling and chromatin organization. These genes were particularly enriched in GABAergic neurons, glutamatergic neurons, astrocytes and microglia. Taken together, our findings suggest the existence of different neuroanatomical subtypes based on multiple anatomical features in ASD with distinct transcriptomic signatures and functional connectome patterns.

	<p>The aim of this study is to present the outcomes of cerebral aneurysm treatment with the DERIVO&amp;amp;reg; mini Embolisation Device (DMD), which is compatible with microcatheters with 0.021-inch inner diameters. Consecutive patients treated with DMD were identified retrospectively. Patient and aneurysm characteristics, procedural findings, clinical outcomes and follow-up imaging results were evaluated. A total of 44 target aneurysms in 30 patients were treated with DMD. The mean age of the patients was 49.9 (range, 4&amp;amp;ndash;77 years). Four patients with five aneurysms presented with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. The mean aneurysm size was 6.8 mm (range, 1.5&amp;amp;ndash;22 mm). In 29 (65.9%) aneurysms, adjunctive devices were used for endovascular treatment. The overall mortality rate was 3.3% and procedure-related mortality was 0%. Overall neurologic morbidity was 6.6% and none of the patients had a permanent sequela secondary to the procedure. The mean clinical follow-up period was 20.9 months (range, 3 days&amp;amp;ndash;46 months) and the mean DSA follow-up period was 10.9 months. A total of 37 (84.1%) aneurysms demonstrated total occlusion (Raymond&amp;amp;ndash;Roy [RR 1]); 3 (6.8%) aneurysms had a neck remnant or infundibular filling at the origin of the jailed side branch (RR 2), 4 (9.1%) aneurysms had residual aneurysm filling (RR 3). For those aneurysms treated with bare DMD, the total occlusion rate was 73.3% at a mean follow-up of 16.1 months. In this initial clinical single-center experience, DMD had a good safety profile and efficacy comparable with the currently used flow diverters.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012433">A comparison of EEG encoding models using audiovisual stimuli and their unimodal counterparts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maansi Desai, Alyssa M. Field, Liberty S. Hamilton</p>

Communication in the real world is inherently multimodal. When having a conversation, typically sighted and hearing people use both auditory and visual cues to understand one another. For example, objects may make sounds as they move in space, or we may use the movement of a person’s mouth to better understand what they are saying in a noisy environment. Still, many neuroscience experiments rely on unimodal stimuli to understand encoding of sensory features in the brain. The extent to which visual information may influence encoding of auditory information and vice versa in natural environments is thus unclear. Here, we addressed this question by recording scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in 11 subjects as they listened to and watched movie trailers in audiovisual (AV), visual (V) only, and audio (A) only conditions. We then fit linear encoding models that described the relationship between the brain responses and the acoustic, phonetic, and visual information in the stimuli. We also compared whether auditory and visual feature tuning was the same when stimuli were presented in the original AV format versus when visual or auditory information was removed. In these stimuli, visual and auditory information was relatively uncorrelated, and included spoken narration over a scene as well as animated or live-action characters talking with and without their face visible. For this stimulus, we found that auditory feature tuning was similar in the AV and A-only conditions, and similarly, tuning for visual information was similar when stimuli were presented with the audio present (AV) and when the audio was removed (V only). In a cross prediction analysis, we investigated whether models trained on AV data predicted responses to A or V only test data similarly to models trained on unimodal data. Overall, prediction performance using AV training and V test sets was similar to using V training and V test sets, suggesting that the auditory information has a relatively smaller effect on EEG. In contrast, prediction performance using AV training and A only test set was slightly worse than using matching A only training and A only test sets. This suggests the visual information has a stronger influence on EEG, though this makes no qualitative difference in the derived feature tuning. In effect, our results show that researchers may benefit from the richness of multimodal datasets, which can then be used to answer more than one research question.

                Prosthetic joint loosening due to Brucella spp. is a rare event. In this report, we describe a rare case of prosthetic infection caused by brucella. A 71-year-old woman reported a six-month history of progressing pain in the right prosthetic knee, which had been implanted for arthrosis four years prior to admission, associated with fever. No night sweats were noted. On examination, the right knee appeared slightly swollen and painful on mobilization, and the surgical wound was normal. Blood tests showed increased C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (34mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (34mm/hr). A CT scan of her right knee was performed, showing loosening of the prosthesis, joint effusion, and osteolysis in contact with the internal tibial component measuring 16mm maximum with bone remodeling of the epiphysis and metaphysis regions. Rose Bengal test was positive for brucellosis, a standard brucella tube agglutination test was positive at a titer of 1/80, blood cultures for brucella were negative and a PCR for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. The patient was diagnosed as having Brucella infection of his total knee arthroplasty. Favorable outcome was observed after medical and surgical treatment. We believe this is the first detailed report of Brucella prosthetic infection in the country despite the endemicity of this type of zoonosis.

                Background Treatment expectations influence clinical outcomes in various physical and psychological conditions; however, no studies have explored their role in endometriosis treatment. It is necessary to understand how these expectations can be measured to study treatment expectations and their effects in clinical practice. This study aimed to psychometrically analyze and compare different treatment expectation measurements and describe treatment expectations in women with suspected endometriosis. Method Analysis of cross-sectional baseline data of a mixed-method clinical observational study of N=699 patients undergoing laparoscopy in Germany. Descriptives, bivariate associations, convergent and discriminant validity of four expectation measurements (Treatment Expectation Questionnaire (TEX-Q); Generic rating scale for previous treatment experiences, treatment expectations, and treatment effects (GEEE); numerical rating scales (NRS) assessing improvement and worsening of endometriosis symptoms, expected Pain Disability Index (PDI); range: 0 to 10) were estimated. A cluster analysis was performed on the three GEEE items. Results Most participants expected high improvement (M=6.68 to 7.20, SD=1.90 to 2.09) and low worsening (M=1.09 to 2.52, SD=1.80 to 2.25) of disability from laparoscopy. Participants who expected greater worsening expected more side effects (r=.31 to .60, p<.001). Associations between the positive and negative expectation dimensions, including side effects, were small to non-significant (r =|.24| to .00, p<.001 to.978). Four distinct clusters, described as’positive’, ‘no pain, no gain’, ‘diminished’, and ‘uniform’ were found, with a total PVE of 62.2%. Conclusions Women with suspected endometriosis reported positive expectations concerning laparoscopy, but wide ranges indicated interindividual differences. Treatment expectations seem to be a multidimensional construct in this patient group. The investigated measurements did not correlate to the extent that they measured exactly the same construct. The selection of measurements should be carefully considered and adapted for the study purposes. Clusters provide initial indications for individualized interventions that target expectation manipulation. Trial Registration Number ID NCT05019612 (ClinicalTrials.gov)

                Background The significant challenge in adolescent and young adult therapy lies in the fact that research in this field does not provide many clinical indications. This study addresses domains contributing to the establishment and sustenance of engagement, satisfaction, and progress among adolescents and young adults in their treatment by delving into the impact of events that, from the perspective of clients, have positively influenced their therapeutic process. Methods Employing a qualitative research approach, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 adolescents and young adults undergoing therapy, recounting positive and constructive events during their treatment. Results A structured thematic analysis revealed six primary domains of positive events: events linked to the management of the setting, events shaping the definition of therapy goals, occurrences tied to the therapist’s active role, collaborative events between therapists and clients, and events associated with both clients’ external and internal worlds. Conclusions The findings suggest that working with adolescents shares similarities with psychotherapy involving adult clients but demands specific attention to adolescents and young adults’ families, surrounding environment, and rapidly changing needs.

                Abstract Paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors, often associated with catecholamine secretion. These tumors can arise in various locations, with the majority found in the abdomen and pelvis, while a smaller percentage occurs in the thorax and head and neck regions. Diaphragmatic paragangliomas are exceedingly rare, with only two documented cases in the literature. This report details a case of a primary diaphragmatic paraganglioma in a 59-year-old patient presenting with unexplained weight loss, tremors, and diaphoresis. Imaging studies revealed a mass in the right lobe of the liver, later identified as a diaphragmatic paraganglioma during surgery. The case underscores the importance of preoperative catecholamine assessment and careful surgical planning due to the risks associated with tumor manipulation. Complete surgical resection, although challenging, remains the definitive treatment, especially in hypervascular tumors located near major vascular structures.

                Background Age-related central auditory processing disorder and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be concomitant in older adults, making it difficult to communicate, especially in challenging listening conditions. This preliminary study investigated the efficacy of auditory-based cognitive training on the auditory processing abilities and cognitive functions of older adults with MCI. Methods In this randomized controlled trial twenty-two older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were randomly assigned to either an experimental (n=11) or a control group (n=11). The experimental group received 15 cognitive training sessions through tasks involving the auditory domain. The outcome measures of this study included auditory resolution (Temporal gap detection, frequency discrimination, and modulation detection) and cognitive measures (Trail making tests and digit recall), which were administered at three-time points (before training, post-training, and follow-up). The linear mixed model computed the effects of training on the outcome measures. Results A significant improvement was observed in the modulation detection threshold between baseline and follow-up and between post-training and follow-up sessions. However, GDT and FD thresholds did not reveal any statistically significant difference. In the trail making test, Part B showed consistent significance across the time points, whereas Part A and the delayed recall task showed no significant difference. Conclusion Auditory-based cognitive training may improve auditory processing and executive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The findings concerning the association between endocannabinoid system (ECS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibited inconsistencies when examining the expression levels of endocannabinoids. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the studies regarding alterations of the ECS in AD. Six databases were thoroughly searched for literature to select relevant studies investigating the ECS in AD, including changes in cannabinoid receptors (CB1R and CB2R), endocannabinoids (2-AG and AEA), and their associated enzymes (FAAH and MAGL). Traditional meta-analysis evaluated the expression levels of the ECS in AD, and the results showed no significant differences in ECS components between healthy controls and AD patients. However, subgroup analysis revealed significantly lower expression levels of CB1R in AD than in controls, particularly in studies using western blot (SMD = −0.88, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and in studies testing CB1R of frontal cortex (SMD = −1.09, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). For studies using HPLC, the subgroup analysis indicated significantly higher 2-AG levels in AD than in controls (SMD = 0.46, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Network meta-analysis examined the rank of ECS alterations in AD compared to controls, and the findings revealed that 2-AG and MAGL exhibited the largest increase and CB1R showed the largest decrease relative to the control group. Based on the findings of traditional meta-analysis and network meta-analysis, we proposed that AD patients may present decreased expression levels of CB1R and increased expression levels of 2-AG and its degrading enzyme MAGL. Our results may contribute to the growing body of research supporting the therapeutic potential of ECS modulation in the management of AD.</p>

                Hüser et al. show that an age-associated decline in CD9 expression in dermal fibroblasts promotes the secretion of CD9-low and ANGPTL2-high extracellular vesicles. The loss of CD9 promotes angiogenesis and presents an age-related mechanism, which could drive melanoma progression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94899">Machine learning approaches identify immunologic signatures of total and intact HIV DNA during long-term antiretroviral therapy</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the interplay between the HIV reservoir and the host immune system may yield insights into HIV persistence during antiretroviral therapy (ART) and inform strategies for a cure. Here, we applied machine learning (ML) approaches to cross-sectional high-parameter HIV reservoir and immunology data in order to characterize host–reservoir associations and generate new hypotheses about HIV reservoir biology. High-dimensional immunophenotyping, quantification of HIV-specific T cell responses, and measurement of genetically intact and total HIV proviral DNA frequencies were performed on peripheral blood samples from 115 people with HIV (PWH) on long-term ART. Analysis demonstrated that both intact and total proviral DNA frequencies were positively correlated with T cell activation and exhaustion. Years of ART and select bifunctional HIV-specific CD4 T cell responses were negatively correlated with the percentage of intact proviruses. A leave-one-covariate-out inference approach identified specific HIV reservoir and clinical–demographic parameters, such as age and biological sex, that were particularly important in predicting immunophenotypes. Overall, immune parameters were more strongly associated with total HIV proviral frequencies than intact proviral frequencies. Uniquely, however, expression of the IL-7 receptor alpha chain (CD127) on CD4 T cells was more strongly correlated with the intact reservoir. Unsupervised dimension reduction analysis identified two main clusters of PWH with distinct immune and reservoir characteristics. Using reservoir correlates identified in these initial analyses, decision tree methods were employed to visualize relationships among multiple immune and clinical–demographic parameters and the HIV reservoir. Finally, using random splits of our data as training-test sets, ML algorithms predicted with approximately 70% accuracy whether a given participant had qualitatively high or low levels of total or intact HIV DNA . The techniques described here may be useful for assessing global patterns within the increasingly high-dimensional data used in HIV reservoir and other studies of complex biology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93243">Rifampicin tolerance and growth fitness among isoniazid-resistant clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from a longitudinal study</a></h4>

              
                Antibiotic tolerance in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> reduces bacterial killing, worsens treatment outcomes, and contributes to resistance. We studied rifampicin tolerance in isolates with or without isoniazid resistance (IR). Using a minimum duration of killing assay, we measured rifampicin survival in isoniazid-susceptible (IS, n=119) and resistant (IR, n=84) isolates, correlating tolerance with bacterial growth, rifampicin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), and isoniazid-resistant mutations. Longitudinal IR isolates were analyzed for changes in rifampicin tolerance and genetic variant emergence. The median time for rifampicin to reduce the bacterial population by 90% (MDK90) increased from 1.23 days (IS) and 1.31 days (IR) to 2.55 days (IS) and 1.98 days (IR) over 15–60 days of incubation, indicating fast and slow-growing tolerant sub-populations. A 6 log10-fold survival fraction classified tolerance as low, medium, or high, showing that IR is linked to increased tolerance and faster growth (OR = 2.68 for low vs. medium, OR = 4.42 for low vs. high, p-trend = 0.0003). High tolerance in IR isolates was associated with rifampicin treatment in patients and genetic microvariants. These findings suggest that IR tuberculosis should be assessed for high rifampicin tolerance to optimize treatment and prevent the development of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99172">Proteomic landscape of tunneling nanotubes reveals CD9 and CD81 tetraspanins as key regulators</a></h4>

              
                Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are open actin- and membrane-based channels, connecting remote cells and allowing direct transfer of cellular material (e.g. vesicles, mRNAs, protein aggregates) from the cytoplasm to the cytoplasm. Although they are important especially, in pathological conditions (e.g. cancers, neurodegenerative diseases), their precise composition and their regulation were still poorly described. Here, using a biochemical approach allowing to separate TNTs from cell bodies and from extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs), we obtained the full composition of TNTs compared to EVPs. We then focused on two major components of our proteomic data, the CD9 and CD81 tetraspanins, and further investigated their specific roles in TNT formation and function. We show that these two tetraspanins have distinct non-redundant functions: CD9 participates in stabilizing TNTs, whereas CD81 expression is required to allow the functional transfer of vesicles in the newly formed TNTs, possibly by regulating docking to or fusion with the opposing cell.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98175">SRSF2 is a key player in orchestrating the directional migration and differentiation of MyoD progenitors during skeletal muscle development</a></h4>

              
                SRSF2 plays a dual role, functioning both as a transcriptional regulator and a key player in alternative splicing. The absence of Srsf2 in MyoD + progenitors resulted in perinatal mortality in mice, accompanied by severe skeletal muscle defects. SRSF2 deficiency disrupts the directional migration of MyoD progenitors, causing them to disperse into both muscle and non-muscle regions. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed significant alterations in Srsf2-deficient myoblasts, including a reduction in extracellular matrix components, diminished expression of genes involved in ameboid-type cell migration and cytoskeleton organization, mitosis irregularities, and premature differentiation. Notably, one of the targets regulated by Srsf2 is the serine/threonine kinase Aurka. Knockdown of <i>Aurka</i> led to reduced cell proliferation, disrupted cytoskeleton, and impaired differentiation, reflecting the effects seen with <i>Srsf2</i> knockdown. Crucially, the introduction of exogenous Aurka in <i>Srsf2</i>-knockdown cells markedly alleviated the differentiation defects caused by <i>Srsf2</i> knockdown. Furthermore, our research unveiled the role of Srsf2 in controlling alternative splicing within genes associated with human skeletal muscle diseases, such as <i>BIN1</i>, <i>DMPK</i>, <i>FHL1</i>, and <i>LDB3</i>. Specifically, the precise knockdown of the <i>Bin1</i> exon17-containing variant, which is excluded following <i>Srsf2</i> depletion, profoundly disrupted C2C12 cell differentiation. In summary, our study offers valuable insights into the role of SRSF2 in governing MyoD progenitors to specific muscle regions, thereby controlling their differentiation through the regulation of targeted genes and alternative splicing during skeletal muscle development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93968">Allosteric modulation of the CXCR4:CXCL12 axis by targeting receptor nanoclustering via the TMV-TMVI domain</a></h4>

              
                CXCR4 is a ubiquitously expressed chemokine receptor that regulates leukocyte trafficking and arrest in both homeostatic and pathological states. It also participates in organogenesis, HIV-1 infection, and tumor development. Despite the potential therapeutic benefit of CXCR4 antagonists, only one, plerixafor (AMD3100), which blocks the ligand-binding site, has reached the clinic. Recent advances in imaging and biophysical techniques have provided a richer understanding of the membrane organization and dynamics of this receptor. Activation of CXCR4 by CXCL12 reduces the number of CXCR4 monomers/dimers at the cell membrane and increases the formation of large nanoclusters, which are largely immobile and are required for correct cell orientation to chemoattractant gradients. Mechanistically, CXCR4 activation involves a structural motif defined by residues in TMV and TMVI. Using this structural motif as a template, we performed in silico molecular modeling followed by in vitro screening of a small compound library to identify negative allosteric modulators of CXCR4 that do not affect CXCL12 binding. We identified AGR1.137, a small molecule that abolishes CXCL12-mediated receptor nanoclustering and dynamics and blocks the ability of cells to sense CXCL12 gradients both in vitro and in vivo while preserving ligand binding and receptor internalization.

">Mitochondrial complex I deficiency occurs in skeletal muscle of a subgroup of individuals with Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Widespread neuronal complex I (CI) deficiency was recently reported to be a characteristic in a subgroup of individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we sought to determine whether a CI deficient subgroup could be discerned using clinically accessible muscle biopsy. Vastus lateralis needle biopsies were collected from 83 individuals with PD and 29 neurologically healthy controls and analyzed by immunohistochemistry for complexes I and IV, cytochrome c oxidase/succinate dehydrogenase (COX/SDH) histochemistry, and spectrophotometric activity assays of complexes I-IV. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, deletions, and point variation were analyzed in single muscle fibers and bulk biopsy samples. PD muscle exhibited reduced CI activity at the group level, with 9% of cases falling below two standard deviations of the control group. This deficiency was not associated with mtDNA abnormalities. Our findings support the existence of a PD subpopulation characterized by CI pathology and suggest that stratification by extra-neural mitochondrial dysfunction may be informative for selecting individuals for clinical trials.

">Use of the non-paretic arm reflects a habitual behaviour in chronic stroke</a></h4>

              
                Background: A proportion of stroke survivors use their affected arm less than might be expected based on their level of impairment. The resulting non-use of the affected arm has a negative impact on participation in neurorehabilitation and functional independence. However, non-use remains poorly understood. One possibility is that prioritising the non-paretic arm reflects a habit, despite residual functional capacity in the paretic arm. Methods: 30 chronic stroke survivors (Mean FM: 28.9 +/- 11.3) participated in a simplified version of the forced response paradigm, which reliably identifies the presence of a habit. Participants were asked to choose which arm to use to maximise points scored during a reaching task. During half of the trials, the presumed habit of using the non-paretic arm yielded more points, whereas in the other half using the non-paretic arm incurred a loss of points. Participants completed two versions of this task, once with unlimited response time available and once without. Results: Participants scored fewer points in the limited response condition compared to the unlimited response conditions. This difference was driven by a selective increase in the use of the non-paretic arm in trials where the paretic arm yielded more points. The results were not mediated by former hand dominance. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that not using the non-paretic arm may reflect a habit response that is more readily triggered in demanding (e.g. time-limited) situations. This may explain why successful neurorehabilitation does not always result in a more functionally useful arm. Our results pave the way for targeted interventions such as habit breaking techniques to be included in clinical practise.

                Alpha-Synuclein (aSyn) accumulation within the extra-nigral neuronal populations in brainstem, including the gigantocellular nuclei (GRN/Gi) of reticular formation, is a recognized feature during the prodromal phase of Parkinson disease (PD). Accordingly, there is a burgeoning interest in animal model development for understanding the pathological significance of extra-nigral synucleinopathy, in relation to motor and/or non-motor symptomatology in PD. Here, we report an experimental paradigm for the induction of aSyn aggregation in brainstem, with stereotaxic delivery of pre-formed fibrillar (PFF) aSyn in the pontine GRN of transgenic mice expressing the mutant human Ala53Thr aSyn (M83 line). Our data show that PFF aSyn-induced aggregate pathology in GRN leads to progressive decline in spontaneous locomotion and an early phenotype of postural instability. This early phase of bradykinesia was followed by a moribund stage, characterized by worsening motor performance and impaired survival with substantial aSyn aggregation in several brain regions beyond the GRN. Collectively, our observations suggest an experimental framework for studying the pathological significance of aSyn aggregation in GRN in relation to features of movement disability in PD. With further refinements, we anticipate that this model holds promise as a test-bed for translational research in PD and related disorders.

                Spider orb-web building is a captivating, rare example of animal construction, whose neural underpinnings remain undiscovered. An essential step in understanding the basis of this behavior is a foundational mapping of the spider's neuroanatomy, which has thus far been primarily studied using non-web building species. We created a three-dimensional atlas for the hackled orb-weaver, Uloborus diversus, based on immunostaining for the presynaptic component, synapsin, in whole-mounted spider synganglia. Aligned to this volume, we examined the expression patterns of neuronal populations representing many of the classical neurotransmitter and neuromodulators, as well as a subset of neuropeptides - detailing immunoreactivity in an unbiased fashion throughout the synganglion, revealing co-expression in known structures, as well as novel neuropils not evident in prior spider works. This optically-sliced, whole-mount atlas is the first of its kind for spiders, representing a substantive addition to knowledge of brain anatomy and neurotransmitter expression patterns for an orb-weaving species.

">Photoreceptor degeneration has heterogeneous effects on functional retinal ganglion cell types</a></h4>

              
                Retinitis pigmentosa is a hereditary disease causing progressive degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors, with no effective therapies. Using the rd10 mouse model, which mirrors the human condition, we examined its disease progression. Rods deteriorate by postnatal day (P) 45, followed by cone degeneration, with most photoreceptors lost by P180. Until then, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) remain light-responsive, albeit only under photopic conditions, despite extensive outer retinal remodelling. However, it is still unknown whether the different functional RGC types remain stable, or if some types differentially alter their activity or are even lost during disease progression. Here, we addressed if and how the response diversity of functional RGC types changes with rd10 disease progression. At P30, we were able to identify all functional wild-type RGC types also in rd10 retina, suggesting that at this early degenerative stage, the full breadth of retinal output is still present. Remarkably, we found that the fractions of functional types changed throughout progressing degeneration between rd10 and wild-type: Responses of RGCs with 'Off'-components ('Off' and 'On-Off' RGCs) seemed to be more vulnerable than 'On'-cells, with 'Fast-On' types being the most resilient. Notably, direction-selective RGCs appeared to be more vulnerable than orientation-selective RGCs. In summary, we found differences in resilience of response types (from resilient to vulnerable): 'Uncertain' > 'Fast On' > 'Slow On' > 'On-Off' > 'Off'. Taken together, our results suggest that rd10 photoreceptor degeneration has heterogeneous effects on functional RGC types, with distinct sets of types losing their characteristic light responses earlier than others. This differential susceptibility of RGC circuits may be of relevance for future neuroprotective therapeutic strategies.

">Modeling Attention and Binding in the Brain through Bidirectional Recurrent Gating</a></h4>

              
                Attention is a key component of the visual system, essential for perception, learning, and memory. Attention can also be seen as a solution to the binding problem: concurrent attention to all parts of an entity allows separating it from the rest. However, the rich models of attention in computational neuroscience are generally not scaled to real-world problems and there are thus many behavioral and neural phenomena that current models cannot explain. Here, we propose a bidirectional recurrent model of attention that is inspired by modern neural networks for image segmentation. It conceptualizes recurrent connections as a multi-stage internal gating process where bottom-up connections transmit features, while top-down and lateral connections transmit attentional gating signals. Our model can recognize and segment simple stimuli such as digits as well as objects in natural images and is able to be prompted with object labels, attributes or locations. It can learn to perform a range of behavioral findings, such as object binding, selective attention, inhibition of return, and visual search. It also replicates a variety of neural findings, including increased activity for attended objects, features, and locations, attention-invariant tuning, and relatively late onset attention. Most importantly, our proposed model unifies decades of cognitive and neurophysiological findings of visual attention into a single principled architecture. Our results highlight that the ability to selectively and dynamically focus on specific parts of stimulus streams can help artificial neural networks to better generalize and align with human brains.

">Cross-species brain-wide mapping reveals a conserved and coordinated network engaged by NAc DBS</a></h4>

              
                Nucleus accumbens (NAc) deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been increasingly explored as a treatment modality for refractory neuropsychiatric disorders. Uncovering the accumbens network that is engaged by DBS is a critical step forward in understanding how modulating this important node impacts the broader mesocorticolimbic circuit. Using whole-brain clearing and unbiased, brain-wide neural activity mapping, we found that NAc DBS increases neural activity in a coordinated mesocorticolimbic network in mice. Simultaneous intracranial electrophysiology recordings from the human NAc and brief stimulation epochs of homologous mesocorticolimbic nodes revealed similar connectivity. Altogether, these results identify specific connectivity conserved across species within the mesocorticolimbic circuit that may underlie mechanisms of NAc DBS.

">Neural Circuit Underlying Individual differences in Visual Escape Habituation</a></h4>

              
                Emotions, like fear, are internal states enabling organisms to effectively confront environmental threats. When repeatedly exposed to predators, individuals show divergent adaptive responses. However, the neural circuit mechanisms underlying individual differences in to repeated threats remain largely unknown. Here, we identify two distinct types of visual escape,consistent escape (T1) and rapid habituation (T2),with unambiguous arousal states to repetitive threat stimuli. We systematically investigate distinct pathways originating from the superior colliculus (SC) and insula that project to the basolateral amygdala (BLA), with relay stations in the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), mediating T1 and T2 behavioral types. Additionally, we identify the MD as a critical hub integrating SC and insula inputs, projecting to the BLA and contributing to reduced arousal and attenuated defensive behaviors against looming stimuli. Our findings offer significant insights into the mechanisms of internal states, arousal modulation, and behavioral adaptability.

">Dynamic cycles between idea generation and evaluation during creative storytelling</a></h4>

              
                Many theories support the notion that creative thinking involves a dynamic transition between idea generation and evaluation, but there is limited evidence of how these two stages interact. The dual process model proposes that spontaneous thinking and deliberate thinking drive these stages and the transitions between them, but there is a debate over whether they operate in parallel or in sequence. To address these gaps, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in 41 college students during a creative storytelling task. By analyzing the dynamic brain state, we link the brain states with idea generation and evaluation. The transition patterns between brain states provide evidence for dynamic circulation between idea generation and evaluation during creative storytelling. Using a deep learning approach, we demonstrate an alternating interaction between spontaneous and deliberate thinking, driving the idea generation and evaluation stages and the transitions between them. These findings deepen our understanding of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying creative thinking.

">Fuzzy ripple artifact in high resolution fMRI: identification, cause, and mitigation</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: High resolution fMRI is a rapidly growing research field focused on capturing functional signal changes across cortical layers. However, the data acquisition is limited by low spatial frequency EPI artifacts; termed here as Fuzzy Ripples. These artifacts limit the practical applicability of acquisition protocols with higher spatial resolution, faster acquisition speed, and they challenge imaging in lower brain areas. Methods: We characterize Fuzzy Ripple artifacts across commonly used sequences and distinguish them from conventional EPI Nyquist ghosts, off-resonance effects, and GRAPPA artifacts. To investigate their origin, we employ dual polarity readouts. Results: Our findings indicate that Fuzzy Ripples are primarily caused by readout-specific imperfections in k-space trajectories, which can be exacerbated by inductive coupling between third-order shims and readout gradients. We also find that these artifacts can be mitigated through complex-valued averaging of dual polarity EPI or by disconnecting the third-order shim coils. Conclusion: The proposed mitigation strategies allow overcoming current limitations in layer-fMRI protocols: (1) Achieving resolutions beyond 0.8mm is feasible, and even at 3T, we achieved 0.53mm voxel functional connectivity mapping. (2) Sub-millimeter sampling acceleration can be increased to allow sub-second TRs and laminar whole brain protocols with up to GRAPPA 8. (3) Sub-millimeter fMRI is achievable in lower brain areas, including the cerebellum.

">Restoring transient connectivity during development improves dysfunctions in fragile X mice</a></h4>

              
                Early-generated circuits are critical for the maturation of cortical network activity and the formation of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance. This process involves the maturation of specific populations of inhibitory neurons. While parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons have been associated with E/I impairments observed in neurodevelopmental disorders, somatostatin-expressing (SST) neurons have recently been shown to regulate PV neuron maturation by controlling neural dynamics in the developing cortex. SST neurons receive transient connections from the sensory thalamus, yet the implications of transient connectivity in neurodevelopmental disorders remain unknown. Here, we show that thalamocortical connectivity to SST neurons is persistent rather than transient in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome. We were able to restore the transient dynamics using chemogenetics, which led to the recovery of fragile X-associated dysfunctions in circuit maturation and sensory-dependent behavior. Overall, our findings unveil the role of early transient dynamics in controlling downstream maturation of sensory functions.

	<p>The present study analyzed the association between anxiety, repetitive behavior and parental stress in individuals with autism from Spain (n = 60, mean age = 8.52, SD = 4.41) and Colombia (n = 58, mean age = 10.29, SD = 4.98). Similarly, differences in anxiety, repetitive behavior and parental stress between both countries were analyzed. Outcomes revealed a strong relationship between anxiety and repetitive behavior in both populations. Furthermore, moderate positive associations were observed between anxiety, repetitive behavior and parental stress in the Spanish sample. However, parental stress was found to be moderately and negatively related with anxiety and repetitive behavior in the Colombian sample. Finally, no differences were found in anxiety and repetitive behavior between countries, but differences did emerge for parental stress which was found to be higher in the Colombian sample. In conclusion, differences in parental stress may be due to regional differences in socio-health resources, socio-economics, parenting styles, etc.</p>

">Aberrant prefrontal activity and arousal level correlate with action initiation and response vigor</a></h4>

              
                Orchestrating learned Stimulus-Response (S-R) mappings has been suggested as one of the central functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). While S-R selective activity has been demonstrated, it remains unclear whether the strength of such activity is related to the vigor of the subsequent response. Here, we trained male rats to perform a Go/NoGo response task while head-fixed on a treadmill. This allowed us to record PFC (cingulate, area 24) single unit spiking, as well as running speed as a proxy for response vigor. We show that aberrant activation of the "wrong" S-R mapping is correlated with initiation of the incorrect response. The vigor of the incorrect response was directly related to the strength of the aberrant stimulus-evoked activity. A similar relationship was observed for pre-trial arousal state and response vigor. Our findings confirm the long-standing concept, established in psychology and cognitive neuroscience, that S-R mappings are directly related to response vigor. Moreover, we provide evidence for the often suggested but rarely tested relationship between arousal and response vigor and a potential underlying neuronal mechanism involving neuromodulation of S-R mapping activity.

">The Confidence-Noise Confidence-Boost (CNCB) model of confidence rating data</a></h4>

              
                Over the last decade, different approaches have been proposed to interpret confidence rating judgments obtained after perceptual decisions. One very popular approach is to compute meta-d' which is a global measure of the sensibility to discriminate the confidence rating distributions for correct and incorrect perceptual decisions. Here, we propose a generative model of confidence based on two main parameters, confidence noise and confidence boost, that we call CNCB model. Confidence noise impairs confidence judgements above and beyond how sensory noise affects perceptual sensitivity. The confidence boost parameter reflects whether confidence uses the same information that was used for perceptual decisions, or some new information. This CNCB model offers a principled way to estimate a confidence efficiency measure that is a theory-driven alternative to the popular M-ratio. We then describe two scenarios to estimate the confidence boost parameter, one where the experiment uses more than two confidence levels, the other where the experiment uses more than two stimulus strengths. We also extend the model to continuous confidence ratings and describe how a non-linear mapping can be estimated between objective and subjective confidence probabilities. Altogether, the CNCB model should help interpret confidence rating data at a deeper level. This manuscript is accompanied by a toolbox that will allow researchers to estimate all the parameters of the CNCB model in confidence ratings datasets. Some examples of re-analyses of previous datasets are provided in the Appendix.

">Time spent in conversation over meals predicts default network function: Evidence from a passive mobile-sensing and fMRI study.</a></h4>

              
                Sharing meals with others, often referred to as 'commensality,' fosters social connection and may have been essential to human brain evolution. Here, we investigate whether shared meals impact social brain processes through the conversations they afford. If so, then time spent in conversation over meals should affect the default network- a set of interconnected cortical regions reliably associated with the social exchange of ideas. To test this possibility, we combined passive-mobile sensing with neuroimaging. Undergraduate participants had an application on their smartphone for two months that unobtrusively captured their time spent in conversation, as well as their location on and around campus. In between these two months, participants completed a resting state scan. Time spent in conversations around meals (e.g., at cafeterias and restaurants) during the prior month predicted greater functional connectivity in the dorsomedial default network subsystem, specifically between the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) portion and the rest of the subsystem regions. This relationship was preferential to: (1) time spent in conversation over the past (vs. future) month, (2) connectivity with the LIFG (vs. other dorsomedial subsystem nodes), (3) the dorsomedial subsystem (vs. other default network subsystems), (4) eateries (vs. other locations), and (5) time spent around conversation at eateries, rather than time at eateries more generally. Follow-up analyses further revealed results were driven by a ventral portion of the LIFG, with peaks in voxel-connectivity associated with language, social, memory, and affective processes, as determined by the meta-analytic platform, NeuroSynth. Time spent in conversation over meals may exercise social cognitive processes supported by the dorsomedial subsystem, a network key to social communication, understanding, and connection.

">Gray matter volume increase in the retrosplenial/posterior cingulate cortices of blind soccer players</a></h4>

              
                Spatial navigation is a crucial brain function that occurs when an individual moves from one location to another. This function normally relies on vision, and the retrosplenial/posterior cingulate cortices (RSC/PCC) and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) play crucial roles. However, an extraordinary adaptation can be observed in blind soccer players, where the human brain can perform spatial navigation without vision. Therefore, this study tested the possible increase in gray matter (GM) volume in the RSC/PCC and PHC in the brains of a world's top blind soccer player and other blind soccer players. We collected structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from six blind soccer players (including the world's top player) and eight blind non-soccer players. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis (single-case VBM approach), we examined GM volume increase in each participant compared to 250 sighted participants (all of whom had never played blind soccer). Compared with the sighted participants, the world's top blind soccer player had a significant increase in GM volume in the bilateral RSC/PCC. Two of the other five blind soccer players also showed an increase in the left RSC/PCC. However, such an increase in GM volume was not observed in the blind non-soccer players. Eventually, the probability of a significant increase in the RSC/PCC was significantly higher in the blind soccer group than in the blind non-soccer group. In contrast, only one blind soccer player (not the top player) showed a significant increase in the PHC, and no between-group difference was observed in the probability of a significant increase in the PHC. This study, unveiling the characteristics of the brains of the world's top blind soccer player and of other blind soccer players, for the first time demonstrates that blind soccer training, which requires spatial navigation based on non-visual cues, may enlarge the human RSC/PCC and provide findings that promote understanding the brains of challenged persons playing blind soccer.

">Next-generation Cu(II) selective peptide shuttles prevent Cu(Aβ)-induced toxicity and microglial activation in organotypic hippocampal slices</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) remains the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease with hallmarks including the apparition, in specific areas of the brain, of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid plaques. The latter result from an abnormal metabolism of Amyloid-beta; precursor protein (APP) leading to its accumulation in plaques. Ex vivo analysis of AD patients brains, show an abnormally elevated concentration of metals including Cu, Zn and Fe in these plaques. Some studies have also demonstrated altered Cu levels in the entire brain and more specifically in regions heavily affected in AD. These modifications are often accompanied by a decline in neuronal Cu levels and by an increase in the proportion of extracellular labile Cu, which in turn promotes reactive oxygen species formation. To correct this Cu dyshomeostasis, we designed and synthesized novel Cu(II)-selective peptide shuttles, capable of swiftly retrieving Cu from extracellular Amyloid-beta; and subsequently transporting and releasing Cu inside cells. We demonstrate here the capacity of this new Cu-shuttles, DapHH-aR5W4NBD and HDapH-aR5W4NBD, to protect organotypic hippocampal slices (OHSCs) from Cu(Abeta;)-induced insult and their capability to rescues Cu-induced microglial activation and proliferation.

">Precision not prediction: Body-ownership illusion as a consequence of online precision adaptation under Bayesian inference</a></h4>

              
                Humans can experience body-ownership of new (external) body parts, for instance, via visuotactile stimulation. While there are models that capture the influence of such body illusions in body localization and recalibration, the computational mechanism that drives the experience of body-ownership of external limbs is still not well understood and under discussion. Here, we describe a mathematical model of this phenomenon via uncertainty minimization. Using the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) as a proxy, we show that to properly estimate one's arm position, an agent infers the least uncertain world model that explains the observed reality through online adaptation of the signals' relevance, i.e., the precision parameters (inverse variance of the prediction error signal). Our computational model describes that the illusion is triggered when the sensory precision quickly adapts to account for the increase of sensory noise during the physical stimulation of the rubber hand due to the real hand occlusion. This adaptation produces a change in the uncertainty of the body position estimates yielding to a switch of the perceived reality: the 'rubber hand is the agent's hand' becomes the most plausible model (i.e., it has the least posterior uncertainty). Overall, our theoretical account, along with the numerical simulations provided, suggests that while the perceptual drifts in body localization may be driven by prediction error minimization, body-ownership illusions are a consequence of estimating the signals precision, i.e. the uncertainty associated with the prediction error.

">Stimulus repetition induces a two-stage learning process in primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Repeated stimulus exposure alters the brain's response to the stimulus. We investigated the underlying neural mechanisms by recording functional MRI data from human observers passively viewing 120 presentations of two Gabor patches (each Gabor repeating 60 times). We evaluated support for two prominent models of stimulus repetition, the fatigue model and the sharpening model. Our results uncovered a two-stage learning process in the primary visual cortex. In Stage 1, univariate BOLD activation in V1 decreased over the first twelve repetitions of the stimuli, replicating the well-known effect of repetition suppression. Applying MVPA decoding along with a moving window approach, we found that (1) the decoding accuracy between the two Gabors decreased from above-chance level (~60% to ~70%) at the beginning of the stage to chance level at the end of the stage (~50%). This result, together with the accompanying weight map analysis, suggested that the learning dynamics in Stage 1 were consistent with the predictions of the fatigue model. In Stage 2, univariate BOLD activation for the remaining 48 repetitions of the two stimuli exhibited significant fluctuations but no systematic trend. The MVPA decoding accuracy between the two Gabor patches was at chance level initially and became progressively higher as stimulus repetition continued, rising above and staying above chance level starting at the ~35th repetition. Thus, results from the second stage supported the notion that sustained and prolonged stimulus repetition prompts sharpened representations. Additional analyses addressed (1) whether the neural patterns within each learning stage remained stable and (2) whether new neural patterns were evoked in Stage 2 relative to Stage 1.

">Pupil self-regulation modulates markers of cortical excitability and cortical arousal</a></h4>

              
                The brain's arousal state (i.e., central arousal) is regulated by multiple neuromodulatory nuclei in the brainstem and significantly influences high-level cognitive processes. By exploiting the mechanistic connection between the locus coeruleus (LC), a key regulator of central arousal, and pupil dynamics, we recently demonstrated that participants can gain volitional control over arousal-regulating centers including the LC using a pupil-based biofeedback approach. Here, we test whether pupil-based biofeedback modulates electrophysiological markers of cortical excitability, cortical arousal, and phasic LC activity. Combining pupil-based biofeedback with single-pulse TMS, EEG recordings, and an auditory oddball task revealed three main results: pupil self-regulation significantly modulates (i) cortical excitability, (ii) the EEG spectral slope, a marker of cortical arousal, and (iii) the P300 response to target tones, an event-related potential suggested to be tightly linked to phasic LC activity. Interestingly, pupil self-regulation strength was linearly linked to the modulation of the spectral slope, suggesting a common physiological mechanism. Here, we have shown that pupil-based biofeedback modulates fundamental aspects of brain function. Whether this method could further be used to modulate these aspects in case of disturbances associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders needs to be investigated in future studies.

">Mouse Brain Extractor: Brain segmentation of mouse MRI using global positional encoding and SwinUNETR</a></h4>

              
                In spite of the great progress that has been made towards automating brain extraction in human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), challenges remain in the automation of this task for mouse models of brain disorders. Researchers often resort to editing brain segmentation results manually when automated methods fail to produce accurate delineations. However, manual corrections can be labor-intensive and introduce interrater variability. This motivated our development of a new deep-learning-based method for brain segmentation of mouse MRI, which we call Mouse Brain Extractor. We adapted the existing SwinUNETR architecture (Hatamizadeh et al., 2021) with the goal of making it more robust to scale variance. Our approach is to supply the network model with supplementary spatial information in the form of absolute positional encoding. We use a new scheme for positional encoding, which we call Global Positional Encoding (GPE). GPE is based on a shared coordinate frame that is relative to the entire input image. This differs from the positional encoding used in SwinUNETR, which solely employs relative pairwise image patch positions. GPE also differs from the conventional absolute positional encoding approach, which encodes position relative to a subimage rather than the entire image. We trained and tested our method on a heterogeneous dataset of N=223 mouse MRI, for which we generated a corresponding set of manually-edited brain masks. These data were acquired previously in other studies using several different scanners and imaging protocols and included in vivo and ex vivo images of mice with heterogeneous brain structure due to different genotypes, strains, diseases, ages, and sexes. We evaluated our method's results against those of seven existing rodent brain extraction methods and two state-of-the art deep-learning approaches, nnU-Net (Isensee et al., 2018) and SwinUNETR. Overall, our proposed method achieved average Dice scores on the order of 0.98 and average HD95 measures on the order of 100m when compared to the manually-labeled brain masks. In statistical analyses, our method significantly outperformed the conventional approaches and performed as well as or significantly better than the nnU-Net and SwinUNETR methods. These results suggest that Global Positional Encoding provides additional contextual information that enables our Mouse Brain Extractor to perform competitively on datasets containing multiple resolutions.

">Feature-specific divisive normalization improves natural image encoding for depth perception</a></h4>

              
                Vision science and visual neuroscience seek to understand how stimulus and sensor properties limit the precision with which behaviorally-relevant latent variables are encoded and decoded. In the primate visual system, binocular disparity-the canonical cue for stereo-depth perception-is initially encoded by a set of binocular receptive fields with a range of spatial frequency preferences. Here, with a stereo-image database having ground-truth disparity information at each pixel, we examine how response normalization and receptive field properties determine the fidelity with which binocular disparity is encoded in natural scenes. We quantify encoding fidelity by computing the Fisher information carried by the normalized receptive field responses. Several findings emerge from an analysis of the receptive field response statistics. First, broadband (or feature- unspecific) normalization yields Laplace-distributed receptive field responses, and narrowband (or feature-specific) normalization yields Gaussian-distributed receptive field responses. Second, the Fisher information in narrowband-normalized responses is larger than in broadband-normalized responses by a scale factor that grows with population size. Third, the most useful spatial frequency decreases with stimulus size and the range of spatial frequencies that is useful for encoding a given disparity decreases with disparity magnitude, consistent with neurophysiological findings. Fourth, the predicted patterns of psychophysical performance, and absolute detection threshold, match human performance with natural and artificial stimuli. The current computational efforts establish a new functional role for response normalization, and bring us closer to understanding the principles that should govern the design of neural systems that support perception in natural scenes.

">Improved classification of alcohol intake groups in the Intermittent-Access Two-Bottle choice rat model using a latent class linear mixed model</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major public health problem in which preclinical models allow the study of AUD development, comorbidities and possible new treatments. The intermittent access two-bottle choice (IA2BC) model is a validated preclinical model for studying alcohol intake patterns similar to those present in AUD in human clinical studies. Typically, the mean/median of overall alcohol intake or the last drinking sessions is used as a threshold to divide groups of animals into high or low alcohol consumers. However, it would be more statistically valuable to stratify the groups using the full consumption data from all drinking sessions. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using the time series data of all drinking sessions to stratify the population into high or low alcohol consumption groups, using a latent class linear mixed model (LCLMM). We compared LCLMM to traditional classification methods: percentiles, k-means clustering, and hierarchical clustering, and used simulations to compare accuracy between methods. Our results demonstrated that LCLMM outperforms other approaches, achieving superior accuracy (0.94) in identifying consumption patterns. By considering the entire trajectory of alcohol intake, LCLMM provides a more robust and nuanced characterization of high and low alcohol consumers. We advocate for the adoption of longitudinal statistical models in substance use disorder research, both in human studies and preclinical investigations, as they hold promise for enhancing population stratification and refining treatment strategies.

">Abnormal hyperactivity of specific striatal ensembles encodes distinct dyskinetic behaviors revealed by high-resolution clustering</a></h4>

              
                L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a debilitating complication of dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease and the most common hyperkinetic disorder of basal ganglia origin. Abnormal activity of striatal D1 and D2 spiny projection neurons (SPNs) is critical for LID, yet the link between SPN activity patterns and specific dyskinetic movements remains unknown. To explore this, we developed a novel method for clustering movements based on high-resolution motion sensors and video recordings. In a mouse model of LID, this method identified two main dyskinesia types and pathological rotations, all absent during normal behavior. Using single-cell resolution imaging, we found that specific sets of both D1 and D2-SPNs were abnormally active during these pathological movements. Under baseline conditions, the same SPN sets were active during behaviors sharing physical features with LID movements. These findings indicate that ensembles of behavior-encoding D1- and D2-SPNs form new combinations of hyperactive neurons mediating specific dyskinetic movements.

">Typical development of synaptic and neuronal properties can proceed without microglia</a></h4>

              
                Brain-resident macrophages, microglia, have been proposed to play an active role in synaptic refinement and maturation, influencing plasticity and circuit-level connectivity. Here we show that a variety of neurodevelopmental processes previously attributed to microglia can proceed without them. Using a genetically modified mouse which lacks microglia (Csf1r{triangleup}FIRE/{triangleup}FIRE) we find that neuronal physiology, synapse number and synaptic maturation are largely normal in CA1 of the hippocampus and somatosensory cortex during development. Seizure susceptibility and hippocampal-prefrontal cortex coherence in awake behaving animals, processes disrupted in mice deficient in microglia-enriched genes, are also normal. Similarly, segregation of eye-specific inputs into the lateral geniculate nucleus proceeds normally in the absence of microglia. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis did not uncover substantial perturbation due to neurons and astrocytes due to microglial absence. Thus, in the absence of microglia, the brain retains the capacity to execute developmental synaptic refinement, maturation and connectivity.

">A dopamine-dependent mechanism for reward-induced modification of fear memories</a></h4>

              
                A positive mental state has been shown to modulate fear-related emotions associated with the recall of fear memories. These, and other observations suggest the presence of central brain mechanisms for affective states to interact. The neurotransmitter dopamine is important for both reward- and fear-related processes, but it is unclear whether dopamine contributes to such affective interactions. Here, we show that precisely timed reward-induced activation of dopamine neurons in mice potently modifies fear memories and enhances their extinction. This reward-based switch in fear states is associated with changes in dopamine release and dopamine-dependent regulation of fear encoding in the central amygdala (CeA). These data provide a central mechanism for reward-induced modification of fear states that have broad implications for treating generalized fear disorders.

">Endophilin A1 facilitates organization of the GABAergic postsynaptic machinery to maintain excitation-inhibition balance</a></h4>

              
                The assembly and operation of neural circuits in the brain rely on the coordination and balance of excitatory and inhibitory activities. Inhibitory synapses are key regulators of the functional balance of neural circuits. However, due to the diversity of inhibitory presynaptic neurons, the complex composition of postsynaptic receptor subunits and the lack of typical postsynaptic dense structure, there are relatively few studies on the regulatory mechanisms for inhibitory synaptic structure and function, and insufficient understanding of the cellular and molecular abnormalities of inhibitory synapses in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we report a crucial role for endophilin A1 in inhibitory synapses. We show that endophilin A1 directly interacts with the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin in excitatory neurons, and promotes organization of the inhibitory postsynaptic density and synaptic recruitment/stabilization of the {gamma}-aminobutyric acid type A receptors via its plasma membrane association and actin polymerization promoting activities. Loss of endophilin A1 by gene knockout in mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells weakens inhibitory synaptic transmission and causes imbalance in the excitatory/inhibitory function of neural circuits, leading to increased susceptibility to epilepsy. Our findings identify endophilin A1 as an iPSD component and provide new insights into the organization and stabilization of inhibitory postsynapses to maintain E/I balance as well as the pathogenesis of epilepsy.

">Modeling Cortical Versus Hippocampal Network Dysfunction in a Human Brain Assembloid Model of Epilepsy and Intellectual Disability</a></h4>

              
                Neurodevelopmental disorders often impair multiple cognitive domains. For instance, a genetic epilepsy syndrome might cause seizures due to cortical hyperexcitability and present with memory impairments arising from hippocampal dysfunction. This study examines how a single disorder differentially affects distinct brain regions by using human patient iPSC-derived cortical- and hippocampal-ganglionic eminence assembloids to model Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy 13 (DEE-13), a condition arising from gain-of-function mutations in the SCN8A gene. While cortical assembloids showed network hyperexcitability akin to epileptogenic tissue, hippocampal assembloids did not, and instead displayed network dysregulation patterns similar to in vivo hippocampal recordings from epilepsy patients. Predictive computational modeling, immunohistochemistry, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed changes in excitatory and inhibitory neuron organization that were specific to hippocampal assembloids. These findings highlight the unique impacts of a single pathogenic variant across brain regions and establish hippocampal assembloids as a platform for studying neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Brain-wide mapping of oligodendrocyte organization and oligodendrogenesis across the murine lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Insulating sheaths of myelin accelerate neuronal signaling in complex networks of the mammalian brain. In the CNS, myelin sheaths are exclusively produced by oligodendrocytes, which continue to be generated throughout life to change patterns of myelination. However, a brain-wide analysis of oligodendrocyte dynamics across the lifespan has not been performed. We developed a rapid, robust cellular mapping pipeline involving tissue clearing, lightsheet microscopy, atlas alignment, and automated segmentation to define the location of all oligodendrocytes in the mouse brain. This analysis demonstrated the remarkable consistency of oligodendrocyte patterns between hemispheres, individuals, and sexes, and established that oligodendrocyte maps estimate myelin coverage. We trained a vision transformer to identify newly generated oligodendrocytes from millions of mature cells, highlighting age- and region-specific differences in oligodendrogenesis, and revealing areas of enhanced oligodendrocyte resilience and regenerative capacity following demyelination, demonstrating the utility of this pipeline for uncovering brain-wide oligodendrocyte dynamics in health and disease.

                The study of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly tauopathies like Pick's disease (PiD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), offers insights into the underlying regulatory mechanisms. By investigating epigenomic variations in these conditions, we identified critical regulatory changes driving disease progression, revealing potential therapeutic targets. Our comparative analyses uncovered disease-enriched non-coding regions and genome-wide transcription factor (TF) binding differences, linking them to target genes. Notably, we identified a distal human-gained enhancer (HGE) associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase (UBE3A), highlighting disease-specific regulatory alterations. Additionally, fine-mapping of AD risk genes uncovered loci enriched in microglial enhancers and accessible in other cell types. Shared and distinct TF binding patterns were observed in neurons and glial cells across PiD and AD. We validated our findings using CRISPR to excise a predicted enhancer region in UBE3A and developed an interactive database (http://swaruplab.bio.uci.edu/scROAD) to visualize predicted single-cell TF occupancy and regulatory networks.

                Many animal species use olfaction to extract information about objects in their environment. Yet, the specific molecular signature that any given object emits varies due to various factors. Here, we detail why such variability makes chemosensory-mediated object recognition such a hard problem, and we propose that a major function of the elaborate chemosensory network is to overcome it. We describe previous work addressing different elements of the problem and outline future research directions that we consider essential for a full understanding of object-oriented olfaction. In particular, we call for extensive representation of olfactory object variability in chemical, behavioral, and electrophysiological analyses. While written with an emphasis on macrosmatic mammalian species, our arguments apply to all organisms that employ chemosensation to navigate complex environments.

	<p>Objective: This meta-analysis with a systematic review was undertaken to assess the association between APOE allelic genotypes and the risk of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) in the Italian population. Methods: The Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases were searched until 15 November 2023. The odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed and random effect models, depending on the I2 statistic value. The systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in agreement with the PRISMA guideline and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023492580). Results: Our meta-analysis based on 15 studies revealed a higher risk of AD among Italian individuals carrying the APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4 allele (OR = 3.60, 95% CI [2.90&amp;amp;ndash;4.47], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). The association of AD genotype APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;2&amp;amp;epsilon;4 (OR = 1.36, 95% CI [0.76&amp;amp;ndash;2.41], p = 0.29) was not statistically significant, while APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;3&amp;amp;epsilon;4 (OR = 3.43, 95% CI [2.95&amp;amp;ndash;3.99], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) has a high risk of AD development; the risk is more notably in the APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4&amp;amp;epsilon;4 genotype (OR = 7.08, 95% CI [4.22&amp;amp;ndash;11.86], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). The APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;2 allele has a protective effect (APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;2 (OR = 0.47, 95% CI [0.29&amp;amp;ndash;0.74], p = 0.0013)), and similar results were achieved by APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;3 (OR&amp;amp;thinsp; = &amp;amp;thinsp;0.49, 95% CI [0.37&amp;amp;ndash;0.65], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Subgroup analysis of three areas of Italy (southern, northern, and center) revealed that that APOE&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;epsilon;4 allele was a risk factor with a higher OR in northern Italy (OR 4.22; 95% CI [3.46&amp;amp;ndash;5.16], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) compared to southern and center Italy (OR 3.02; 95% CI [2.28&amp;amp;ndash;4.01], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001 and OR 3.97; 95% CI [1.37&amp;amp;ndash;11.56], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001, respectively). As well, APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4&amp;amp;epsilon;4 genotype carriers had a significantly higher OR in northern Italy (OR 9.69; 95% CI [4.94&amp;amp;ndash;18.99], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) compared to in southern and center Italy (OR 4.38; 95% CI [1.54&amp;amp;ndash;12.47], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001 and OR 3.59; 95% CI [0.87&amp;amp;ndash;14.86], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001, respectively). Conclusions: This systematic review with a meta-analysis of the Italian population on APOE alleles, genotyping, and AD incidence, highlights that individuals harboring APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4 have a higher risk of developing AD compared to those with other alleles. It also supports the protective effect of the APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;2 allele against the progress of AD. The qualitative analysis on the complex genetic interactions influencing Alzheimer risk emphasizes the need for further research on genetic and environmental factors for effective prevention strategies.</p>

	<p>In this narrative review, we explore the latest evidence on semantic interventions for older adults, including both prevention and rehabilitation/remediation efforts, discussing them particularly in the context of dementia. Cognitive interventions vary in their level of structure, encompassing standardized (task-focused tasks) and unstandardized tasks (person-centered tasks). These interventions also differ in their target: rehabilitation or prevention. Addressing semantic knowledge/semantic memory/semantics is important, primarily because its efficiency impacts other cognitive domains. Semantic tasks are commonly included in preventive and rehabilitation programs, typically as standardized tasks with pre-defined semantic referents. On the other hand, person-centered approaches introduce personally relevant semantics, allowing patients to share thoughts and experiences with expressive language. Although these approaches offer benefits beyond cognitive improvement, their lack of structure may pose challenges. Our question club (CQ) program blends structured activities with personally relevant semantics, aiming to harness the advantages of both methods. Additionally, in this narrative review, we discuss future challenges and directions in the field of semantic interventions.</p>

                Background Insufficient awareness of foot self-care among diabetic individuals results in diabetic foot ulcers. The management of diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers demands a well-coordinated approach that involves multiple healthcare providers (HCPs). The present study aims to develop and validate an interprofessional collaborative (IPC) educational program involving HCPs to efficiently oversee and instruct the public on appropriate strategies for self-managing diabetic foot health. Methods The research group worked on creating an educational module titled ‘An Interprofessional Collaborative Educational Module on Self-Management of Foot for Individuals with Type II Diabetes Mellitus.’ The objective of this module was to promote the adoption of proper practices in self-managing foot health for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A panel of 13 experts participated in a two-stage validation process using the Delphi method to assess the module and its educational resources. Subsequently, the module was tested on a group of 30 participants, i.e., individuals with diabetes, with its efficacy evaluated through conversation analysis and in-depth interviews. Results The three-month-long module included three sessions • 1: Diabetes and its health implications • 2: Diabetic foot and self-management • 3: Interprofessional education in diabetic foot care The mode of content delivery was via Whatsapp, and the educational resources, in the form of pamphlets, flowcharts, handouts, case-based cartoons, and videos on diabetes, including diabetic foot, its risks, and self-management, were shared regularly. All participating experts consensually validated the module and educational resources. Analysis of in-depth interviews revealed that the module immensely benefitted the participants and helped them improve their knowledge and practices of foot care in diabetes. Conclusions The study concludes that IPC educational modules can enhance adherence to proper diabetic foot care practices, potentially reducing the occurrence of foot ulcers and amputations, and ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals with diabetes.

                Background An entrepreneurial mindset is widely recognized as crucial for success in today’s fast-paced competitive world. People across various sectors—businesses, schools, politics, the military, and the public— benefit from a developed entrepreneurial mindset. Consequently, an accurate entrepreneurial mind-sets is becoming increasingly vital. This systematic literature review comprehensively analyzed the research on methods used to assess entrepreneurial mindsets. This inquiry was explored in terms of the fundamental characteristics of the reviewed documents, common entrepreneurial mindset traits or skills, evidence of validity and reliability, research methods employed, study participants, focus areas, and key findings from recent studies. Methods A systematic literature review using the PRISMA framework was utilized, and 39 documents published in the period 2015–2024 were extracted from the EBSCO, ERIC, and SCOPUS databases. Results Researchers from the USA dominated the field of this study. These assessment practices mainly target the educational sector, especially engineering education, where students are the primary participants. Currently, researchers are actively creating new assessment tools for entrepreneurial mind-sets tailored to students in entrepreneurial programs at engineering institutions. Most of these tools have been shown to be valid and reliable. The KEEN 3C framework is the most common assessment tool, emphasizing curiosity (CU), connections (CON), and creating value (CV). Conclusions This study makes significant contributions by compiling the existing literature on entrepreneurial mindset assessment, which presents the most up-to-date knowledge in the field. Educational institutions and business organizations can utilize the entrepreneurial mind-set assessment approaches highlighted in this review. This article is unique in that it enhances the field of entrepreneurship by presenting a new systematic literature review of entrepreneurial mindset assessment approaches.

                Background Piezoceramic materials have unique property which enables direct and bilateral conversion between mechanical and electrical energy. This ability facilitates significant miniaturisation of technology and opens many opportunities in design of new actuators and energy harvesters. Mathematical modelling of piezoelectric modules is notoriously hard due to complex constitutive equations defining mechanical and electrical energy conversion. Methods The article presents research on a new synthesis method based on the Cauer’s method. Mechanical damping is introduced with the use of Rayleigh’s approximation. A discrete electromechanical model is formed based on the Mason’s piezoelectric model. The proposed approach allows modelling of piezoelectric systems based on a set of characteristic frequencies. The method allows a more general approach to the problem of modelling new systems, as opposed to application-oriented methods seen in literature. A non-standard model analysis method using edge graphs and structural numbers is also verified as a potential alternative for matrix-based method. The authors compare their precision and computation requirements. Results The structural method of mechanical model analysis gave identical results as the reference matrix method. However, the non-classical algorithm took much longer to calculate and was using more memory. The electromechanical model analysis has shown an error of 5% in comparison to resonance frequencies taken from a reference plate specification. The calculated magnitude of displacement was well above the capability of a 3.5mm thick piezoelectric plate. Conclusions The synthesis method presented in this paper allows synthesizing piezoelectric cascade models based on limited information in form of characteristic frequencies. Currently this method allows a coarse approximation of the real piezoelectric parameters with limited number of inputs. The additional method of analysis based on structural numbers offers a promising alternative to matrix calculations but requires a more thorough investigation of the computational power required to determine whether it can compete with existing algorithms.

                Abstract Background Melanoma, an aggressive malignant skin cancer, has the ability to spread both locoregionally and to distant sites. The risk of metastasis is correlated to invasion depth and the presence of ulceration. Although gastrointestinal (GI) metastases are uncommon, gastric involvement is particularly rare. Case presentation We report a case of a 62-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain, dyspepsia, anorexia, and weight loss. On physical examination abdominal masses and hepatomegaly were detected. Radiological imaging showed widespread masses in the abdominal and thoracic regions. Upper GI endoscopy identified an umbilicated protruded lesion with central dark pigmentation at the antro-fundic junction. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with melanoma. A subsequent rigorous skin examination uncovered a primary malignant skin melanoma. Due to worsening general condition, the patient received palliative hospice care. Conclusion This report highlights the critical need for vigilant skin examination when encountering gastric lesions with dark pigmentation, which led to the identification of initially undetected cutaneous melanoma.

                Background Education for diabetes patients is not managed well by diabetes nurse educators because the competency of diabetes nurse educators is low, and the number of diabetes nurse educators in hospitals is not commensurate with the number of diabetes patients, which is much larger. Methods This qualitative phenomenological research uses an exploratory design. Twenty nurse managers and forty staff nurses who participated in the focus group discussion (FGD) were selected using purposive sampling. Nine staff nurses who participated in in-depth interviews were selected using the snowball method. The results of the FGD exploration and in-depth interviews produced components for developing an educational model with a management approach. The development of this educational model uses an input, process, output, and outcome approach. The input uses King’s conceptual framework approach, the method uses the theory of goal attainment and management functions, the output is the competency of nurses to educate diabetes patients, and the outcome is the health literacy of diabetes patients. This educational model was reviewed by three experts: a nursing management expert, a diabetes mellitus expert, and a health literacy expert. Results The educational model for Diabetes nurse educators with a management approach consists of five stages: 1) Educational planning includes identifying educational targets, strategy formulation, and situation analysis. 2) Organizing nursing resources includes strengthening the role of nurses as diabetes educators. 3) Nursing staff includes intraprofessional collaboration and collaboration between nurses and patient families. 4) Direction includes nurses’ motivation for diabetes patients and respecting the culture and values of diabetes patients. 5) Control includes evaluating nurse education for diabetes patients. Conclusion This education model has five competencies, which are structured and systematic so that diabetes nurse educators have the competence to manage diabetes patient education: the personal system, interpersonal system, and social system influence nurse competency.

                Background Muscarinic receptor agonism is a promising mechanism of action for treating psychosis, not present in most D2R-blocking antipsychotics. Xanomeline, an M1/M4-preferring agonist, has shown efficacy in late-stage clinical trials, with more compounds being investigated. Therefore, we aim to synthesize evidence on the preclinical efficacy of muscarinic receptor agonists in animal models of psychosis to provide unique insights and evidence-based information to guide drug development. Methods We plan a systematic review and meta-analysis of in vivo animal studies comparing muscarinic receptor agonists or positive allosteric modulators with control conditions and existing D2R-blocking antipsychotics in animals subjected to any method that induces behavioural changes of relevance for psychosis. We will identify eligible studies by searching multiple electronic databases. At least two independent reviewers will conduct the study selection and data extraction using prespecified forms and assess the risk of bias with the SYRCLE’s tool. Our primary outcomes include locomotor activity and prepulse inhibition measured with standardized mean differences. We will examine other behavioural readouts of relevance for psychosis as secondary outcomes, such as social interaction and cognitive function. We will synthesize the data using multi-level meta-analysis with a predefined random-effects structure, considering the non-independence of the data. In meta-regressions we will explore potential sources of heterogeneity from a predefined list of characteristics of the animal population, model, and intervention. We will assess the confidence in the evidence considering a self-developed instrument thatconsiders the internal and external validity of the evidence.

                Background Patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) frequently present with kinesiophobia. Although kinesiophobia is found to affect outcomes such as affect pain and quality of life in patients with CLBP, it is unclear whether kinesiophobia is linked to reduction of muscle endurance in these patients. The primary aim of the study was to analyze the impact of kinesiophobia on lumbar extensor endurance in patients with CLBP and asymptomatic individuals. Methods This case-control study was proceeded with 200 patients with CLBP and 400 controls. Kinesiophobia, lumbar endurance and Pain intensity were assessed with Tampa Scale, Soren’s lumbar extensor test and visual analog scale respectively. Regression model was administered to explore the relationship between kinesiophobia and lumbar extensor endurance. Results Prevalence of kinesiophobia was found to be higher in patients with CLBP (30%) than in controls (11%) which is (6.49 ± 0.52, d= 1.07) more in CLBP than controls. Lumbar endurance was significantly lower in CLBP than controls (-20.5±6.84), further affected by the presence of kinesiophobia as lumbar endurance was negatively correlated (r = - 0.09) to Kinesiophobia. Moreover, VAS (r = 0.2) was positively correlated with kinesiophobia in patients with CLBP. Discussion and conclusion A high prevalence of kinesiophobia was reported by patients with CLBP. The presence of kinesiophobia exhibited strong linear relationship with lumbar endurance, and pain intensity among patients with CLBP. Hence management of CLBP should comprise of an assessment of kinesiophobia and appropriate treatment strategies to address it in preventing persistent CLBP.

                Background Dietary habits play a significant role in health and well-being. Nutritional knowledge can influence dietary habits. This study investigated the level of nutrition knowledge and factors affecting nutrition knowledge among student migrants in the West Midlands of the United Kingdom. Method Data were collected from 372 participants using the General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire (GNKQ). The effects of gender, length of UK residency, program and level of study, marital status, and history of diet-related diseases on nutrition knowledge were assessed. Results The students generally demonstrated good nutrition knowledge. The overall mean score was 52.3 ± 2.4, and the median score was 54. Mean scores for dietary recommendations (11.9±0.4, 348 participants), food classification (21.3±1.0, 264 participants) and diet-related diseases/weight management (13.2±0.6, 324 participants) are indicative of good nutrition knowledge. Poor knowledge of food choices was observed (5.9±0.4, 156 participants). Females, postgraduates, and married students, as well as those with ≤3 years of UK residency, had higher mean scores compared to those in the opposite groups. BMI and a history of diet-related diseases did not significantly affect nutritional knowledge. Conclusion Gender, level and type of study, marital status, and length of stay in the UK were predictors of good nutrition knowledge. Interventions to improve the knowledge of food choices among student migrants are needed.

                <p>by Eslam Abousamra, Marlin Figgins, Trevor Bedford</p>

Genomic surveillance of pathogen evolution is essential for public health response, treatment strategies, and vaccine development. In the context of SARS-COV-2, multiple models have been developed including Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) describing variant frequency growth as well as Fixed Growth Advantage (FGA), Growth Advantage Random Walk (GARW) and Piantham parameterizations describing variant <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>. These models provide estimates of variant fitness and can be used to forecast changes in variant frequency. We introduce a framework for evaluating real-time forecasts of variant frequencies, and apply this framework to the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during 2022 in which multiple new viral variants emerged and rapidly spread through the population. We compare models across representative countries with different intensities of genomic surveillance. Retrospective assessment of model accuracy highlights that most models of variant frequency perform well and are able to produce reasonable forecasts. We find that the simple MLR model provides ∼0.6% median absolute error and ∼6% mean absolute error when forecasting 30 days out for countries with robust genomic surveillance. We investigate impacts of sequence quantity and quality across countries on forecast accuracy and conduct systematic downsampling to identify that 1000 sequences per week is fully sufficient for accurate short-term forecasts. We conclude that fitness models represent a useful prognostic tool for short-term evolutionary forecasting.

                <p>by Aakash Agrawal, Stanislas Dehaene</p>

Learning to read places a strong challenge on the visual system. Years of expertise lead to a remarkable capacity to separate similar letters and encode their relative positions, thus distinguishing words such as FORM and FROM, invariantly over a large range of positions, sizes and fonts. How neural circuits achieve invariant word recognition remains unknown. Here, we address this issue by recycling deep neural network models initially trained for image recognition. We retrain them to recognize written words and then analyze how reading-specialized units emerge and operate across the successive layers. With literacy, a small subset of units becomes specialized for word recognition in the learned script, similar to the visual word form area (VWFA) in the human brain. We show that these units are sensitive to specific letter identities and their ordinal position from the left or the right of a word. The transition from retinotopic to ordinal position coding is achieved by a hierarchy of “space bigram” unit that detect the position of a letter relative to a blank space and that pool across low- and high-frequency-sensitive units from early layers of the network. The proposed scheme provides a plausible neural code for written words in the VWFA, and leads to predictions for reading behavior, error patterns, and the neurophysiology of reading.

                <p>by Alia Abbara, Lisa Pagani, Celia García-Pareja, Anne-Florence Bitbol</p>

In nature, most microbial populations have complex spatial structures that can affect their evolution. Evolutionary graph theory predicts that some spatial structures modelled by placing individuals on the nodes of a graph affect the probability that a mutant will fix. Evolution experiments are beginning to explicitly address the impact of graph structures on mutant fixation. However, the assumptions of evolutionary graph theory differ from the conditions of modern evolution experiments, making the comparison between theory and experiment challenging. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by using our new model of spatially structured populations. This model considers connected subpopulations that lie on the nodes of a graph, and allows asymmetric migrations. It can handle large populations, and explicitly models serial passage events with migrations, thus closely mimicking experimental conditions. We analyze recent experiments in light of this model. We suggest useful parameter regimes for future experiments, and we make quantitative predictions for these experiments. In particular, we propose experiments to directly test our recent prediction that the star graph with asymmetric migrations suppresses natural selection and can accelerate mutant fixation or extinction, compared to a well-mixed population.

                <p>by Breanne Sparta, Timothy Hamilton, Gunalan Natesan, Samuel D. Aragones, Eric J. Deeds</p>

Effective analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data requires a rigorous distinction between technical noise and biological variation. In this work, we propose a simple feature selection model, termed “Differentially Distributed Genes” or DDGs, where a binomial sampling process for each mRNA species produces a null model of technical variation. Using scRNA-seq data where cell identities have been established <i>a priori</i>, we find that the DDG model of biological variation outperforms existing methods. We demonstrate that DDGs distinguish a validated set of real biologically varying genes, minimize neighborhood distortion, and enable accurate partitioning of cells into their established cell-type groups.

                <p>by Joseph Shingleton, David Mustard, Steven Dyke, Hannah Williams, Emma Bennett, Thomas Finnie</p>

Reverse epidemiology is a mathematical modelling tool used to ascertain information about the source of a pathogen, given the spatial and temporal distribution of cases, hospitalisations and deaths. In the context of a deliberately released pathogen, such as <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> (the disease-causing organism of anthrax), this can allow responders to quickly identify the location and timing of the release, as well as other factors such as the strength of the release, and the realized wind speed and direction at release. These estimates can then be used to parameterise a predictive mechanistic model, allowing for estimation of the potential scale of the release, and to optimise the distribution of prophylaxis.
In this paper we present two novel approaches to reverse epidemiology, and demonstrate their utility in responding to a simulated deliberate release of <i>B. anthracis</i> in ten locations in the UK and compare these to the standard grid-search approach. The two methods—a modified MCMC and a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network—are able to identify the source location and timing of the release with significantly better accuracy compared to the grid-search approach. Further, the neural network method is able to do inference on new data significantly quicker than either the grid-search or novel MCMC methods, allowing for rapid deployment in time-sensitive outbreaks.

Modular organization at approximately 1 mm scale could be fundamental to cortical processing, but its presence in human association cortex is unknown. Using custom-built, high-density electrode arrays placed on the cortical surface of 7 patients undergoing awake craniotomy for tumor excision, we investigated receptive speech processing in the left (dominant) human posterior superior temporal gyrus. Responses to consonant-vowel syllables and noise-vocoded controls recorded with 1,024 channel micro-grids at 200 μm pitch demonstrated roughly circular domains approximately 1.7 mm in diameter, with sharp boundaries observed in 128 channel linear arrays at 50 μm pitch, possibly consistent with a columnar organization. Peak latencies to syllables in different modules were bimodally distributed centered at 252 and 386 ms. Adjacent modules were sharply delineated from each other by their distinct time courses and stimulus selectivity. We suggest that receptive language cortex may be organized in discrete processing modules.

Transitions between the fed and fasted state are common in mammals. The liver orchestrates adaptive responses to feeding/fasting by transcriptionally regulating metabolic pathways of energy usage and storage. Transcriptional and enhancer dynamics following cessation of fasting (refeeding) have not been explored. We examined the transcriptional and chromatin events occurring upon refeeding in mice, including kinetic behavior and molecular drivers. We found that the refeeding response is temporally organized with the early response focused on ramping up protein translation while the later stages of refeeding drive a bifurcated lipid synthesis program. While both the cholesterol biosynthesis and lipogenesis pathways were inhibited during fasting, most cholesterol biosynthesis genes returned to their basal levels upon refeeding while most lipogenesis genes markedly overshoot above pre-fasting levels. Gene knockout, enhancer dynamics, and ChIP-seq analyses revealed that lipogenic gene overshoot is dictated by LXRα. These findings from unbiased analyses unravel the mechanism behind the long-known phenomenon of refeeding fat overshoot.

                Kushinsky et al. demonstrate that the appearance of daylight induces, in visual cortex excitatory neurons, gene expression as well as rapid increases in E/I ratio and neural activity that are subsequently normalized. The light-induced transcription factor NPAS4 drives this daily downward firing rate homeostasis by promoting inhibitory inputs to stabilize visual processing.

                Horizontal cortical networks preferentially connect neurons with shared tuning preferences. Davis et al. demonstrate that this connectivity generates activity motifs that reflect shared excitability among like-tuned neurons. When a particular motif is present, targets that match the preference of those neurons yield stronger responses and are more detectable perceptually.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87335">The protein domains of vertebrate species in which selection is more effective have greater intrinsic structural disorder</a></h4>

              
                The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution posits variation among species in the effectiveness of selection. In an idealized model, the census population size determines both this minimum magnitude of the selection coefficient required for deleterious variants to be reliably purged, and the amount of neutral diversity. Empirically, an ‘effective population size’ is often estimated from the amount of putatively neutral genetic diversity and is assumed to also capture a species’ effectiveness of selection. A potentially more direct measure of the effectiveness of selection is the degree to which selection maintains preferred codons. However, past metrics that compare codon bias across species are confounded by among-species variation in %GC content and/or amino acid composition. Here, we propose a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species (CAIS), based on Kullback–Leibler divergence, that corrects for both confounders. We demonstrate the use of CAIS correlations, as well as the Effective Number of Codons, to show that the protein domains of more highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher intrinsic structural disorder.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90082">Using recurrent neural network to estimate irreducible stochasticity in human choice behavior</a></h4>

              
                Theoretical computational models are widely used to describe latent cognitive processes. However, these models do not equally explain data across participants, with some individuals showing a bigger predictive gap than others. In the current study, we examined the use of theory-independent models, specifically recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to classify the source of a predictive gap in the observed data of a single individual. This approach aims to identify whether the low predictability of behavioral data is mainly due to noisy decision-making or misspecification of the theoretical model. First, we used computer simulation in the context of reinforcement learning to demonstrate that RNNs can be used to identify model misspecification in simulated agents with varying degrees of behavioral noise. Specifically, both prediction performance and the number of RNN training epochs (i.e., the point of early stopping) can be used to estimate the amount of stochasticity in the data. Second, we applied our approach to an empirical dataset where the actions of low IQ participants, compared with high IQ participants, showed lower predictability by a well-known theoretical model (i.e., Daw’s hybrid model for the two-step task). Both the predictive gap and the point of early stopping of the RNN suggested that model misspecification is similar across individuals. This led us to a provisional conclusion that low IQ subjects are mostly noisier compared to their high IQ peers, rather than being more misspecified by the theoretical model. We discuss the implications and limitations of this approach, considering the growing literature in both theoretical and data-driven computational modeling in decision-making science.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99702">Empowering AlphaFold2 for protein conformation selective drug discovery with AlphaFold2-RAVE</a></h4>

              
                Small-molecule drug design hinges on obtaining co-crystallized ligand-protein structures. Despite AlphaFold2’s strides in protein native structure prediction, its focus on apo structures overlooks ligands and associated holo structures. Moreover, designing selective drugs often benefits from the targeting of diverse metastable conformations. Therefore, direct application of AlphaFold2 models in virtual screening and drug discovery remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate an AlphaFold2-based framework combined with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and Induced Fit docking, named AF2RAVE-Glide, to conduct computational model-based small-molecule binding of metastable protein kinase conformations, initiated from protein sequences. We demonstrate the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow on three different mammalian protein kinases and their type I and II inhibitors, with special emphasis on binding of known type II kinase inhibitors which target the metastable classical DFG-out state. These states are not easy to sample from AlphaFold2. Here, we demonstrate how with AF2RAVE these metastable conformations can be sampled for different kinases with high enough accuracy to enable subsequent docking of known type II kinase inhibitors with more than 50% success rates across docking calculations. We believe the protocol should be deployable for other kinases and more proteins generally.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92545">The function of juvenile–adult transition axis in female sexual receptivity of Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Female sexual receptivity is essential for reproduction of a species. Neuropeptides play the main role in regulating female receptivity. However, whether neuropeptides regulate female sexual receptivity during the neurodevelopment is unknown. Here, we found the peptide hormone prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), which belongs to the insect PG (prothoracic gland) axis, negatively regulated virgin female receptivity through ecdysone during neurodevelopment in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We identified PTTH neurons as doublesex-positive neurons, they regulated virgin female receptivity before the metamorphosis during the third-instar larval stage. PTTH deletion resulted in the increased EcR-A expression in the whole newly formed prepupae. Furthermore, the ecdysone receptor EcR-A in pC1 neurons positively regulated virgin female receptivity during metamorphosis. The decreased EcR-A in pC1 neurons induced abnormal morphological development of pC1 neurons without changing neural activity. Among all subtypes of pC1 neurons, the function of EcR-A in pC1b neurons was necessary for virgin female copulation rate. These suggested that the changes of synaptic connections between pC1b and other neurons decreased female copulation rate. Moreover, female receptivity significantly decreased when the expression of PTTH receptor Torso was reduced in pC1 neurons. This suggested that PTTH not only regulates female receptivity through ecdysone but also through affecting female receptivity associated neurons directly. The PG axis has similar functional strategy as the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis in mammals to trigger the juvenile–adult transition. Our work suggests a general mechanism underlying which the neurodevelopment during maturation regulates female sexual receptivity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92135">Early moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and maternal diet impact offspring DNA methylation across species</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol consumption in pregnancy can affect genome regulation in the developing offspring but results have been contradictory. We employed a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) resembling common patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy in humans. Early moderate PAE was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in newborn pups without altering behavioural outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with some perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding genomic regions with regulatory potential indicative of broad effects of alcohol on genome regulation. Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder suggested some effects were metastable at genes linked to disease-relevant traits including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. In our murine model, a maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some of the damaging effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation. Our studies demonstrate that early moderate exposure is sufficient to affect fetal genome regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes and highlight a role for preventative maternal dietary interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91605">Novel cyclic homogeneous oscillation detection method for high accuracy and specific characterization of neural dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Determining the presence and frequency of neural oscillations is essential to understanding dynamic brain function. Traditional methods that detect peaks over 1/<i>f</i> noise within the power spectrum fail to distinguish between the fundamental frequency and harmonics of often highly non-sinusoidal neural oscillations. To overcome this limitation, we define fundamental criteria that characterize neural oscillations and introduce the cyclic homogeneous oscillation (CHO) detection method. We implemented these criteria based on an autocorrelation approach to determine an oscillation’s fundamental frequency. We evaluated CHO by verifying its performance on simulated non-sinusoidal oscillatory bursts and validated its ability to determine the fundamental frequency of neural oscillations in electrocorticographic (ECoG), electroencephalographic (EEG), and stereoelectroencephalographic (SEEG) signals recorded from 27 human subjects. Our results demonstrate that CHO outperforms conventional techniques in accurately detecting oscillations. In summary, CHO demonstrates high precision and specificity in detecting neural oscillations in time and frequency domains. The method’s specificity enables the detailed study of non-sinusoidal characteristics of oscillations, such as the degree of asymmetry and waveform of an oscillation. Furthermore, CHO can be applied to identify how neural oscillations govern interactions throughout the brain and to determine oscillatory biomarkers that index abnormal brain function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93146">Reversions mask the contribution of adaptive evolution in microbiomes</a></h4>

              
                When examining bacterial genomes for evidence of past selection, the results depend heavily on the mutational distance between chosen genomes. Even within a bacterial species, genomes separated by larger mutational distances exhibit stronger evidence of purifying selection as assessed by d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub>, the normalized ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations. Here, we show that the classical interpretation of this scale dependence, weak purifying selection, leads to problematic mutation accumulation when applied to available gut microbiome data. We propose an alternative, adaptive reversion model with opposite implications for dynamical intuition and applications of d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub>. Reversions that occur and sweep within-host populations are nearly guaranteed in microbiomes due to large population sizes, short generation times, and variable environments. Using analytical and simulation approaches, we show that adaptive reversion can explain the d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub> decay given only dozens of locally fluctuating selective pressures, which is realistic in the context of <i>Bacteroides</i> genomes. The success of the adaptive reversion model argues for interpreting low values of d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub> obtained from long timescales with caution as they may emerge even when adaptive sweeps are frequent. Our work thus inverts the interpretation of an old observation in bacterial evolution, illustrates the potential of mutational reversions to shape genomic landscapes over time, and highlights the importance of studying bacterial genomic evolution on short timescales.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95494">ImmCellTyper facilitates systematic mass cytometry data analysis for deep immune profiling</a></h4>

              
                Mass cytometry is a cutting-edge high-dimensional technology for profiling marker expression at the single-cell level, advancing clinical research in immune monitoring. Nevertheless, the vast data generated by cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) poses a significant analytical challenge. To address this, we describe ImmCellTyper (<a href="https://github.com/JingAnyaSun/ImmCellTyper">https://github.com/JingAnyaSun/ImmCellTyper</a>), a novel toolkit for CyTOF data analysis. This framework incorporates BinaryClust, an in-house developed semi-supervised clustering tool that automatically identifies main cell types. BinaryClust outperforms existing clustering tools in accuracy and speed, as shown in benchmarks with two datasets of approximately 4 million cells, matching the precision of manual gating by human experts. Furthermore, ImmCellTyper offers various visualisation and analytical tools, spanning from quality control to differential analysis, tailored to users’ specific needs for a comprehensive CyTOF data analysis solution. The workflow includes five key steps: (1) batch effect evaluation and correction, (2) data quality control and pre-processing, (3) main cell lineage characterisation and quantification, (4) in-depth investigation of specific cell types; and (5) differential analysis of cell abundance and functional marker expression across study groups. Overall, ImmCellTyper combines expert biological knowledge in a semi-supervised approach to accurately deconvolute well-defined main cell lineages, while maintaining the potential of unsupervised methods to discover novel cell subsets, thus facilitating high-dimensional immune profiling.

	<p>A major scientific objective of cognitive neuroscience is to define cortico-cortical functional connections supporting cognitive functions. Here, we use an original approach combining frequency-tagging and direct electrical stimulation (DES) to test for bidirectional and cross-hemispheric category-specific modulations within the human cortical face network. A unique patient bilaterally implanted with depth electrodes in multiple face-selective cortical regions of the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC) was shown 70 s sequences of variable natural object images at a 6 Hz rate, objectively identifying deviant face-selective neural activity at 1.2 Hz (i.e., every five images). Concurrent electrical stimulation was separately applied for 10 seconds on four independently defined face-selective sites in the right and left VOTC. Upon stimulation, we observed reduced or even abolished face-selective neural activity locally and, most interestingly, at distant VOTC recording sites. Remote DES effects were found up to the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in both forward and backward directions along the VOTC, as well as across the two hemispheres. This reduction was specific to face-selective neural activity, with the general 6 Hz visual response being mostly unaffected. Overall, these results shed light on the functional connectivity of the cortical face-selective network, supporting its non-hierarchical organization as well as bidirectional effective category-selective connections between posterior &amp;amp;lsquo;core&amp;amp;rsquo; regions and the ATL. They also pave the way for widespread and systematic development of this approach to better understand the functional and effective connectivity of human brain networks.</p>

	<p>Medulloblastoma, a malignant brain tumor primarily affecting children, poses significant challenges to patients and clinicians due to its complex treatment and potential long-term cognitive consequences. While recent advancements in treatment have significantly improved survival rates, survivors often face cognitive impairments, particularly in reading, impacting their quality of life. According to the double deficit theory, reading impairments are caused by deficits in one or both of two independent reading-related functions: phonological awareness and rapid visual naming. This longitudinal study investigates neurofunctional changes related to reading in medulloblastoma survivors in comparison to controls using functional MRI acquired during rapid automatized naming tasks over three annual visits. Support vector machine classification of functional MRI data reveals a progressive divergence in brain activity patterns between medulloblastoma survivors and healthy controls over time, suggesting delayed effects of cancer treatment on brain function. Alterations in brain regions involved in visual processing and orthographic recognition during rapid naming tasks imply disruptions in the ventral visual pathway associated with normal orthographic processing. These alterations are correlated with performance in tasks involving sound awareness, reading fluency, and word attack. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of post-treatment neurofunctional alterations and the importance of early identification and intervention to address cognitive deficits in survivors.</p>

	<p>Members of three generations of a Norwegian family (N = 9) with a rare demyelinating disease were studied. Neuropsychological testing was performed using the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Wechsler Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R). EEGs were recorded with grand averaging spectrograms and event-related potentials (ERPs) in rest and cued GO/NOGO task conditions. The results were within the normal range on the MMSE. Full-scale WAIS-III results were in the range of 69&amp;amp;ndash;113, with lower scores in verbal understanding than in perceptual organization, and low scores also in indications of working memory and processing speed difficulties. The HVLT-R showed impairment of both immediate and delayed recall. Quantitative EEG showed an increase in low alpha (around 7.5 Hz) activity in the temporofrontal areas, mostly on the left side. There was a deviation in the late (&amp;amp;gt;300 ms) component in response to the NOGO stimuli. A strong correlation (r = 0.78, p = 0.01) between the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (delayed recall) and the amplitude of the NOGO ERP component was observed. The EEG spectra showed deviations from the healthy controls, especially at frontotemporal deviations. Deviations in the ERP component of the NOGO trials were related to delayed recall in the Hopkins Verbal learning test.</p>

	<p>Gonadal steroids exert different effects on the central nervous system (CNS), such as preserving neuronal function and promoting neuronal survival. Estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone reduce neuronal loss in the CNS in animal models of neurodegeneration. However, hormone replacement therapy has been associated with higher rates of endometrial, prostate, and breast cancer. Tibolone (TIB), the metabolites of which show estrogenic and progestogenic effects, is an alternative to reduce this risk. However, the impact of TIB on memory and learning, as well as on choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) levels in the hippocampus of aging males, is unknown. We administered TIB to aged C57BL/6J male mice at different doses (0.01 or 1.0 mg/kg per day for 12 weeks) and evaluated its effects on memory and learning and the content of ChAT and TPH. We assessed memory and learning with object recognition and elevated T-maze tasks. Additionally, we determined ChAT and TPH protein levels in the hippocampus by Western blotting. TIB administration increased the percentage of time spent on the novel object in the object recognition task. In addition, the latency of leaving the enclosed arm increased in both TIB groups, suggesting an improvement in fear-based learning. We also observed decreased ChAT content in the group treated with the 0.01 mg/kg TIB dose. In the case of TPH, no changes were observed with either TIB dose. These results show that long-term TIB administration improves memory without affecting locomotor activity and modulates cholinergic but not serotonergic systems in the hippocampus of aged male mice.</p>

	<p>Extensive research has shed light on the cellular and functional underpinnings of higher cognition as influenced by the prefrontal cortex. Neurotransmitters act as key regulatory molecules within the PFC to assist with synchronizing cognitive state and arousal levels. The monoamine family of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, play multifaceted roles in the cognitive processes behind learning and memory. The present review explores the organization and signaling patterns of monoamines within the PFC, as well as elucidates the numerous roles played by monoamines in learning and higher cognitive function.</p>

	<p>Tai Chi (TC) practice has been shown to improve both cognitive and physical function in older adults. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the benefits of TC remain unclear. Our primary aims are to explore whether distinct age-related and TC-practice-related relationships can be identified with respect to either temporal or spatial (within/between-network connectivity) differences. This cross-sectional study examined recurrent neural network dynamics, employing an adaptive, data-driven thresholding approach to source-localized resting-state EEG data in order to identify meaningful connections across time-varying graphs, using both temporal and spatial features derived from a hidden Markov model (HMM). Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U tests assessed between-group differences in temporal and spatial features by age and TC practice using either healthy younger adult controls (YACs, n = 15), healthy older adult controls (OACs, n = 15), or Tai Chi older adult practitioners (TCOAs, n = 15). Our results showed that aging is associated with decreased within-network and between-network functional connectivity (FC) across most brain networks. Conversely, TC practice appears to mitigate these age-related declines, showing increased FC within and between networks in older adults who practice TC compared to non-practicing older adults. These findings suggest that TC practice may abate age-related declines in neural network efficiency and stability, highlighting its potential as a non-pharmacological intervention for promoting healthy brain aging. This study furthers the triple-network model, showing that a balancing and reorientation of attention might be engaged not only through higher-order and top-down mechanisms (i.e., FPN/DAN) but also via the coupling of bottom-up, sensory&amp;amp;ndash;motor (i.e., SMN/VIN) networks.</p>

                <p>Musicians can have better abilities to understand speech in adverse condition such as background noise than non-musicians. However, the neural mechanisms behind such enhanced behavioral performances remain largely unclear. Studies have found that the subcortical frequency-following response to the fundamental frequency of speech and its higher harmonics (speech-FFR) may be involved since it is larger in people with musical training than in those without. Recent research has shown that the speech-FFR consists of a cortical contribution in addition to the subcortical sources. Both the subcortical and the cortical contribution are modulated by selective attention to one of two competing speakers. However, it is unknown whether the strength of the cortical contribution to the speech-FFR, or its attention modulation, is influenced by musical training. Here we investigate these issues through magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of 52 subjects (18 musicians, 25 non-musicians, and 9 neutral participants) listening to two competing male speakers while selectively attending one of them. The speech-in-noise comprehension abilities of the participants were not assessed. We find that musicians and non-musicians display comparable cortical speech-FFRs and additionally exhibit similar subject-to-subject variability in the response. Furthermore, we also do not observe a difference in the modulation of the neural response through selective attention between musicians and non-musicians. Moreover, when assessing whether the cortical speech-FFRs are influenced by particular aspects of musical training, no significant effects emerged. Taken together, we did not find any effect of musical training on the cortical speech-FFR.</p>

                Background Tonsillectomy is among the standard procedures performed on the head and neck. Acute pain following tonsillectomy impairs recovery and contributes to physical discomfort. Adequate pharmacological management of post-operative pain increases the satisfaction and well-being of a patient. The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacological management of acute pain post-tonsillectomy in the otorhinolaryngology department at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) Methods A hospital-based prospective cohort study was carried out among 72 patients. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from selected patients who underwent cold tonsillectomy. Postoperative pain assessment was conducted at six, 12, and 18 hours from initiation of pharmacological management following tonsillectomy. An interviewer-administered numerical rating scale was used for assessing postoperative pain scores. Results A total of 72 patients were enrolled, of which most were female (73.6%). The majority of patients were in the age group of 8–15 years (50%). Paracetamol was the commonest analgesia prescribed (37.5%) post-tonsillectomy. The majority of patients experienced moderate pain at six- and 12-hours following tonsillectomy, 55.6% and 65.3%, respectively, whereas 88.9% of patients had mild pain at 18 hours after initial analgesic administration. Pain relief was attained by all patients aged 16–23 years (96.6%), all being female patients, and these differences were statistically insignificant. Paracetamol achieved pain reduction from moderate pain (59.3%) and severe pain (37.0%) at six hours to mild pain at 18 hours (88.9%). Conclusions Paracetamol was the commonly prescribed analgesic following tonsillectomy with majority of patients attaining moderate pain; however, there was no significant difference between the use of combined drugs and single drug use. This could be influenced by the sample size of the studied population and individual variations in pain perception.

                Background Digital elevation models (DEMs) are important in many fields, such as geomatics and water conservation in mountainous areas. Geomorphic feature lines are necessary for topography interpolation and computation from DEMs. Methods Instead of a parameter space, we propose a novel automatic extraction of geomorphic feature lines in the feature space from discrete airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data by the tensor voting method (TVM), which was originally developed for image data. A tensor field for discrete airborne LiDAR points was first established, and then, utilizing the TVM, a new geometric feature metric of data, the line feature strength, was captured. A practical line-growing method based on the local maxima line feature strength is proposed in this study. Results Compared with general line growing, which is based on a certain threshold, our line growing method is quite effective, particularly for the extraction of primary and minor ridge and valley lines in mountainous areas. Conclusions The method presented in this paper is fast and automated, and can furnish operators with a wealth of detailed information about minor line features. This enables the extraction of ridge and valley lines that are tailored to specific requirements. Undoubtedly, the method developed here can be generalized to a large amount of LiDAR data.

                SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1, otherwise known as SMOC-1, is a secreted glycoprotein involved in various cell biological processes including cell-matrix interactions, osteoblast differentiation, embryonic development, and homeostasis. SMOC-1 was found to be elevated in asymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patient cortex as well as being enriched in amyloid plaques and in AD patientcerebrospinal fluid, arguing for SMOC-1 as a promising biomarker for AD. Having access to high-quality SMOC-1 antibodies is crucial for the scientific community. It can ensure the consistency and reliability of SMOC-1 research, and further the exploration of its potential as both a therapeutic target or diagnostic marker.. In this study, we characterized seven SMOC-1 commercial antibodies for Western blot and immunoprecipitation, using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. We identified successful antibodies in the tested applications and encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.

                Background Dendritic spines are tiny protrusions found along the dendrites of neurons, and their number is a measure of the density of synaptic connections. Altered density and morphology is observed in several pathologies, and spine formation as well as morphological changes correlate with learning and memory. The detection of spines in microscopy images and the analysis of their morphology is therefore a prerequisite for many studies. We have developed a new open-source, freely available, plugin for ImageJ/FIJI, called Spot Spine, that allows detection and morphological measurements of spines in three dimensional images. Method Local maxima are detected in spine heads, and the intensity distribution around the local maximum is computed to perform the segmentation of each spine head. Spine necks are then traced from the spine head to the dendrite. Several parameters can be set to optimize detection and segmentation, and manual correction gives further control over the result of the process. Results The plugin allows the analysis of images of dendrites obtained with various labeling and imaging methods. Quantitative measurements are retrieved including spine head volume and surface, and neck length. Conclusion The plugin and instructions for use are available at https://imagej.net/plugins/spot-spine.

                <p>by Kirstin I. Oliveira Roster, Stephen M. Kissler, Enoma Omoregie, Jade C. Wang, Helly Amin, Steve Di Lonardo, Scott Hughes, Yonatan H. Grad</p>

Surveillance systems that monitor pathogen genome sequences are critical for rapidly detecting the introduction and emergence of pathogen variants. To evaluate how interactions between surveillance capacity, variant properties, and the epidemiological context influence the timeliness of pathogen variant detection, we developed a geographically explicit stochastic compartmental model to simulate the transmission of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant in New York City. We measured the impact of (1) testing and sequencing volume, (2) geographic targeting of testing, (3) the timing and location of variant emergence, and (4) the relative variant transmissibility on detection speed and on the undetected disease burden. Improvements in detection times and reduction of undetected infections were driven primarily by increases in the number of sequenced samples. The relative transmissibility of the new variant and the epidemic context of variant emergence also influenced detection times, showing that individual surveillance strategies can result in a wide range of detection outcomes, depending on the underlying dynamics of the circulating variants. These findings help contextualize the design, interpretation, and trade-offs of genomic surveillance strategies of pandemic respiratory pathogens.

Spatial transcriptome technology can parse transcriptomic data at the spatial level to detect high-throughput gene expression and preserve information regarding the spatial structure of tissues. Identifying spatial domains, that is identifying regions with similarities in gene expression and histology, is the most basic and critical aspect of spatial transcriptome data analysis. Most current methods identify spatial domains only through a single view, which may obscure certain important information and thus fail to make full use of the information embedded in spatial transcriptome data. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised clustering framework based on multiview graph convolutional networks (MVST) to achieve accurate spatial domain recognition by the learning graph embedding features of neighborhood graphs constructed from gene expression information, spatial location information, and histopathological image information through multiview graph convolutional networks. By exploring spatial transcriptomes from multiple views, MVST enables data from all parts of the spatial transcriptome to be comprehensively and fully utilized to obtain more accurate spatial expression patterns. We verified the effectiveness of MVST on real spatial transcriptome datasets, the robustness of MVST on some simulated datasets, and the reasonableness of the framework structure of MVST in ablation experiments, and from the experimental results, it is clear that MVST can achieve a more accurate spatial domain identification compared with the current more advanced methods. In conclusion, MVST is a powerful tool for spatial transcriptome research with improved spatial domain recognition.

                <p>by Caterina Millevoi, Damiano Pasetto, Massimiliano Ferronato</p>

Compartmental models provide simple and efficient tools to analyze the relevant transmission processes during an outbreak, to produce short-term forecasts or transmission scenarios, and to assess the impact of vaccination campaigns. However, their calibration is not straightforward, since many factors contribute to the rapid change of the transmission dynamics. For example, there might be changes in the individual awareness, the imposition of non-pharmacological interventions and the emergence of new variants. As a consequence, model parameters such as the transmission rate are doomed to vary in time, making their assessment more challenging. Here, we propose to use Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to track the temporal changes in the model parameters and the state variables. PINNs recently gained attention in many engineering applications thanks to their ability to consider both the information from data (typically uncertain) and the governing equations of the system. The ability of PINNs to identify unknown model parameters makes them particularly suitable to solve ill-posed inverse problems, such as those arising in the application of epidemiological models. Here, we develop a reduced-split approach for the implementation of PINNs to estimate the temporal changes in the state variables and transmission rate of an epidemic based on the SIR model equation and infectious data. The main idea is to split the training first on the epidemiological data, and then on the residual of the system equations. The proposed method is applied to five synthetic test cases and two real scenarios reproducing the first months of the Italian COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that the split implementation of PINNs outperforms the joint approach in terms of accuracy (up to one order of magnitude) and computational times (speed up of 20%). Finally, we illustrate that the proposed PINN-method can also be adopted to produced short-term forecasts of the dynamics of an epidemic.

                <p>by Ariel Rokem</p>

As large, high-dimensional data have become more common, software development is playing an increasingly important role in research across many different fields. This creates a need to adopt software engineering practices in research settings. Code review is the engineering practice of giving and receiving detailed feedback on a computer program. Consistent and continuous examination of the evolution of computer programs by others has been shown to be beneficial, especially when reviewers are familiar with the technical aspects of the software and also when they possess relevant domain expertise. The rules described in the present article provide information about the why, when, and how of code review. They provide the motivation for continual code reviews as a natural part of a rigorous research program. They provide practical guidelines for conducting review of code both in person, as a “lab meeting for code,” as well as asynchronously, using industry-standard online tools. A set of guidelines is provided for the nitty-gritty details of code review, as well as for the etiquette of such a review. Both the technical and the social aspects of code review are covered to provide the reader with a comprehensive approach that facilitates an effective, enjoyable, and educational approach to code review.

                <p>by Gustavo Menesse, Joaquín J. Torres</p>

The relation between electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms, brain functions, and behavioral correlates is well-established. Some physiological mechanisms underlying rhythm generation are understood, enabling the replication of brain rhythms <i>in silico</i>. This offers a pathway to explore connections between neural oscillations and specific neuronal circuits, potentially yielding fundamental insights into the functional properties of brain waves. Information theory frameworks, such as Integrated information Decomposition (Φ-ID), relate dynamical regimes with informational properties, providing deeper insights into neuronal dynamic functions. Here, we investigate wave emergence in an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balanced network of <i>integrate and fire</i> neurons with short-term synaptic plasticity. This model produces a diverse range of EEG-like rhythms, from low <i>δ</i> waves to high-frequency oscillations. Through Φ-ID, we analyze the network’s information dynamics and its relation with different emergent rhythms, elucidating the system’s suitability for functions such as robust information transfer, storage, and parallel operation. Furthermore, our study helps to identify regimes that may resemble pathological states due to poor informational properties and high randomness. We found, e.g., that <i>in silico</i> <i>β</i> and <i>δ</i> waves are associated with maximum information transfer in inhibitory and excitatory neuron populations, respectively, and that the coexistence of excitatory <i>θ</i>, <i>α</i>, and <i>β</i> waves is associated to information storage. Additionally, we observed that high-frequency oscillations can exhibit either high or poor informational properties, potentially shedding light on ongoing discussions regarding physiological versus pathological high-frequency oscillations. In summary, our study demonstrates that dynamical regimes with similar oscillations may exhibit vastly different information dynamics. Characterizing information dynamics within these regimes serves as a potent tool for gaining insights into the functions of complex neuronal networks. Finally, our findings suggest that the use of information dynamics in both model and experimental data analysis, could help discriminate between oscillations associated with cognitive functions and those linked to neuronal disorders.

Inferring the driving regulatory programs from comparative analysis of gene expression data is a cornerstone of systems biology. Many computational frameworks were developed to address this problem, including our iPAGE (information-theoretic Pathway Analysis of Gene Expression) toolset that uses information theory to detect non-random patterns of expression associated with given pathways or regulons. Our recent observations, however, indicate that existing approaches are susceptible to the technical biases that are inherent to most real world annotations. To address this, we have extended our information-theoretic framework to account for specific biases and artifacts in biological networks using the concept of conditional information. To showcase pyPAGE, we performed a comprehensive analysis of regulatory perturbations that underlie the molecular etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). pyPAGE successfully recapitulated several known AD-associated gene expression programs. We also discovered several additional regulons whose differential activity is significantly associated with AD. We further explored how these regulators relate to pathological processes in AD through cell-type specific analysis of single cell and spatial gene expression datasets. Our findings showcase the utility of pyPAGE as a precise and reliable biomarker discovery in complex diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.

                <p>by Yann Le Cunff, Laurent Chesneau, Sylvain Pastezeur, Xavier Pinson, Nina Soler, Danielle Fairbrass, Benjamin Mercat, Ruddi Rodriguez-Garcia, Zahraa Alayan, Ahmed Abdouni, Gary de Neidhardt, Valentin Costes, Mélodie Anjubault, Hélène Bouvrais, Christophe Héligon, Jacques Pécréaux</p>

How can inter-individual variability be quantified? Measuring many features per experiment raises the question of choosing them to recapitulate high-dimensional data. Tackling this challenge on spindle elongation phenotypes, we showed that only three typical elongation patterns describe spindle elongation in <i>C. elegans</i> one-cell embryo. These archetypes, automatically extracted from the experimental data using principal component analysis (PCA), accounted for more than 95% of inter-individual variability of more than 1600 experiments across more than 100 different conditions. The two first archetypes were related to spindle average length and anaphasic elongation rate. The third archetype, accounting for 6% of the variability, was novel and corresponded to a transient spindle shortening in late metaphase, reminiscent of kinetochore function-defect phenotypes. Importantly, these three archetypes were robust to the choice of the dataset and were found even considering only non-treated conditions. Thus, the inter-individual differences between genetically perturbed embryos have the same underlying nature as natural inter-individual differences between wild-type embryos, independently of the temperatures. We thus propose that beyond the apparent complexity of the spindle, only three independent mechanisms account for spindle elongation, weighted differently in the various conditions. Interestingly, the spindle-length archetypes covered both metaphase and anaphase, suggesting that spindle elongation in late metaphase is sufficient to predict the late anaphase length. We validated this idea using a machine-learning approach. Finally, given amounts of these three archetypes could represent a quantitative phenotype. To take advantage of this, we set out to predict interacting genes from a seed based on the PCA coefficients. We exemplified this firstly on the role of <i>tpxl-1</i> whose homolog <i>tpx2</i> is involved in spindle microtubule branching, secondly the mechanism regulating metaphase length, and thirdly the central spindle players which set the length at anaphase. We found novel interactors not in public databases but supported by recent experimental publications.

Centrosome amplification is a feature of cancer cells associated with chromosome instability and invasiveness. Enhancing chromosome instability and subsequent cancer cell death via centrosome unclustering and multipolar divisions is an aimed-for therapeutic approach. Here, we show that centrosome amplification potentiates responses to conventional chemotherapy in addition to its effect on multipolar divisions and chromosome instability. We perform single-cell live imaging of chemotherapy responses in epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines and observe increased cell death when centrosome amplification is induced. By correlating cell fate with mitotic behaviors, we show that enhanced cell death can occur independently of chromosome instability. We identify that cells with centrosome amplification are primed for apoptosis. We show they are dependent on the apoptotic inhibitor BCL-XL and that this is not a consequence of mitotic stresses associated with centrosome amplification. Given the multiple mechanisms that promote chemotherapy responses in cells with centrosome amplification, we assess such a relationship in an epithelial ovarian cancer patient cohort. We show that high centrosome numbers associate with improved treatment responses and longer overall survival. Our work identifies apoptotic priming as a clinically relevant consequence of centrosome amplification, expanding our understanding of this pleiotropic cancer cell feature.

                Abstract* Background Digital addictions are a major problem worldwide, which has increased considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this scenario, two important impact factors to explain this problem are stress and anxiety because of COVID-19. The objective of this research was to determine the impact of distress and anxiety due to COVID-19 on digital addictions. Methods cross-sectional, explanatory study. A total of 802 students from public and private universities residing in the city of Lima and Callao (Peru), with a mean age of 21.68 (SD = 3.11), selected by convenience sampling, participated in the study. The MULTICAGE CAD-4 questionnaire, the distress scale, and the COVID-19 worry scale were applied. Results two models examined with structural equation modeling showed good fit indices (CFI and TLI > .95, RMSEA and SRMR < .06). The first model shows that the latent variables distress and anxiety due to COVID-19 have direct effects on digital addictions as a general construct (R2 = 22%). The second model shows that the exogenous latent variables (stress and anxiety) have direct effects of different magnitudes on each digital technology, so the variance explained on smartphone addiction was higher (R2 = 25%) with respect to internet (R2 = 19%) and video game addiction (R2 = 6%). It was also found that for every male, there are two females with high levels of distress and anxiety. Regarding the problematic use of smartphones and internet, there is a prevalence of 40% regardless of sex; but as for the problematic use of video games, there is a marked difference between males (18.8%) and females (2.7%). Conclusion the distress and anxiety caused by COVID-19 have a direct impact in aggravating digital addictions.

<p>Immune cell-derived IL-4 induces Ly6C<sup>+</sup> macrophages to express BDNF. Following the injection of IL-4 neutralizing antibody into the infarct, the BDNF, IL-4 protein lev and the quantity of BDNF<sup>+</sup>/Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells significantly decreased.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>We reported that infiltrated Ly6C<sup>+</sup> macrophages express brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) only at the cerebral cortex infarct in a rat dMCAO model. However, the changein neuron-expressed BDNF, the niche components that induce the Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells to express BDNF, and the cellular sources of these components, remain unclear. In this study, immunofluorescence double staining was performed to label BDNF and Ly6C on brain sections at 3, 24, and 48 h following distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) of male rats, and to stain BDNF with Ly6C, IL-4R, and IL-10R. A neutralizing anti-IL-4 antibody was injected into the infarct, and the IL-4 and BDNF concentrations in the subareas of the infarct were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To find out the cellular sources of IL-4, the markers for microglia, T cells, and neurons were co-stained with IL-4 separately. In certain infarct subareas, the main BDNF-expressing cells shifted quickly from NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons to Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells during 24–48 h post-stroke, and the Ly6C<sup>+</sup>/BDNF<sup>+</sup> cells mostly expressed IL-4 receptor. Following IL-4 neutralizing antibody injection, the BDNF, IL-4 protein levels, and BDNF<sup>+</sup>/Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells decreased significantly. The main IL-4-expressing cell type in this infarct subarea is not neuron either, but immune cells, including microglia, monocyte, macrophages, and T cells. The neurons, maintained BDNF and IL-4 expression in the peri-infarct area. In conclusion, in a specific cerebral subarea of the rat dMCAO model, IL-4 secreted by immune cells is one of the main inducers for Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells to express BDNF.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1550/v2?src=rss">Sample size variation in single-time post-dose assessment vs multi-time post-dose assessment [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Many randomized trials measure a continuous outcome simultaneously at baseline and after taking the drug. For a single continuous post-treatment outcome, the sample size calculation is simple, but if there are assessments at multiple time points post-treatment then this longitudinal data may give more insights by analyzing the data using the repeated measures method. Also, if the sample size is calculated using the single time-point method for longitudinal data, it may lead to a larger than required sample size, increasing the cost and time. Methods: In this research, an effort is made to determine the size of the sample for repeated measures case and then compared with the single post-baseline case. The sample sizes were examined under different scenarios for the continuous type of response variable. Under Mean contrast and Diff contrast the sample sizes were calculated with different correlations. These two scenarios were again examined under compound symmetry as well as Auto regressive of order 1 type of correlation structure in longitudinal data. The graphical presentation is given for better visualization of the scenarios. Results: Sample size required for highly correlated longitudinal data using multi timepoint sample size derivation method led to much smaller sample size requirement as compared to single timepoint sample size calculation method. Conclusions: This study will help researchers to make better decisions in choosing the right method for sample size determination which may reduce the time and cost of carrying out the experiment. Also, we must carefully assess which method to go with when the correlation is weak. More complex correlation structures are not studied in this article but can be studied in the same fashion.

                Background: In the evaluation of research proposals, reviewers are often required to provide their opinions using various forms of quantitative and qualitative criteria. In 2020, the European Commission removed, for the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Innovative Training Networks (ITN) funding scheme, the numerical scores from the individual evaluations but retained them in the consensus report. This study aimed to assess whether there were any differences in reviewer comments’ linguistic characteristics after the numerical scoring was removed, compared to comments from 2019 when numerical scoring was still present. Methods: This was an observational study and the data were collected for the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Innovative Training Networks (ITN) evaluation reports from the calls of 2019 and 2020, for both individual and consensus comments and numerical scores about the quality of the research proposal on three evaluation criteria: Excellence, Impact and Implementation. All comments were analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program. Results: For both years, the comments for proposal’s strengths were written in a style that reflects objectivity, clout, and positive affect, while in weaknesses cold and objective style dominated, and that pattern remained stable across proposal status and research domains. Linguistic variables explained a very small proportion of the variance of the differences between 2019 and 2020 (McFadden R2=0.03). Conclusions: Removing the numerical scores was not associated with the differences in linguistic characteristics of the reviewer comments. Future studies should adopt a qualitative approach to assess whether there are conceptual changes in the content of the comments.

                Background: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected people's economies, lifestyles, and physical, emotional, and sleep health. This research aimed to estimate the prevalence of insomnia and symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression among teachers with the resumption of in-person instruction at schools following a hiatus after COVID-19 lockdowns in India. We also studied the association of teachers' insomnia with psychological symptoms and demographic variables. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey between October –November 2021 after schools had reopened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data was collected using standard questionnaires online among schoolteachers. We explored the association of insomnia with teachers' symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, sex, school boards, and age groups. Results: Of 124 schoolteachers surveyed, the prevalence of insomnia was 37.9% (subthreshold in 25% and clinical in 12.9%). The prevalence of stress, depression, and anxiety was 20.2%, 30.6%, and 45.2%, respectively. There was a significant association (p<0.001) of insomnia with symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression in univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, we found that those feeling stressed had a 6.4 times higher risk of insomnia (95% CI: 1.5-28.3, p - 0.01). There was no association of insomnia with age, sex, school educational boards, and type of institution. Conclusions: Over one-third (37.9%) of teachers reported having trouble sleeping when they returned to the school's typical face-to-face instruction modalities through COVID-19 times, and insomnia was more prevalent in those with stress.

                Background The concept of euthanasia has recently come into the spotlight, and cases such as those of Aruna Shanbaug have heavily influenced people’s opinions on the topic. Whether euthanasia is performed with the intention of ending suffering that otherwise cannot be helped should truly be supported. The thoughts on this topic- especially of those who work closely with patients who suffer from terminal illnesses- healthcare providers must be analyzed. Their perception and views on legalizing the procedure and their hesitancy or lack thereof to perform such a procedure would give the rest of the world a clearer picture- a better standpoint to understand what to do. This study attempted to quantify and analyze the views of doctors and medical students regarding euthanasia. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 212 doctors and medical students at a private medical college in South India was conducted to determine their attitudes toward euthanasia. Results Most participants (66%) supported the practice of euthanasia. The majority of participants also believed that euthanasia should only be performed with the explicit consent of the patient (71.7%). It was also observed that those who had heard about euthanasia via hearsay mostly agreed that it must only be performed with the explicit consent of the patient. Moreover, the study showed that those who had heard about it from hearsay and news mostly stood for it. Conclusion It has been noted that news and media all around us heavily influence people’s opinions. It is concluded that these opinions have changed from the past, and will likely do so depending on the environment and media around the topic.

     alt="Thorny and Tufted Retinal Ganglion Cells Express the Transcription Factor Forkhead Proteins Foxp1 and Foxp2 in Marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)"/>
<p>We identify a novel ganglion cell type in marmoset retina, named tufted cell, which expresses the transcription factor Foxp2. Tufted cells are characterized by bare primary dendrites which branch frequently in the peripheral dendritic field to form dense tufts. The dendritic stratification and overall dendritic field size of tufted cells is otherwise comparable to that of broad thorny ganglion cells. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The transcription factor forkhead/winged-helix domain proteins Foxp1 and Foxp2 have previously been studied in mouse retina, where they are expressed in retinal ganglion cells named F-mini and F-midi. Here we show that both transcription factors are expressed by small subpopulations (on average less than 10%) of retinal ganglion cells in the retina of the marmoset monkey (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>). The morphology of Foxp1- and Foxp2-expressing cells was revealed by intracellular DiI injections of immunofluorescent cells. Foxp1- and Foxp2-expressing cells comprised multiple types of wide-field ganglion cells, including broad thorny cells, narrow thorny cells, and tufted cells. The large majority of Foxp2-expressing cells were identified as tufted cells. Tufted cells stratify broadly in the middle of the inner plexiform layer. They resemble broad thorny cells but their proximal dendrites are bare of branches and the distal dendrites branch frequently forming dense dendritic tufts. Double labeling with calretinin, a previously established marker for broad thorny and narrow thorny cells, showed that only a small proportion of ganglion cells co-expressed calretinin and Foxp1 or Foxp2 supporting the idea that the two markers are differentially expressed in retinal ganglion cells of marmoset retina.</p>

     alt="Sources of Rapid and Delayed New Lower Jaw Input in the Forepaw Barrel Subfield (FBS) in Rat Primary Somatosensory Cortex (SI) Following Forelimb Deafferentation"/>
<p>The rat's forepaw is represented in the forepaw barrel subfield (FBS) of the somatosensory cortex. After forelimb input loss, the anterior FBS immediately responds to lower jaw stimulation, with the entire FBS doing so in 7 weeks. The lower jaw barrel subfield (LJBSF) supplies immediate input, whereas the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) thalamus provides new delayed input to the posterior FBS.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Previously, we reported an immediate emergence of new lower jaw input to the anterior forepaw barrel subfield (FBS) in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) following forelimb deafferentation. However, a delay of 7 weeks or more post-amputation results in the presence of this new input to both anterior and posterior FBS. The immediate change suggests pre-existing latent lower jaw input in the FBS, whereas the delayed alteration implies the involvement of alternative sources. One possible source for immediate lower jaw responses is the neighboring lower jaw barrel subfield (LJBSF). We used anatomical tracers to investigate the possible projection of LJBSF to the FBS in normal and forelimb-amputated rats. Our findings are as follows: (1) anterograde tracer injection into LJBSF in normal and amputated rats labeled fibers and terminals exclusively in the anterior FBS; (2) retrograde tracer injection in the anterior FBS in normal and forelimb-amputated rats, heavily labeled cell bodies predominantly in the posterior LJBSF, with fewer in the anterior LJBSF; (3) retrograde tracer injection in the posterior FBS in normal and forelimb-amputated rats, sparsely labeled cell bodies in the posterior LJBSF; (4) retrograde tracer injection in anterior and posterior FBS in normal and forelimb-amputated rats, labeled cells exclusively in ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus and posterior thalamus (PO); (5) retrograde tracer injection in LJBSF-labeled cell bodies exclusively in ventral posterior medial thalamic nucleus and PO. These findings suggest that LJBSF facilitates rapid lower jaw reorganization in the anterior FBS, whereas VPL and/or other subcortical sites provide a likely substrate for delayed reorganization observed in the posterior FBS.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>We have investigated the hippocampal connectivity of the marmoset presubiculum (PreS) and reported that major connections of PreS in the rat were conserved in the marmoset. Moreover, our results indicated the presence of several additional projections that were almost absent in the rat brain, but abundant in the marmoset, such as direct projections from CA1 to PreS. However, little is known about the connectivity between the frontal brain regions and PreS or hippocampal formation. Therefore, we investigated the distribution of cells of the origins and terminals of the presubicular and hippocampal projections in the marmoset frontal brain regions using the retrograde and anterograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit. In cases of tracer injections into all layers of PreS, many neurons and terminals were labeled in the claustrum–endopiriform (Cl–En) complex almost entirely along the rostrocaudal axis. Even in cases where the injection site involved the superficial (not deep) layers of PreS, labeled neurons and terminals were distributed over a wide rostrocaudal range of the Cl–En complex, but their number and density were significantly lower than the whole-layer injection cases. In cases where the injection site was confined to the hippocampal formation, labeled cells and terminals were localized at a restricted portion of the Cl–En complex. Here, we demonstrate for what we believe to be the first time the strong, reciprocal connections of the Cl–En complex with PreS and projections from the Cl–En complex to the hippocampal regions (CA1 and the subiculum) in the marmoset. Our findings indicate that the Cl–En complex may exert a strong influence on the cortical and subcortical outputs from PreS and, in turn, the entire memory circuitry in the marmoset brain.</p>

     alt="Scaled Complexity of Mammalian Astrocytes: Insights From Mouse and Macaque"/>
<p>We used a multi-technique approach (including immunohistochemistry, AAV-mediated transduction of astrocytes, diOlistics, confocal imaging, and electron microscopy) to label astrocytes in mice and rhesus macaques and conducted a comprehensive morphological analysis. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Astrocytes intricately weave within the neuropil, giving rise to characteristic bushy morphologies. Pioneering studies suggested that primate astrocytes are more complex due to increased branch numbers and territory size compared to rodent counterparts. However, there has been no comprehensive comparison of astrocyte morphology across species. We employed several techniques to investigate astrocyte morphology and directly compared them between mice and rhesus macaques in cortical and subcortical regions. We assessed astrocyte density, territory size, branching structure, fine morphological complexity, and interactions with neuronal synapses using a combination of techniques, including immunohistochemistry, adeno-associated virus–mediated transduction of astrocytes, diOlistics, confocal imaging, and electron microscopy. We found significant morphological similarities between primate and rodent astrocytes, suggesting that astrocyte structure has scaled with evolution. Our findings show that primate astrocytes are larger and more numerous than those in rodents but contest the view that primate astrocytes are morphologically far more complex.</p>
