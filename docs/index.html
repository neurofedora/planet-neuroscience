                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ability to form different neural representations for similar inputs is a central process of episodic memory. Although the dorsal dentate gyrus and CA3 have been indicated as important in this phenomenon, the neuronal circuits underlying spatiotemporal memory processing with different levels of spatial similarity are still elusive. In this study, we measured the expression of the immediate early gene c-Fos to evaluate brain areas activated when rats recalled the temporal order of object locations in a task, with either high or low levels of spatial interference. Animals showed spatiotemporal memory in both conditions once they spent more time exploring the older object locations relative to the more recent ones. We found no difference in the levels of c-Fos expression between high and low spatial interference. However, the levels of c-Fos expression in CA2 positively correlated with the discrimination index in the low spatial interference condition. More importantly, functional network connectivity analysis revealed a wider and more interconnected neuronal circuit in conditions of high than in low spatial interference. Our study advances the understanding of brain networks recruited in episodic memory with different degrees of spatial similarity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16437">Haunted House: A text-based game for comparing the flexibility of mental models in humans and LLMs</a></h4>

Abstract: This study introduces "Haunted House" a novel text-based game designed to compare the performance of humans and large language models (LLMs) in model-based reasoning. Players must escape from a house containing nine rooms in a 3x3 grid layout while avoiding the ghost. They are guided by verbal clues that they get each time they move. In Study 1, the results from 98 human participants revealed a success rate of 31.6%, significantly outperforming seven state-of-the-art LLMs tested. Out of 140 attempts across seven LLMs, only one attempt resulted in a pass by Claude 3 Opus. Preliminary results suggested that GPT o3-mini-high performance might be higher, but not at the human level. Further analysis of 29 human participants' moves in Study 2 indicated that LLMs frequently struggled with random and illogical moves, while humans exhibited such errors less frequently. Our findings suggest that current LLMs encounter difficulties in tasks that demand active model-based reasoning, offering inspiration for future benchmarks.

                arXiv:2503.16668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great promise in generating code, especially when used inside an evolutionary computation framework to iteratively optimize the generated algorithms. However, in some cases they fail to generate competitive algorithms or the code optimization stalls, and we are left with no recourse because of a lack of understanding of the generation process and generated codes. We present a novel approach to mitigate this problem by enabling users to analyze the generated codes inside the evolutionary process and how they evolve over repeated prompting of the LLM. We show results for three benchmark problem classes and demonstrate novel insights. In particular, LLMs tend to generate more complex code with repeated prompting, but additional complexity can hurt algorithmic performance in some cases. Different LLMs have different coding ``styles'' and generated code tends to be dissimilar to other LLMs. These two findings suggest that using different LLMs inside the code evolution frameworks might produce higher performing code than using only one LLM.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17061">Replay4NCL: An Efficient Memory Replay-based Methodology for Neuromorphic Continual Learning in Embedded AI Systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.17061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic Continual Learning (NCL) paradigm leverages Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to enable continual learning (CL) capabilities for AI systems to adapt to dynamically changing environments. Currently, the state-of-the-art employ a memory replay-based method to maintain the old knowledge. However, this technique relies on long timesteps and compression-decompression steps, thereby incurring significant latency and energy overheads, which are not suitable for tightly-constrained embedded AI systems (e.g., mobile agents/robotics). To address this, we propose Replay4NCL, a novel efficient memory replay-based methodology for enabling NCL in embedded AI systems. Specifically, Replay4NCL compresses the latent data (old knowledge), then replays them during the NCL training phase with small timesteps, to minimize the processing latency and energy consumption. To compensate the information loss from reduced spikes, we adjust the neuron threshold potential and learning rate settings. Experimental results on the class-incremental scenario with the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset show that Replay4NCL can preserve old knowledge with Top-1 accuracy of 90.43% compared to 86.22% from the state-of-the-art, while effectively learning new tasks, achieving 4.88x latency speed-up, 20% latent memory saving, and 36.43% energy saving. These results highlight the potential of our Replay4NCL methodology to further advances NCL capabilities for embedded AI systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17111">A Digital Machine Learning Algorithm Simulating Spiking Neural Network CoLaNET</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.17111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During last several years, our research team worked on development of a spiking neural network (SNN) architecture, which could be used in the wide range of supervised learning classification tasks. It should work under the condition, that all participating signals (the classified object description, correct class label and SNN decision) should have spiking nature. As a result, the CoLaNET (columnar layered network) SNN architecture was invented. The distinctive feature of this architecture is a combination of prototypical network structures corresponding to different classes and significantly distinctive instances of one class (=columns) and functionally differing populations of neurons inside columns (=layers). The other distinctive feature is a novel combination of anti-Hebbian and dopamine-modulated plasticity. While CoLaNET is relatively simple, it includes several hyperparameters. Their choice for particular classification tasks is not trivial. Besides that, specific features of the data classified (e.g. classification of separate pictures like in MNIST dataset vs. classifying objects in a continuous video stream) require certain modifications of CoLaNET structure. To solve these problems, the deep mathematical exploration of CoLaNET should be carried out. However, SNNs, being stochastic discrete systems, are usually very hard for exact mathematical analysis. To make it easier, I developed a continuous numeric (non-spiking) machine learning algorithm which approximates CoLaNET behavior with satisfactory accuracy. It is described in the paper. At present, it is being studied by exact analytic methods. We hope that the results of this study could be applied to direct calculation of CoLaNET hyperparameters and optimization of its structure.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16775">Region Masking to Accelerate Video Processing on Neuromorphic Hardware</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.16775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapidly growing demand for on-chip edge intelligence on resource-constrained devices has motivated approaches to reduce energy and latency of deep learning models. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained particular interest due to their promise to reduce energy consumption using event-based processing. We assert that while sigma-delta encoding in SNNs can take advantage of the temporal redundancy across video frames, they still involve a significant amount of redundant computations due to processing insignificant events. In this paper, we propose a region masking strategy that identifies regions of interest at the input of the SNN, thereby eliminating computation and data movement for events arising from unimportant regions. Our approach demonstrates that masking regions at the input not only significantly reduces the overall spiking activity of the network, but also provides significant improvement in throughput and latency. We apply region masking during video object detection on Loihi 2, demonstrating that masking approximately 60% of input regions can reduce energy-delay product by 1.65x over a baseline sigma-delta network, with a degradation in mAP@0.5 by 1.09%.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17132">Temporal-Guided Spiking Neural Networks for Event-Based Human Action Recognition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.17132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the promising interplay between spiking neural networks (SNNs) and event-based cameras for privacy-preserving human action recognition (HAR). The unique feature of event cameras in capturing only the outlines of motion, combined with SNNs' proficiency in processing spatiotemporal data through spikes, establishes a highly synergistic compatibility for event-based HAR. Previous studies, however, have been limited by SNNs' ability to process long-term temporal information, essential for precise HAR. In this paper, we introduce two novel frameworks to address this: temporal segment-based SNN (\textit{TS-SNN}) and 3D convolutional SNN (\textit{3D-SNN}). The \textit{TS-SNN} extracts long-term temporal information by dividing actions into shorter segments, while the \textit{3D-SNN} replaces 2D spatial elements with 3D components to facilitate the transmission of temporal information. To promote further research in event-based HAR, we create a dataset, \textit{FallingDetection-CeleX}, collected using the high-resolution CeleX-V event camera $(1280 \times 800)$, comprising 7 distinct actions. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed frameworks surpass state-of-the-art SNN methods on our newly collected dataset and three other neuromorphic datasets, showcasing their effectiveness in handling long-range temporal information for event-based HAR.

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) offers a neuromorphic framework that is particularly effective for processing spatiotemporal signals. Known for its temporal processing prowess, RC significantly lowers training costs compared to conventional recurrent neural networks. A key component in its hardware deployment is the ability to generate dynamic reservoir states. Our research introduces a novel dual-memory RC system, integrating a short-term memory via a WOx-based memristor, capable of achieving 16 distinct states encoded over 4 bits, and a long-term memory component using a TiOx-based memristor within the readout layer. We thoroughly examine both memristor types and leverage the RC system to process temporal data sets. The performance of the proposed RC system is validated through two benchmark tasks: isolated spoken digit recognition with incomplete inputs and Mackey-Glass time series prediction. The system delivered an impressive 98.84% accuracy in digit recognition and sustained a low normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.036 in the time series prediction task, underscoring its capability. This study illuminates the adeptness of memristor-based RC systems in managing intricate temporal challenges, laying the groundwork for further innovations in neuromorphic computing.

Abstract: Optimization plays an important role in tackling public health problems. Animal instincts can be used effectively to solve complex public health management issues by providing optimal or approximately optimal solutions to complicated optimization problems common in public health. BAT algorithm is an exemplary member of a class of nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithms and designed to outperform existing metaheuristic algorithms in terms of efficiency and accuracy. It's inspiration comes from the foraging behavior of group of microbats that use echolocation to find their target in the surrounding environment. In recent years, BAT algorithm has been extensively used by researchers in the area of optimization, and various variants of BAT algorithm have been developed to improve its performance and extend its application to diverse disciplines. This paper first reviews the basic BAT algorithm and its variants, including their applications in various fields. As a specific application, we apply the BAT algorithm to a biostatistical estimation problem and show it has some clear advantages over existing algorithms.

                arXiv:2407.05650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Cooperative Network Architecture (CNA), a model that represents sensory signals using structured, recurrently connected networks of neurons, termed "nets." Nets are dynamically assembled from overlapping net fragments, which are learned based on statistical regularities in sensory input. This architecture offers robustness to noise, deformation, and out-of-distribution data, addressing challenges in current vision systems from a novel perspective. We demonstrate that net fragments can be learned without supervision and flexibly recombined to encode novel patterns, enabling figure completion and resilience to noise. Our findings establish CNA as a promising paradigm for developing neural representations that integrate local feature processing with global structure formation, providing a foundation for future research on invariant object recognition.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13945">Neuromorphic Attitude Estimation and Control</a></h4>

Abstract: The real-world application of small drones is mostly hampered by energy limitations. Neuromorphic computing promises extremely energy-efficient AI for autonomous flight but is still challenging to train and deploy on real robots. To reap the maximal benefits from neuromorphic computing, it is necessary to perform all autonomy functions end-to-end on a single neuromorphic chip, from low-level attitude control to high-level navigation. This research presents the first neuromorphic control system using a spiking neural network (SNN) to effectively map a drone's raw sensory input directly to motor commands. We apply this method to low-level attitude estimation and control for a quadrotor, deploying the SNN on a tiny Crazyflie. We propose a modular SNN, separately training and then merging estimation and control sub-networks. The SNN is trained with imitation learning, using a flight dataset of sensory-motor pairs. Post-training, the network is deployed on the Crazyflie, issuing control commands from sensor inputs at 500Hz. Furthermore, for the training procedure we augmented training data by flying a controller with additional excitation and time-shifting the target data to enhance the predictive capabilities of the SNN. On the real drone, the perception-to-control SNN tracks attitude commands with an average error of 3.0 degrees, compared to 2.7 degrees for the regular flight stack. We also show the benefits of the proposed learning modifications for reducing the average tracking error and reducing oscillations. Our work shows the feasibility of performing neuromorphic end-to-end control, laying the basis for highly energy-efficient and low-latency neuromorphic autopilots.

                arXiv:2412.06534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms underlying deep neural networks in computer vision remains a fundamental challenge. While many previous approaches have focused on visualizing intermediate representations within deep neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks, these techniques have yet to be thoroughly explored in transformer-based vision models. In this study, we apply a modular approach of training inverse models to reconstruct input images from intermediate layers within a Detection Transformer and a Vision Transformer, showing that this approach is efficient and feasible. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations of reconstructed images, we generate insights into the underlying mechanisms of these architectures, highlighting their similarities and differences in terms of contextual shape and preservation of image details, inter-layer correlation, and robustness to color perturbations. Our analysis illustrates how these properties emerge within the models, contributing to a deeper understanding of transformer-based vision models. The code for reproducing our experiments is available at github.com/wiskott-lab/inverse-detection-transformer.

">A novel membrane contact site in vestibular hair cells</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian vestibular system has two types of sensory receptor hair cells (HCs), each with different neurotransmission mechanisms. Type II HCs use ribbon synapses to transmit neurotransmitters like glutamate to afferent neurons. On the other hand, type I HCs are nearly engulfed by a calyceal afferent ending and also form ribbon synapses. These HCs regulate afferent activity through non-quantal transmission (NQT), which is faster than classic neurotransmitter release and may play a key role in stabilizing vision and balance during rapid head movements. Here, we describe a novel striated contact, present between the mouse type I HC and its calyceal afferent ending, and intimately associated with atypical plasma membrane-apposed (PMA) mitochondria. This distinctive arrangement has the potential to serve or modulate NQT.

">Population activity of mossy fibre axon input to the cerebellar cortex during behaviours</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum gathers information from the neocortex via the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway, and forms sensorimotor associations for predicting movements and their sensory consequences. However, little is known about the functional properties of this major input to the cerebellar cortex. Recordings from individual cerebellar mossy fibre axons (MFAs) have shown that they convey sensory and motor information, but nothing is known about their population code. Here, we report that the population activity of pontine MFAs is heterogeneous, high-dimensional and that different subpopulations of MFAs are active during quiet and active behavioural states. Population activity occupied a substantial fraction of the state space and some MFAs are particularly informative about behaviour. Surprisingly, positively and negatively modulated MFAs are intermingled, suggesting granule cells integrate opposite-signed inputs to generate mixed bidirectional sensorimotor representations. Our results establish that neocortex and cerebellum can communicate with a low redundancy, high capacity, bidirectional population code, which is well-suited for forming sensorimotor associations.

">Mapping Along-Tract White Matter Microstructural Differences in Autism</a></h4>

              
                Previous diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) research has indicated altered white matter microstructure in autism, but the implicated regions are highly inconsistent across studies. Such prior work has largely used conventional dMRI analysis methods, including the traditional microstructure model, based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, these methods are limited in their ability to precisely map microstructural differences and accurately resolve complex fiber configurations. In our study, we investigated white matter microstructure alterations in autism using the refined along-tract analytic approach, BUndle ANalytics (BUAN), and an advanced microstructure model, the tensor distribution function (TDF). We analyzed dMRI data from 365 autistic and neurotypical participants (5-24 years; 34% female) from 10 cohorts to examine commissural and association tracts. Autism was associated with lower fractional anisotropy and higher diffusivity in localized portions of nearly every commissural and association tract examined; these tracts inter-connected a wide range of brain regions, including frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital. Taken together, BUAN and TDF allow robust and spatially precise mapping of microstructural properties in autism. Our findings rigorously demonstrate that white matter microstructure alterations in autism may be greater within specific regions of individual tracts, and that the implicated tracts are distributed across the brain.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to quantify differences in the brain and spinal cord between Friedreich ataxia and controls, stratified by age and disease stage, including for the first time in young children.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>TRACK-FA is the largest prospective, longitudinal, multi-modal neuroimaging study in Friedreich ataxia to date. We assessed individuals with Friedreich ataxia and controls, 5 to 42 years, at 7 sites across 4 continents. The 17 imaging primary outcome measures (POMs) were selected from metrics that showed a significant longitudinal change in previous small-scale studies. These included brain and spinal cord morphometry (structural magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and microstructure (diffusion MRI); brain iron levels (quantitative susceptibility mapping); and spinal cord biochemistry (magnetic resonance spectroscopy). This study is registered with <a target="_blank"
   title="Link to external resource"
   href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> (NCT04349514).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between February 2021 and August 2023, we assessed 169 individuals with Friedreich ataxia and 95 controls. Compared to controls, individuals with Friedreich ataxia had lower volume of dentate nucleus and superior cerebellar peduncles; smaller cross-sectional area of spinal cord; lower fractional anisotropy and higher diffusivity in spinal cord and superior cerebellar peduncles; and lower total N-acetyl-aspartate/myo-inositol ratio in spinal cord. Morphometric differences in spinal cord and superior cerebellar peduncles increased dramatically with age during childhood, with rapid development in controls, but not in Friedreich ataxia. Many imaging POMs showed significant associations with clinical severity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings provide strong imaging evidence of impaired development of spinal cord and superior cerebellar peduncles during childhood in Friedreich ataxia and open the way for the use of neuroimaging biomarkers in clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

">Acute particulate matter (PM10) exposure selectively triggers behavioral alterations in the presymptomatic Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the Central Nervous System, where neuroinflammation and autoimmune response against myelin lead to functional impairments and psychiatric symptoms. Exposure to air pollution - and, in particular, to peaks of particulate matter (PM) - has been associated with an increase of hospital admissions for MS onset and relapses and exacerbated neuroinflammation in MS patients. Here, in the MOG35-55-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to PM10 might influence the disease course and severity in individuals with a predisposing background. Short-term PM10 exposures - occurring either before immunization or during the pre-symptomatic phase - did not modify disease manifestation in EAE mice, as assessed by clinical and neuropathological analyses. Yet, presymptomatic EAE - but not healthy - mice selectively showed increased disinhibited, risk-taking and novelty-seeking behaviors early after being exposed to PM10. These data show a selective vulnerability of immunologically primed mice toward the effects of PM10, occurring before the emergence of overt motor impairment and presenting as specific behavioral alterations.

">MEEGNet: An open source python library for the application of convolutional neural networks to MEG</a></h4>

              
                Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are rapidly gaining traction in neuroscience, proving invaluable for decoding and modeling brain signals from techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Although these networks are beginning to find applications in magnetoencephalography (MEG), their use in this domain is still in the early stages. Here, we introduce MEEGNet, a novel Python library paired with an intuitive convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed primarily for MEG data, yet adaptable to EEG signals. The MEEGNet model was trained and cross-validated using MEG data from 643 participants across four classification tasks, including auditory and visual stimulus classification and age prediction. Our model achieves competitive performance across all tasks, with a notable balance of accuracy and efficiency - for instance, reaching 92.70% test accuracy in an auditory vs. visual classification task while maintaining shorter training times than other architectures. The MEEGNet pipeline also integrates latent space visualization tools, adapted for MEG and EEG data. These include saliency maps and Grad-CAM methods, which enhance the interpretability of ANN-based classification and help address the black-box critique of such models. Importantly, the MEEGNet library is designed for extensibility, allowing the neuroscience and machine learning communities to add functionalities and ANN models. By prioritizing usability, transparency, and interpretability, MEEGNet empowers MEG- and EEG-based research with a user-friendly and modular framework.

">Resting-State EEG Aperiodic Exponent Moderates the Association Between Age and Memory Performance in Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                Memory functions are susceptible to age-related cognitive decline, making it essential to explore the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms that contribute to memory function during healthy ageing. Resting-state EEG (rsEEG) parameters, particularly the aperiodic exponent, a marker of cortical excitation-inhibition balance, and individual alpha frequency (IAF), a correlate of neural processing efficiency, have demonstrated associations with ageing and cognitive functions. This study investigated associations between these rsEEG markers and performance across multiple memory systems in healthy older adults (n = 99) aged 50-84 years, specifically the moderating and mediating effects on memory and age-memory relationships across episodic, working, and visual short-term memory systems, assessed via computerised tasks. Results revealed significant moderating effects of the aperiodic exponent on age-related performance in episodic (EM) and visual short-term memory (VSTM). Notably, for individuals with a higher exponent, age was not significantly associated with EM or VSTM performance, whereas those with average and lower exponent values showed poorer performance with older age. These findings suggest that average and lower aperiodic exponents may reflect a marker of decrement in age-related memory performance and higher exponents may index an underlying protective mechanism against age-related memory decline. This investigation extends the current understanding of cognitive ageing mechanisms by identifying the aperiodic exponent as a potential biomarker explaining individual differences in cognitive ageing trajectories in older adult populations, particularly in EM and VSTM systems, and establishes a framework for studying neuroprotective mechanisms and developing interventions to preserve cognitive function in older adults.

">Auditory Perception Induces Cortical and Thalamic Event-Related Desynchronization in the Mouse</a></h4>

              
                Studies of human perception have shown early cortical signals for primary information encoding, and later signals for higher order processing. An important late signal is the cortical event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha (8-12Hz) and beta (12-30Hz) frequency band, which has been linked to human perceptual awareness. Detailed mechanistic investigation of the ERD would be greatly facilitated by availability of a suitable animal model. We conducted local field potential recordings in the mouse frontal association cortex (FrA), thalamic intralaminar centrolateral nucleus (Cl), primary auditory cortex (A1), and primary visual cortex (V1) during two auditory tasks. Fully audible brief 50 ms stimuli with both tasks produced early broadband gamma (30-100Hz) frequency activity at 0-250ms, followed by a late cortical alpha/beta ERD 250 - 750 ms after stimulus onset. The ERD was statistically significant in FrA and A1, but not in V1. Interestingly, a significant ERD was also observed in thalamic Cl. The magnitude of the ERD at full stimulus intensity, and the slope of the relationship between stimulus intensity versus ERD magnitude, were both largest in FrA, and smaller in Cl and A1. Conversely, for early broadband gamma activity the magnitude at full intensity and slopes were largest in A1, smaller in Cl and smaller still in FrA. These findings suggest that mice, like humans, process perceptual signals in hierarchically organized corticothalamic networks, and strongly support mice as a promising platform for further investigation of the ERD to better understand the origin and function of this robust yet understudied electrophysiological phenomenon.

">Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy drives cortical neuronal disturbances in human organoids harbouring the common m.3243A>G mutation</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial diseases frequently affect the brain leading to severe and disabling neurological symptoms. The heteroplasmic m.3243A>G mutation in MT-TL1, encoding mt-tRNALeu, is responsible for ~80% of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), which is one of the most characteristic mitochondrial syndromes, leading to disability and early death. There are no animal models harbouring this mutation to provide precise mechanistic insights informing therapeutic interventions. Here, we generated a human iPSC-derived cerebral organoid slice model that recapitulates cortical architecture and mitochondrial pathology. Using biological assays and single-cell RNA sequencing, we uncovered heteroplasmy-dependent transcriptional shifts and changes in key cellular processes in cortical neurons. Organoids with high heteroplasmy showed a predominant impairment of deep-layer neurons triggered by mitochondrial stress, leading to axonal degeneration and apoptosis, similar to brain autopsy of a MELAS patient. Our findings provide insights into the vulnerability of long-range projection neurons in mitochondrial diseases, advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms with a view to potential therapeutic strategies.

">Reticular Thalamic Hyperexcitability Drives Autism Spectrum Disorder Behaviors in the Cntnap2 Model of Autism</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social communication deficits, repetitive behaviors, and comorbidities such as sensory abnormalities, sleep disturbances, and seizures. Dysregulation of thalamocortical circuits has been implicated in these comorbid features, yet their precise roles in ASD pathophysiology remain elusive. This study focuses on the reticular thalamic nucleus (RT), a key regulator of thalamocortical interactions, to elucidate its contribution to ASD-related behavioral deficits using a Cntnap2 knockout (KO) mouse model. Our behavioral and EEG analyses comparing Cntnap2+/+ and Cntnap2-/- mice demonstrated that Cntnap2 knockout heightened seizure susceptibility, elevated locomotor activity, and produced hallmark ASD phenotypes, including social deficits, and repetitive behaviors. Electrophysiological recordings from thalamic brain slices revealed increased spontaneous and evoked network oscillations with increased RT excitability due to enhanced T-type calcium currents and burst firing. We observed behavior related heightened RT population activity in vivo with fiber photometry. Notably, suppressing RT activity via Z944, a T-type calcium channel blocker, and via C21 and the inhibitory DREADD hM4Di, improved ASD-related behavioral deficits. These findings identify RT hyperexcitability as a mechanistic driver of ASD behaviors and underscore RT as a potential therapeutic target for modulating thalamocortical circuit dysfunction in ASD.

">Differential representations of spatial location by aperiodic and alpha oscillatory activity in working memory</a></h4>

              
                Decades of research have shown working memory (WM) relies on sustained prefrontal cortical activity and visual extrastriate activity, particularly in the alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency range. This alpha activity tracks the spatial location of WM items, even when spatial position is task-irrelevant and there is no stimulus currently being presented. Traditional analyses of putative oscillations using bandpass filters, however, conflate oscillations with non-oscillatory aperiodic activity. Here, we reanalyzed seven different human electroencephalography (EEG) visual WM datasets to test the hypothesis that aperiodic activity--which is thought to reflect the relative contributions of excitatory and inhibitory drive--plays a distinct role in visual WM from true alpha oscillations. To do this, we developed a novel, time-resolved spectral parameterization approach to disentangle oscillations from aperiodic activity during WM encoding and maintenance. Across all seven tasks, totaling 112 participants, we captured the representation of spatial location from total alpha power using an inverted encoding model (IEM), replicating traditional analyses. We then trained separate IEMs to estimate the strength of spatial location representation from aperiodic-adjusted alpha (reflecting just the oscillatory component) and aperiodic activity, and find that IEM performance improves for aperiodic-adjusted alpha compared to total alpha power that blends the two signals. We also discover a novel role for aperiodic activity, where IEM performance trained on aperiodic activity is highest during stimulus presentation, but not during the WM maintenance period. Our results emphasize the importance of controlling for aperiodic activity when studying neural oscillations while uncovering a novel functional role for aperiodic activity in the encoding of visual WM information.

">Three-photon population imaging of subcortical brain regions</a></h4>

              
                Recording activity from large cell populations in deep neural circuits is essential for understanding brain function. Three-photon (3P) imaging is an emerging technology that allows for imaging of structure and function in subcortical brain structures. However, increased tissue heating, as well as the low repetition rate sources inherent to 3P imaging, have limited the fields of view (FOV) to areas of [&le;]0.3 mm2. Here we present a Large Imaging Field of view Three-photon (LIFT) microscope with a FOV of [gt]3 mm2. LIFT combines high numerical aperture (NA) optimized sampling, using a custom scanning module, with deep learning-based denoising, to enable population imaging in deep brain regions. We demonstrate non-invasive calcium imaging in the mouse brain from >1500 cells across CA1, the surrounding white matter, and adjacent deep layers of the cortex, and show population imaging with high signal-to-noise in the rat cortex at a depth of 1.2 mm. The LIFT microscope was built with all off-the-shelf components and allows for a flexible choice of imaging scale and rate.

Understanding the neuro-mechanisms underlying methamphetamine overuse and the associated emotional withdrawal symptoms is crucial for developing effective clinical strategies. This study aimed to investigate the distinct functional contributions of fine-scale gyro-sulcal signaling in the psychopathology of patients with methamphetamine use disorder and its associations with emotional symptoms. We recruited 48 male abstinent methamphetamine use disorders and 48 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, obtaining their resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data along with scores on anxiety and depressive symptoms. The proposed deep learning model, a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network utilizing gyro-sulcal subdivisions, achieved the highest average classification accuracy in distinguishing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of methamphetamine use disorders from healthy controls. Within this model, nodes in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and the habitual and executive control networks, contributed most significantly to the classification. Additionally, emotional symptom scores were negatively correlated with the sum of negative functional connectivity in the right caudal anterior cingulate sulcus and the functional connectivity between the left putamen and pallidum in methamphetamine use disorders. These findings provide novel insights into the differential functions of gyral and sulcal regions, enhancing our understanding of the neuro-mechanisms underlying methamphetamine use disorders.</span>

                <p>Alpha (8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) oscillations and default mode network (DMN) activity dominate the brain's intrinsic activity in the temporal and spatial domains, respectively. They are thought to play crucial roles in the spatiotemporal organization of the complex brain system. Relatedly, both have been implicated, often concurrently, in diverse neuropsychiatric disorders, with accruing electroencephalogram (EEG)/magnetoencephalogram and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data linking these two neural activities both at rest and during key cognitive operations. Prominent theories and extant findings thus converge to suggest a mechanistic relationship between alpha oscillations and the DMN. Here, we leveraged simultaneous EEG&ndash;fMRI data acquired before and after alpha-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (<I>&alpha;</I>-tACS) and observed that <I>&alpha;</I>-tACS tightened the dynamic coupling between spontaneous fluctuations in alpha power and DMN connectivity (especially, in the posterior DMN, between the posterior cingulate cortex and the bilateral angular gyrus). In comparison, no significant changes were observed for temporal correlations between power in other oscillatory frequencies and connectivity in other major networks. These results thus suggest an inherent coupling between alpha and DMN activity in humans. Importantly, these findings highlight the efficacy of <I>&alpha;</I>-tACS in regulating the DMN, a clinically significant network that is challenging to target directly with noninvasive methods.</p>

                <p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 8&ndash;12% of children globally. Hyperactivity-related behaviors, as well as inattention and impulsivity, are regarded as the nuclear symptoms of ADHD. At present, its etiologies and risk factors are unknown. Previous research linked TARP -8 deficiency to ADHD-like behaviors in mice, including hyperactivity, impulsivity, and memory deficits. Aniracetam, a nootropic drug, enhances cognition by modulating cholinergic activity and glutamate receptors, offering neuroprotective effects. This study examined TARP -8 knockout (KO) mice at 4 and 8 weeks, assessing behaviors through locomotor activity, cliff avoidance, novel object recognition, and contextual fear conditioning tests. TARP -8 KO mice exhibited hyperactivity, reduced recognition memory, and impaired short-term memory and long-term memory. Aniracetam administration improved these behavioral deficits, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for ADHD. The findings align with ADHD&rsquo;s pathophysiology, resembling the neurological impairments in TARP -8 KO mice. Aniracetam shows promise as a novel treatment for ADHD symptoms, highlighting its therapeutic value.</p>

                Objective This scoping review aims to map and synthesise the current research evidence targeting the electroencephalography (EEG) neural correlates during pregnancy and its association with parenting-related measures during pregnancy and postpartum period. Introduction Pregnancy is characterised by a wide range of biological changes associated with adaptation to parenthood. A growing body of literature has examined the neural correlates of pregnancy using EEG, revealing distinct patterns in pregnant females, with these EEG metrics changing throughout gestation and postpartum. Due to the heterogeneity of the evidence, the current literature lacks an organised synthesis, making it difficult to understand the neural correlates during pregnancy and their association with parenting-related measures during pregnancy and postpartum period. Inclusion criteria Studies will be included if they contain a quantitative EEG metric in their assessment in pregnant women. Studies will be included if they involve clinical or community samples. No sociodemographic, obstetric, or health exclusion criteria will be applied. Methods The scoping review will be conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute’s (JBI) guidelines and will be reported following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Searches will be conducted in 7 databases (Cochrane for Trials and Reviews, PsycInfo, PubMed, Psychological and Behavioural Science Collection, Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection) for articles published in English, Portuguese, or Spanish with no limitation on the region or publication time frame. Two independent reviewers will screen each record following a standardised flowchart using asreview lab. Data extraction will be performed by the two reviewers using charting tables in Excel. Disagreements at any step will be resolved via consensus or by a third reviewer. Results will be reported using tables and graphs along with a descriptive analysis, according to the research questions.

                Background SARS-CoV has caused a high number of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia. COVID-19 cases continue to be reported, including incidents of the latest variant of SARS-CoV-2, Omicron. The development of vaccines remains essential to address potential future outbreaks. Methods We performed whole genome sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technology and phylogenetic and mutational analysis using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis to identify potential isolates as a new platform vaccine candidate. Results Nine isolates have the potential to serve as candidates for the next generation COVID-19 vaccine. The sequencing test results of the nine selected isolates revealed that two samples were identified as the alpha variant, two as the delta variant, and five as the Omicron variant. Alpha variant has been identified as B.1 lineage, the delta variant with lineage AY.23, and the omicron variant with three lineages including BA.1.1, BA.5.2, and BQ.1.23 lineages. Phylogenetic analysis revealed five distinct classes: 20A, 21J, 21K, 22B, and 22E. The quantification of SARS-CoV-2 amino acid mutations in structural proteins revealed that the spike protein had the highest mutation percentage at 44.56%, followed by the N protein at 9.05%, the M protein at 5.54%, and the E protein at 1.78%. Conclusions It was concluded that nine isolates had potential to be developed as candidates for the next generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. These isolates include three variants: alpha, delta, and omicron.

                Climate change significantly affects smallholder farmers, whose livelihoods are closely tied to the environment. This study explores factors influencing the adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices and their impact on crop productivity among small-scale farmers in Nyimba District, Zambia. Data were collected from 194 households across 12 villages, and logistic regression and propensity score matching analyses were employed to identify key factors and evaluate CSA’s effects on crop yields. Findings revealed that CSA adoption is influenced by factors such as education level, household size, fertilizer use, age, gender, farming experience, livestock ownership, income, farmland size, marital status, and access to climate-related information. CSA adopters experienced a 20.20% increase in overall crop yields compared to non-adopters, with a 21.50% increase in maize yields specifically. The study underscores the need for targeted interventions to support CSA adoption through education, improved dissemination of climate information, and access to critical resources such as improved seeds and financial services. This research offers insights for policymakers and extension services to develop evidence-based strategies enhancing resilience and productivity among smallholder farmers in response to climate challenges.

We introduce a classification system that distinguishes between bright and dark particles based on their charge and color charge properties, leading to potential extensions in particle physics models. Furthermore, we investigate the nature of dark black holes, differentiating them from bright black holes, and discuss their potential observational signatures in astrophysics. This study provides a theoretical foundation for future explorations of dark matter and its interactions in the universe.

                <p>by Kevin S Chen, Anuj K Sharma, Jonathan W Pillow, Andrew M Leifer</p>

Learned olfactory-guided navigation is a powerful platform for studying how a brain generates goal-directed behaviors. However, the quantitative changes that occur in sensorimotor transformations and the underlying neural circuit substrates to generate such learning-dependent navigation is still unclear. Here we investigate learned sensorimotor processing for navigation in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> by measuring and modeling experience-dependent odor and salt chemotaxis. We then explore the neural basis of learned odor navigation through perturbation experiments. We develop a novel statistical model to characterize how the worm employs two behavioral strategies: a biased random walk and weathervaning. We infer weights on these strategies and characterize sensorimotor kernels that govern them by fitting our model to the worm’s time-varying navigation trajectories and precise sensory experiences. After olfactory learning, the fitted odor kernels reflect how appetitive and aversive trained worms up- and down-regulate both strategies, respectively. The model predicts an animal’s past olfactory learning experience with  > 90<i>%</i> accuracy given finite observations, outperforming a classical chemotaxis metric. The model trained on natural odors further predicts the animals’ learning-dependent response to optogenetically induced odor perception. Our measurements and model show that behavioral variability is altered by learning—trained worms exhibit less variable navigation than naive ones. Genetically disrupting individual interneuron classes downstream of an odor-sensing neuron reveals that learned navigation strategies are distributed in the network. Together, we present a flexible navigation algorithm that is supported by distributed neural computation in a compact brain.

                Objective To determine whether economic factors are crucial in empowering women, guiding them towards growth and development opportunities, achieving empowerment, and contributing to two sustainable development goals of the 2030 development agenda: ending poverty and achieving gender equality. Methodology The research was foundational, with a phenomenological and hermeneutic design. The applied technique was in-depth interviews with 12 women who had started a business within the last five years in a region of Peru. Results It is evident that economic factors are decisive in business experiences and decisions, highlighting the necessity of having contingency funds to prevent operational impacts. Through entrepreneurship, women achieved economic independence, enabling them to support their families and impacting their empowerment. It concludes that to promote economic opportunity equality, addressing financing needs, encouraging economic independence, strengthening family empowerment, improving customer management, and facilitating access to government funds are essential. Conclusions The narrative of the participants provides a solid foundation for designing specific policies and support programs that boost the economic empowerment of women entrepreneurs and encourage their active participation in the business sphere.

                In Peru, insect consumption, as a nutritional complement or as the main source in the diet, is limited to the regions of our the central jungle where Atta sexdens ants are consumed. An energy bar based on Andean grains with Atta sexdens ant flour was formulated. The ants were obtained from the department of San Martin, district of Rioja, province of Rioja. Four different formulations were prepared with different Atta sexdens ant flour concentrations: 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30%. Moisture, total fat, ash, proteins, fiber, carbohydrates, instrumental texture, and organoleptic analysis (taste, texture, and color) were performed. The developed cereal energy bar presented a 10 g protein content in 100 g of the final product. Acceptability was evaluated in adolescents and young adult populations. The developed cereal bars presented a high protein content, adequate organoleptic properties and high acceptability. However, this must be considered in the context of the rising cost of protein-rich foods.

                Background Hypertension is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, contributing to global mortality and disability. Approximately 30% of Indian adults are diagnosed with hypertension. Evidence supports that self-monitoring and blood pressure self-management can lower systolic BP by an average of 3.2 mmHg. mHealth applications facilitate remote monitoring and self-management, yet existing applications in India lack customisation for user needs, limiting their usability. This study aims to develop and evaluate a novel, user-friendly mHealth application tailored to hypertensive individuals. Methods This study follows an Agile development design, an iterative software development approach that allows continuous feedback and refinement. The research will be conducted in three phases over an anticipated duration of 27 months. Phase 1 (6 months) will involve in-depth interviews and focus group discussions to identify essential features for a customised Android-based mHealth application. Phase 2 (9 months) will involve developing the application using Android Studio following Agile principles. Phase 3 (12 months) will be a community-based cluster randomised trial conducted in 12 villages to evaluate the application’s effectiveness. Villages will be randomised into intervention and control groups. Each group will include 118 participants. The intervention group will use the mHealth application, while the control group will follow the standard hypertension management regimen. Villages and participants will be selected based on specific criteria, including population size, availability of healthcare facilities, and smartphone accessibility among hypertensive patients. Results In the proposed study, if the intervention is helpful, hypertension patients in the community can be encouraged to use the mHealth application. If found effective, this application is anticipated to improve hypertensive patients’ health status, knowledge, and self-care approach.

     alt="Environmental Enrichment Increases Brain Volume in Snakes"/>
<p>MRI scans of Western hognose (<i>Heterodon nasicus</i>) brains show that snakes that lived in enriched conditions for 8 months have larger brains than snakes that lived in impoverished conditions, especially in the hindbrain. Relative brain area sizes differed across sexes.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The effects of environmental enrichment have been well documented in mammals and birds, but less work has focused on reptiles. Because snakes are common in captivity, both as pets and in research/commercial facilities, it is critical to explore how they react to standard captive housing. Here, we examined the effects of environmental enrichment on brain development in a popular pet snake species, the western hognose snake (<i>Heterodon nasicus</i>). Hognose snakes (<i>n</i> = 15) were individually housed for one year in either enriched or standard environments before their brains were harvested and imaged using MRI. We found that enriched snakes had significantly larger brain volumes compared to standard snakes, most prominently in posterior brain regions. In addition, we observed sex-specific brain investments: as snakes grew larger, males displayed relatively larger cerebral hemispheres, and females displayed larger posterior brain regions. These results suggest that environmental enrichment is critical to encouraging healthy brain development in snakes and that snake brain plasticity is very similar to that observed in mammals and birds.</p>

                Somatic mutations in genes regulating mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway signaling can cause epilepsy, autism, and cognitive dysfunction. Research has predominantly focused on mTOR regulation of excitatory neurons in these conditions; however, dysregulated mTOR signaling among interneurons may also be critical. In this review, we discuss clinical evidence for interneuron involvement, and potential mechanisms, known and hypothetical, by which interneurons might come to directly harbor pathogenic mutations. To understand how mTOR hyperactive interneurons might drive dysfunction, we review studies in which mTOR signaling has been selectively disrupted among interneurons and interneuron progenitors in mouse model systems. Complex cellular mosaicism and dual roles for mTOR (hyper)activation in mediating disease pathogenesis and homeostatic responses raise challenging questions for effective treatment of these disorders.

                Hippocampal replay is widely thought to support two key cognitive functions: online decision-making and offline memory consolidation. In this review, we take a closer look at the hypothesized link between awake replay and online decision-making in rodents, and find only marginal evidence in support of this role. By contrast, the consolidation view is bolstered by new computational ideas and recent data, suggesting that (i) replay performs offline fictive learning for later goal-oriented behavior; and (ii) replay tags memories prior to sleep, prioritizing them for consolidation. Based on these recent advances, we favor an updated and refined role for awake replay – that is, supporting prioritized offline learning and tagging outside the hippocampus – rather than a direct, online role in guiding behavior.

                Memory consolidation is thought to rely on the interplay of sleep-related brain oscillations. Drawing on recent findings that highlight the influence of respiration on these rhythms, we outline a framework positioning respiration as pacemaker for sleep’s memory function. By orchestrating the cardinal non-rapid eye movement (NREM) oscillations, namely slow oscillations, spindles, and sharp wave-ripples, respiration may coordinate the hippocampo-cortical crosstalk essential for memory consolidation.

                ILC3s are essential for intestinal defense; however, how metabolism affects their function has remained elusive. Fonseca-Pereira et al. show that LKB1 controls ILC3 function in a cell-intrinsic manner following its activation by upstream cytokine signals. LKB1 inhibits ROS production and PD-1 expression to promote mitochondrial function and sustain IL-22 production.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92892">The neural correlates of novelty and variability in human decision-making under an active inference framework</a></h4>

              
                Active inference integrates perception, decision-making, and learning into a united theoretical framework, providing an efficient way to trade off exploration and exploitation by minimizing (expected) free energy. In this study, we asked how the brain represents values and uncertainties (novelty and variability), and resolves these uncertainties under the active inference framework in the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Twenty-five participants performed a contextual two-armed bandit task, with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. By comparing the model evidence for active inference and reinforcement learning models of choice behavior, we show that active inference better explains human decision-making under novelty and variability, which entails exploration or information seeking. The EEG sensor-level results show that the activity in the frontal, central, and parietal regions is associated with novelty, while the activity in the frontal and central brain regions is associated with variability. The EEG source-level results indicate that the expected free energy is encoded in the frontal pole and middle frontal gyrus and uncertainties are encoded in different brain regions but with overlap. Our study dissociates the expected free energy and uncertainties in active inference theory and their neural correlates, speaking to the construct validity of active inference in characterizing cognitive processes of human decisions. It provides behavioral and neural evidence of active inference in decision processes and insights into the neural mechanism of human decisions under uncertainties.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102019">Zinc finger homeobox-3 (ZFHX3) orchestrates genome-wide daily gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), situated in the ventral hypothalamus, directs daily cellular and physiological rhythms across the body. The SCN clockwork is a self-sustaining transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL) that in turn coordinates the expression of clock-controlled genes (CCGs) directing circadian programmes of SCN cellular activity. In the mouse, the transcription factor, ZFHX3 (zinc finger homeobox-3), is necessary for the development of the SCN and influences circadian behaviour in the adult. The molecular mechanisms by which ZFHX3 affects the SCN at transcriptomic and genomic levels are, however, poorly defined. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing to map the genomic localization of ZFHX3-binding sites in SCN chromatin. To test for function, we then conducted comprehensive RNA sequencing at six distinct times-of-day to compare the SCN transcriptional profiles of control and ZFHX3-conditional null mutants. We show that the genome-wide occupancy of ZFHX3 occurs predominantly around gene transcription start sites, co-localizing with known histone modifications, and preferentially partnering with clock transcription factors (CLOCK, BMAL1) to regulate clock gene(s) transcription. Correspondingly, we show that the conditional loss of ZFHX3 in the adult has a dramatic effect on the SCN transcriptome, including changes in the levels of transcripts encoding elements of numerous neuropeptide neurotransmitter systems while attenuating the daily oscillation of the clock TF <i>Bmal1</i>. Furthermore, various TTFL genes and CCGs exhibited altered circadian expression profiles, consistent with an advanced in daily behavioural rhythms under 12 h light–12 h dark conditions. Together, these findings reveal the extensive genome-wide regulation mediated by ZFHX3 in the central clock that orchestrates daily timekeeping in mammals.

                Bacterial biofilms are communities of bacteria usually attached to solid strata and often differentiated into complex structures. Communication across biofilms has been shown to involve chemical signaling and, more recently, electrical signaling in Gram-positive biofilms. We report for the first time, community-level synchronized membrane potential dynamics in three-dimensional <i>Escherichia coli</i> biofilms. Two hyperpolarization events are observed in response to light stress. The first requires mechanically sensitive ion channels (MscK, MscL, and MscS) and the second needs the Kch-potassium channel. The channels mediated both local spiking of single <i>E. coli</i> biofilms and long-range coordinated electrical signaling in <i>E. coli</i> biofilms. The electrical phenomena are explained using Hodgkin-Huxley and 3D fire-diffuse-fire agent-based models. These data demonstrate that electrical wavefronts based on potassium ions are a mechanism by which signaling occurs in Gram-negative biofilms and as such may represent a conserved mechanism for communication across biofilms.

">Brain structural modules associated to functional high-order interactions in the human brain,</a></h4>

              
                The brain's modular organization, ranging from microcircuits to large-scale networks, has been extensively studied in terms of its structural and functional properties. Particularly insightful has been the investigation of the coupling between structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC), whose analysis has revealed important insights into the brain's efficiency and adaptability related to various cognitive functions. Interestingly, links in SC are intrinsically pairwise but this is not the case for FC; and while recent work demonstrates the relevance of the brain's high-order interactions (HOI), the coupling of between SC and functional HOI remains unexplored. To address this gap, this study leverages functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging to delineate the brain's modular structure by investigating the coupling between SC and functional HOI. Our results demonstrates that structural networks can be associated with both redundant and synergistic functional interactions. In particular, SC exhibits both positive and negative correlations with redundancy, it shows consistent positive correlations with synergy, indicating that a higher density of structural connections is linked to increased synergistic interactions. These findings advance our understanding of the complex relationship between structural and high-order functional properties, shedding light on the brain's architecture underlying its modular organization.

">Mapping Dynamic Metabolic Energy Distribution in Brain Networks using fMRI: A Novel Dynamic Time Warping Framework</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how metabolic energy is distributed across brain networks is essential for elucidating healthy brain function and neurological disorders. Research has established the link between blood flow changes and glucose metabolic processes that fuel neural activity. Here, we introduce a novel framework based on the normalized dynamic time warping algorithm robust to neural temporal variability, enabling reliable insights into metabolic energy demands using functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings indicate that healthy brains maintain balanced energy distribution, whereas imbalances are more pronounced in schizophrenia with links to both positive and negative symptoms, particularly during rapid neural processes. Additionally, we identified a dynamic state that supports the brain criticality theory and is associated with higher-order cognitive abilities, demonstrating our framework's functional and clinical relevance. By linking metabolic energy distribution to neural dynamics, this framework provides a novel way to estimate and quantify the brain's maintenance of functional balance in a broadly applicable manner for studying brain health and disorders.

">Divide and conquer: How avian 'prefrontal' and hippocampal neurons process extinction learning in complementary ways</a></h4>

              
                Context-dependent extinction learning enables organisms to acquire an inhibition of responding to cues that no longer signal reward in specific environmental settings. Both the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex play key but complementary roles in encoding extinction. To understand what drives the differential contributions of these two structures, we recorded single-unit responses from the pigeon hippocampus (HPC) and the prefrontal like nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), while the animals were engaged in a repeated appetitive ABA extinction learning paradigm. HPC carried more information about experimental phases (acquisition (context A), extinction (context B), and renewal (context A)) than NCL. In addition, hippocampal neurons with mixed selectivity integrated all contextual stimuli and conditioned cues, thereby possibly enabling context integration into phase-dependent extinction events. The mixed selectivity pattern of NCL neurons differed: They encoded all relevant task parameters separately, thereby possibly enabling the weighing and deciding between response alternatives. Repeatedly testing the same animals over many months enabled us to reveal that the activity of NCL neurons increasingly became predictive of the number of responses that animals made during renewal. Thus, NCL neurons possibly assumed a meta-learning ability that enabled a behavioral adaption to the deeper task structure that always followed the sequence of acquisition -> extinction -> renewal. Our results make it likely that different processing strategies of hippocampus and the prefrontal like NCL enable a differential encoding of experimental phase, context, decision-making, and meta-learning during extinction learning.

">How Task Representations Integrate Information from Multiple Sources</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive behavior requires integrating multiple sources of information, yet neural and computational mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. We introduce a novel Bayesian computational framework elucidating how internally maintained and externally cued information are integrated to guide goal-directed actions. Our model infers trial-by-trial beliefs for inputs and integrates them into a joint probability distribution, where entropy quantifies overall uncertainty. This integrated representation predicts a probabilistic task belief and generates continuous measures of prediction errors and updating. Decoding analyses revealed distinct neural substrates encoded external and internal inputs, with convergence in frontoparietal hub regions where activity fluctuations scaled with entropy. Increasing integrated uncertainty modulated connectivity patterns, biasing the generation of integrated task outputs and prediction errors. Together, these findings capture the full integration process: encoding inputs, forming an integrated representation jointly encoding uncertainty, and producing a unified task output. This work provides novel insights into neural mechanisms underlying cognitive integration.

">Never mind the repeat: How speech expectations reduce tracking at the cocktail party</a></h4>

              
                When the brain focuses on a conversation in a noisy environment, it exploits past experience to prioritize relevant elements from the auditory scene. This prompts the question of what changes occur in the selective neural processing of speech mixtures as listeners garner prior experience about single speech objects. In three different priming experiments, we quantified cortical selection of temporal landmarks from continuous speech, applying the temporal response function (TRF) method to single-trial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. The designs specifically addressed how attention interacts with exact (Experiment 1), voice (Experiment 2a), or message (Experiment 2b) content priming of the target or background speakers in cortical responses to speech. Our results demonstrate that, during multispeaker listening, attentional gains typical of cortical responses under speech selection are met with attenuations as a consequence of prior experience. The changes were observed at the P2 processing stage (220-320 ms) of speech envelope onset processing and were specific to responses to primed speech targets (Experiment 1). Suppressions at stages earlier than the P2, or under partial priming conditions (Experiments 2a and 2b), were not observed. An exploratory analysis suggests the observed P2 reduction predicts listeners' ability to report target words, consistent with this component encoding in part temporal prediction error about onset edge cues exclusive to target speech. Our results show that at this late and definitive stage of selective attention, the auditory system may test the evidence for its own predictive model of the noise-invariant speech stream. Precise inference of its temporal structure is bound to tag all checkpoints where auditory evidence can be most reliably connected into higher-order representations of continuous speech.

">Gyral crowns contribute to the cortical infrastructure of human face processing</a></h4>

              
                Neuroanatomical features across spatial scales contribute to functional specialization and individual differences in behavior across species. Among species with gyrencephalic brains, gyral crown height, which measures a key aspect of the morphology of cortical folding, may represent an anatomical characteristic that importantly shapes neural function. Nevertheless, little is known about the relationship between functional selectivity and gyral crowns, especially in clinical populations. Here, we investigated this relationship and found that the size and gyral crown height of the middle, but not posterior, face-selective region on the fusiform gyrus (FG) was smaller in individuals with developmental prosopagnosia (DPs; N = 22, 68% female, aged 25-62) compared to neurotypical controls (NTs; N = 25, 60% females, aged 21-55), and this difference was related to face perception. Additional analyses replicated the relationship between gyral crowns and face selectivity in 1,053 NTs (55% females, aged 22-36). These results inform theoretical models of face processing while also providing a novel neuroanatomical feature contributing to the cortical infrastructure supporting face processing.

">Retinoic acid signaling guides the efficiency of inner ear organoid-genesis and governs sensory-nonsensory fate specification</a></h4>

              
                Inner ear organoid development--from germ layer to otocyst formation--relies on timed chemical cues to recapitulate major signals in vivo. In contrast, later stages of differentiation-from otic vesicle (OV) to organoid formation-are self-guided, even though these stages are modulated by several key morphogens in vivo. We sought to elucidate additional morphogens that might improve culture efficiency and influence cell fate decisions. Using a whole-transcriptomic approach, we identified major differences in native and stem cell-derived OVs related to anterior-posterior patterning and retinoic acid (RA) signaling. Increasing the level of RA during OV formation in these cultures modulated organoid efficiency, increased nonsensory markers, decreased sensory markers, and decreased hair cell production. The organoid culture platform mimics the exquisite RA sensitivity found in normal inner ear development and may help identify RA-responsive genes driving organogenesis and cell fate specification.

">Optic Ataxia in Patients with Thalamic Lesions</a></h4>

              
                Lesions in parietal cortex can strongly impair visually guided reach-grasping behavior. A specific reaching deficit termed Optic Ataxia (OA) occurs when eye and hand position are dissociated. Optic ataxia has typically been studied in patients with lesions in parietal cortex, neglecting potential thalamic contributions. We here examined 28 acute stroke patients with circumscribed thalamic lesions for the presence of optic ataxia. We leveraged MRI-based lesion-symptom mapping to address the contributions of specific thalamic nuclei to visually-guided reaching deficits under foveal and peripheral viewing conditions. Based on the cortical literature, we hypothesized that lesions in thalamic nuclei with strong connections to the inferior and superior parietal cortex, such as the ventrolateral nucleus and pulvinar might lead to optic ataxia. In comparison with aged-matched healthy subjects (n = 40), we identified five thalamic patients with optic ataxia, most pronounced for reaches with the contralesional hand into the contralesional space. While motor and grasping deficits and optic ataxia occurred frequently together, they did not always co-occur, and visual attention deficits could not account for the OA either. Comparing the lesion maps of patients with and without optic ataxia, the critical lesion site for optic ataxia was not restricted to one circumscribed thalamic region within the Morel atlas. Instead, it encompassed several medial and lateral nuclei within and around the internal medullary laminar (IML) complex. Interestingly, this region matches the so-called central thalamus, a functionally defined thalamic region that is considered a higher-order nucleus complex. It receives afferent inputs from the cerebellum and brainstem regions and connects to fronto-parietal regions involved in eye movement control. Taken together, our results suggest the critical importance of transthalamic routes for the spatial transformation from eye- into body-centered coordinates.

">INFLUENCE OF PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME ON ATTENTIONAL CAPTURE BY EXPRESSIONS IN THE LUTEAL PHASE</a></h4>

              
                Research on female health has increased thanks to the growing interest in women's well-being. Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) is characterized by its high incidence and negative emotional symptoms during the luteal phase. While various studies suggest that the menstrual cycle affects emotional processing, the role of PMS has barely been investigated. Prior evidence suggests that the menstrual cycle does not modulate the attentional capture by emotional faces (Alvarez et al., 2022). This study aims to explore PMS's impact on this phenomenon. Forty-seven women performed an attentional capture task in both phases of the menstrual cycle, with emotional faces as distractors. Both behavioral performance and Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Additionally, premenstrual symptoms were monitored over two menstrual cycles. Results showed no significant interaction effect of PMS, either at the behavioral or ERP levels. However, emotional stimuli, particularly angry faces, consistently captured attention more than neutral ones, as reflected in enhanced P1 and N170 components. These results indicate no evidence that PMS modulates exogenous attention to emotional stimuli. Future studies should consider individual affective states, such as depressive and anxiety symptoms associated with PMS, rather than PMS as a category, to further investigate the potential effects of PMS on attentional capture.

                Background Head and neck cancer (HNCs) is a major health issue worldwide, and India has contributed to approximately 2.4 lakh new cases in 2022. Definitive chemoradiation is the standard treatment for locally advanced disease but carries a risk of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) that add to morbidity, hospitalization, cost, and possible delay in treatment. The increasing incidence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has also contributed to management burden. This study aimed to assess the microbiological profiles and antimicrobial resistance patterns of lower respiratory tract infections in patients with head and neck cancer receiving chemoradiation. Methods Patients who underwent definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy and who developed LRTIs were included in the study. Sputum and tracheostomy suction tip cultures were obtained and processed using standard microbiological techniques such as Gram staining, biochemical tests, and VITEK-2 automated systems. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and EUCAST recommendations. Clinical and treatment-related factors were documented and compared using SPSS version 23.0, with descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests, ANOVA, and logistic regression models. Results Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated pathogen (35.0%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.7%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (10.0%). The pathogens were strongly resistant to fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins but were susceptible to carbapenems and aminoglycosides in the majority of isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequent pathogen in all age groups and chemotherapy regimens (p<0.001). Conclusion LRTIs in patients with HNC treated with chemoradiation were mainly caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Resistance patterns are crucial for directing empirical antibiotic therapy, minimizing treatment delays, and enhancing clinical outcomes.

                Background Soft-tissue sarcomas are an uncommon group of neoplasms that can be fatal, especially in metastatic settings. Thus, this study aimed to assess the demographic, pathological, clinical, and treatment patterns of soft tissue sarcoma at the Tikur Anbesa Specialized Hospital in Ethiopia. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with soft tissue sarcomas who visited the Tihur Anbesa Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia, between August 2017 and August 2021GC. A total of 190 samples were taken. Data from health management information system logbooks and medical records were collected, with only histopathology-confirmed cases included, while those with incomplete data were excluded. Analysis was performed using SPSS version 25, and ethical clearance was obtained from Addis Ababa University College of Health Sciences. Results A total of 320 patients were registered between August 2017 and August 2021; 190 patients were available for this study, and 130 were lost. The median age was 32 years of age and male sex was commonly affected, accounting 61.6%, and female sex accounted 38.4%. The common sites were extremities, accounting for 48.9% of cases. The Commonest presenting symptoms were mass and pain, accounting for 93.2% and 77.9% of cases, respectively. The common histological subtypes were undifferentiated sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and synovial sarcoma, accounting 50%, 15.8%, and 6.3% cases, respectively. The grade of the lesions was described in 67.3% of patients. Of the lesions whose grade was described, 56.8% were high grade lesions. In all cases, 58.3% of the patients underwent surgery as the primary treatment modality. Only 50.5% of cases were started treatment with curative intent, and 49.5% of the patients started their treatment with palliative treatment. Conclusions The pattern of soft tissue sarcomas showed a heterogeneous distribution in terms of demography, clinical presentation, treatment, and pathological subtypes. The advanced stage of initial clinical presentation and substandard work-up and therapy make it unique from cases reported in other parts of the world.

                <p>Cutaneomuscular reflexes (CMRs) can be recorded in the hand muscle of human subjects after stimulation of a digital nerve. We hypothesized that repeated synchronous stimulation of nerves from two digits may lead to long-term plastic changes in CMR, by the mechanisms of spike-timing&ndash;dependent plasticity (STDP). To test this idea, we conducted experiments in 27 healthy human volunteers. After baseline measurement of CMR, one of four 30-min-long stimulation conditions were tested; the CMR was then remeasured. The four conditions were simultaneous index finger and thumb stimulation; asynchronous index finger and thumb stimulation; thumb 5&nbsp;ms before index finger stimulation; and thumb-only stimulation. Neither the early (E1) nor late excitatory (E2) components of the CMR showed consistent changes after any stimulation condition. The inhibitory (I1) component was slightly reduced in all cases. To understand why paired stimulation did not produce long-term changes, we conducted a further experiment. In this, we measured the CMR in response to simultaneous stimulation of index finger and thumb, compared with a prediction expected if the responses summed linearly. This revealed sublinear summation, possibly indicating partial response saturation after stimulation of only one digit. We argue such a pattern prevents paired stimuli from generating especially reliable and well-timed outputs relative to synaptic inputs in downstream neurons, which is required to produce plasticity by STDP.</p>

                <p>Beta event-related spectral perturbation, including bilateral movement-related beta desynchronization (MRBD) and postmovement beta synchronization (PMBS), can be evoked by unilateral speed movement. A potential correlation might exist between power (de)synchronization and interhemispheric coherence during movement execution. However, during the PMBS phase, the existence of interhemispheric coupling and the effect of speed on it are largely undiscovered. To answer this question, we investigated eight healthy, right-handed volunteers using a combination of electroencephalography, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and electromyography. We explored interhemispheric (directed) coherence during isotonic right index finger abduction movements at two speeds: ballistic and self-paced. We discovered that (1) interhemispheric coherence was greater during the PMBS than during the MRBD period. Furthermore, ballistic movement induced a larger coherence during the PMBS period, but not during the MRBD period. (2) In the MRBD phase, directed coherence from the contralateral motor cortex (CM1) to the ipsilateral motor cortex (IM1) was larger, with a reverse tendency observed during the PMBS period. Additionally, in ballistic movement, directed coherence from IM1 to CM1 was stronger and positively correlated with coherence, with no effect of speed on directed coherence detected in the MRBD phase. To explore the causality of interhemispheric coherence during the PMBS period, we investigated the interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) from IM1 to CM1 at different speeds. A stronger IHI from IM1 to CM1 at PMBS peak time was demonstrated, which was enhanced during ballistic movement. Additionally, IHI was negatively correlated with PMBS, and movement speed was positively associated with interhemispheric coupling during the PMBS period and IHI from IM1 to CM1.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012893">How immunity shapes the long-term dynamics of influenza H3N2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Oliver Eales, Freya M. Shearer, James M. McCaw</p>

Since its emergence in 1968, influenza A H3N2 has caused yearly epidemics in temperate regions. While infection confers immunity against antigenically similar strains, new antigenically distinct strains that evade existing immunity regularly emerge (‘antigenic drift’). Immunity at the individual level is complex, depending on an individual's lifetime infection history. An individual's first infection with influenza typically elicits the greatest response with subsequent infections eliciting progressively reduced responses (‘antigenic seniority’). The combined effect of individual-level immune responses and antigenic drift on the epidemiological dynamics of influenza are not well understood. Here we develop an integrated modelling framework of influenza transmission, immunity, and antigenic drift to show how individual-level exposure, and the build-up of population level immunity, shape the long-term epidemiological dynamics of H3N2. Including antigenic seniority in the model, we observe that following an initial decline after the pandemic year, the average annual attack rate increases over the next 80 years, before reaching an equilibrium, with greater increases in older age-groups. Our analyses suggest that the average attack rate of H3N2 is still in a growth phase. Further increases, particularly in the elderly, may be expected in coming decades, driving an increase in healthcare demand due to H3N2 infections.

                <p>by Simón Poblete, Mikolaj Mlynarczyk, Marta Szachniuk</p>

RNA 3D structure prediction often encounters entanglements, computational artifacts that complicate structural models, resulting in their exclusion from further studies despite the potentially accurate prediction of regions outside the entanglement. This study presents a protocol aimed at resolving such issues in RNA models while preserving the overall 3D fold and structural integrity. By employing the SPQR coarse-grained model and short Molecular Dynamics simulations, the protocol imposes energy terms that enable selective modifications to disentangle structures without causing significant distortions. The method was validated on 195 entangled RNA models from CASP15 and RNA-Puzzles, successfully resolving over 70% of interlaces and approximately 40% of lassos, with minimal impact on the original geometry but notable improvement in ClashScore. The efficiency of untangling conformations that are unequivocally classified as artifacts is 81%. Certain cases, particularly those involving dense packing of atoms or complex secondary structures, posed challenges that limited the efficiency of the method. In this paper, we present quantitative results from the application of the protocol and discuss examples of both successfully disentangled and unresolved structures. We show a viable approach for refining models previously deemed unsuitable due to topological artifacts.

                <p>by Anna Posfai, Juannan Zhou, David M. McCandlish, Justin B. Kinney</p>

Quantitative models of sequence-function relationships are ubiquitous in computational biology, e.g., for modeling the DNA binding of transcription factors or the fitness landscapes of proteins. Interpreting these models, however, is complicated by the fact that the values of model parameters can often be changed without affecting model predictions. Before the values of model parameters can be meaningfully interpreted, one must remove these degrees of freedom (called “gauge freedoms” in physics) by imposing additional constraints (a process called “fixing the gauge”). However, strategies for fixing the gauge of sequence-function relationships have received little attention. Here we derive an analytically tractable family of gauges for a large class of sequence-function relationships. These gauges are derived in the context of models with all-order interactions, but an important subset of these gauges can be applied to diverse types of models, including additive models, pairwise-interaction models, and models with higher-order interactions. Many commonly used gauges are special cases of gauges within this family. We demonstrate the utility of this family of gauges by showing how different choices of gauge can be used both to explore complex activity landscapes and to reveal simplified models that are approximately correct within localized regions of sequence space. The results provide practical gauge-fixing strategies and demonstrate the utility of gauge-fixing for model exploration and interpretation.

                <p>by Sheng Huang, Chengji Piao, Zhiying Zhao, Christine B. Beuschel, Oriane Turrel, David Toppe, Stephan J. Sigrist</p>

Sleep is crucial for cognitive functions and life span across species. While sleep homeostasis and cognitive processes are linked through cellular and synaptic plasticity, the signaling pathways connecting them remain unclear. Here, we show that <i>Drosophila insomniac</i> (<i>inc</i>) short sleep mutants, which lack an adaptor protein for the autism-associated Cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase, exhibited enhanced Pavlovian aversive olfactory learning and memory, unlike other sleep mutants with normal or reduced memory. Through a genetic modifier screen, we found that a mild reduction of Protein Kinase A (PKA) signaling specifically rescued the sleep and longevity phenotypes of <i>inc</i> mutants. However, this reduction further increased their excessive memory and mushroom body overgrowth. Since <i>inc</i> mutants displayed higher PKA signaling, we propose that <i>inc</i> loss-of-function suppresses sleep via increased PKA activity, which also constrains the excessive memory of <i>inc</i> mutants. Our data identify a signaling cascade for balancing sleep and memory functions, and provide a plausible explanation for the sleep phenotypes of <i>inc</i> mutants, suggesting that memory hyperfunction can provoke sleep deficits.

                <p>by Rory L. Cooper, Michel C. Milinkovitch</p>

The morphological intricacies of avian feathers make them an ideal model for investigating embryonic patterning and morphogenesis. In particular, the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway is an important mediator of feather outgrowth and branching. However, functional in vivo evidence regarding its role during feather development remains limited. Here, we demonstrate that an intravenous injection of sonidegib, a potent Shh pathway inhibitor, at embryonic day 9 (E9) temporarily produces striped domains (instead of spots) of <i>Shh</i> expression in the skin, arrests morphogenesis, and results in unbranched and non-invaginated feather buds—akin to proto-feathers—in embryos until E14. Although feather morphogenesis partially recovers, hatched treated chickens exhibit naked skin regions with perturbed follicles. Remarkably, these follicles are subsequently reactivated by seven weeks post-hatching. Our RNA-sequencing data and rescue experiment using Shh-agonism confirm that sonidegib specifically down-regulates Shh pathway activity. Overall, we provide functional evidence for the role of the Shh pathway in mediating feather morphogenesis and confirm its role in the evolutionary emergence and diversification of feathers.

                Background The Japanese central government’s human resource system is a “closed career-based system,” meaning that some ministries/agencies appoint government officials with PhDs in the field of Natural Science to positions responsible for policymaking and comprehensive coordination, similar to administrative officials who are executive candidates, rather than the positions requiring scientific and specialized knowledge. This study aims to clarify the characteristics of PhD-holding government officials, involved in the policymaking process, who possess expertise based on their doctoral degree in the field of Natural Sciences, yet are placed within the same personnel system as administrative officials. The study also aims to provide insights for future personnel systems. Methods A questionnaire survey was distributed among government officials responsible for science and technology policy. The questionnaire focused on tasks such as overall coordination, policymaking, and other general administrative duties. The analysis utilized descriptive statistics based on the perception data collected through the survey, and hypotheses derived from prior studies on administrative expertise were tested through statistical analysis using ordinary least squares (OLS). Result The results of the questionnaire survey revealed no significant differences between PhD-holding officials and others in terms of their perceptions of coordination tasks or the importance of evidence; however, regarding policymaking, PhD-holding officials showed a notable tendency to find greater fulfillment in formulating new policies. The OLS analysis, with the number of new policy proposals as the dependent variable, showed that the presence of a doctoral degree was found to have a significant impact. Conclusions This study suggests that PhD-holding officials utilize their specialized literacy when proposing new policies. The findings imply that leveraging doctoral-holding personnel with not only expertise in scientific knowledge but also specialized literacy and general skills in public institutions could lead to the creation of new innovations.

                Background This study addresses the challenge of stabilizing rice retail prices in Indonesia, a critical staple food across many Asian countries. The government prioritizes price stability to prevent sharp increases that could lead to social unrest due to rice shortages. Approaches to price control are categorized as direct or indirect. Direct controls involve immediate interventions, such as increasing rice stocks through imports to rapidly influence market prices. Indirect controls comprises longer-term measures, like enhancing domestic production capacity to achieve gradual price stability. This study proposes optimization model to determine the optimal volume of rice imports required to minimize bimonthly changes in rice retail prices. Methods A linear programming model is formulated to minimize bimonthly price changes, subject to constraints including local production capacity, import limits, rice flow balance, and demand fulfillment. The monthly retail price is modeled using a compound linear regression approach with ten explanatory variables: rice production, the rupiah-dollar exchange rate, GDP per capita, agricultural land area, harvested dry rice price per kilogram, ground dry rice price per kilogram, domestic rice procurement, rice imports, rice stocks, and monthly rice distribution. The explanatory variable is forecasted using methods best suited to its historical pattern. Results The model was tested using data from 2020 to 2023. The results indicate that bimonthly rice prices increases can be effectively controlled, with maximum inflation rates maintained between 0.42% and 0.53% and a standard deviation ranging from 0.39% to 0.53%. These values are significantly lower than the anticipated inflation rate of 2–3%. Conclusions The optimization model effectively determines the required volume of rice imports to minimize bimonthly retail price fluctuations. By regulating import volumes, excessive price increases can be prevented. Enhanced data-driven forecasting with granular historical data may further improve the accuracy of retail rice price predictions and strengthen price stabilization initiatives.

<p>In the telencephalon, apical specializations such as cilia, primary cilia, and microvilli with varying morphologies were observed. Goblet-like cells, arranged in a single row along the ventricular wall, contained secretory vesicles in their apical regions. Light microscopy demonstrated that these secretory vesicles had a carbohydrate-rich structure, as confirmed by positive alcian blue staining. Ultrastructural analysis revealed detailed cellular features within the ventricular wall. After metamorphosis, changes in the chromatin structure of the cell nucleus and alterations in the myelin sheath structure were observed.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ability of certain tetrapods, such as amphibians, to regenerate complex structures, such as organs or limbs, is well-established, though this capacity varies significantly across species, with humans exhibiting limited regenerative potential. Ependymoglia cells in the ventricular region of the brain are known to exhibit proliferative properties during homeostasis and damage and to perform stem cell functions. This study investigated changes occurring in neurons and glia in the central nervous system following metamorphosis in axolotls. Morphological alterations in brain tissue, newly formed neurons, and cellular organizations in different brain regions were assessed using stereological and immunohistochemical methods, as well as light and electron microscopy. Interestingly, we observe no statistically significant difference in total neuron numbers in the telencephalon region between neotenic and metamorphic axolotls. However, the proliferation index and the numbers of cells expressing NeuN were significantly higher in metamorphic axolotls. Furthermore, structural changes in neuronal nuclei and myelin sheath organization were determined at the light and electron microscopic levels post-metamorphosis. Ultrastructural analyses revealed a change in chromatin organization from euchromatic to heterochromatic in neurons after metamorphosis, and morphological changes were also demonstrated in myelinated nerve fibers in the telencephalon. Additionally, mucopolysaccharide-containing secretory sacs were also identified on the apical surfaces of a subgroup of ependymoglia cells located in the lateral ventricle wall. Overall, this study sheds useful light on the intricate changes occurring in the central nervous system during metamorphosis in axolotls and provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying these processes.</p>

                Tian et al. show that DSCC1 is elevated during S/G2 phase and recruited at the DSBs to facilitate HR repair through ATR-mediated phosphorylation. DSCC1 binds to 53BP1 and prevents 53BP1-dependent recruitment of RIF1, thereby promoting DNA end resection. DSCC1 is a promising therapeutic target to improve the efficiency of PARPis.

                Dai et al. demonstrate that upregulated Slit1 from neurons is required for white matter integrity in neonatal hypoxic mice. They find that secreted Slit1 promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation via activating Robo2-srGAP1-RhoA signaling axis in oligodendrocyte and hypoxia-induced hypomyelination can be rescued by RhoA inhibitor.

Tumors growing within the brain or elsewhere in the body connect with neuronal networks in circuit-specific manners, via neuron-to-cancer synaptic interactions and paracrine crosstalk. Moreover, neural factors govern critical components of the tumor environment, such as the immune system, and cancer can use neural mechanisms in a malignant cell-intrinsic manner. Here we provide a personal view on the burgeoning field of cancer neuroscience and highlight the need to approach cancer research from a neuroscience perspective — together with neuroscientists.

                <p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 20 March 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01894-6">doi:10.1038/s41593-025-01894-6</a></p>Madar et al. report that behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), not spike-timing-dependent plasticity, explains heterogeneous place fields shifting in the hippocampus. The probability of BTSP induction follows patterned dynamics, is higher in new contexts and lower in CA3 than CA1.

                <p>Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Published online: 20 March 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-025-00916-3">doi:10.1038/s41583-025-00916-3</a></p>Identifying the psychological and neurobiological processes underpinning intra-individual variations in choice behaviour presents a formidable challenge. In this Review, Duffy et al. discuss how algorithmic models for teasing apart such sources of variability and advances in behavioural paradigm design and neurally grounded computational modelling are providing new avenues for systematic progress.
