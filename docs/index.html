	<p>Background: Vessel perforation during stent mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is a rare and disastrous complication. A routine rescue strategy includes balloon occlusion for tamponade, procedure suspension, and lowering or normalizing blood pressure. However, this complication is still associated with poor outcome and high mortality. Objective: We present our experience with intra-arterial injection of thrombin in the treatment of vessel perforation secondary to microcatheter/microwire perforation, which prevents further deterioration in clinical outcomes. Methods: Cases with intraprocedural vessel perforation during mechanical thrombectomy were included in the final analysis. Clinical data, procedural details, and radiographic and clinical outcomes were collected. Results: Four patients with intraprocedural vessel perforation were included. Intraprocedural perforations occurred at the distal middle cerebral artery in two cases: the A2 segment in one case and the internal carotid artery terminus in one case. The etiology of four cases was intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS). The ruptured vessels were effectively occluded in all cases. Endovascular therapy was continued in three cases, and mTICI &amp;amp;ge; 2b recanalization was achieved in all cases. The culprit artery was kept patent on CTA for 72 h post-operation. No active bleeding was detected on follow-up CT post-operation. During the 90-day follow-up period, one patient died, modified Rankle Scare (mRS) 3 was observed in two patients, and mRS 4 was observed in one patient. Conclusions: The key benefit of this method is occluding the ruptured vessel without affecting the following MT. We propose that intra-arterial injection of prothrombin may be simple yet effective in managing vessel perforation complications during MT.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Comparing Surrogates to Evaluate Precisely Timed Higher-Order Spike Correlations</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The generation of surrogate data, i.e., the modification of data to destroy a certain feature, can be considered as the implementation of a null-hypothesis whenever an analytical approach is not feasible. Thus, surrogate data generation has been extensively used to assess the significance of spike correlations in parallel spike trains. In this context, one of the main challenges is to properly construct the desired null-hypothesis distribution and to avoid altering the single spike train statistics. A classical surrogate technique is uniform dithering (UD), which displaces spikes locally and uniformly distributed, to destroy temporal properties on a fine timescale while keeping them on a coarser one. Here, we compare UD against five similar surrogate techniques in the context of the detection of significant spatiotemporal spike patterns. We evaluate the surrogates for their performance, first on spike trains based on point process models with constant firing rate, and second on modeled nonstationary artificial data to assess the potential detection of false positive (FP) patterns in a more complex and realistic setting. We determine which statistical features of the spike trains are modified and to which extent. Moreover, we find that UD fails as an appropriate surrogate because it leads to a loss of spikes in the context of binning and clipping, and thus to a large number of FP patterns. The other surrogates achieve a better performance in detecting precisely timed higher-order correlations. Based on these insights, we analyze experimental data from the pre-/motor cortex of macaque monkeys during a reaching-and-grasping task.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Analysis of emergent patterns in crossing flows of pedestrians reveals an invariant of ‘stripe’ formation in human data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pratik Mullick, Sylvain Fontaine, Cécile Appert-Rolland, Anne-Hélène Olivier, William H. Warren, Julien Pettré</p>

When two streams of pedestrians cross at an angle, striped patterns spontaneously emerge as a result of local pedestrian interactions. This clear case of self-organized pattern formation remains to be elucidated. In counterflows, with a crossing angle of 180°, alternating <i>lanes</i> of traffic are commonly observed moving in opposite directions, whereas in crossing flows at an angle of 90°, diagonal <i>stripes</i> have been reported. Naka (1977) hypothesized that stripe orientation is perpendicular to the bisector of the crossing angle. However, studies of crossing flows at acute and obtuse angles remain underdeveloped. We tested the bisector hypothesis in experiments on small groups (18-19 participants each) crossing at seven angles (30° intervals), and analyzed the geometric properties of stripes. We present two novel computational methods for analyzing striped patterns in pedestrian data: (i) an edge-cutting algorithm, which detects the dynamic formation of stripes and allows us to measure local properties of individual stripes; and (ii) a pattern-matching technique, based on the Gabor function, which allows us to estimate global properties (orientation and wavelength) of the striped pattern at a time <i>T</i>. We find an invariant property: stripes in the two groups are parallel and perpendicular to the bisector at all crossing angles. In contrast, other properties depend on the crossing angle: stripe spacing (wavelength), stripe size (number of pedestrians per stripe), and crossing time all decrease as the crossing angle increases from 30° to 180°, whereas the number of stripes increases with crossing angle. We also observe that the width of individual stripes is dynamically squeezed as the two groups cross each other. The findings thus support the bisector hypothesis at a wide range of crossing angles, although the theoretical reasons for this invariant remain unclear. The present results provide empirical constraints on theoretical studies and computational models of crossing flows.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Contextual cues are not unique for motor learning: Task-dependant switching of feedback controllers</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Justinas Česonis, David W. Franklin</p>

The separation of distinct motor memories by contextual cues is a well known and well studied phenomenon of feedforward human motor control. However, there is no clear evidence of such context-induced separation in feedback control. Here we test both experimentally and computationally if context-dependent switching of feedback controllers is possible in the human motor system. Specifically, we probe visuomotor feedback responses of our human participants in two different tasks—stop and hit—and under two different schedules. The first, blocked schedule, is used to measure the behaviour of stop and hit controllers in isolation, showing that it can only be described by two independent controllers with two different sets of control gains. The second, mixed schedule, is then used to compare how such behaviour evolves when participants regularly switch from one task to the other. Our results support our hypothesis that there is contextual switching of feedback controllers, further extending the accumulating evidence of shared features between feedforward and feedback control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inference and dynamic simulation of malaria using a simple climate-driven entomological model of malaria transmission</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Israel Ukawuba, Jeffrey Shaman</p>

Given the crucial role of climate in malaria transmission, many mechanistic models of malaria represent vector biology and the parasite lifecycle as functions of climate variables in order to accurately capture malaria transmission dynamics. Lower dimension mechanistic models that utilize implicit vector dynamics have relied on indirect climate modulation of transmission processes, which compromises investigation of the ecological role played by climate in malaria transmission. In this study, we develop an implicit process-based malaria model with direct climate-mediated modulation of transmission pressure borne through the Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR). The EIR, a measure of the number of infectious bites per person per unit time, includes the effects of vector dynamics, resulting from mosquito development, survivorship, feeding activity and parasite development, all of which are moderated by climate. We combine this EIR-model framework, which is driven by rainfall and temperature, with Bayesian inference methods, and evaluate the model’s ability to simulate local transmission across 42 regions in Rwanda over four years. Our findings indicate that the biologically-motivated, EIR-model framework is capable of accurately simulating seasonal malaria dynamics and capturing of some of the inter-annual variation in malaria incidence. However, the model unsurprisingly failed to reproduce large declines in malaria transmission during 2018 and 2019 due to elevated anti-malaria measures, which were not accounted for in the model structure. The climate-driven transmission model also captured regional variation in malaria incidence across Rwanda’s diverse climate, while identifying key entomological and epidemiological parameters important to seasonal malaria dynamics. In general, this new model construct advances the capabilities of implicitly-forced lower dimension dynamical malaria models by leveraging climate drivers of malaria ecology and transmission.

                <p>by Melanie Duc Bo Massey, Suchinta Arif, Shanukie Embuldeniya, Karma Nanglu, Joseph Bielawski</p>

Undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds (e.g., Black, Indigenous, and people of color [BIPOC], members of the Deaf community, people with disabilities, members of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community, from low-income backgrounds, or underrepresented genders) continue to face exclusion and marginalization in higher education. In this piece, authored and edited by a diverse group of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) scholars, we present 10 simple rules for succeeding as an underrepresented STEM undergraduate student, illuminating the “hidden curriculum” of STEM specifically as it relates to the underrepresented undergraduate experience. Our rules begin by encouraging students to embrace their own distinct identities and scientific voices and explain how students can overcome challenges unique to underrepresented students throughout their undergraduate degrees. These rules are derived from a combination of our own experiences navigating our undergraduate STEM degrees and the growing body of literature on improving success for underrepresented students.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The lexical categorization model: A computational model of left ventral occipito-temporal cortex activation in visual word recognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Benjamin Gagl, Fabio Richlan, Philipp Ludersdorfer, Jona Sassenhagen, Susanne Eisenhauer, Klara Gregorova, Christian J. Fiebach</p>

To characterize the functional role of the left-ventral occipito-temporal cortex (lvOT) during reading in a quantitatively explicit and testable manner, we propose the <i>lexical categorization model</i> (LCM). The LCM assumes that lvOT optimizes linguistic processing by allowing fast meaning access when words are familiar and filtering out orthographic strings without meaning. The LCM successfully simulates benchmark results from functional brain imaging described in the literature. In a second evaluation, we empirically demonstrate that quantitative LCM simulations predict lvOT activation better than alternative models across three functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. We found that word-likeness, assumed as input into a lexical categorization process, is represented posteriorly to lvOT, whereas a dichotomous word/non-word output of the LCM could be localized to the downstream frontal brain regions. Finally, training the process of lexical categorization resulted in more efficient reading. In sum, we propose that word recognition in the ventral visual stream involves word-likeness extraction followed by lexical categorization before one can access word meaning.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The Aedes aegypti siRNA pathway mediates broad-spectrum defense against human pathogenic viruses and modulates antibacterial and antifungal defenses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuemei Dong, Shengzhang Dong, Nahid Borhani Dizaji, Natalie Rutkowski, Tyler Pohlenz, Kevin Myles, George Dimopoulos</p>

The mosquito’s innate immune system defends against a variety of pathogens, and the conserved siRNA pathway plays a central role in the control of viral infections. Here, we show that transgenic overexpression of Dicer2 (<i>Dcr2</i>) or <i>R2d2</i> resulted in an accumulation of 21-nucleotide viral sequences that was accompanied by a significant suppression of dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) replication, thus indicating the broad-spectrum antiviral response mediated by the siRNA pathway that can be applied for the development of novel arbovirus control strategies. Interestingly, overexpression of <i>Dcr2</i> or <i>R2d2</i> regulated the mRNA abundance of a variety of antimicrobial immune genes, pointing to additional functions of DCR2 and R2D2 as well as cross-talk between the siRNA pathway and other immune pathways. Accordingly, transgenic overexpression of <i>Dcr2</i> or <i>R2d2</i> resulted in a lesser proliferation of the midgut microbiota and increased resistance to bacterial and fungal infections.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A lifecourse mendelian randomization study highlights the long-term influence of childhood body size on later life heart structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Katie O’Nunain, Chloe Park, Helena Urquijo, Genevieve M. Leyden, Alun D. Hughes, George Davey Smith, Tom G. Richardson</p>

Children with obesity typically have larger left ventricular heart dimensions during adulthood. However, whether this is due to a persistent effect of adiposity extending into adulthood is challenging to disentangle due to confounding factors throughout the lifecourse. We conducted a multivariable mendelian randomization (MR) study to separate the independent effects of childhood and adult body size on 4 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of heart structure and function in the UK Biobank (UKB) study. Strong evidence of a genetically predicted effect of childhood body size on all measures of adulthood heart structure was identified, which remained robust upon accounting for adult body size using a multivariable MR framework (e.g., left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), Beta = 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23 to 0.43, <i>P</i> = 4.6 × 10<sup>−10</sup>). Sensitivity analyses did not suggest that other lifecourse measures of body composition were responsible for these effects. Conversely, evidence of a genetically predicted effect of childhood body size on various other MRI-based measures, such as fat percentage in the liver (Beta = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.23, <i>P</i> = 0.002) and pancreas (Beta = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.33, <i>P</i> = 3.9 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), attenuated upon accounting for adult body size. Our findings suggest that childhood body size has a long-term (and potentially immutable) influence on heart structure in later life. In contrast, effects of childhood body size on other measures of adulthood organ size and fat percentage evaluated in this study are likely explained by the long-term consequence of remaining overweight throughout the lifecourse.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hyperoside: a review of pharmacological effects [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Hyperoside, also known as quercetin-3-O-β-D-galactopyranoside, belongs to the class of flavonol glycosides. Its aglycon is quercetin, and the sugar base is galactopyranoside. It is made of quercetin. The O atom at the 3rd position of the element is connected to the sugar group by a β-glycosidic bond. Hyperoside, which is widely present in the planted objects, such as the fruits and whole plants of Hypericaceae, Rosaceae, Campanulaceae, Lamiaceae, and Berberis spp., has received extensive attention due to its anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-tumor, and other disease activities, as well as its protective effects on the cardiovascular system, nervous system, digestive system and immune system. While glycosides are a commonly researched topic, there are very few studies on the metabolic pathways, and its overuse and adverse reactions are rarely reported. This article provides a comprehensive review of the pharmacological research results of hyperoside, and a new perspective on the limitations of the existing research on metabolic pathways and toxicology. It provides new ideas for further research and clinical application of hyperoside.

                Background: eHealth makes use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to improve health. In the digital age, the use of eHealth applications and other health-related applications has gained popularity, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the pandemic, many uncertainties have arisen, causing stress and affecting the mental health of many skilled workers in the digital industry, particularly in the ICT, computing, and creative media industries. eHealth applications have the potential to benefit people's health. As a prerequisite for effective implementation of eHealth for mental wellness (EHMW), this paper examines the acceptance of EHMW among digital workers in Malaysia.  The objectives of this research are two-fold: 1) To explore the acceptance of EHMW among digital workers in a local Premier Digital Tech Institution (PDTI), and 2) To explore how these talents' demographic profiles, mental health literacy and workplace wellness influence their acceptance of EHMW.   Methods: This research surveyed 41 digital workers who played vital roles in providing digital skills at a tertiary education level.    Results: Most respondents agreed that eHealth was appropriate for managing mental wellness. Among the three eHealth domains for managing mental wellness, the acceptance level is the highest for the application domain of "interacting for health", with male respondents more likely to accept the use of EHMW.  Conclusions: This small-scale survey could not fully examine the acceptance of eHealth and its usage patterns for mental wellness among digital workers in Malaysia. Future research will target more digital workers in Malaysia. This research addresses the research gap on the eHealth perspectives of digital workers on their acceptance, and the potential influence of demographic profiles, mental health literacy, and workplace wellness on EHMW's acceptance of digital health tools/platforms to promote their mental wellness.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Hyperemesis gravidarum, high transaminases level and prolonged prothrombin time: is it an acute liver injury? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in the first trimester of pregnancy. It is considered a benign condition, but severe complications, fortunately rare, have been reported. Frequently, this condition is associated with a perturbed liver function tests, which remains without severe consequences. The clinical presentation may be suggestive of an acute liver injury (ALI), especially as the end of the first trimester approaches, pregnancy specific and non-specific liver diseases should be considered. Case: A 28-year-old primigravida, 14-week pregnant woman affected by hyperemesis gravidarum, developed high transaminases level and spontaneously low prothrombin time (PT) ratio. An ALI was suspected as transaminases were very high and our patient was at the end of the first trimester. An exhaustive etiological work-up was negative. In the second line, the factor V assay was conducted, which showed a normal activity, and the vitamin K level was low. We therefore concluded that it was hyperhemesis gravidarum complicated by fluid and electrolyte disorders and vitamin K deficiency. She had parenteral rehydration and a proton pump inhibitor. She received intravenous vitamin K 10 mg daily for three days. The outcome was excellent without any maternal or fetal impact. Conclusion: Hyperhemesis gravidarum is a common condition in the first trimester of pregnancy that usually has a favourable outcome. However, it is important to be attentive to possible complications, including vitamin K deficiency with its maternal and fetal consequences.  On the other hand, in case of major disturbance of the liver function tests, we should not overlook acute liver injury and should not hesitate to initiate an adequate etilogical investigation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">HGNChelper: identification and correction of invalid gene symbols for human and mouse [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Gene symbols are recognizable identifiers for gene names but are unstable and error-prone due to aliasing, manual entry, and unintentional conversion by spreadsheets to date format. Official gene symbol resources such as HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) for human genes and the Mouse Genome Informatics project (MGI) for mouse genes provide authoritative sources of valid, aliased, and outdated symbols, but lack a programmatic interface and correction of symbols converted by spreadsheets. We present HGNChelper, an R package that identifies known aliases and outdated gene symbols based on the HGNC human and MGI mouse gene symbol databases, in addition to common mislabeling introduced by spreadsheets, and provides corrections where possible. HGNChelper identified invalid gene symbols in the most recent Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB 7.0) and in platform annotation files of the Gene Expression Omnibus, with prevalence ranging from ~3% in recent platforms to 30-40% in the earliest platforms from 2002-03. HGNChelper is installable from CRAN.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Space environment provides many challenges to pilots, astronauts, and space scientists, which are constantly subjected to unique conditions, including microgravity, radiations, hypoxic condition, absence of the day and night cycle, etc. These stressful stimuli have the potential to affect many human physiological systems, triggering physical and biological adaptive changes to re-establish the homeostatic state. A particular concern regards the risks for the effects of spaceflight on the central nervous system (CNS), as several lines of evidence reported a great impact on neuroplasticity, cognitive functions, neurovestibular system, short-term memory, cephalic fluid shift, reduction in motor function, and psychological disturbances, especially during long-term missions. Aside these potential detrimental effects, the other side of the coin reflects the potential benefit of applicating space-related conditions on Earth-based life sciences, as cancer research. Here, we focused on examining the effect of real and simulated microgravity on CNS functions, both in humans and in cellular models, browsing the different techniques to experience or mime microgravity on-ground. Increasing evidence demonstrate that cancer cells, and brain cancer cells in particular, are negatively affected by microgravity, in terms of alteration in cell morphology, proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis, representing an advancing novel side of space-based investigations. Overall, deeper understandings about the mechanisms by which space environment influences CNS and tumor biology may be promisingly translated into many clinical fields, ranging from aerospace medicine to neuroscience and oncology, representing an enormous pool of knowledge for the implementation of countermeasures and therapeutic applications.</p>

     alt="Effects of 4-month running exercise on the spatial learning ability and white matter volume and microvessels of middle-aged female and male rats"/>
<p>A comprehensive analysis of the effects of 4 months treadmill running on spatial learning ability, white matter volume and the microvessels in the white matter in middle-aged rats revealed actual benefits of exercise at the brain aging of middle-aged female and male rats. This report showed that there were sex differences in the protective effects of the 4-month exercise protocol on spatial learning and white matter volume. 4 months of exercise can protect the microvessels in the white matter of middle-aged rats.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Age-related degeneration of microvessels is known to occur in white matter, and exercise training can enhance brain function and promote cerebral blood flow. However, the effects of exercise training on microvessels in aged white matter are unknown. Forty-one middle-aged male and female Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into a sedentary group and an exercised group. The rats in the exercised group were made to run on treadmills for 4 months. The spatial learning capacities of all groups were then assessed with the Morris water maze. White matter and its microvessels were investigated using immunohistological techniques and stereological methods. In the exercised group, females but not males, showed improved performance over time in the Morris water maze. In females but not males, the exercised rats showed significantly increased white matter volume compared with that of sedentary rats. The total length of microvessels in the white matter in the exercised group was significantly increased compared with that in the sedentary group in both males and females, but the total volume and total surface area of microvessels in the white matter did not differ significantly between the sedentary and exercised rats. Regular treadmill exercise had protective effects on spatial learning capacity, white matter volume, and the total length of microvessels in the white matter in middle-aged female rats and on the total length of microvessels in the white matter in middle-aged male rats. The results obtained might increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which exercise delays brain aging.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Neural consequences of chronic sleep disruption</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies in both humans and animal models call into question the completeness of recovery after chronic sleep disruption. Studies in humans have identified cognitive domains particularly vulnerable to delayed or incomplete recovery after chronic sleep disruption, including sustained vigilance and episodic memory. These findings, in turn, provide a focus for animal model studies to critically test the lasting impact of sleep loss on the brain. Here, we summarize the human response to sleep disruption and then discuss recent findings in animal models examining recovery responses in circuits pertinent to vigilance and memory.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Heavy isotope labeling and mass spectrometry reveal unexpected remodeling of bacterial cell wall expansion in response to drugs</a></h4>

              
                Antibiotics of the β-lactam (penicillin) family inactivate target enzymes called D,D-transpeptidases or penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that catalyze the last cross-linking step of peptidoglycan synthesis. The resulting net-like macromolecule is the essential component of bacterial cell walls that sustains the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm. In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, bypass of PBPs by the YcbB L,D-transpeptidase leads to resistance to these drugs. We developed a new method based on heavy isotope labeling and mass spectrometry to elucidate PBP- and YcbB-mediated peptidoglycan polymerization. PBPs and YcbB similarly participated in single-strand insertion of glycan chains into the expanding bacterial side wall. This absence of any transpeptidase-specific signature suggests that the peptidoglycan expansion mode is determined by other components of polymerization complexes. YcbB did mediate β-lactam resistance by insertion of multiple strands that were exclusively cross-linked to existing tripeptide-containing acceptors. We propose that this undocumented mode of polymerization depends upon accumulation of linear glycan chains due to PBP inactivation,  formation of tripeptides due to cleavage of existing cross-links by a β-lactam-insensitive endopeptidase, and concerted cross-linking by YcbB.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hypoxia controls plasma membrane targeting of polarity proteins by dynamic turnover of PI4P and PI(4,5)P2</a></h4>

              
                Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) are key phosphoinositides that determine the identity of the plasma membrane (PM) and regulate numerous key biological events there. To date, mechanisms regulating the homeostasis and dynamic turnover of PM PI4P and PIP2 in response to various physiological conditions and stresses remain to be fully elucidated. Here we report that hypoxia in <i>Drosophila</i> induces acute and reversible depletion of PM PI4P and PIP2 that severely disrupts the electrostatic PM targeting of multiple polybasic polarity proteins. Genetically encoded ATP sensors confirmed that hypoxia induces acute and reversible reduction of cellular ATP levels which showed a strong real-time correlation with the levels of PM PI4P and PIP2 in cultured cells. By combining genetic manipulations with quantitative imaging assays we showed that PI4KIIIα, as well as Rbo/EFR3 and TTC7 that are essential for targeting PI4KIIIα to PM, are required for maintaining the homeostasis and dynamic turnover of PM PI4P and PIP2 under normoxia and hypoxia. Our results revealed that in cells challenged by energetic stresses triggered by hypoxia, ATP inhibition and possibly ischemia, dramatic turnover of PM PI4P and PIP2 could have profound impact on many cellular processes including electrostatic PM targeting of numerous polybasic proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Towards a unified model of naive T cell dynamics across the lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Naive CD4 and CD8 T cells are cornerstones of adaptive immunity, but the dynamics of their establishment early in life and how their kinetics change as they mature following release from the thymus are poorly understood. Further, due to the diverse signals implicated in naive T cell survival, it has been a long-held and conceptually attractive view that they are sustained by active homeostatic control as thymic activity wanes. Here we employ multiple experimental systems to identify a unified model of naive CD4 and CD8 T cell population dynamics in mice, across their lifespan. We infer that both subsets divide rarely and progressively increase their survival capacity with cell age. Strikingly, this simple model is able to describe naive CD4 T cell dynamics throughout life. In contrast, we find that newly generated naive CD8 T cells are lost more rapidly during the first 3-4 weeks of life, likely due to increased recruitment into memory. We find no evidence for elevated division rates in neonates, or for feedback regulation of naive T cell numbers at any age. We show how confronting mathematical models with diverse datasets can reveal a quantitative and remarkably simple picture of naive T cell dynamics in mice from birth into old age.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dynamic spreading of chromatin-mediated gene silencing and reactivation between neighboring genes in single cells</a></h4>

              
                In mammalian cells genes that are in close proximity can be transcriptionally coupled: silencing or activating one gene can affect its neighbors. Understanding these dynamics is important for natural processes, such as heterochromatin spreading during development and aging, and when designing synthetic gene regulation circuits. Here, we systematically dissect this process in single cells by recruiting and releasing repressive chromatin regulators at dual-gene synthetic reporters, and measuring how fast gene silencing and reactivation spread as a function of intergenic distance and configuration of insulator elements. We find that silencing by KRAB, associated with histone methylation, spreads between two genes within hours, with a time delay that increases with distance. This fast KRAB-mediated spreading is not blocked by the classical cHS4 insulators. Silencing by histone deacetylase HDAC4 of the upstream gene can also facilitate background silencing of the downstream gene by PRC2, but with a days-long delay that does not change with distance. This slower silencing can sometimes be stopped by insulators. Gene reactivation of neighboring genes is also coupled, with strong promoters and insulators determining the order of reactivation. Our data can be described by a model of multi-gene regulation that builds upon previous knowledge of heterochromatin spreading, where both gene silencing and gene reactivation can act at a distance, allowing for coordinated dynamics via chromatin regulator recruitment.

                The adult subventricular zone is one of the two neurogenic niches that continuously produce newborn neurons. Here we show that serine racemase (SR), an enzyme that catalyzes the racemization of L-serine to D-serine and vice versa, affects neurogenesis in the adult SVZ by controlling de novo fatty acid synthesis. Complete and conditional deletion of SR in nestin precursor cells lead to diminished neurogenesis in the SVZ. Nestin-cre+ mice showed reduced expression of fatty acid synthase and its substrate malonyl CoA, which are involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis. Global lipidomic analyses revealed significant alterations in lipid subclasses in nestin-cre+ mice. Decrease in fatty acid synthesis was mediated by phospho acetyl CoA carboxylase that was AMPK independent. Both L and D serine treatment rescued defects in SVZ neurogenesis, proliferation and levels of malonyl CoA in vitro. Our work shows that SR affects adult neurogenesis in the SVZ via lipid metabolism.

                A complete neuroscience requires multi-level theories that address phenomena ranging from higher-level cognitive behaviors to activities within a cell. A levels-of-mechanism approach that decomposes a higher-level model of cognition and behavior into component mechanisms provides a coherent and richer understanding of the system than any level alone. Toward this end, we decomposed a cognitive model into neuron-like units using a neural flocking approach that parallels recurrent hippocampal activity. Neural flocking coordinates units that collectively form higher-level mental constructs. The decomposed model suggested how brain-scale neural populations coordinate to form assemblies encoding concept and spatial representations, and why so many neurons are needed for robust performance at the cognitive level. This multi-level explanation provides a way to understand how cognition and symbol-like representations are supported by coordinated neural populations (assemblies) formed through learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-related learning and working memory impairment in the common marmoset</a></h4>

              
                Aging is the greatest risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, yet we still do not understand how the aging process leads to pathological vulnerability. The research community has relied heavily on mouse models, but the considerable anatomical, physiological, and cognitive differences between mice and humans limit their translational relevance. Ultimately, these barriers necessitate the development of novel aging models. As a non-human primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) shares many features in common with humans and yet has a significantly shorter lifespan (10 years) than other primates, making it ideally suited to longitudinal studies of aging. Our objective was to evaluate the marmoset as a model of age-related cognitive impairment. To do this, we utilized the Delayed Recognition Span Task (DRST) to characterize age-related changes in working memory capacity in a cohort of sixteen marmosets varying in age from young adult to geriatric. These monkeys performed thousands of trials over periods of time ranging up to 50 percent of their adult lifespan. To our knowledge, this represents the most thorough cognitive profiling of any marmoset aging study conducted to-date. By analyzing individual learning curves, we found that aged animals exhibited delayed onset of learning, slowed learning rate after onset, and decreased asymptotic working memory performance. These findings are not accounted for by age-related impairments in motor speed and motivation. This work firmly establishes the marmoset as a model of age-related cognitive impairment.

                Empirical and computational methods were combined to examine whether individual or dual-drug treatments can restore the deficit in long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF) of the Aplysia sensorimotor synapse observed in a molecular model of Coffin-Lowry Syndrome (CLS). The model was produced by pharmacological inhibition of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) activity. Simultaneous treatment with an activator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoform ERK and an activator of protein kinase A (PKA) resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of RSK and LTF to a greater extent than either drug alone and greater than their additive effects. Indeed, the combined drugs exerted synergistic effects on both RSK activation and LTF, fully restoring RSK phosphorylation and LTF. The extent of synergism appeared to depend on another MAPK isoform, p38 MAPK. Inhibition of p38 MAPK facilitated serotonin (5-HT)-induced RSK phosphorylation, indicating that p38 MAPK inhibits activation of RSK. Inhibition of p38 MAPK combined with activation of PKA synergistically activated RSK.

                3D EM connectomics image volumes are now surpassing sizes of 1 mm3, and are therefore beginning to contain multiple meaningful spatial scales of brain circuitry simultaneously. However, the sheer density of information in such datasets makes the development of unbiased, scalable machine learning techniques a necessity for extracting novel insights without extremely time-consuming, intensive labor. In this paper, we present SynapseCLR, a self-supervised contrastive representation learning method for 3D electron microscopy (EM) data, and use the method to extract feature representations of synapses from a 3D EM dataset from mouse visual cortex. We show that our representations separate synapses according to both their overall physical appearance and structural annotations of known functional importance. We further demonstrate the utility of our methodology for several valuable downstream tasks for the growing field of 3D EM connectomics. These include one-shot identification of defective synapse segmentations, dataset-wide similarity-based querying, and accurate imputation of annotations for unlabeled synapses, using only manual annotation of 0.2% of synapses in the dataset. In particular, we show that excitatory vs. inhibitory neuronal cell types can be assigned to individual synapses and highly truncated neurites with accuracy exceeding 99.8%, making this population accessible to connectomics analysis. Finally, we present a data-driven and unsupervised study of the manifold of synaptic structural variation, revealing its intrinsic axes of variation and showing that synapse structure is also strongly correlated with inhibitory neuronal subtypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Measures of Implicit and Explicit Adaptation Do Not Linearly Add</a></h4>

              
                Both implicit (unconscious, automatic) and explicit (effortful, strategic) processes contribute to various kinds of learning, including visuomotor adaptation. Implicit adaptation may be capped at some level, regardless of the level of explicit adaptation, or implicit and explicit adaptation could be linearly added in total adaptation. Both appear well accepted, but ironically contradict each other. In the latter case, the equation used is simple: 1) adaptation ~= implicit + explicit, Which is used to "predict" that implicit adaptation is perfectly anti-correlated with explicit adaptation: 2) implicit ~= adaptation - explicit. This derived implicit adaptation is sometimes further analyzed. But the underlying additivity assumption is not always replicated and is considered the "least robust" assumption in motor adaptation. Here we directly test the additivity assumption, particularly how well it predicts implicit adaptation. We find that the relationship between explicit and implicit adaptation is not additive but more complicated and very noisy, which means that future studies should measure both implicit and explicit adaptation directly. It also highlights a challenge to the field to disentangle how various motor adaptation processes combine when producing movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Poor decision-makers motivation, working memory performance, and repartition across two rat inbred strains</a></h4>

              
                A minority of healthy individuals exhibit a combination of behavioral traits reminiscent, at least in part, of addiction and predicting poor decision-making (DM), namely motor impulsivity, inflexibility, risk-taking, and higher motivation in Wistar Han rats. Two behavioral features, motivation and working memory, play a role in DM capacities although the precise relationship is not entirely known. Additionally, we previously reported that neurotransmitters e.g., dopamine - modulation was tightly linked to poor DM. The goal of the study was to investigate the detailed motivational functions involved in poor DM including saccharin intake and reward-seeking/incentive behaviors under different internal states i.e., ad libitum or food-deprived. Maze-based spatial working memory was also evaluated. Moreover, two rat inbred strains, Lewis and Fisher 344 (F344) rats, known for modeling vulnerability to drug addiction and affected by substantial variations in the mesolimbic dopaminergic route, were run in the decision-making task (Rat Gambling Task, RGT). We found that Wistar Han poor decision-makers (NPERF) display higher saccharin intake levels and a drastic increased reward-seeking behavior on a fixed schedule. NPERF were not more sensitive to the internal state in responding to saccharin delivery in fixed and progressive schedules. A few relationships were found within motivation functions, and with DM, that is a positive correlation between saccharin intake and reward-seeking behavior, and two negative correlations between saccharin intake; reward-seeking, and DM. NPERF were significantly not impaired in working memory. Lewis and F344 rats performed fewer nose-pokes visits during the RGT compared to Wistar Han rats, and improved performance early in the task. A higher proportion of NPERF was observed in Lewis as compared to F344 rats. Altogether, these findings complete the preclinical panel of behavioral functions that relate to poor decision-making and extend a presumed role of dopamine in such processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Conscientiousness associated with efficiency of the salience/ventral attention network: Replication in three samples using individualized parcellation</a></h4>

              
                Previous research in the field of personality neuroscience has identified associations of conscientiousness and related constructs like impulsivity and self-control with structural and functional properties of particular regions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and insula. Network-based conceptions of brain function suggest that these regions probably belong to a single large-scale network, labeled the salience/ventral attention network (SVAN). The current study tested associations between conscientiousness and resting-state functional connectivity in this network using two community samples (N = 244 and 239) and data from the Human Connectome Project (N = 1000). Individualized parcellation was used to improve the accuracy of functional localization and to facilitate replication. Functional connectivity was measured using an index of network efficiency, a graph theoretical measure quantifying the capacity for parallel information transfer within a network. Efficiency of a set of parcels in the SVAN was significantly associated with conscientiousness in all samples. Findings are consistent with a theory of conscientiousness as a function of variation in neural networks underlying effective prioritization of goals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Discovery of synapse-specific RNA N6-methyladenosine readers associated with the consolidation of fear extinction memory</a></h4>

              
                The RNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is critically involved in the regulation of gene activity underlying experience-dependent plasticity, and is necessary for the functional interplay between RNA and RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in the nucleus. However, the complete repertoire of m6A-modified RNA interacting RBPs in the synaptic compartment, and whether they are involved in fear extinction, have yet to be revealed. Using RNA immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry, we discovered 12 novel, synapse-specific, learning-induced m6A readers in the medial prefrontal cortex of male C57/B6 mice. m6A RNA-sequencing also revealed a unique population of learning-related m6A-modified RNAs at the synapse, which includes a variant of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1). m6A-modified Malat1 binds to a subset of novel m6A readers, including cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2) and dihydropyrimidase-related protein 2 (DPYSL2) and a cell-type-specific, state-dependent, and synapse-specific reduction in m6A-modified Malat1 disrupts the interaction between Malat1 and DPYSL2 and impairs fear extinction. The consolidation of fear-extinction memory therefore relies on an interaction between m6A-modified Malat1 and select RBPs in the synaptic compartment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robust enhancement of motor sequence learning with 4mA transcranial electric stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Background and Objectives: Motor learning experiments with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) at 2mA have produced mixed results. We hypothesize that tDCS will boost motor learning provided sufficiently high field intensity on the motor cortex. Methods: In a single-blinded, between-subject design, 72 healthy right-handed participants received either anodal or cathodal tDCS at 4mA while they learned to perform a sequence of key presses using their non-dominant hand for about 12 minutes. Cathodal stimulation served as an active control for sensation. A separate sham-stimulation group established baseline performance. Gains during practice and rest periods were analyzed (called micro-online and -offline learning). The target for stimulation was identified on the motor cortex using fMRI. After optimization with individual current flow models, we selected a single montage for all 108 participants with 4 frontal and 4 parietal electrodes each drawing 1mA. Results: We found significant gains in performance with anodal stimulation (Cohen's d=0.7). The boost in performance persisted for at least one hour. Subsequent learning for a new sequence and the opposite hand also improved. Concurrent tDCS enhanced micro-offline learning, while subsequent learning relied on micro-online gains. Sensation ratings were comparable in the active groups and did not exceed moderate levels. The new electrode montage achieved a better tradeoff between stimulation intensity and sensations on the scalp as compared to alternative montages. Conclusion: The present paradigm shows reliable behavioral effects at 4mA and is well-tolerated. It may serve as a go-to experiment for future studies on motor learning and tDCS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An ecological investigation of the capacity to follow simultaneous speech and preferential detection of ones' own name</a></h4>

              
                Many situations require focusing attention on one speaker, while monitoring the environment for potentially important information. Some have proposed that dividing attention among two speakers involves behavioral tradeoffs, due to limited cognitive resources. However the severity of these tradeoffs, particularly under ecologically-valid circumstances, is not well understood. We investigated the capacity to process simultaneous speech using a dual-task paradigm simulating task demands and stimuli encountered in real-life. Participants listened to conversational narratives (Narrative Stream) and monitored a stream of announcements (Barista Stream), to detect when their order was called. We measured participants' performance, neural activity and skin conductance as they engaged in this dual-task. Participants achieved extremely high dual-task accuracy, with no apparent behavioral tradeoffs. Moreover, robust neural and physiological responses were observed for target-stimuli in the Barista Stream, alongside significant neural speech-tracking of the Narrative Stream. These results suggest that humans have substantial capacity to process simultaneous speech and do not suffer from insufficient processing resources, at least for this highly ecological task-combination and level of perceptual load. Results also confirmed the ecological validity of the advantage for detecting ones' own name at the behavioral, neural and physiological level, highlighting the contribution of personal relevance when processing simultaneous speech.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alterations in neural stem cell quiescence and activation in the 3xTG-AD model of Alzheimers Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with progressive cognitive deficits and mood disorders (Knopman et al., 2021). Recent studies have associated AD pathology with the impairment of adult neurogenesis, as indicated by impaired neural stem cell (NSCs) homeostasis (Bond et al., 2015). Recent work has further associated AD progression with a decline in the number and maturation of adult-born neurons in the SGZ, distinct from typical age-related decline (Moreno-Jimenez et al., 2019). In 3xTG-AD mice, a well-established mouse model of AD, our and other groups have demonstrated impairments to NSC pool and neural progenitor proliferation, as well as adult-born neurons, before the onset of A{beta} plaques and NFTs (Hamilton et al., 2010, 2015; Rodr[l]guez; et al., 2008, 2009). However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the functional impairment of adult NSCs remain to be resolved. Here, we employ single-cell RNA-Seq to establish population-specific defects in the 3xTG-AD mouse model during adult SGZ neurogenesis. Relative to control mice, we observe a dramatic AD-induced decrease in the primed and activated NSC population, which results in a progressive loss of cells committed to neurogenesis. Transcriptome measurements suggest that 3xTG-AD NSCs and their progeny represent enhanced ribosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis, and disturbed Notch signaling pathway. RNA velocity analysis reveals reduced NSC activation as evidenced by a large fraction of Ascl1-postive cells, instead of entering cell cycle, returning to the primed and quiescent state. This is further supported by reduced numbers of Lpar1-expressing cells, a marker of neural progenitor cells, in the SGZ. Our work explores, at a stage-specific resolution, changes in the regulatory networks guiding adult neurogenesis, and identifies niche disturbances in the regulation of NSC quiescence and activation. These NSC deficits underlying impaired neurogenesis identified in AD mice, may be key contributors underlying the compromised hippocampal function in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">hnRNP R is a regulator of stress granule formation</a></h4>

              
                hnRNP R (Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins R) is one member of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in hnRNP family, it plays important role in nucleic acid metabolism including alternative splicing, mRNA stabilization, transcriptional and translational regulation, and mRNA transport. Mostly hnRNP R is localized in nuclear and extensively binds with RNA and chromatin, but still some part of it exports to cytosol. We found that long and short isoform hnRNP R can located in stress granules, depletion hnRNP R can facilitate the stress granule formation and accelerate mRNA in the stress granules. Meanwhile we found that depletion hnRNP R can alter the stress granule phenotype and impair stress granule resolving. Additionally, we also found that depletion hnRNP R also induce TDP43 granules formation. Furthermore, depletion hnRNP R can impair TDP43 binding with ribosome. Altogether, hnRNP R plays important role in the stress granule formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ATAC and histone H3K9me3 landscapes revealed the altered epigenome by fetal-neonatal iron deficiency in the adult male rat hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Iron deficiency during the fetal-neonatal period results in long-term neurodevelopmental impairments associated with pervasive and widespread hippocampal gene dysregulation. Globally, fetal-neonatal iron deficiency produces both long-term activation and repression of hundreds of loci in the adult rat hippocampus. Prenatal choline (a methyl donor) supplementation can partially reverse these effects, suggesting an interaction between iron and choline in regulating the hippocampal transcriptome. To gain insights into the underlying epigenetic signatures, we integrate hippocampal transcriptomes and epigenetic marks of active (transposase accessible chromatin/ATAC) and repressed (H3K9me3 enrichment) genes in adult rats that had been exposed to fetal-neonatal iron deficiency with or without prenatal choline supplementation. Rats were made iron-deficient during fetal and neonatal period by limiting maternal iron intake from gestational day (G) 2 through postnatal day (P) 7. Choline (5.5 g/kg) was given to half of the pregnant dams during G11-18. This paradigm produced four comparison groups (Iron-sufficient [IS], Iron-deficient [ID], IS+choline [ISch], and ID+choline [IDch]). Hippocampi were collected from P65 males and analyzed for changes in chromatin conformation and histone H3K9me3 enrichment. ATAC-seq results accounted for 22% and 24%, whereas H3K9me3 enrichment accounted for 1.7% and 13% of differences in ID- and IDch-altered gene expression. These epigenetic changes were annotated onto gene networks regulating synaptic structure and plasticity, neuroinflammation, and reward circuits. The low correlation between gene dysregulation and changes in ATAC or H3K9me3 signatures indicate involvements of other epigenetic modifications. This study provides a genome-wide findings of stable epigenetic changes and lays a foundation for further analyses to elucidate more fully iron-dependent epigenetic mechanisms that underlie iron deficiency, choline supplementation, and their interactions in mediating long-term neural gene dysregulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Developmental history modulates adult olfactory behavioral preferences via regulation of chemoreceptor expression in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Developmental experiences play critical roles in shaping adult physiology and behavior. We and others previously showed that adult C. elegans which transiently experienced dauer arrest during development (PD: post-dauer) exhibit distinct gene expression profiles as compared to control adults which bypassed the dauer stage. In particular, the expression patterns of subsets of chemoreceptor genes are markedly altered in PD adults. Whether altered chemoreceptor levels drive behavioral plasticity in PD adults is unknown. Here we show that PD adults exhibit enhanced attraction to a panel of food-related attractive volatile odorants including the bacterially-produced chemical diacetyl. Diacetyl-evoked responses in the AWA olfactory neuron pair are increased in both dauer larvae and PD adults, and we find that these increased responses are correlated with upregulation of the diacetyl receptor ODR-10 in AWA likely via both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. We show that transcriptional upregulation of odr-10 expression in dauer larvae is in part mediated by the DAF-16 FOXO transcription factor. Via transcriptional profiling of sorted populations of AWA neurons from control and PD adults, we further show that the expression of a subset of additional chemoreceptor genes in AWA is regulated similarly to odr-10 in PD animals. Our results suggest that developmental experiences may be encoded at the level of olfactory receptor regulation, and provide a simple mechanism by which C. elegans is able to precisely modulate its behavioral preferences as a function of its current and past experiences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Investigating mouse motor coordination using quantitative trait locus analysis to model the genetic underpinnings of developmental coordination disorder</a></h4>

              
                The fundamental skills for motor coordination and motor control emerge through development, from infancy to late childhood years. Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) lead to impaired acquisition of motor skills. This study investigated motor behaviors that reflect the core symptoms of human DCD through the use of BXD recombinant inbred lines of mice that are known to have divergent phenotypes in many behavioral traits, including motor activity. We sought to correlate behavior in basic motor control tasks with the known genotypes of these reference populations of mice using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. We used twelve BXD lines with an average of 16 mice per group to assess the onset of reflexes during the early neonatal stage of life and differences in motor coordination using the open field, rotarod, and gait analyses during the adolescent/young adulthood period. Results indicated significant variability between lines in as to when neonatal reflexes appeared as well as significant line differences for all measures of motor coordination. Five lines (BXD15, BXD27, BXD28, BXD75, and BXD86) struggled with sensorimotor coordination as seen in gait analysis, rotarod, and open field, similar to human presentation of DCD. We identified three significant quantitative trait loci for gait on proximal Chr 3, Chr 4 and distal Chr 6. Based on expression, function, and polymorphism within the mapped QTL intervals, 7 candidate genes (Gpr63, Spata5, Trpc3, Cntn6, Chl1, Grm7 and Ogg1) emerged.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effects of data quantity on performance of temporal response function analyses of natural speech processing</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, temporal response function (TRF) analyses of non-invasive recordings of neural activity evoked by continuous naturalistic stimuli have become increasingly popular for characterizing response properties within the auditory hierarchy. However, despite this rise in TRF usage, relatively few educational resources for these tools exist. Here we use a dual-talker continuous speech paradigm to demonstrate how a key parameter of experimental design, the quantity of acquired data, influences TRF analyses fit to either individual data (subject-specific analyses), or group data (generic analyses). We show that although model performance monotonically increases with data quantity, the amount of data required to achieve significant prediction accuracies can vary substantially based on whether the fitted model contains densely (e.g., acoustic envelope) or sparsely (e.g., lexical surprisal) spaced features, especially when the goal of the analyses is to capture the aspect of neural responses that co-vary with the amplitude of the modelled features. Moreover, we demonstrate that generic models can exhibit high performance on small amounts of test data (4-8 min), as long as they are trained on a sufficiently large data set. As such, they may be particularly useful for clinical and multi-task study designs. Finally, we show that the regularization procedure used in fitting TRF models can interact with the quantity of data used to fit the models, with larger training quantities resulting in systematically larger TRF amplitudes. Together, demonstrations in this work should aid the learning process of new users of TRF analyses, and in combination with other tools, such as piloting and power analyses, may serve as a detailed reference for choosing acquisition duration in future studies.

                Little is known about how exposure to limited socioeconomic resources (SER) in childhood gets "under the skin" to shape brain development, especially using rigorous whole-brain multivariate methods in large, adequately powered samples. The present study examined resting state functional connectivity patterns from 5,821 youth in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, employing multivariate methods across three levels: whole-brain, network-wise, and connection-wise. Across all three levels, SER was associated with widespread alterations across the connectome. We found that parental education was the primary driver of neural effects of SER, with notable concentrations in somatosensory and subcortical regions. Moreover, parental education associations with the developing connectome were partially accounted for by home enrichment activities, child's cognitive abilities, and child's grades, indicating interwoven links between parental education, child stimulation, and child cognitive performance. These results add a new data-driven, multivariate perspective on links between household SER and the child's developing functional connectome.

                Astrocytes exhibit regional heterogeneity in morphology, function and molecular composition to support and modulate neuronal function and signaling in a region-specific manner. To characterize regional heterogeneity of astrocytic proteomes of different brain regions we established an Aldh1l1-MetRSL274G mouse line that allows cell-type specific labeling of newly synthesized proteins in vivo and analyzed astrocytic proteins from four different brain regions by mass spectrometry. Identified proteins are specific for astrocytes and show a high overlap with proteins compiled in AstroProt, a newly established database for astrocytic proteins. Gene enrichment analysis reveals high overlap among brain regions, and only subtle changes in abundances of key astrocytic proteins for hippocampus, cortex and striatum. However, the cerebellar proteome stands out with proteins being associated with calcium signaling or bipolar disorder. Subregional differences of translation dynamics in single hippocampal astrocytes indicates distinct subregional heterogeneity and highlights the applicability of our toolbox to study dynamic astrocytic proteomes in vivo.

                While action language and motor imagery both engage the motor system, determining whether these two processes indeed share the same motor representations would contribute to better understanding their underlying mechanisms. We conducted two experiments probing the mutual influence of these two processes. In Exp.1, hand-action verbs were presented subliminally, and participants (n=36) selected the verb they thought they perceived from two alternatives. When congruent actions were imagined prior to this task, accuracy significantly increased, i.e. participants were better able to "see" the subliminal verbs. In Exp.2, participants (n=19) imagined hand flexion or extension, while corticospinal excitability was measured via transcranial magnetic stimulation. Corticospinal excitability was modulated by action verbs subliminally presented prior to imagery. Specifically, the typical increase observed during imagery was suppressed after presentation of incongruent action verbs. This mutual influence of action language and motor imagery, both at behavioral and neurophysiological levels, suggests overlapping motor representations.

                The hippocampal CA3 subregion is a densely connected recurrent circuit that supports memory consolidation and retrieval by generating and storing sequential neuronal activity patterns that reflect recent experience. The encoding of precise temporal firing patterns in CA3 ensembles during awake-behavior is supported by phase precession, in which spike timing shifts with reference to local theta oscillations that are prominent in the hippocampus during active learning. Although phase precession is thought to be critical for generating sequential activity during memory encoding, the circuit mechanisms that support this computation across hippocampal subregions are unknown. By assessing CA3 network activity in the absence of each of its theta modulated excitatory inputs, the dentate gyrus (DG) and the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), we show necessary and unique contributions of each region to phase precession. DG inputs to the CA3 circuit are essential for organizing the temporal order of neuronal firing by promoting the expression of prospective "look-ahead" sequential spiking during theta states. In contrast, MEC inputs to CA3 modulate the gain of excitation and increase the precision of phase precession, but are not necessary for generating the temporally ordered activity of CA3 neurons. We propose a simple computational model that accounts for the empirical findings by proposing different effects of each of the feedforward pathways on inhibitory subnetworks. DG inputs affect the phase and MEC inputs affect the amplitude of the inhibitory theta signal. Our results thus describe circuit mechanisms that are required for the generation of sequence coding in the CA3 recurrent circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Feedforward attentional selection in sensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Salient objects stand out (pop-out) from their surroundings, grabbing our attention. Whether this phenomenon is a consequence of bottom-up sensory processing or predicated on top-down influence is debated. We show that the neural computation of attentional pop-out is embedded in the earliest cortical sensory response, seemingly void of feedback from higher-level areas. We measured synaptic and spiking activity across cortical columns in mid-level area V4 of monkeys searching for an attention-grabbing stimulus. Indexed by reaction times and behavioral accuracy, attention was captured at variable times. This moment of attentional capture occurred within the earliest feedforward response, both in terms of timing and spatial location. Moreover, the magnitude of the earliest sensory response predicted reaction times. Crucially, errant attentional selection and consequent behavior was associated with errant selection in sensory cortex. Together, these findings demonstrate a dominant role for feedforward activation of sensory cortex for dictating attentional priority and subsequent behavior.

                The mechanisms underlying visual anomalies observed in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), presenting in the form of impaired global visual perception and enhanced local perception have long been debated. Researchers have sought to investigate the phenomenon of surround suppression, the inhibitory mechanism responsible for filtering visual noise in high contrast stimuli of increasing size. Mixed results have shown impaired gain control reduces surround suppression allowing for improved motion inspection in certain conditions, along with the possibility that receptive field size and population varies among the ASD population producing size-specific alteration in motion inspection. The present study aims to investigate whether the level of autistic traits predicts motion inspection time performance in a random dot kinetogram (RDK), a function of stimulus size and contrast. A total of 12 typically developing (TD) participants were screened and grouped by AQ score to indicate level of autistic traits (low, medium and high). Results revealed that the high AQ groups motion inspection time significantly outperformed the mid AQ group for small and large central RDK of low contrast. This result suggests an interaction between temporal and spatial processing may have masked the effects of gain control and impaired surround suppression in higher contrast conditions, often seen in previous studies.

                Aggregation of -Synuclein (-Syn) drives Parkinson's disease, although the initial stages of self-assembly and structural conversion have not been captured inside neurons. We track the intracellular conformational states of -Syn utilizing a single-molecule FRET biosensor, and show that -Syn converts from its monomeric state to form two distinct oligomeric states in neurons in a concentration dependent, and sequence specific manner. 3D FRET-CLEM reveals the structural organization, and location of aggregation hotspots inside the cell. Notably multiple intracellular seeding events occur preferentially on membrane surfaces, especially mitochondrial membranes. The mitochondrial lipid, cardiolipin triggers rapid oligomerization of A53T -Syn, and cardiolipin is sequestered within aggregating lipid-protein complexes. Mitochondrial aggregates impair complex I activity and increase mitochondrial ROS generation, which accelerates the oligomerization of A53T -Syn, and ultimately causes permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes, and cell death. Patient iPSC derived neurons harboring A53T mutations exhibit accelerated oligomerization that is dependent on mitochondrial ROS, early mitochondrial permeabilization and neuronal death. Our study highlights a mechanism of de novo oligomerization at the mitochondria and its induction of neuronal toxicity.

                The mammalian Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2) family consists of 4 different CAMK2 genes, encoding CAMK2A, CAMK2B, CAMK2D and CAMK2G, which have high structural homology. CAMK2A and CAMK2B are abundantly expressed in the brain; they play a unique role in proper neuronal functioning, since both CAMK2A and CAMK2B knockout mice show several behavioural and cellular phenotypes. However, our recent finding that deletion of both CAMK2A and CAMK2B is lethal indicates that they show redundancy and that the full spectrum of CAMK2 function in neurons remains to be uncovered. For example, it still remains unclear which overlapping functions are present at a single cell level in neuronal transmission and excitability. In order to get more insight into the full spectrum of CAMK2 functions in neurons, we performed whole-cell patch clamp experiments in inducible Camk2a/Camk2b double knockout mice, as well as the CAMK2A and CAMK2B knockout mice. We found that whereas deletion of only CAMK2A or CAMK2B did not change excitability, simultaneous deletion of CAMK2A and CAMK2B resulted in a decrease in excitability 10 days after deletion in CA1 pyramidal neurons, which reversed to increased excitability 21 days after deletion. Additionally, loss of both CAMK2A and CAMK2B resulted in a decreased frequency of both miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC and mIPSC) 21 days after deletion, but not 10 days after deletion, an effect not seen in the single mutants. Our results indicate that CAMK2 is critically important to maintain normal excitability of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, as well as normal inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission. Together, these results lead to new insights in how CAMK2 regulates normal neuronal function and highlight the importance of having both CAMK2A and CAMK2B expressed in high levels in the brain.

                Current clinical diagnosis of major depression is solely based on subjective symptoms and signs rather than the underlying biological mechanisms, which has hindered the improvement in treatment effectiveness and outcomes. Redefining and subtyping MDD based on neural circuits has been an emerging consensus. Here, we developed EH-BrainNN, a novel ensemble hybrid deep-learning framework based on graph neural network for redefining and subtyping of MDD with the brain's "fingerprinting", i.e. nuanced functional connectivity profiles. With a supervised classifier, we comprehensively validated that our classifier showed a high generalization of 75% for leave-one-site-out cross validation with one of the largest MDD dataset which included 2428 participants recruited from 25 independent sites. The graph embedding features obtained from the supervised classifier was then employed for subtyping of MDD with an unsupervised clustering by fast search and find of density peaks (CFDP) approach. With this framework, we obtained three biologically homogenous MDD subtypes characterized by impairments in subcortical-limbic, DMN-FPN, VN-SMN circuits, respectively. Notably, we demonstrated that subtyping of MDD according to graph embedding features showed high robustness and reproducibility when CFDP was replicated for each site separately. The proposed framework is not only essential for redefining and subtyping of MDD, but also paves the way towards precision medicine of mental disorders.

                Background: Speech decoding, one of the most intriguing BCI applications, opens up plentiful opportunities from rehabilitation of patients to direct and seamless communication between human species. Typical solutions rely on invasive recordings with a large number of distributed electrodes implanted through craniotomy. Here we explored the possibility of creating speech prosthesis in a minimally invasive setting with a small number of spatially segregated intracranial electrodes. Methods: We collected one hour of data (from two sessions) in two patients implanted with invasive electrodes. We then used only the contacts that pertained to a single sEEG shaft or an ECoG stripe to decode neural activity into 26 words and one silence class. We employed a compact convolutional network-based architecture whose spatial and temporal filter weights allow for a physiologically plausible interpretation. Results: We achieved on average 58% accuracy using only 6 channels of data recorded with a single minimally invasive sEEG electrode in the first patient and 72% accuracy using only 8 channels of data recorded for a single ECoG strip in the second patient in classifying 26+1 overtly pronounced words. Our compact architecture did not require the use of pre-engineered features, learned fast and resulted in a stable, interpretable and physiologically meaningful decision rule successfully operating over a contiguous dataset collected during a different time interval than that used for training. Spatial characteristics of the pivotal neuronal populations corroborate with active and passive speech mapping results and exhibit the inverse space-frequency relationship characteristic of neural activity. Comparison to other architectures our compact solution performed on par or better than those recently featured in neural speech decoding literature. Conclusions: We showcase the possibility of building speech prosthesis with a small number of electrodes and based on a compact feature engineering free decoder derived from a small amount of training data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CaMKIIα promoter-controlled circuit manipulations target both pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons in cortical networks</a></h4>

              
                A key assumption in studies of cortical functions is that excitatory principal neurons, but not inhibitory cells express calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II subunit  (CaMKII) resulting in a widespread use of CaMKII promoter-driven protein expression for principal cell manipulation and monitoring their activities. Using neuroanatomical and electrophysiological methods we demonstrate that in addition to pyramidal neurons, multiple types of cortical GABAegic cells are targeted by adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) carrying the CaMKII-Channelrhodopsin 2-mCherry construct. We show that the reporter protein, mCherry can visualize a large fraction of different interneuron types, including parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and neuropeptide Y (NPY)-containing GABAergic cells, which altogether cover around 50% of the whole inhibitory cell population in cortical structures. Importantly, the expression of the excitatory opsin Channelrhodopsin 2 in the interneurons effectively drive spiking of infected GABAergic cells even if the detectability of reporter proteins is ambiguous. Thus, our results challenge the use of CaMKII promoter-driven protein expression as a selective tool in targeting cortical glutamatergic neurons using viral vectors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reconstructing the cascade of language processing in the brain using the internal computations of a transformer-based language model</a></h4>

              
                Piecing together the meaning of a narrative requires understanding not only the individual words but also the intricate relationships between them. How does the brain construct this kind of rich, contextual meaning from natural language? Recently, a new class of artificial neural networks--based on the Transformer architecture--has revolutionized the field of language modeling. Transformers integrate information across words via multiple layers of structured circuit computations, forming increasingly contextualized representations of linguistic content. In this paper, we deconstruct these circuit computations and analyze the associated "transformations" (alongside the more commonly studied "embeddings") at each layer to provide a fine-grained window onto linguistic computations in the human brain. Using functional MRI data acquired while participants listened to naturalistic spoken stories, we find that these transformations capture a hierarchy of linguistic computations across cortex, with transformations at later layers in the model mapping onto higher-level language areas in the brain. We then decompose these transformations into individual, functionally-specialized "attention heads" and demonstrate that the emergent syntactic computations performed by individual heads correlate with predictions of brain activity in specific cortical regions. These heads fall along gradients corresponding to different layers, contextual distances, and syntactic dependencies in a low-dimensional cortical space. Our findings provide a new basis for using the internal structure of large language models to better capture the cascade of cortical computations that support natural language comprehension.

	<p>Purpose: Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, for which cognitive impairment is a non-motor symptom (NMS). Bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an effective treatment for PD. This study established a nomogram to predict cognitive improvement rate after STN-DBS in PD patients. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 103 PD patients who underwent STN-DBS. Patients were followed up to measure improvement in MoCA scores one year after surgery. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors affecting improvement in cognitive status. A nomogram was developed to predict this factor. The discrimination and fitting performance were evaluated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, calibration diagram, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: Among 103 patients, the mean improvement rate of the MoCA score was 37.3% and the median improvement rate was 27.3%, of which 64% improved cognition, 27% worsened cognition, and 8.7% remained unchanged. Logistic multivariate regression analysis showed that years of education, UPDRSIII drug use, MoCA Preop, and MMSE Preop scores were independent factors affecting the cognitive improvement rate. A nomogram model was subsequently developed. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.98 (95%CI, 0.97&amp;amp;ndash;1.00), and the area under the ROC was 0.98 (95%CI 0.97&amp;amp;ndash;1.00). The calibration plot and DCA demonstrated the goodness-of-fit between nomogram predictions and actual observations. Conclusion: Our nomogram could effectively predict the possibility of achieving good cognitive improvement one year after STN-DBS in patients with PD. This model has value in judging the expected cognitive improvement of patients with PD undergoing STN-DBS.</p>

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease, and increasing evidence shows that insulin signaling has crucial roles in AD initiation and progression. In this study, we explored the effect and underlying mechanism of SQW, a representative formula for tonifying the kidney and promoting yang, on improving the cognitive function in a streptozotocin-induced model of AD rats. We investigated memory impairment in the AD rats by using the Morris water test. HE and Nissl staining were employed to observe the histomorphological changes in the hippocampal. Expression levels of NeuN and proteins related to Tau and apoptosis were measured using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, respectively. Additionally, we performed RNA sequencing, and the selected hub genes were then validated by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of PI3K/AKT pathway-related proteins were detected by Western blot. We found that SQW treatment significantly alleviated learning and memory impairment, pathological damage, and apoptosis in rats, as evidenced by an increased level of NeuN and Bcl-2, and decreased phosphorylation of Tau, Bax, and Caspase-3 protein expression. SQW treatment reversed the expression of insulin resistance-related genes (Nr4a1, Lpar1, Bdnf, Atf2, and Ppp2r2b) and reduced the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Our results demonstrate that SQW could contribute to neuroprotection against learning and memory impairment in rats induced by STZ through activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">EEG Signals Index a Global Signature of Arousal Embedded in Neuronal Population Recordings</a></h4>

              
                <p>Electroencephalography (EEG) has long been used to index brain states, from early studies describing activity in the presence and absence of visual stimulation to modern work employing complex perceptual tasks. These studies have shed light on brain-wide signals but often lack explanatory power at the single neuron level. Similarly, single neuron recordings can suffer from an inability to measure brain-wide signals accessible using EEG. Here, we combined these techniques while monkeys performed a change detection task and discovered a novel link between spontaneous EEG activity and a neural signal embedded in the spiking responses of neuronal populations. This "slow drift" was associated with fluctuations in the subjects&rsquo; arousal levels over time: decreases in prestimulus &alpha; power were accompanied by increases in pupil size and decreases in microsaccade rate. These results show that brain-wide EEG signals can be used to index modes of activity present in single neuron recordings, that in turn reflect global changes in brain state that influence perception and behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Multiscale and Extended Retrieval of Associative Memory Structures in a Cortical Model of Local-Global Inhibition Balance</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Inhibitory neurons take on many forms and functions. How this diversity contributes to memory function is not completely known. Previous formal studies indicate inhibition differentiated by local and global connectivity in associative memory networks functions to rescale the level of retrieval of excitatory assemblies. However, such studies lack biological details such as a distinction between types of neurons (excitatory and inhibitory), unrealistic connection schemas, and nonsparse assemblies. In this study, we present a rate-based cortical model where neurons are distinguished (as excitatory, local inhibitory, or global inhibitory), connected more realistically, and where memory items correspond to sparse excitatory assemblies. We use this model to study how local-global inhibition balance can alter memory retrieval in associative memory structures, including naturalistic and artificial structures. Experimental studies have reported inhibitory neurons and their subtypes uniquely respond to specific stimuli and can form sophisticated, joint excitatory-inhibitory assemblies. Our model suggests such joint assemblies, as well as a distribution and rebalancing of overall inhibition between two inhibitory subpopulations, one connected to excitatory assemblies locally and the other connected globally, can quadruple the range of retrieval across related memories. We identify a possible functional role for local-global inhibitory balance to, in the context of choice or preference of relationships, permit and maintain a broader range of memory items when local inhibition is dominant and conversely consolidate and strengthen a smaller range of memory items when global inhibition is dominant. This model, while still theoretical, therefore highlights a potentially biologically-plausible and behaviorally-useful function of inhibitory diversity in memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Structural Analysis of Human and Mouse Dendritic Spines Reveals a Morphological Continuum and Differences across Ages and Species</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dendritic spines have diverse morphologies, with a wide range of head and neck sizes, and these morphologic differences likely generate different functional properties. To explore how this morphologic diversity differs across species and ages we analyzed 3D confocal reconstructions of ~8000 human spines and ~1700 mouse spines, labeled by intracellular injections in fixed tissue. Using unsupervised algorithms, we computationally separated spine heads and necks and systematically measured morphologic features of spines in apical and basal dendrites from cortical pyramidal cells. Human spines had unimodal distributions of parameters, without any evidence of morphologic subtypes. Their spine necks were longer and thinner in apical than in basal spines, and spine head volumes of an 85-year-old individual were larger than those of a 40-year-old individual. Human spines had longer and thicker necks and larger head volumes than mouse spines. Our results indicate that human spines form part of a continuum, are larger and longer than those of mice, and become larger with increasing adult age. These morphologic differences in spines across species could generate functional differences in biochemical and electrical spine compartmentalization, or in synaptic properties, across species and ages.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Transactivating response element DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), which is encoded by the <I>TARDBP</I> gene, is an RNA-binding protein with fundamental RNA processing activities, and its loss-of-function (LOF) has a central role in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). <I>TARDBP</I> mutations are postulated to inactivate TDP-43 functions, leading to impaired RNA processing. However, it has not been fully examined how mutant TDP-43 affects global RNA regulation, especially in human cell models. Here, we examined global RNA processing in forebrain cortical neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with a pathogenic <I>TARDBP</I> mutation encoding the TDP-43<sup>K263E</sup> protein. In neurons expressing mutant TDP-43, we detected disrupted RNA regulation, including global changes in gene expression, missplicing, and aberrant polyadenylation, all of which were highly similar to those induced by TDP-43 knock-down. This mutation-induced TDP-43 LOF was not because of the cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP-43. Intriguingly, in nonneuronal cells, including iPSCs and neural progenitor cells (NPCs), we did not observe impairments in RNA processing, thus indicating that the K263E mutation results in neuron-specific LOF of TDP-43. This study characterizes global RNA processing impairments induced by mutant TDP-43 and reveals the unprecedented cell type specificity of TDP-43 LOF in ALS/FTLD pathogenesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 2 in the Ventromedial Hypothalamus Modifies Blood Glucose Levels by Controlling Sympathetic Nervous Activation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ubiquitin-specific protease 2 (USP2) participates in glucose metabolism in peripheral tissues such as the liver and skeletal muscles. However, the glucoregulatory role of USP2 in the CNS is not well known. In this study, we focus on USP2 in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), which has dominant control over systemic glucose homeostasis. ISH, using a <I>Usp2</I>-specific probe, showed that <I>Usp2</I> mRNA is present in VMH neurons, as well as other glucoregulatory nuclei, in the hypothalamus of male mice. Administration of a USP2-selective inhibitor ML364 (20 ng/head), into the VMH elicited a rapid increase in the circulating glucose level in male mice, suggesting USP2 has a suppressive role on glucose mobilization. ML364 treatment also increased serum norepinephrine concentration, whereas it negligibly affected serum levels of insulin and corticosterone. ML364 perturbated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in neural SH-SY5Y cells and subsequently promoted the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Consistent with these findings, hypothalamic ML364 treatment stimulated AMPK&alpha; phosphorylation in the VMH. Inhibition of hypothalamic AMPK prevented ML364 from increasing serum norepinephrine and blood glucose. Removal of ROS restored the ML364-evoked mitochondrial dysfunction in SH-SY5Y cells and impeded the ML364-induced hypothalamic AMPK&alpha; phosphorylation as well as prevented the elevation of serum norepinephrine and blood glucose levels in male mice. These results indicate hypothalamic USP2 attenuates perturbations in blood glucose levels by modifying the ROS&ndash;AMPK&ndash;sympathetic nerve axis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Under normal conditions (excluding hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia), blood glucose levels are maintained at a constant level. In this study, we used a mouse model to identify a hypothalamic protease controlling blood glucose levels. Pharmacological inhibition of USP2 in the VMH caused a deviation in blood glucose levels under a nonstressed condition, indicating that USP2 determines the set point of the blood glucose level. Modification of sympathetic nervous activity accounts for the USP2-mediated glucoregulation. Mechanistically, USP2 mitigates the accumulation of ROS in the VMH, resulting in attenuation of the phosphorylation of AMPK. Based on these findings, we uncovered a novel glucoregulatory axis consisting of hypothalamic USP2, ROS, AMPK, and the sympathetic nervous system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Parametric Cognitive Load Reveals Hidden Costs in the Neural Processing of Perfectly Intelligible Degraded Speech</a></h4>

              
                <p>Speech is often degraded by environmental noise or hearing impairment. People can compensate for degradation, but this requires cognitive effort. Previous research has identified frontotemporal networks involved in effortful perception, but materials in these works were also less intelligible, and so it is not clear whether activity reflected effort or intelligibility differences. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the degree to which spoken sentences were processed under distraction and whether this depended on speech quality even when intelligibility of degraded speech was matched to that of clear speech (close to 100%). On each trial, male and female human participants either attended to a sentence or to a concurrent multiple object tracking (MOT) task that imposed parametric cognitive load. Activity in bilateral anterior insula reflected task demands; during the MOT task, activity increased as cognitive load increased, and during speech listening, activity increased as speech became more degraded. In marked contrast, activity in bilateral anterior temporal cortex was speech selective and gated by attention when speech was degraded. In this region, performance of the MOT task with a trivial load blocked processing of degraded speech, whereas processing of clear speech was unaffected. As load increased, responses to clear speech in these areas declined, consistent with reduced capacity to process it. This result dissociates cognitive control from speech processing; substantially less cognitive control is required to process clear speech than is required to understand even very mildly degraded, 100% intelligible speech. Perceptual and control systems clearly interact dynamically during real-world speech comprehension.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Speech is often perfectly intelligible even when degraded, for example, by background sound, phone transmission, or hearing loss. How does degradation alter cognitive demands? Here, we use fMRI to demonstrate a novel and critical role for cognitive control in the processing of mildly degraded but perfectly intelligible speech. We compare speech that is matched for intelligibility but differs in putative control demands, dissociating cognitive control from speech processing. We also impose a parametric cognitive load during perception, dissociating processes that depend on tasks from those that depend on available capacity. Our findings distinguish between frontal and temporal contributions to speech perception and reveal a hidden cost to processing mildly degraded speech, underscoring the importance of cognitive control for everyday speech comprehension.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Context-Dependent Inhibitory Control of Stimulus-Specific Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) is the reduction in responses to frequent stimuli (standards) that does not generalize to rare stimuli (deviants). We investigated the contribution of inhibition in auditory cortex to SSA using two-photon targeted cell-attached recordings and optogenetic manipulations in male mice. We characterized the responses of parvalbumin (PV)-, somatostatin (SST)-, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons of layer 2/3, and of serotonin receptor 5HT3a-expressing interneurons of layer 1. All populations showed early-onset SSA. Unexpectedly, the PV, SST, and VIP populations exhibited a substantial late component of evoked activity, often stronger for standard than for deviant stimuli. Optogenetic suppression of PV neurons facilitated pyramidal neuron responses substantially more (approximately <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT>10) for deviants than for standards. VIP suppression decreased responses of putative PV neurons, specifically for standard but not for deviant stimuli. Thus, the inhibitory network does not generate cortical SSA, but powerfully controls its expression by differentially affecting the responses to deviants and to standards.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) reflects the growing complexity of auditory processing along the ascending auditory system. In the presence of SSA, neuronal responses depend not only on the stimulus itself but also on the history of stimulation. Strong SSA in the fast, ascending auditory pathway first occurs in cortex. Here we studied the role of the cortical inhibitory network in shaping SSA, showing that while cortical inhibition does not generate SSA, it powerfully controls its expression. We deduce that the cortical network contributes in crucial ways to the properties of SSA.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Structural and Functional Network-Level Reorganization in the Coding of Auditory Motion Directions and Sound Source Locations in the Absence of Vision</a></h4>

              
                <p>hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 is a region in the middle occipitotemporal cortex that responds preferentially to visual motion in sighted people. In cases of early visual deprivation, hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 enhances its response to moving sounds. Whether hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 contains information about motion directions and whether the functional enhancement observed in the blind is motion specific, or also involves sound source location, remains unsolved. Moreover, the impact of this cross-modal reorganization of hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 on the regions typically supporting auditory motion processing, like the human planum temporale (hPT), remains equivocal. We used a combined functional and diffusion-weighted MRI approach and individual in-ear recordings to study the impact of early blindness on the brain networks supporting spatial hearing in male and female humans. Whole-brain univariate analysis revealed that the anterior portion of hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 responded to moving sounds in sighted and blind people, while the posterior portion was selective to moving sounds only in blind participants. Multivariate decoding analysis revealed that the presence of motion direction and sound position information was higher in hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 and lower in hPT in the blind group. While both groups showed axis-of-motion organization in hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 and hPT, this organization was reduced in the hPT of blind people. Diffusion-weighted MRI revealed that the strength of hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5&ndash;hPT connectivity did not differ between groups, whereas the microstructure of the connections was altered by blindness. Our results suggest that the axis-of-motion organization of hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 does not depend on visual experience, but that congenital blindness alters the response properties of occipitotemporal networks supporting spatial hearing in the sighted.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Spatial hearing helps living organisms navigate their environment. This is certainly even more true in people born blind. How does blindness affect the brain network supporting auditory motion and sound source location? Our results show that the presence of motion direction and sound position information was higher in hMT<sup>+</sup>/V5 and lower in human planum temporale in blind relative to sighted people; and that this functional reorganization is accompanied by microstructural (but not macrostructural) alterations in their connections. These findings suggest that blindness alters cross-modal responses between connected areas that share the same computational goals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Two Types of Auditory Spatial Receptive Fields in Different Parts of the Chicken's Midbrain</a></h4>

              
                <p>The optic tectum (OT) is an avian midbrain structure involved in the integration of visual and auditory stimuli. Studies in the barn owl, an auditory specialist, have shown that spatial auditory information is topographically represented in the OT. Little is known about how auditory space is represented in the midbrain of birds with generalist hearing, i.e., most of avian species lacking peripheral adaptations such as facial ruffs or asymmetric ears. Thus, we conducted <I>in vivo</I> extracellular recordings of single neurons in the OT and in the external portion of the formatio reticularis lateralis (FRLx), a brain structure located between the inferior colliculus (IC) and the OT, in anaesthetized chickens of either sex. We found that most of the auditory spatial receptive fields (aSRFs) were spatially confined both in azimuth and elevation, divided into two main classes: round aSRFs, mainly present in the OT, and annular aSRFs, with a ring-like shape around the interaural axis, mainly present in the FRLx. Our data further indicate that interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD) play a role in the formation of both aSRF classes. These results suggest that, unlike mammals and owls which have a congruent representation of visual and auditory space in the OT, generalist birds separate the computation of auditory space in two different midbrain structures. We hypothesize that the FRLx-annular aSRFs define the distance of a sound source from the axis of the lateral visual fovea, whereas the OT-round aSRFs are involved in multimodal integration of the stimulus around the lateral fovea.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous studies implied that auditory spatial receptive fields (aSRFs) in the midbrain of generalist birds are only confined along azimuth. Interestingly, we found SRFs s in the chicken to be confined along both azimuth and elevation. Moreover, the auditory receptive fields are arranged in a concentric manner around the overlapping interaural and visual axes. These data suggest that in generalist birds, which mainly rely on vision, the auditory system mainly serves to align auditory stimuli with the visual axis, while auditory specialized birds like the barn owl compute sound sources more precisely and integrate sound positions in the multimodal space map of the optic tectum (OT).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Conflict Detection in a Sequential Decision Task Is Associated with Increased Cortico-Subthalamic Coherence and Prolonged Subthalamic Oscillatory Response in the {beta} Band</a></h4>

              
                <p>Making accurate decisions often involves the integration of current and past evidence. Here, we examine the neural correlates of conflict and evidence integration during sequential decision-making. Female and male human patients implanted with deep-brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes and age-matched and gender-matched healthy controls performed an expanded judgment task, in which they were free to choose how many cues to sample. Behaviorally, we found that while patients sampled numerically more cues, they were less able to integrate evidence and showed suboptimal performance. Using recordings of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and local field potentials (LFPs; in patients) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), we found that &beta; oscillations signaled conflict between cues within a sequence. Following cues that differed from previous cues, &beta; power in the STN and cortex first decreased and then increased. Importantly, the conflict signal in the STN outlasted the cortical one, carrying over to the next cue in the sequence. Furthermore, after a conflict, there was an increase in coherence between the dorsal premotor cortex and STN in the &beta; band. These results extend our understanding of cortico-subcortical dynamics of conflict processing, and do so in a context where evidence must be accumulated in discrete steps, much like in real life. Thus, the present work leads to a more nuanced picture of conflict monitoring systems in the brain and potential changes because of disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Decision-making often involves the integration of multiple pieces of information over time to make accurate predictions. We simultaneously recorded whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) and local field potentials (LFPs) from the human subthalamic nucleus (STN) in a novel task which required integrating sequentially presented pieces of evidence. Our key finding is prolonged &beta; oscillations in the STN, with a concurrent increase in communication with frontal cortex, when presented with conflicting information. These neural effects reflect the behavioral profile of reduced tendency to respond after conflict, as well as relate to suboptimal cue integration in patients, which may be directly linked to clinically reported side-effects of deep-brain stimulation (DBS) such as impaired decision-making and impulsivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Dorsal Visual Pathway Represents Object-Centered Spatial Relations for Object Recognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although there is mounting evidence that input from the dorsal visual pathway is crucial for object processes in the ventral pathway, the specific functional contributions of dorsal cortex to these processes remain poorly understood. Here, we hypothesized that dorsal cortex computes the spatial relations among an object's parts, a process crucial for forming global shape percepts, and transmits this information to the ventral pathway to support object categorization. Using fMRI with human participants (females and males), we discovered regions in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) that were selectively involved in computing object-centered part relations. These regions exhibited task-dependent functional and effective connectivity with ventral cortex, and were distinct from other dorsal regions, such as those representing allocentric relations, 3D shape, and tools. In a subsequent experiment, we found that the multivariate response of posterior (p)IPS, defined on the basis of part-relations, could be used to decode object category at levels comparable to ventral object regions. Moreover, mediation and multivariate effective connectivity analyses further suggested that IPS may account for representations of part relations in the ventral pathway. Together, our results highlight specific contributions of the dorsal visual pathway to object recognition. We suggest that dorsal cortex is a crucial source of input to the ventral pathway and may support the ability to categorize objects on the basis of global shape.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans categorize novel objects rapidly and effortlessly. Such categorization is achieved by representing an object's global shape structure, that is, the relations among object parts. Yet, despite their importance, it is unclear how part relations are represented neurally. Here, we hypothesized that object-centered part relations may be computed by the dorsal visual pathway, which is typically implicated in visuospatial processing. Using fMRI, we identified regions selective for the part relations in dorsal cortex. We found that these regions can support object categorization, and even mediate representations of part relations in the ventral pathway, the region typically thought to support object categorization. Together, these findings shed light on the broader network of brain regions that support object categorization.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sleep-Specific Processing of Auditory Stimuli Is Reflected by Alpha and Sigma Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent research revealed a surprisingly large range of cognitive operations to be preserved during sleep in humans. The new challenge is therefore to understand functions and mechanisms of processes, which so far have been mainly investigated in awake subjects. The current study focuses on dynamic changes of brain oscillations and connectivity patterns in response to environmental stimulation during non-REM sleep. Our results indicate that aurally presented names were processed and neuronally differentiated across the wake-sleep spectrum. Simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG signals revealed two distinct clusters of oscillatory power increase in response to the stimuli: (1) vigilance state-independent  synchronization occurring immediately after stimulus onset, followed by (2) sleep-specific &alpha;/ synchronization peaking after stimulus offset. We discuss the possible role of , &alpha;, and  oscillations during non-REM sleep, and work toward a unified theory of brain rhythms and their functions during sleep.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous research has revealed (residual) capacity of the sleeping human brain to interact with the environment. How sensory processing is realized by the neural assemblies in different stages of sleep is however unclear. To tackle this question, we examined simultaneously recorded MEG and EEG data. We discuss the possible role of , &alpha;, and  oscillations during non-REM sleep. In contrast to versatile  band response that reflected early stimulus processing step, succeeding &alpha; and  band activity was sensitive to the saliency of the incoming information, and contingent on the sleep stage. Our findings suggest that the specific reorganization of mechanisms involved in later stages of sensory processing takes place upon falling asleep.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Voluntary Exercise Boosts Striatal Dopamine Release: Evidence for the Necessary and Sufficient Role of BDNF</a></h4>

              
                <p>Physical exercise improves motor performance in individuals with Parkinson's disease and elevates mood in those with depression. Although underlying factors have not been identified, clues arise from previous studies showing a link between cognitive benefits of exercise and increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Here, we investigated the influence of voluntary wheel-running exercise on BDNF levels in the striatum of young male wild-type (WT) mice, and on the striatal release of a key motor-system transmitter, dopamine (DA). Mice were allowed unlimited access to a freely rotating wheel (runners) or a locked wheel (controls) for 30 d. Electrically evoked DA release was quantified in <I>ex vivo</I> corticostriatal slices from these animals using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. We found that exercise increased BDNF levels in dorsal striatum (dStr) and increased DA release in dStr and in nucleus accumbens core and shell. Increased DA release was independent of striatal acetylcholine (ACh), and persisted after a week of rest. We tested a role for BDNF in the influence of exercise on DA release using mice that were heterozygous for BDNF deletion (BDNF<sup>+/&ndash;</sup>). In contrast to WT mice, evoked DA release did not differ between BDNF<sup>+/&ndash;</sup> runners and controls. Complementary pharmacological studies using a tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) agonist in WT mouse slices showed that TrkB receptor activation also increased evoked DA release throughout striatum in an ACh-independent manner. Together, these data support a causal role for BDNF in exercise-enhanced striatal DA release and provide mechanistic insight into the beneficial effects of exercise in neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's, depression, and anxiety.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Exercise has been shown to improve movement and cognition in humans and rodents. Here, we report that voluntary exercise for 30 d leads to an increase in evoked DA release throughout the striatum and an increase in BDNF in the dorsal (motor) striatum. The increase in DA release appears to require BDNF, indicated by the absence of DA release enhancement with running in BDNF<sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice. Activation of BDNF receptors using a pharmacological agonist was also shown to boost DA release. Together, these data support a necessary and sufficient role for BDNF in exercise-enhanced DA release and provide mechanistic insight into the reported benefits of exercise in individuals with dopamine-linked neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease and depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Blocking Site-Specific Cleavage of Human Tau Delays Progression of Disease-Related Phenotypes in Genetically Matched Tau-Transgenic Mice Modeling Frontotemporal Dementia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Studies have recently demonstrated that a caspase-2-mediated cleavage of human tau (htau) at asparate-314 (D314) is responsible for cognitive deficits and neurodegeneration in mice modeling frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, these animal studies may be confounded by flaws in their model systems, such as endogenous functional gene disruption and inequivalent transgene expression. To avoid these weaknesses, we examined the pathogenic role of this site-specific htau cleavage in FTD using genetically matched htau targeted-insertion mouse lines: rT2 and rT3. Both male and female mice were included in this study. rT2 mice contain a single copy of the FTD-linked htau proline-to-leucine mutation at amino acid 301 (htau P301L), inserted into a neutral site to avoid dysregulation of host gene expression. The similarly constructed rT3 mice harbor an additional D314-to-glutamate (D314E) mutation that blocks htau cleavage. We demonstrate that htau transgene expression occurs primarily in the forebrain at similar levels in rT2 and rT3 mice. Importantly, expression of the cleavage-resistant D314E mutant delays transgene-induced tau accumulation in the postsynaptic density, brain atrophy, hippocampal neurodegeneration, and spatial memory impairment, without altering age-related progression of pathologic tau conformation and phosphorylation. Our comprehensive investigation of age-dependent disease phenotypes associated with the htau P301L variant in precisely engineered FTD-modeling mice unveils a transiently protective effect of blocking htau cleavage at D314. Findings of this study advance our understanding of the contribution of this tau cleavage to the pathogenesis of FTD, and aid the development of effective dementia-targeting therapies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A site-specific and caspase-2-mediated cleavage of human tau plays a pathologic role in dementia. In this study, we investigate the contribution of this cleavage to the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) using two genetically matched, tau-transgene targeted-insertion mouse lines that differ only by a cleavage-resistant mutation. The use of these mice avoids confounding effects associated with the random integration of tau transgenes to the mouse genome and allows us to comprehensively evaluate the impact of the tau cleavage on FTD phenotypes. Our data reveal that blocking this tau cleavage delays memory impairment and neurodegeneration of FTD-modeling mice. These findings improve our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying FTD and will facilitate the development of effective therapeutics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Motor Impairments and Dopaminergic Defects Caused by Loss of Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase Function in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the pathogenic mechanism underlying LRRK2 mutations remains unresolved. In this study, we investigate the consequence of inactivation of LRRK2 and its functional homolog LRRK1 in male and female mice up to 25 months of age using behavioral, neurochemical, neuropathological, and ultrastructural analyses. We report that <I>LRRK1</I> and <I>LRRK2</I> double knock-out (<I>LRRK</I> DKO) mice exhibit impaired motor coordination at 12 months of age before the onset of dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra (SNpc). Moreover, <I>LRRK</I> DKO mice develop age-dependent, progressive loss of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum. Evoked dopamine (DA) release measured by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in the dorsal striatum is also reduced in the absence of LRRK. Furthermore, <I>LRRK</I> DKO mice at 20&ndash;25 months of age show substantial loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc. The surviving SNpc neurons in <I>LRRK</I> DKO mice at 25 months of age accumulate large numbers of autophagic and autolysosomal vacuoles and are accompanied with microgliosis. Surprisingly, the cerebral cortex is unaffected, as shown by normal cortical volume and neuron number as well as unchanged number of apoptotic cells and microglia in <I>LRRK</I> DKO mice at 25 months. These findings show that loss of LRRK function causes impairments in motor coordination, degeneration of dopaminergic terminals, reduction of evoked DA release, and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc, indicating that <I>LRRK</I> DKO mice are unique models for better understanding dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our current study employs a genetic approach to uncover the normal function of the LRRK family in the brain during mouse life span. Our multidisciplinary analysis demonstrates a critical normal physiological role of LRRK in maintaining the integrity and function of dopaminergic terminals and neurons in the aging brain, and show that <I>LRRK</I> DKO mice recapitulate several key features of PD and provide unique mouse models for elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD.</p>

                Background: With the implementation of lockdown and all students restricted to their houses, medical education has shifted towards the online mode. The objective of this study was to assess stress during the pandemic and the association between stress and involvement in online classes among students of a medical college in Mangalore, Karnataka, South India. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 324 undergraduate students at a medical college in Mangalore, Karnataka, South India. The extent of stress was assessed using a perceived stress scale (PSS), and a questionnaire was used to identify different stressors and to understand the participant’s involvement in online classes. Results: In this study, the mean perceived stress score was 21.66 ± 4. Moderate stress was observed in 262 (85%) students. The main stressors noted were inability to focus (173 (56.4%)) and fear of exams (153 (49.8%)). A significant association was noted between stress and involvement in online classes. Conclusions: This study thereby highlights the need for more attention to the various stressors among students and for making online classes student friendly.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of ST-Segment elevation myocardial infarction in Indonesia: a cohort study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a form of acute coronary syndrome with high mortality rate. Management of STEMI should be performed as soon as possible to prevent further damage. With the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it may face obstacles. To overcome those problems, some changes in policy focusing on fibrinolytic therapy in STEMI patients have been applied. This study aimed to identify the effects of COVID-19 in management of STEMI patients in Indonesia. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted in Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (CMH), the national referral center in Indonesia. We compared data between 2018 to 2019 and 2020 to 2021 as before and during COVID-19 pandemic period, respectively. We analyzed the effects of COVID-19 on STEMI patients' visits to hospital i.e., monthly hospital admission and symptoms-to-hospital, management of STEMI i.e., the strategies and time of reperfusion, and clinical outcomes of STEMI patients i.e., major adverse coronary event and mortality. Results: There was a significant statistically reduced mean of monthly hospital admissions from 11 to 7 (p = 0.002) and prolonged duration of symptoms-to-hospital during COVID-19 from 8 to 12 hours (p = 0.005). There was also a decrease in primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) procedures during COVID-19 (65.2% vs. 27.8%, p<0.001), which was accompanied by an increased number of fibrinolytic (1.5% vs. 9.5%, p<0.001) and conservative therapy (28.5% vs. 55.6%, p <0.01). Moreover, there was also a prolonged duration of diagnosis-to-wire-crossing time (160 vs. 186 minutes, p = 0.005), meanwhile, percentage of urgent PCI, door-to-needle time, and clinical outcomes were not statistically significant. Conclusions: During COVID-19 pandemic, the number STEMI patients declined in monthly hospital admission, delays in symptoms-to-hospital time, changes in type of reperfusion strategy, and delays in PPCI procedures in CMH. Meanwhile, fibrinolytic time and clinical outcomes were not affected.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Outcomes in intervention research on snakebite envenomation: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: A core outcome set (COS) is a minimal list of consensus outcomes that should be used in all intervention research in a specific domain. COS enhance the ability to undertake meaningful comparisons and to understand the benefits or harms of different treatments. A first step in developing a COS is to identify outcomes that have been used previously. We did this global systematic review to provide the foundation for development of a region-specific COS for snakebite envenomation.  Methods: We searched 15 electronic databases, eight trial registries, and reference lists of included studies to identify reports of relevant trials, protocols, registry records and systematic reviews. We extracted verbatim data on outcomes, their definitions, measures, and time-points. Outcomes were classified as per an existing outcome taxonomy, and we identified unique outcomes based on similarities in the definition and measurement of the verbatim outcomes. Results: We included 107 records for 97 studies which met our inclusion criteria. These reported 538 outcomes, with a wide variety of outcome measures, definitions, and time points for measurement. We consolidated these into 88 unique outcomes, which we classified into core areas of mortality (1, 1.14 %), life impact (6, 6.82%), resource use (15, 17.05%), adverse events (7, 7.95%), physiological/clinical (51, 57.95%), and composite (8, 9.09%) outcomes. The types of outcomes varied by the type of intervention, and by geographic region. Only 15 of the 97 trials (17.04%) listed Patient Related Outcome Measures (PROMS). Conclusion: Trials evaluating interventions for snakebite demonstrate heterogeneity on outcomes and often omit important information related to outcome measurement (definitions, instruments, and time points). Developing high quality, region-specific COS for snakebite could inform the design of future trials and improve outcome reporting. Measurement of PROMS, resource use and life impact outcomes in trials on snakebite remains a gap.

                Background: Cytological samples are cleared with xylene in two or three baths during a Pap test, however, this solvent has a high degree of toxicity, and being a controlled reagent infers high costs for its purchase and implications for environmental pollution. We estimated the impact of xylene during the Pap test in terms of the number of liters and cost of two baths of xylene, and also estimated the impact with three baths  Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in four hospitals of EsSalud in Peru in two stages. First, the analysis of the impact due to the use of two baths of xylene was conducted during the period 2015–2019, and second, the estimates were calculated based on the assumption of three baths of xylene for the years 2020–2025. The assumption was based on the recommendations of the 2018 EsSalud cytology guideline. The monthly amount of xylene was ~10 liters per bath/month and the cost per liter was estimated at 8.13 USD (27 soles).  Results: For the staining of 594,898 cytology tests, 7,848 liters of xylene were necessary, resulting in a cost of 60,861 USD (202,068 soles) during the period 2015–2019. The estimates showed a maximum assumption of 9,483 liters and 77,110 USD (256,040 soles) for the use of three baths of xylene in the four EsSalud hospitals (p = 0.0025) during the period 2020–2025.   Conclusions: We determined that there was a high economic impact of using xylene with two baths from 2015 to 2019 and a dramatic increase in costs with the possible use of three baths of xylene in the Pap test for the following five years.

                Background: The continuous rise in the number of patients suffering from Helicobacter pylori is probably due to the changes in modern life. Nowadays, patients suffering from gastrointestinal problems are diagnosed through invasive and non-invasive techniques. The choice of a diagnostic test is influenced by factors such as the tests' sensitivity and specificity, the clinical conditions, and the cost-effectiveness of the testing strategy. This study aimed to compare molecular detection methods of H. pylori by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the 16S rRNA, ureA and glmM genes with an invasive histopathological technique. Methods: 290 gastric biopsies were collected using gastrointestinal endoscopy from patients with gastritis symptoms in different hospitals in Khartoum state. Two gastric biopsies were collected from each patient for PCR and histopathology. Results: A total of 103 (35.5%) samples were positive by histopathological examination, 88 (30.3%) by 16S rRNA, 39 (13.4%) by glmM gene, and 56 (19.3%) by ureA gene. The highest sensitivity was observed in 16S rRNA (46.6%), followed by glmM (24.3%) and ureA (23.3%). While the best specificity was observed in glmM gene (92.5%), followed by ureA (82.3%) and 16S rRNA (78.6%). Conclusion: PCR test targeting the 16S rRNA gene exhibited the best results for molecular detection of H. pylori compared to other genes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Individual-based model highlights the importance of trade-offs for virus-host population dynamics and long-term co-existence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fateme Pourhasanzade, Swami Iyer, Jesslyn Tjendra, Lotta Landor, Selina Våge</p>

Viruses play diverse and important roles in ecosystems. In recent years, trade-offs between host and virus traits have gained increasing attention in viral ecology and evolution. However, microbial organism traits, and viral population parameters in particular, are challenging to monitor. Mathematical and individual-based models are useful tools for predicting virus-host dynamics. We have developed an individual-based evolutionary model to study ecological interactions and evolution between bacteria and viruses, with emphasis on the impacts of trade-offs between competitive and defensive host traits on bacteria-phage population dynamics and trait diversification. Host dynamics are validated with lab results for different initial virus to host ratios (VHR). We show that trade-off based, as opposed to random bacteria-virus interactions, result in biologically plausible evolutionary outcomes, thus highlighting the importance of trade-offs in shaping biodiversity. The effects of nutrient concentration and other environmental and organismal parameters on the virus-host dynamics are also investigated. Despite its simplicity, our model serves as a powerful tool to study bacteria-phage interactions and mechanisms for evolutionary diversification under various environmental conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cargo surface fluidity can reduce inter-motor mechanical interference, promote load-sharing and enhance processivity in teams of molecular motors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Niranjan Sarpangala, Ajay Gopinathan</p>

In cells, multiple molecular motors work together as teams to carry cargoes such as vesicles and organelles over long distances to their destinations by stepping along a network of cytoskeletal filaments. How motors that typically mechanically interfere with each other, work together as teams is unclear. Here we explored the possibility that purely physical mechanisms, such as cargo surface fluidity, may potentially enhance teamwork, both at the single motor and cargo level. To explore these mechanisms, we developed a three dimensional simulation of cargo transport along microtubules by teams of kinesin-1 motors. We accounted for cargo membrane fluidity by explicitly simulating the Brownian dynamics of motors on the cargo surface and considered both the load and ATP dependence of single motor functioning. Our simulations show that surface fluidity could lead to the reduction of negative mechanical interference between kinesins and enhanced load sharing thereby increasing the average duration of single motors on the filament. This, along with a cooperative increase in on-rates as more motors bind leads to enhanced collective processivity. At the cargo level, surface fluidity makes more motors available for binding, which can act synergistically with the above effects to further increase transport distances though this effect is significant only at low ATP or high motor density. Additionally, the fluid surface allows for the clustering of motors at a well defined location on the surface relative to the microtubule and the fluid-coupled motors can exert more collective force per motor against loads. Our work on understanding how teamwork arises in cargo-coupled motors allows us to connect single motor properties to overall transport, sheds new light on cellular processes, reconciles existing observations, encourages new experimental validation efforts and can also suggest new ways of improving the transport of artificial cargo powered by motor teams.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Annotation-free delineation of prokaryotic homology groups</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yongze Yin, Huw A. Ogilvie, Luay Nakhleh</p>

Phylogenomic studies of prokaryotic taxa often assume conserved marker genes are homologous across their length. However, processes such as horizontal gene transfer or gene duplication and loss may disrupt this homology by recombining only parts of genes, causing gene fission or fusion. We show using simulation that it is necessary to delineate homology groups in a set of bacterial genomes without relying on gene annotations to define the boundaries of homologous regions. To solve this problem, we have developed a graph-based algorithm to partition a set of bacterial genomes into Maximal Homologous Groups of sequences (MHGs) where each MHG is a maximal set of maximum-length sequences which are homologous across the entire sequence alignment. We applied our algorithm to a dataset of 19 Enterobacteriaceae species and found that MHGs cover much greater proportions of genomes than markers and, relatedly, are less biased in terms of the functions of the genes they cover. We zoomed in on the correlation between each individual marker and their overlapping MHGs, and show that few phylogenetic splits supported by the markers are supported by the MHGs while many marker-supported splits are contradicted by the MHGs. A comparison of the species tree inferred from marker genes with the species tree inferred from MHGs suggests that the increased bias and lack of genome coverage by markers causes incorrect inferences as to the overall relationship between bacterial taxa.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Data-dependent visualization of biological networks in the web-browser with NDExEdit</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Florian Auer, Simone Mayer, Frank Kramer</p>

Networks are a common methodology used to capture increasingly complex associations between biological entities. They serve as a resource of biological knowledge for bioinformatics analyses, and also comprise the subsequent results. However, the interpretation of biological networks is challenging and requires suitable visualizations dependent on the contained information. The most prominent software in the field for the visualization of biological networks is Cytoscape, a desktop modeling environment also including many features for analysis.
A further challenge when working with networks is their distribution. Within a typical collaborative workflow, even slight changes of the network data force one to repeat the visualization step as well. Also, just minor adjustments to the visual representation not only need the networks to be transferred back and forth. Collaboration on the same resources requires specific infrastructure to avoid redundancies, or worse, the corruption of the data. A well-established solution is provided by the NDEx platform where users can upload a network, share it with selected colleagues or make it publicly available.
NDExEdit is a web-based application where simple changes can be made to biological networks within the browser, and which does not require installation. With our tool, plain networks can be enhanced easily for further usage in presentations and publications. Since the network data is only stored locally within the web browser, users can edit their private networks without concerns of unintentional publication. The web tool is designed to conform to the Cytoscape Exchange (CX) format as a data model, which is used for the data transmission by both tools, Cytoscape and NDEx. Therefore the modified network can be directly exported to the NDEx platform or saved as a compatible CX file, additionally to standard image formats like PNG and JPEG.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An approximate stochastic optimal control framework to simulate nonlinear neuro-musculoskeletal models in the presence of noise</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tom Van Wouwe, Lena H. Ting, Friedl De Groote</p>

Optimal control simulations have shown that both musculoskeletal dynamics and physiological noise are important determinants of movement. However, due to the limited efficiency of available computational tools, deterministic simulations of movement focus on accurately modelling the musculoskeletal system while neglecting physiological noise, and stochastic simulations account for noise while simplifying the dynamics. We took advantage of recent approaches where stochastic optimal control problems are approximated using deterministic optimal control problems, which can be solved efficiently using direct collocation. We were thus able to extend predictions of stochastic optimal control as a theory of motor coordination to include muscle coordination and movement patterns emerging from non-linear musculoskeletal dynamics. In stochastic optimal control simulations of human standing balance, we demonstrated that the inclusion of muscle dynamics can predict muscle co-contraction as minimal effort strategy that complements sensorimotor feedback control in the presence of sensory noise. In simulations of reaching, we demonstrated that nonlinear multi-segment musculoskeletal dynamics enables complex perturbed and unperturbed reach trajectories under a variety of task conditions to be predicted. In both behaviors, we demonstrated how interactions between task constraint, sensory noise, and the intrinsic properties of muscle influence optimal muscle coordination patterns, including muscle co-contraction, and the resulting movement trajectories. Our approach enables a true minimum effort solution to be identified as task constraints, such as movement accuracy, can be explicitly imposed, rather than being approximated using penalty terms in the cost function. Our approximate stochastic optimal control framework predicts complex features, not captured by previous simulation approaches, providing a generalizable and valuable tool to study how musculoskeletal dynamics and physiological noise may alter neural control of movement in both healthy and pathological movements.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of anisometropia in children and adolescents [version 4; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This research was developed to study the epidemiology of anisometropia. It aims to estimate the prevalence of anisometropia in Portuguese children and adolescents at various educational stages, studying its association with sociodemographic variables. Methods: Observational cross sectional study envolving 749 children and adolescents (from 3 to 16 years old) from the central region of Portugal. The refraction was performed with a paediatric, open field auto refractometer (PlusOptix), without cycloplegia and under binocular conditions, to determine the rate of anisometropia and its association with gender, study cycle and area of residence. Results: The prevalence of anisometropia in the studied sample was 6.1%, varying from 2.9% in pre-school education to 9.4% in the 3rd study cycle. Myopic anisometropia was the most prevalent and hyperopic and astigmatic anisometropia showed identical proportions of occurrence. No statistical differences were found between genders or between areas of residence regarding the rate of anisometropia. Regarding spherical equivalent anisometropia, there was a pattern of variation that increased with the cycle of studies (p = 0.012), with myopic anisometropia being the main contributor to this variation. Conclusions: This study found an increase in anisometropia with the educational stage. The high rate of anisometropia found in adolescents (9.4%) as well as the progressive increase in this rate throughout school progress (from 2.9% to 9.4%) suggests the need to extend the detection strategies of this condition beyond childhood.

                Multiple studies have shown how dendrites enable some neurons to perform linearly non-separable computations. These works focus on cells with an extended dendritic arbor where voltage can vary independently, turning dendritic branches into local non-linear subunits. However, these studies leave a large fraction of the nervous system unexplored. Many neurons, e.g. granule cells, have modest dendritic trees and are electrically compact. It is impossible to decompose them into multiple independent subunits. Here, we upgraded the integrate and fire neuron to account for saturation due to interacting synapses. This artificial neuron has a unique membrane voltage and can be seen as a single layer. We present a class of linearly non-separable computations and how our neuron can perform them. We thus demonstrate that even a single layer neuron with interacting synapses has more computational capacity than without. Because all neurons have one or more layer, we show that all neurons can potentially implement linearly non-separable computations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Noise intensity and its impact on the perception and concentration level among forest harvesting workers in industrial forest plantation, North Sumatera, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Noise has the potential to affect the comfort and health of workers. The objective of this research was to find out the effect of noise caused by the timber harvesting process using chainsaws on the concentration of workers in an industrial forest plantation. Methods: This experimental study included 20 respondents which consisted of 10 chainsaw operators/helpers and 10 non-chainsaw operators. All respondents were exposed to the sound of a chainsaw in three different conditions (idle, half gas and racing conditions) with and without personal protective equipment (PPE). The sound intensity produced by the chainsaw and the noise received by the respondents were measured using a sound level meter. Respondents’ perception toward noise was recorded using a Likert scale. Respondents’ concentration level was assessed by giving 25 math-questions to be answered within 10 minutes. Wilcoxon sign rank test was used to analysed paired data. Results: The average sound intensity received by respondents’ left and right ears were lower than the average sound intensity produced by the chainsaw. The use of earmuffs leads to better perception towards noise when compared with the use of earplugs and the absence of any PPE. The Wilcoxon test result showed that noise did not have significant impact on the concentration level of chainsaw operators, whilst the contrary result is true for non-chainsaw operators. Conclusions: The research indicated that although the noise produced by the chainsaw machine was considered noisy for both chainsaw operators and non-chainsaw operator, it did not have a significant effect on the concentration level of chainsaw operators and only affected the non-chainsaw operators. Therefore, given that the non-chainsaw operators were still affected by the noise, noise control measures are still needed to ensure occupational safety and health for the workers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Grammatical awareness and language performance: examining gendered differences among Saudi EFL (English as a foreign language) learners [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Despite the many studies that have been conducted on the learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) regarding grammar ability in various contexts, some gaps are still unbridged and need researching. Therefore, this study addresses the research gap in the Saudi context concerning the grammatical competence of Saudi EFL (English as foreign language) learners. Methods: This study described the Saudi EFL learners’ level of awareness in developing grammatical forms. It also assessed Saudi EFL students' level of performance in grammar learning. Finally, it quantitatively explored what, if any, gendered differences exist in the grammar acquisition of Saudi EFL learners. The study employed descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze the data. The study sample comprised 50 Saudi EFL students out of the population of 120 students enrolled in EFL programs at Qassim University, Saudi Arabia with sample size being determined using online sampling calculator Raosoft. Results: The results of the present study show that the Saudi EFL learners manifest a favorable level of awareness in developing grammatical forms while they still not having attained mastery of English grammar. Results also indicate that grammatical competence and level of awareness are more advanced among the Saudi EFL female learners compared to their male counterparts. Conclusions: The outcomes of this research imply that Saudi EFL learners have sufficient performance in grammar learning but need further nurturance. Implications of this study will serve as a basis for English language learning development interventions in the benefit of the students.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Using a multi-cohort, discovery-replication-validation design, we sought new plasma biomarkers that predict which individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) will experience cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In 108 discovery cohort PD individuals and 83 replication cohort PD individuals, we measured 940 plasma proteins on an aptamer-based platform. Using proteins associated with subsequent cognitive decline in both cohorts, we trained a logistic regression model to predict which patients with PD showed fast (&gt; = 1 point drop/year on Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) versus slow (&lt; 1 point drop/year on MoCA) cognitive decline in the discovery cohort, testing it in the replication cohort. We developed alternate assays for the top 3 proteins and confirmed their ability to predict cognitive decline – defined by change in MoCA or development of incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia – in a validation cohort of 118 individuals with PD. We investigated the top plasma biomarker for causal influence by Mendelian randomization (MR).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A model with only 3 proteins (melanoma inhibitory activity protein [MIA], C-reactive protein [CRP], and albumin) separated fast versus slow cognitive decline subgroups with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 in the validation cohort. The individuals with PD in the validation cohort in the top quartile of risk for cognitive decline based on this model were 4.4 times more likely to develop incident MCI or dementia than those in the lowest quartile. Genotypes at MIA single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2233154 associated with MIA levels and cognitive decline, providing evidence for MIA's causal influence.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>An easily obtained plasma-based predictor identifies individuals with PD at risk for cognitive decline. MIA may participate causally in development of cognitive decline. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                In a recent study, Bolkan, Stone, and colleagues demonstrated that direct and indirect striatal pathways in mice exert opponent control over choice behavior in a task- and state-dependent manner. This work highlights the need for rigorously controlled behavioral experiments and novel behavioral modeling in investigations of the neural mechanisms of decision making.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Shared and specialized coding across posterior cortical areas for dynamic navigation decisions</a></h4>

              
                In mice navigating in dynamic environments, Tseng, Chettih, et al. find highly distributed but specialized encoding of visual, cognitive, and locomotor signals in the posterior cortex with similar conjunctive codes across areas. They propose that the posterior cortex integrates distinct information modalities to form a general-purpose state representation of the environment and behavior.

Older hamsters have a diminished antiviral response and are slower to repair damage induced by infection.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Squamation and scale morphology at the root of jawed vertebrates</a></h4>

              
                Placoderms, as the earliest branching jawed vertebrates, are crucial to understanding how the characters of crown gnathostomes comprising Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes evolved from their stem relatives. Despite the growing knowledge of the anatomy and diversity of placoderms over the past decade, the dermal scales of placoderms are predominantly known from isolated material, either morphologically or histologically, resulting in their squamation being poorly understood. Here we provide a comprehensive description of the squamation and scale morphology of a primitive taxon of Antiarcha (a clade at the root of jawed vertebrates), <i>Parayunnanolepis xitunensis</i>, based on the virtual restoration of an articulated specimen by using X-ray computed tomography. Thirteen morphotypes of scales are classified to exhibit how the morphology changes with their position on the body in primitive antiarchs, based on which nine areas of the post-thoracic body are distinguished to show their scale variations in the dorsal, flank, ventral, and caudal lobe regions. In this study, the histological structure of yunnanolepidoid scales is described for the first time based on disarticulated scales from the type locality and horizon of <i>P. xitunensis</i>. The results demonstrate that yunnanolepidoid scales are remarkably different from their dermal plates as well as euantiarch scales in lack of a well-developed middle layer. Together, our study reveals that the high regionalization of squamation and the bipartite histological structure of scales might be plesiomorphic for antiarchs, and jawed vertebrates in general.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sparse genetically-defined neurons refine the canonical role of periaqueductal gray columnar organization</a></h4>

              
                During encounters with external threats, survival depends on the engagement of appropriate defensive reactions to minimize harm. There are major clinical implications for identifying the neural circuitry and activation patterns that produce such defensive reactions, as maladaptive overactivation of these circuits underlies pathological human anxiety and fear responses. A compelling body of work has linked activation of large glutamatergic neuronal populations in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) to defensive reactions such as freezing, flight and threat-induced analgesia. These pioneering data have firmly established that the overarching functional organization axis of the PAG is along anatomically-defined columnar boundaries. Accordingly, broad activation of the dorsolateral column induces flight, while activation of the lateral or ventrolateral (l and vl) columns induces freezing. However, the PAG contains a diverse arrangement of cell types that vary in neurochemical profile and location. How these cell types contribute to defensive responses remains largely unknown, indicating that targeting sparse, genetically-defined populations can lead to a deeper understanding of how the PAG generates a wide array of behaviors. Though several prior works showed that broad excitation of the lPAG or vlPAG causes freezing, we found in mice that activation of lateral and ventrolateral PAG (l/vlPAG) cholecystokinin-expressing (CCK) cells selectively caused flight to safer regions within an environment. Furthermore, inhibition of l/vlPAG-CCK cells reduced avoidance of a predatory threat without altering other defensive behaviors like freezing. Lastly, l/vlPAG-CCK activity decreased when approaching threat and increased during movement to safer locations. Taken together, these data suggest CCK cells are driving threat avoidance states, which are epochs during which mice increase distance from threat and perform evasive escape. In contrast, activating l/vlPAG cells pan-neuronally promoted freezing and these cells were activated near threat. These data underscore the importance of investigating genetically-identified PAG cells. Using this approach, we found a sparse population of CCK-expressing l/vlPAG cells that have distinct and opposing function and neural activation motifs compared to the broader local ensemble defined solely by columnar anatomical boundaries. Thus, in addition to the anatomical columnar architecture of the PAG, the molecular identity of PAG cells may confer an additional axis of functional organization, revealing unexplored functional heterogeneity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Towards a molecular mechanism underlying mitochondrial protein import through the TOM and TIM23 complexes</a></h4>

              
                Nearly all mitochondrial proteins need to be targeted for import from the cytosol. For the majority, the first port of call is the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM complex), followed by a procession of alternative molecular machines, conducting transport to their final destination. The pre-sequence translocase of the inner-membrane (TIM23-complex) imports proteins with cleavable pre-sequences. Progress in understanding these transport mechanisms has been hampered by the poor sensitivity and time-resolution of import assays. However, with the development of an assay based on split NanoLuc luciferase, we can now explore this process in greater detail. Here, we apply this new methodology to understand how ∆ψ and ATP hydrolysis, the two main driving forces for import into the matrix, contribute to the transport of pre-sequence-containing precursors (PCPs) with varying properties. Notably, we found that two major rate-limiting steps define PCP import time: passage of PCP across the outer membrane and initiation of inner membrane transport by the pre-sequence - the rates of which are influenced by PCP properties such as size and net charge. The apparent distinction between transport through the two membranes (passage through TOM is substantially complete before PCP-TIM engagement) is in contrast with the current view that import occurs through TOM and TIM in a single continuous step. Our results also indicate that PCPs spend very little time in the TIM23 channel – presumably rapid success or failure of import is critical for maintaining mitochondrial fitness.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Alone, in the dark: The extraordinary neuroethology of the solitary blind mole rat</a></h4>

              
                On the social scale, the blind mole rat (BMR; <i>Spalax ehrenbergi</i>) is an extreme. It is exceedingly solitary, territorial, and aggressive. BMRs reside underground, in self-excavated tunnels that they rarely leave. They possess specialized sensory systems for social communication and navigation, which allow them to cope with the harsh environmental conditions underground. This review aims to present the blind mole rat as an ideal, novel neuroethological model for studying aggressive and solitary behaviors. We discuss the BMR’s unique behavioral phenotype, particularly in the context of ‘anti-social’ behaviors, and review the available literature regarding its specialized sensory adaptations to the social and physical habitat. To date, the neurobiology of the blind mole rat remains mostly unknown and holds a promising avenue for scientific discovery. Unraveling the neural basis of the BMR’s behavior, in comparison to that of social rodents, can shed important light on the underlying mechanisms of psychiatric disorders in humans, in which similar behaviors are displayed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">METTL18-mediated histidine methylation of RPL3 modulates translation elongation for proteostasis maintenance</a></h4>

              
                Protein methylation occurs predominantly on lysine and arginine residues, but histidine also serves as a methylation substrate. However, a limited number of enzymes responsible for this modification have been reported. Moreover, the biological role of histidine methylation has remained poorly understood to date. Here, we report that human METTL18 is a histidine methyltransferase for the ribosomal protein RPL3 and that the modification specifically slows ribosome traversal on Tyr codons, allowing the proper folding of synthesized proteins. By performing an in vitro methylation assay with a methyl donor analog and quantitative mass spectrometry, we found that His245 of RPL3 is methylated at the τ-<i>N</i> position by METTL18. Structural comparison of the modified and unmodified ribosomes showed stoichiometric modification and suggested a role in translation reactions. Indeed, genome-wide ribosome profiling and an in vitro translation assay revealed that translation elongation at Tyr codons was suppressed by RPL3 methylation. Because the slower elongation provides enough time for nascent protein folding, RPL3 methylation protects cells from the cellular aggregation of Tyr-rich proteins. Our results reveal histidine methylation as an example of a ribosome modification that ensures proteome integrity in cells.

                Individual differences in second language (L2) learning can offer insights into the neurobiological bases of learning aptitude. One neurophysiological marker of inter-individual differences in cognition is the individual alpha frequency (IAF), a trait-like measure correlated with cognition. Further, the N400 is an electrophysiological marker indexing stimulus irregularity and has been used to study L2 learning; however, its relationship with IAF and L2 learning remains unknown. To examine the relation between IAF and L2 learning (indexed by N400 amplitude), we report data from a modified miniature language learning study. After a vocabulary learning period, participants (N = 38, Mage = 25.3, SD = 7.13) judged the grammaticality of classifier-noun pairs, with mixed-effects modelling revealing lower IAF individuals were better than higher IAF individuals at grammaticality judgements. N400 amplitude also reduced across the experiment in low relative to high IAF individuals, indicating the relationship between IAF and language learning is more complex than initially postulated.

                Precisely timed behaviour and accurate time perception plays a critical role in our everyday lives, as our well-being and even survival can depend on well-timed decisions. Although the temporal structure of the world around us is essential for human decision making, we know surprisingly little about how representation of temporal structure of our everyday environment impacts decision making. How does the representation of temporal structure affect our ability to generate well-timed decisions? Here we address this question by using a well-established dynamic probabilistic learning task. Using computational modelling, we found that human subjects' beliefs about temporal structure are reflected in their choices to either exploit their current knowledge or to explore novel options. The model-based analysis illustrates a large within-group and within-subject heterogeneity. To explain these results, we propose a normative model for how temporal structure is used in decision making, based on the semi-Markov formalism in an active inference framework. We discuss potential key applications of the presented approach to the fields of cognitive phenotyping and computational psychiatry.

                Distal arthrogryposis (DA) is a collection of rare disorders characterized by congenital joint contractures. Most DA mutations are in muscle- and joint-related genes, and the anatomical defects originate cell-autonomously within the musculoskeletal system. However, gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in PIEZO2, a principal mechanosensor in somatosensation, cause DA subtype 5 via unknown mechanisms. We show that expression of a GOF PIEZO2 mutation in proprioceptive sensory neurons mainly innervating muscle spindles and tendons is sufficient to induce DA5-like phenotypes in mice. Overactive PIEZO2 causes anatomical defects via increased activity within the peripheral nervous system during postnatal development. Remarkably, Botox and a dietary fatty acid that modulates PIEZO2 activity markedly reduce DA5-like deficits. This reveals an unexpected role for somatosensory neurons: excessive mechanosensation within these neurons disrupts musculoskeletal development.

                COVID-19 pandemic affected the global population in an unprecedented scale, with long-term consequences of SARS CoV-2 infection now emerging as a serious concern. Cognitive dysfunction is often reported in post-COVID patients, but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we demonstrated that brain exposure to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein through its infusion into the lateral ventricle of adult mice induced late cognitive impairment, hippocampal synapse loss, and microglial engulfment of presynaptic terminals. Additionally, TLR4 blockage prevented Sassociated detrimental effects on memory in mice and TLR4 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10759931 was associated with late cognitive outcome in mild COVID-19-recovered patients. Collectively, these findings indicate that S protein directly impacts the brain and identify TLR4 as a key target to prevent cognitive dysfunction. To our knowledge, this is the first animal model that recapitulates postCOVID cognitive impairment, opening new avenues for developing new strategies to prevent or treat the neurological outcomes of COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Binocular Imaging with The Conformal Eyes</a></h4>

              
                The human eye possesses a natural asymmetry of its optical components and an inhomogeneous distribution of photoreceptors causing optical aberrations and providing high acuity only at a 2-degree visual angle. Although these features greatly impact the visual system functions, they have not been supported by the geometric formulation of the fundamental binocular concepts. The author recently constructed a geometric theory of the binocular system with asymmetric eyes (AEs) integrated with the eyes' movement to address these problems. This theory suggests that a symmetric framework can fully represent the asymmetric properties of this binocular system with the AEs. Pursuing this idea leads to the conformal eye model furnished by the Riemann sphere. The conformal geometry of the Riemann sphere establishes efficient image representation in terms of the projective Fourier transform (PFT)---the Fourier transform on the group of image projective transformations representing images covariantly to these transformations. The PFT is fast computable by an FFT algorithm in log-polar coordinates known to approximate the retina-cortical mapping of the human brain's visual pathways. The retinotopy modeling here with PFT is compared to Schwartz's modeling with the exponential chirp transform showing clear advantages of PFT in both physiological conformity and numerical efficacy. Finally, the conformal eye model is extended to the AE, which can be implemented into the binocular system with AEs making PFT available for image processing. The PFT combined with the conformal eye model allows binocular extensions of the previous monocular algorithms for modeling visual stability during the saccade and smooth pursuit eye movements needed to offset the eye's acuity limitation.

                We report on the implementation and features of the Brain/MINDS Marmoset Connectivity Atlas, BMCA, a new resource that provides access to anterograde neuronal tracer data in the prefrontal cortex of a marmoset brain. Neuronal tracers combined with fluorescence microscopy are a key technology for the systematic mapping of structural brain connectivity. We selected the prefrontal cortex for mapping due to its important role in higher brain functions. This work introduces the BMCA standard image preprocessing pipeline and tools for exploring and reviewing the data. We developed the BMCA-Explorer, which is an online image viewer designed for data exploration. Unlike other existing image explorers, it visualizes the data of different individuals in a common reference space at an unprecedented high resolution, facilitating comparative studies. To foster the integration with other marmoset brain image databases and cross-species comparisons, we added fiber tractography data from diffusion MRI, retrograde neural tracer data from the Marmoset Brain Connectivity Atlas project, and tools to map image data between marmoset and the human brain image space. This version of BMCA allows direct comparison between the results of 52 anterograde and 164 retrograde tracer injections in the cortex of the marmoset.

                High salt (HS) intake is a known risk factor for hypertension and dementia. Clinical studies have shown that antihypertensive drugs can decrease the incidence of dementia. Accordingly, a strong relationship can be suggested between hypertension and cognitive impairment. It is well-known that angiotensin II (Ang II)-AT1 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-EP1 systems are involved in hypertension and neurotoxicity. However, the involvement of these systems in HS-mediated hypertension and emotional and cognitive impairments remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that hypertension and impaired social behavior and object recognition memory following HS intake could be associated with tau hyperphosphorylation, decreased phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) expression in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of mice. These changes were blocked by pharmacological treatment with losartan, an Ang II receptor blocker (ARB), or EP1 gene knockout. Our findings suggest that Ang II-AT1 and PGE2-EP1 systems could be novel therapeutic targets for hypertension-induced dementia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evolutionary shaping of human brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The human brain is distinct from those of other species in terms of size, organization, and connectivity. How do these structural evolutionary differences drive patterns of neural activity enabling brain function? Here, we combine brain imaging and biophysical modeling to show that the anatomical wiring of the human brain distinctly shapes neural dynamics. This shaping is characterized by a narrower distribution of dynamic ranges across brain regions compared with that of chimpanzees, our closest living primate relatives. We find that such a sharp dynamic range distribution supports faster integration between regions, particularly in transmodal systems. Conversely, a broad dynamic range distribution as seen in chimpanzees facilitates brain processes relying more on neural interactions within specialized local brain systems. These findings suggest that human brain dynamics have evolved to foster rapid associative processes in service of complex cognitive functions and behavior.

	<p>Background: Studies have shown that dexmedetomidine improves neurological function. Whether dexmedetomidine reduces mortality or improves quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) among patients post-craniotomy remains unclear. Methods: This single-center randomized study was conducted prospectively from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2020. Patients who were transferred to the ICU after craniotomy within 24 h were included. The analgesic was titrated to a Critical care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) score &amp;amp;le;2, and the sedative was titrated to a Richmond Agitation&amp;amp;ndash;Sedation Scale (RASS) score &amp;amp;le;&amp;amp;minus;3 for at least 24 h. The qEEG signals were collected by four electrodes (F3, T3, F4, and T4 according to the international 10/20 EEG electrode practice). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality and qEEG results on day 1 and day 3 after sedation. Results: One hundred and fifty-one patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 77 were in the dexmedetomidine group and 74 in the midazolam group. No significant difference was found between the two groups in mortality at 28 days (14.3% vs. 24.3%; p = 0.117) as well as in the theta/beta ratio (TBR), the delta/alpha ratio (DAR), and the (delta + theta)/(alpha + beta) ratio (DTABR) between the two groups on day 1 or day 3. However, both the TBR and the DTABR were significantly increased in the dexmedetomidine group. The DTABR in the midazolam group was significantly increased. The DAR was significantly increased on the right side in the dexmedetomidine group (20.4 (11.6&amp;amp;ndash;43.3) vs. 35.1 (16.7&amp;amp;ndash;65.0), p = 0.006) as well as on both sides in the midazolam group (Left: 19.5 (10.1&amp;amp;ndash;35.8) vs. 37.3 (19.3&amp;amp;ndash;75.7), p = 0.006; Right: 18.9 (10.1&amp;amp;ndash;52.3) vs. 39.8 (17.5&amp;amp;ndash;99.9), p = 0.002). Conclusion: Compared with midazolam, dexmedetomidine did not lead to a lower 28-day mortality or better qEEG results in brain injury patients after a craniotomy.</p>

	<p>Background: Multi-modal neuroimaging with appropriate atlas is vital for effectively differentiating mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from healthy controls (HC). Methods: The resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) of 69 MCI patients and 61 HC subjects were collected. Then, the gray matter volumes obtained from the sMRI and Hurst exponent (HE) values calculated from rs-fMRI data in the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL-90), Brainnetome (BN-246), Harvard&amp;amp;ndash;Oxford (HOA-112) and AAL3-170 atlases were extracted, respectively. Next, these characteristics were selected with a minimal redundancy maximal relevance algorithm and a sequential feature collection method in single or multi-modalities, and only the optimal features were retained after this procedure. Lastly, the retained characteristics were served as the input features for the support vector machine (SVM)-based method to classify MCI patients, and the performance was estimated with a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Results: Our proposed method obtained the best 92.00% accuracy, 94.92% specificity and 89.39% sensitivity with the sMRI in AAL-90 and the fMRI in HOA-112 atlas, which was much better than using the single-modal or single-atlas features. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that the multi-modal and multi-atlas integrated method could effectively recognize MCI patients, which could be extended into various neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases.</p>

	<p>Objectives: our group explored the correlation between postoperative coordinates of the electrode contacts, VTA, and anxiety and depression symptoms in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) patients after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS). Methods: STN-DBS was conducted on PD patients (n = 57) for six months with follow-up. Clinical outcomes were explored using the unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease rating scale Part III (UPDRS-III), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) before and after surgery. At the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), the location of active contacts and the volume of tissue activated (VTA) were calculated. Results: patient evaluations took place preoperatively and follow-ups took place at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. The average patient improvement rates for HAM-A and HAM-D scores at the 6-month follow-up were 41.7% [interquartile range (IQR) 34.9%] and 37.5% (IQR 33.4%), respectively (both p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). In medication-off, there were negative correlations between the HAM-A improvement rate and the Z-axis coordinate of the active contact (left side: r = &amp;amp;minus;0.308, p = 0.020; right side: r = &amp;amp;minus;0.390, p = 0.003), and negative correlations between the HAM-D improvement rate and the Z-axis coordinate of the active contact (left side: r = &amp;amp;minus;0.345, p = 0.009; right side: r = &amp;amp;minus;0.521, p = 0.001). There were positive correlations between the HAM-A and HAM-D scores improvement rate at 6 months after surgery and bilateral VTA in the right STN limbic subregion (HAM-A: r = 0.314, p = 0.018; HAM-D: r = 0.321, p = 0.015). Conclusion: bilateral STN-DBS can improve anxiety and depression symptoms in PD patients. The closer the stimulation to the ventral limbic region of the STN, the more significant the improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms of PD patients.</p>

	<p>Background: Sensorimotor difficulties significantly interfere with daily activities, and when undiagnosed in early life, they may increase the risk of later life cognitive and mental health disorders. Subtests from the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery (LNNB) discriminate sensorimotor impairments predictive of sensorimotor dysfunction. However, scoring the LNNB sensorimotor assessment is highly subjective and time consuming, impeding the use of this task in epidemiologic studies. Aim: To train and validate a novel automated and image-derived scoring approach to the LNNB neuro-motor tasks for use in adolescents and young adults. Methods: We selected 46 adolescents (19.6 +/&amp;amp;minus; 2.3 years, 48% male) enrolled in the prospective Public Health Impact of Metal Exposure (PHIME) study. We visually recorded the administration of five conventional sensorimotor LNNB tasks and developed automated scoring alternatives using a novel mathematical approach combining optic flow fields from recorded image sequences on a frame-by-frame basis. We then compared the conventional and image-derived LNNB task scores using Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlations. Finally, we provided the accuracy of the novel scoring approach with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curves (AUC). Results: Image-derived LNNB task scores strongly correlated with conventional scores, which were assessed and confirmed by multiple administrators to limit subjectivity (Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation &amp;amp;ge; 0.70). The novel image-derived scoring approach discriminated participants with low motility (&amp;amp;lt;mean population levels) with a specificity ranging from 70% to 83%, with 70% sensitivity. Conclusions: The novel image-derived LNNB task scores may contribute to the timely assessment of sensorimotor abilities and delays, and may also be effectively used in telemedicine.</p>
