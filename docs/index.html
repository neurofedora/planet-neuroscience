                <p>Nature Reviews Neuroscience, Published online: 13 January 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-021-00548-3">doi:10.1038/s41583-021-00548-3</a></p>Deciphering the mechanisms that cause encoded memories to be forgotten may help us to understand both adaptive forgetting and pathological memory loss. In this Perspective, Tomás Ryan and Paul Frankland propose that forgetting involves neuroplasticity that alters engram cells accessibility and is governed by changes in environmental predictability.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Repeated Administration of 2-Hydroxypropyl-{beta}-Cyclodextrin (HP{beta}CD) Attenuates the Chronic Inflammatory Response to Experimental Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <p>Globally, more than 67 million people are living with the effects of ischemic stroke. Importantly, many stroke survivors develop a chronic inflammatory response that may contribute to cognitive impairment, a common and debilitating sequela of stroke that is insufficiently studied and currently untreatable. 2-Hydroxypropyl-&beta;-cyclodextrin (HP&beta;CD) is an FDA-approved cyclic oligosaccharide that can solubilize and entrap lipophilic substances. The goal of the present study was to determine whether the repeated administration of HP&beta;CD curtails the chronic inflammatory response to stroke by reducing lipid accumulation within stroke infarcts in a distal middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model of stroke. To achieve this goal, we subcutaneously injected young adult and aged male mice with vehicle or HP&beta;CD 3 times per week, with treatment beginning 1 week after stroke. We evaluated mice at 7 weeks following stroke using immunostaining, RNA sequencing, lipidomic, and behavioral analyses. Chronic stroke infarct and peri-infarct regions of HP&beta;CD-treated mice were characterized by an upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and a downregulation of genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity, reactive astrogliosis, and chemotaxis. Correspondingly, HP&beta;CD reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and plasma cells in stroke infarcts. Repeated administration of HP&beta;CD also preserved NeuN immunoreactivity in the striatum and thalamus and c-Fos immunoreactivity in hippocampal regions. Additionally, HP&beta;CD improved recovery through the protection of hippocampal-dependent spatial working memory and reduction of impulsivity. These results indicate that systemic HP&beta;CD treatment following stroke attenuates chronic inflammation and secondary neurodegeneration and prevents poststroke cognitive decline.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dementia is a common and debilitating sequela of stroke. Currently, there are no available treatments for poststroke dementia. Our study shows that lipid metabolism is disrupted in chronic stroke infarcts, which causes an accumulation of uncleared lipid debris and correlates with a chronic inflammatory response. To our knowledge, these substantial changes in lipid homeostasis have not been previously recognized or investigated in the context of ischemic stroke. We also provide a proof of principle that solubilizing and entrapping lipophilic substances using HP&beta;CD could be an effective strategy for treating chronic inflammation after stroke and other CNS injuries. We propose that using HP&beta;CD for the prevention of poststroke dementia could improve recovery and increase long-term quality of life in stroke sufferers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Stopping Interference in Response Inhibition: Behavioral and Neural Signatures of Selective Stopping</a></h4>

              
                <p>Response inhibition is an essential aspect of cognitive control that is necessary for terminating inappropriate preplanned or ongoing responses. Response-selective stopping represents a complex form of response inhibition where only a subcomponent of a multicomponent action must be terminated. In this context, a substantial response delay emerges on unstopped effectors after the cued effector is successfully stopped. This response delay has been termed the stopping interference effect. Converging lines of evidence indicate that this effect results from a global response inhibition mechanism that is recruited regardless of the stopping context. However, behavioral observations reveal that the stopping interference effect may not always occur during selective stopping. This review summarizes the behavioral and neural signatures of response inhibition during selective stopping. An overview of selective stopping contexts and the stopping interference effect is provided. A "restart" model of selective stopping is expanded on in light of recent neurophysiological evidence of selective and nonselective response inhibition. Factors beyond overt action cancellation that contribute to the stopping interference effect are discussed. Finally, a pause-then-cancel model of action stopping is presented as a candidate framework to understand stopping interference during response-selective stopping. The extant literature indicates that stopping interference may result from both selective and nonselective response inhibition processes, which can be amplified or attenuated by response conflict, task familiarity, and functional coupling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Gephyrin Interacts with the K-Cl Cotransporter KCC2 to Regulate Its Surface Expression and Function in Cortical Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>The K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> cotransporter KCC2, encoded by the <I>Slc12a5</I> gene, is a neuron-specific chloride extruder that tunes the strength and polarity of GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor-mediated transmission. In addition to its canonical ion transport function, KCC2 also regulates spinogenesis and excitatory synaptic function through interaction with a variety of molecular partners. KCC2 is enriched in the vicinity of both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, the activity of which in turn regulates its membrane stability and function. KCC2 interaction with the submembrane actin cytoskeleton via 4.1N is known to control its anchoring near glutamatergic synapses on dendritic spines. However, the molecular determinants of KCC2 clustering near GABAergic synapses remain unknown. Here, we used proteomics to identify novel KCC2 interacting proteins in the adult rat neocortex. We identified both known and novel candidate KCC2 partners, including some involved in neuronal development and synaptic transmission. These include gephyrin, the main scaffolding molecule at GABAergic synapses. Gephyrin interaction with endogenous KCC2 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation from rat neocortical extracts. We showed that gephyrin stabilizes plasmalemmal KCC2 and promotes its clustering in hippocampal neurons, mostly but not exclusively near GABAergic synapses, thereby controlling KCC2-mediated chloride extrusion. This study identifies gephyrin as a novel KCC2 anchoring molecule that regulates its membrane expression and function in cortical neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Fast synaptic inhibition in the brain is mediated by chloride-permeable GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs) and therefore relies on transmembrane chloride gradients. In neurons, these gradients are primarily maintained by the K/Cl cotransporter KCC2. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms controlling KCC2 expression and function is crucial to understand its physiological regulation and rescue its function in the pathology. KCC2 function depends on its membrane expression and clustering, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We describe the interaction between KCC2 and gephyrin, the main scaffolding protein at inhibitory synapses. We show that gephyrin controls plasmalemmal KCC2 clustering and that loss of gephyrin compromises KCC2 function. Our data suggest functional units comprising GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs, gephyrin, and KCC2 act to regulate synaptic GABA signaling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Gli1 Regulates the Postnatal Acquisition of Peripheral Nerve Architecture</a></h4>

              
                <p>Peripheral nerves are organized into discrete compartments. Axons, Schwann cells (SCs), and endoneurial fibroblasts (EFs) reside within the endoneurium and are surrounded by the perineurium, a cellular sheath comprised of layers of perineurial glia (PNG). SC secretion of Desert Hedgehog (Dhh) regulates this organization. In Dhh nulls, the perineurium is deficient and the endoneurium is subdivided into small compartments termed minifascicles. Human Dhh mutations cause a neuropathy with similar defects. Here we examine the role of Gli1, a canonical transcriptional effector of hedgehog signaling, in regulating peripheral nerve organization in mice of both genders. We identify PNG, EFs, and pericytes as Gli1-expressing cells by genetic fate mapping. Although expression of Dhh by SCs and Gli1 in target cells is coordinately regulated with myelination, Gli1 expression unexpectedly persists in Dhh null EFs. Thus, Gli1 is expressed in EFs noncanonically (i.e., independent of hedgehog signaling). Gli1 and Dhh also have nonredundant activities. Unlike Dhh nulls, Gli1 nulls have a normal perineurium. Like Dhh nulls, Gli1 nulls form minifascicles, which we show likely arise from EFs. Thus, Dhh and Gli1 are independent signals: Gli1 is dispensable for perineurial development but functions cooperatively with Dhh to drive normal endoneurial development. During development, Gli1 also regulates endoneurial extracellular matrix production, nerve vascular organization, and has modest, nonautonomous effects on SC sorting and myelination of axons. Finally, in adult nerves, induced deletion of Gli1 is sufficient to drive minifascicle formation. Thus, Gli1 regulates the development and is required to maintain the endoneurial architecture of peripheral nerves.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Peripheral nerves are organized into distinct cellular/ECM compartments: the epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium. This organization, with its associated cellular constituents, is critical for the structural and metabolic support of nerves and their response to injury. Here, we show that Gli1, a transcription factor normally expressed downstream of hedgehog signaling, is required for the proper organization of the endoneurium but not the perineurium. Unexpectedly, Gli1 expression by endoneurial cells is independent of, and functions nonredundantly with, Schwann Cell-derived Desert Hedgehog in regulating peripheral nerve architecture. These results further delineate how peripheral nerves acquire their distinctive organization during normal development, and highlight mechanisms that may regulate their reorganization in pathologic settings, including peripheral neuropathies and nerve injury.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Loss of RNA-Binding Protein HuR Leads to Defective Ependymal Cells and Hydrocephalus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Multiciliated ependymal cells line the ventricle wall and generate CSF flow through ciliary beating. Defects in ependymal cells cause hydrocephalus; however, there are still significant gaps in our understanding the molecular, cellular and developmental mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus. Here, we demonstrate that specific deletion of RNA-binding protein (RBP) Hu antigen R (HuR) in the mouse brain results in hydrocephalus and causes postnatal death. HuR deficiency leads to impaired ependymal cell development with defective motile ciliogenesis in both female and male mice. Transcriptome-wide analysis reveals that HuR binds to mRNA transcripts related to ciliogenesis, including cilia and flagella associated protein 52 (<I>Cfap52</I>), the effector gene of Foxj-1 and Rfx transcriptional factors. HuR deficiency accelerates the degradation of <I>Cfap52</I> mRNA, while overexpression of Cfap52 is able to promote the development of HuR-deficient ependymal cells. Taken together, our results unravel the important role of HuR in posttranscriptional regulation of ependymal cell development by stabilizing <I>Cfap52</I> mRNA.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study identifies Hu antigen R (HuR) as a genetic factor involved in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus. Mechanistically, HuR regulates ependymal cell differentiation and ciliogenesis through stabilizing <I>Cfap52</I> mRNA, the effector gene of Foxj-1 and Rfx transcriptional factors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortical Control of Virtual Self-Motion Using Task-Specific Subspaces</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brain&ndash;machine interfaces (BMIs) for reaching have enjoyed continued performance improvements, yet there remains significant need for BMIs that control other movement classes. Recent scientific findings suggest that the intrinsic covariance structure of neural activity depends strongly on movement class, potentially necessitating different decode algorithms across classes. To address this possibility, we developed a self-motion BMI based on cortical activity as monkeys cycled a hand-held pedal to progress along a virtual track. Unlike during reaching, we found no high-variance dimensions that directly correlated with to-be-decoded variables. This was due to no neurons having consistent correlations between their responses and kinematic variables. Yet we could decode a single variable&mdash;self-motion&mdash;by nonlinearly leveraging structure that spanned multiple high-variance neural dimensions. Resulting online BMI-control success rates approached those during manual control. These findings make two broad points regarding how to build decode algorithms that harmonize with the empirical structure of neural activity in motor cortex. First, even when decoding from the same cortical region (e.g., arm-related motor cortex), different movement classes may need to employ very different strategies. Although correlations between neural activity and hand velocity are prominent during reaching tasks, they are not a fundamental property of motor cortex and cannot be counted on to be present in general. Second, although one generally desires a low-dimensional readout, it can be beneficial to leverage a multidimensional high-variance subspace. Fully embracing this approach requires highly nonlinear approaches tailored to the task at hand, but can produce near-native levels of performance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many brain&ndash;machine interface decoders have been constructed for controlling movements normally performed with the arm. Yet it is unclear how these will function beyond the reach-like scenarios where they were developed. Existing decoders implicitly assume that neural covariance structure, and correlations with to-be-decoded kinematic variables, will be largely preserved across tasks. We find that the correlation between neural activity and hand kinematics, a feature typically exploited when decoding reach-like movements, is essentially absent during another task performed with the arm: cycling through a virtual environment. Nevertheless, the use of a different strategy, one focused on leveraging the highest-variance neural signals, supported high performance real-time brain&ndash;machine interface control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Speech Categorization Reveals the Role of Early-Stage Temporal-Coherence Processing in Auditory Scene Analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Temporal coherence of sound fluctuations across spectral channels is thought to aid auditory grouping and scene segregation. Although prior studies on the neural bases of temporal-coherence processing focused mostly on cortical contributions, neurophysiological evidence suggests that temporal-coherence-based scene analysis may start as early as the cochlear nucleus (i.e., the first auditory region supporting cross-channel processing over a wide frequency range). Accordingly, we hypothesized that aspects of temporal-coherence processing that could be realized in early auditory areas may shape speech understanding in noise. We then explored whether physiologically plausible computational models could account for results from a behavioral experiment that measured consonant categorization in different masking conditions. We tested whether within-channel masking of target-speech modulations predicted consonant confusions across the different conditions and whether predictions were improved by adding across-channel temporal-coherence processing mirroring the computations known to exist in the cochlear nucleus. Consonant confusions provide a rich characterization of error patterns in speech categorization, and are thus crucial for rigorously testing models of speech perception; however, to the best of our knowledge, they have not been used in prior studies of scene analysis. We find that within-channel modulation masking can reasonably account for category confusions, but that it fails when temporal fine structure cues are unavailable. However, the addition of across-channel temporal-coherence processing significantly improves confusion predictions across all tested conditions. Our results suggest that temporal-coherence processing strongly shapes speech understanding in noise and that physiological computations that exist early along the auditory pathway may contribute to this process.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Temporal coherence of sound fluctuations across distinct frequency channels is thought to be important for auditory scene analysis. Prior studies on the neural bases of temporal-coherence processing focused mostly on cortical contributions, and it was unknown whether speech understanding in noise may be shaped by across-channel processing that exists in earlier auditory areas. Using physiologically plausible computational modeling to predict consonant confusions across different listening conditions, we find that across-channel temporal coherence contributes significantly to scene analysis and speech perception and that such processing may arise in the auditory pathway as early as the brainstem. By virtue of providing a richer characterization of error patterns not obtainable with just intelligibility scores, consonant confusions yield unique insight into scene analysis mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hypocretin/Orexin Interactions with Norepinephrine Contribute to the Opiate Withdrawal Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <p>We previously found that human heroin addicts and mice chronically exposed to morphine exhibit a significant increase in the number of detected hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt)-producing neurons. However, it remains unknown how this increase affects target areas of the hypocretin system involved in opioid withdrawal, including norepinephrine containing structures locus coeruleus (LC) and A1/A2 medullary regions. Using a combination of immunohistochemical, biochemical, imaging, and behavioral techniques, we now show that the increase in detected hypocretin cell number translates into a significant increase in hypocretin innervation and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels in the LC without affecting norepinephrine-containing neuronal cell number. We show that the increase in TH is completely dependent on Hcrt innervation. The A1/A2 regions were unaffected by morphine treatment. Manipulation of the Hcrt system may affect opioid addiction and withdrawal.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previously, we have shown that the hypothalamic hypocretin system undergoes profound anatomic changes in human heroin addicts and in mice exposed to morphine, suggesting a role of this system in the development of addictive behaviors. The locus coeruleus plays a key role in opioid addiction. Here we report that the hypothalamic hypocretin innervation of the locus coeruleus increases dramatically with morphine administration to mice. This increase is correlated with a massive increase in tyrosine hydroxylase expression in locus coeruleus. Elimination of hypocretin neurons prevents the tyrosine hydroxylase increase in locus coeruleus and dampens the somatic and affective components of opioid withdrawal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Aging Enhances Neural Activity in Auditory, Visual, and Somatosensory Cortices: The Common Cause Revisited</a></h4>

              
                <p>In humans, age-related declines in vision, hearing, and touch coincide with changes in amplitude and latency of sensory-evoked potentials. These age-related differences in neural activity may be related to a common deterioration of supra-modal brain areas (e.g., PFC) that mediate activity in sensory cortices or reflect specific sensorineural impairments that may differ between sensory modalities. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we measured neuroelectric brain activity while 37 young adults (18-30 years, 18 males) and 35 older adults (60-88 years, 20 males) were presented with a rapid randomized sequence of lateralized auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli. Within each sensory domain, we compared amplitudes and latencies of sensory-evoked responses, source activity, and functional connectivity (via phase-locking value) between groups. We found that older adults' early sensory-evoked responses were greater in amplitude than those of young adults in all three modalities, which coincided with enhanced source activity in auditory, visual, and somatosensory cortices. Older adults also showed stronger neural synchrony than young adults between superior prefrontal and sensory cortices; and in older adults, the degree of phase synchrony was positively correlated with the magnitude of source activity in sensory areas. Critically, older adults who showed enhanced neural activity in one sensory domain also showed enhanced activity in other modalities. Together, these findings support the common cause hypothesis of aging and highlight the role of prefrontal regions in exerting top-down control over sensory cortices.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A prominent theory of aging posits that age-related declines in sensory processing across domains are related to a single common neurobiological mechanism. However, the neural evidence supporting this common cause hypothesis has remained elusive. Our study revealed robust age-related changes in three sensory domains across a range of neural metrics. Importantly, older adults who showed increased neural activity within one sensory domain also showed enhanced neural activity in the other two sensory modalities. No such relation among activity in sensory cortices was observed in young adults. Age-related increases in neural activity in sensory cortices coincided with enhanced neural synchrony between the PFC and sensory cortices, underlining the importance of the PFC in regulating sensory processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A One-Shot Shift from Explore to Exploit in Monkey Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Much animal learning is slow, with cumulative changes in behavior driven by reward prediction errors. When the abstract structure of a problem is known, however, both animals and formal learning models can rapidly attach new items to their roles within this structure, sometimes in a single trial. Frontal cortex is likely to play a key role in this process. To examine information seeking and use in a known problem structure, we trained monkeys in an explore/exploit task, requiring the animal first to test objects for their association with reward, then, once rewarded objects were found, to reselect them on further trials for further rewards. Many cells in the frontal cortex showed an explore/exploit preference aligned with one-shot learning in the monkeys' behavior: the population switched from an explore state to an exploit state after a single trial of learning but partially maintained the explore state if an error indicated that learning had failed. Binary switch from explore to exploit was not explained by continuous changes linked to expectancy or prediction error. Explore/exploit preferences were independent for two stages of the trial: object selection and receipt of feedback. Within an established task structure, frontal activity may control the separate processes of explore and exploit, switching in one trial between the two.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Much animal learning is slow, with cumulative changes in behavior driven by reward prediction errors. When the abstract structure a problem is known, however, both animals and formal learning models can rapidly attach new items to their roles within this structure. To address transitions in neural activity during one-shot learning, we trained monkeys in an explore/exploit task using familiar objects and a highly familiar task structure. When learning was rapid, many frontal neurons showed a binary, one-shot switch between explore and exploit. Within an established task structure, frontal activity may control the separate operations of exploring alternative objects to establish their current role, then exploiting this knowledge for further reward.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Microglial Correlates of Late Life Physical Activity: Relationship with Synaptic and Cognitive Aging in Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Physical activity relates to reduced dementia risk, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms are unknown. We translated animal and <I>in vitro</I> studies demonstrating a causal link between physical activity and microglial homeostasis into humans. Decedents from Rush Memory and Aging Project completed actigraphy monitoring (average daily activity) and cognitive evaluation in life, and neuropathological examination at autopsy. Brain tissue was analyzed for microglial activation via immunohistochemistry (anti-human HLA-DP-DQ-DR) and morphology (% Stage I, II, or III), and synaptic protein levels (SNAP-25, synaptophysin, complexin-I, VAMP, syntaxin, synaptotagmin-1). Proportion of morphologically activated microglia (PAM) was estimated in ventromedial caudate, posterior putamen, inferior temporal (IT), and middle frontal gyrus. The 167 decedents averaged 90 years at death, two-thirds were nondemented, and 60% evidenced pathologic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Adjusting for age, sex, education, and motor performances, greater physical activity associated with lower PAM in the ventromedial caudate and IT. Relationships between physical activity and PAM in the ventromedial caudate or IT were particularly prominent in adults evidencing microinfarcts or AD pathology, respectively. Mediational analyses indicated that PAM IT mediated ~30% of the relationships between (1) physical activity and synaptic protein in IT, and (2) physical activity and global cognition, in separate models. However, the size of the mediation depended on AD pathology ranging from &gt;40% in adults with high AD burden, but &lt;10% in adults with low AD burden. Lower microglial activation may be a pathway linking physical activity to age-related brain health in humans. Physical activity may promote AD-related synaptic and cognitive resilience through reduction of pro-inflammatory microglial states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Physical activity relates to better cognitive aging and reduced risk of neurodegenerative disease, yet the cellular and molecular pathways linking behavior-to-brain in humans are unknown. Animal studies indicate that increasing physical activity leads to decreased microglial activation and corresponding increases in synaptogenesis and neurogenesis. We objectively monitored physical activity (accelerometer-based actigraphy) and cognitive performances in life, and quantified microglial activation and synaptic markers in brain tissue at death in older adults. These are the first data supporting microglial activation as a physiological pathway by which physical activity relates to brain heath in humans. Although more interventional work is needed, we suggest that physical activity may be a modifiable behavior leveraged to reduce pro-inflammatory microglial states in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Predictive Representations in Hippocampal and Prefrontal Hierarchies</a></h4>

              
                <p>As we navigate the world, we use learned representations of relational structures to explore and to reach goals. Studies of how relational knowledge enables inference and planning are typically conducted in controlled small-scale settings. It remains unclear, however, how people use stored knowledge in continuously unfolding navigation (e.g., walking long distances in a city). We hypothesized that multiscale predictive representations guide naturalistic navigation in humans, and these scales are organized along posterior-anterior prefrontal and hippocampal hierarchies. We conducted model-based representational similarity analyses of neuroimaging data collected while male and female participants navigated realistically long paths in virtual reality. We tested the pattern similarity of each point, along each path, to a weighted sum of its successor points within predictive horizons of different scales. We found that anterior PFC showed the largest predictive horizons, posterior hippocampus the smallest, with the anterior hippocampus and orbitofrontal regions in between. Our findings offer novel insights into how cognitive maps support hierarchical planning at multiple scales.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Whenever we navigate the world, we represent our journey at multiple horizons: from our immediate surroundings to our distal goal. How are such cognitive maps at different horizons simultaneously represented in the brain? Here, we applied a reinforcement learning-based analysis to neuroimaging data acquired while participants virtually navigated their hometown. We investigated neural patterns in the hippocampus and PFC, key cognitive map regions. We uncovered predictive representations with multiscale horizons in prefrontal and hippocampal gradients, with the longest predictive horizons in anterior PFC and the shortest in posterior hippocampus. These findings provide empirical support for the computational hypothesis that multiscale neural representations guide goal-directed navigation. This advances our understanding of hierarchical planning in everyday navigation of realistic distances.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Roles for Prefrontal Dopamine D1 and D2 Neurons in Social Hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) controls dominance hierarchies in groups of animals. Dopamine (DA) strongly modulates PFC activity mainly through D1 receptors (D1Rs) and D2 receptors (D2Rs). Still, it is unclear how these two subpopulations of DA receptor-expressing neurons in the PFC regulate social dominance hierarchy. Here, we demonstrate distinct roles for prefrontal D1R- and D2R-expressing neurons in establishing social hierarchy, with D1R<sup>+</sup> neurons determining dominance and D2R<sup>+</sup> neurons for subordinate. <I>Ex vivo</I> whole-cell recordings revealed that the dominant status of male mice correlates with rectifying AMPAR transmission and stronger excitatory synaptic strength onto D1R<sup>+</sup> neurons in PFC pyramidal neurons. In contrast, the submissive status is associated with higher neuronal excitability in D2R<sup>+</sup> neurons. Moreover, simultaneous manipulations of synaptic efficacy of D1R<sup>+</sup> neurons in dominant male mice and neuronal excitability of D2R<sup>+</sup> neurons of their male subordinates switch their dominant&ndash;subordinate relationship. These results reveal that prefrontal D1R<sup>+</sup> and D2R<sup>+</sup> neurons have distinct but synergistic functions in the dominance hierarchy, and DA-mediated regulation of synaptic strengths acts as a powerful behavioral determinant of intermale social rank.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dominance hierarchy exists widely among animals who confront social conflict. Studies have indicated that social status largely relies on the neuronal activity in the PFC, but how dopamine influences social hierarchy via subpopulation of prefrontal neurons is still elusive. Here, we explore the cell type-specific role of dopamine receptor-expressing prefrontal neurons in the dominance&ndash;subordinate relationship. We found that the synaptic strength of D1 receptor-expressing neurons determines the dominant status, whereas hyperactive D2-expressing neurons are associated with the subordinate status. These findings highlight how social conflicts recruit distinct cortical microcircuits to drive different behaviors and reveal how D1- and D2-receptor enriched neurocircuits in the PFC establish a social hierarchy.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Insight into the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying development of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) will provide a foundation for improved therapies. We studied a model in which an episode of prolonged seizures is followed by recovery lasting two weeks before emergence of spontaneous recurrent seizures. We focused on the interval between the prolonged seizures and the late onset recurrent seizures. We investigated the hippocampal mossy fiber CA3 pyramidal cell microcircuit in models spanning <I>in vitro</I>, <I>in vivo</I>, and <I>ex vivo</I> preparations. Expression of channelrhodopsin-2 in the dentate granule cells of <I>DGC ChR</I> mice enabled the selective activation of mossy fiber axons. <I>In vivo</I> studies revealed marked potentiation of mossy fiber evoked field potentials in hippocampal CA3 beginning within hours following seizures, a potentiation which persisted at least 7 d. Stimulation of mossy fibers in hippocampal slices <I>in vitro</I> using patterns of activity mimicking seizures induced LTP not only of the monosynaptic EPSC but also of the disynaptic IPSC of CA3 pyramidal cells. <I>Ex vivo</I> studies of slices isolated following seizures revealed evidence of LTP of mossy fiber evoked EPSC and disynaptic IPSC of CA3 pyramidal cells. We suggest that activation of dentate granule cells during seizures induces these plasticities <I>in vivo</I> and the retained balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition limits excessive activation of CA3 pyramidal cells, thereby protecting animals from spontaneous recurrent seizures at this interval following status epilepticus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Paradigm shift in medical education due to the COVID-19 pandemic: guidelines for developing a blended learning curriculum in medical education [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has transformed the world’s economy, health and education in a blink of an eye. Almost 1 billion learners have been affected across the globe. This has resulted in a paradigm shift to blended learning. Therefore, it was felt necessary to provide practical guidelines for the development of blended curriculum in medical education. It would help to overcome the challenges faced due to unprecedented transformation of medical education on account of pandemic. Methods: Guidelines based on personal experience of the authors and literature search were developed using the complex adapted blended learning system (CALBS) framework. Seven experts developed these guidelines using the nominal group technique. The consent form and literature for CABLS framework was shared with experts. The experts developed the guidelines independently during phase one of the technique. After a given time, phase 2 started with moderator mediated discussion about the individual guidelines developed by the experts. After discussion and mutual consensus four types of guideline ideas were developed. During the third phase the experts ranked the guideline ideas on a scale of 1 to 5. The guideline idea that ranked highest was selected as a final guideline for developing a blended learning curriculum. Results: The group consensus resulted in developing seven guidelines for a blended course or curriculum in medical education. These guidelines are based on a conceptual framework supplemented by expert’s own personal experience and current evidence from literature. Conclusions: These guidelines would provide a comprehensive and systematic approach to develop a blended learning curriculum in medical education.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">How academic sabbaticals used and how they contribute to research – a small-scale study of the University of Cambridge using interviews and analysis of administrative data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Academic sabbaticals are seen as an important aspect of academic life and require considerable resources, however, little research has been done into how they are used and whether their effects can be measured. We explored these issues at the University of Cambridge. Methods: A mixed method approach including 24 interviews with academics, eight interviews with administrators; alongside analysis of administrative and publication data between 2010 and 2019. Results: Academics underline the importance of sabbaticals in providing uninterrupted time for research that is used to think, explore new ideas, master new techniques, develop new collaborations, draw together previous work, set work in a wider context, and provide personal discretion in research direction. They also highlight sabbaticals’ contributions in allowing the beneficial effects of combining teaching and research, while mitigating some of the disadvantages. However, it is difficult to detect the effect of sabbaticals on publications using a time series approach. Conclusions: Sabbaticals provide manifold contributions to academic research at the University of Cambridge; however, detecting and quantifying this contribution, and extending these findings requires wider and more detailed investigation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors Associated with Knowledge and Awareness of Stroke Among the Jordanian Population: A Cross-Sectional Study [version 2; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background and objective: Stroke is the second leading cause of death in Jordan and over the world. Knowledge and awareness towards stroke play a crucial role in the management and prevention of its complications. This study aims to assess the knowledge and awareness about stroke among the Jordanian population and determine factors associated with stroke awareness. Methods: This cross-sectional study through a web-based anonymous questionnaire that needed 10 minutes to be completed. It examined sociodemographic characteristics and recognition of the risk factors, warning signs, stroke consequences, and early response to stroke symptoms. Logistic regression analysis identified the factors associated with poor knowledge of stroke.  Results: A total of 573 Jordanian adults participated in this study. The participant's ability to identify at least one early symptom of stroke and the proper response to the symptoms were significantly correlated with the educational level (OR of 3.4 and 2.5, respectively). At least one consequence of stroke was significantly associated with different demographic factors such as gender, socioeconomic income, females versus males and those with medium income versus low income had significantly higher odds (OR of 6.6 and 4.1, respectively). Conclusion: This study revealed a good knowledge and awareness level about stroke among Jordanians correlated mainly with their educational level. Therefore, new strategies should be considered to decrease the prevalence of stroke in Jordan, including the need for engagement in enhanced awareness campaigns.

                Thermal injuries in young children involving the buttocks, perineum, and lower limbs raise suspicion of child abuse. Determining the manner of death and ruling out homicide in a fatal case of scalding remains a challenge for forensic practitioners. One such issue is reported in the present case report, where a medicolegal evaluation of a fatal scald in a two-year-old girl child is discussed. Young children sustaining serious injuries from scalds is a grave social concern. Such young lives need to be protected from scald injuries whether accidental or purposeful. Differences in injury patterns on the basis of their distribution and their characteristics are important to determine manner of death in such cases.

                Invasive fungal diseases due to resistant yeasts and molds are an important and increasing public health threat, likely due to a growing population of immunosuppressed hosts, increases in antifungal resistance, and improvements in laboratory diagnostics.  The significant morbidity and mortality associated with these pathogens bespeaks the urgent need for novel safe and effective therapeutics.  This review highlights promising investigational antifungal agents in clinical phases of development: fosmanogepix, ibrexafungerp, rezafungin, encochleated amphotericin B, oteseconazole (VT-1161), VT-1598, PC945, and olorofim.  We discuss three first-in-class members of three novel antifungal classes, as well as new agents within existing antifungal classes with improved safety and tolerability profiles due to enhanced pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.

                Background: Oxidative stress and the mild inflammatory process present in diabetes play a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease and its comorbidities. This understanding has opened new avenues and targets for developing improved treatments since the risk factors associated with diabetes may be reduced through non-pharmacological interventions. In this sense, plant extracts could be efficient in preventing or assisting these pathological conditions treatment. Methods: Diabetes mellitus was induced in 24 rats, which were allocated in 4 groups: Control (CT), Control+Baccharis (CT-B), Diabetes (DB), and Diabetes+Baccharis (DB-B). For 28 days, the animals of CT-B and DB-B groups were treated, via gavage, with B. dracunculifolia extract at 50 mg.kg-1. Results: The DB group presented higher values than the DB-B group on parameters such as creatinine (26.42%), urea (31.42%), and triglycerides (60.80%). Creatinine and triglycerides values of DB-B group (0.39±0.01 e 75.0±8.4, receptively) were equivalent to the values of CT group (0.32±0.01 e 71.7±5.4) and of CT-B group (0.39±0.01, and 58.8±4.5). The treatment with B. dracunculifolia improved the levels of fasting glucose and response of glucose tolerance (32%), insulin (52,17%) and lipid peroxidation (liver 33.33%, kidney 38.77%) when compared to the DB group. Conclusions: The phenolic compounds and the anti-inflammatory activity of the extract of Baccharis dracunculifolia may be responsible for the hypoglycemic effect observed in the study.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Hybrid simulation modelling of networks of heterogeneous care homes and the inter-facility spread of Covid-19 by sharing staff</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Le Khanh Ngan Nguyen, Itamar Megiddo, Susan Howick</p>

Although system dynamics [SD] and agent-based modelling [ABM] have individually served as effective tools to understand the Covid-19 dynamics, combining these methods in a hybrid simulation model can help address Covid-19 questions and study systems and settings that are difficult to study with a single approach. To examine the spread and outbreak of Covid-19 across multiple care homes via bank/agency staff and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting this group, we develop an integrated hybrid simulation model combining the advantages of SD and ABM. We also demonstrate how we use several approaches adapted from both SD and ABM practices to build confidence in this model in response to the lack of systematic approaches to validate hybrid models. Our modelling results show that the risk of infection for residents in care homes using bank/agency staff was significantly higher than those not using bank/agency staff (Relative risk [RR] 2.65, 95% CI 2.57–2.72). Bank/agency staff working across several care homes had a higher risk of infection compared with permanent staff working in a single care home (RR 1.55, 95%CI 1.52–1.58). The RR of infection for residents is negatively correlated to bank/agency staff’s adherence to weekly PCR testing. Within a network of heterogeneous care homes, using bank/agency staff had the most impact on care homes with lower intra-facility transmission risks, higher staff-to-resident ratio, and smaller size. Forming bubbles of care homes had no or limited impact on the spread of Covid-19. This modelling study has implications for policy makers considering developing effective interventions targeting staff working across care homes during the ongoing and future pandemics.

                <p>by Georgy Antonov, Christopher Gagne, Eran Eldar, Peter Dayan</p>

The replay of task-relevant trajectories is known to contribute to memory consolidation and improved task performance. A wide variety of experimental data show that the content of replayed sequences is highly specific and can be modulated by reward as well as other prominent task variables. However, the rules governing the choice of sequences to be replayed still remain poorly understood. One recent theoretical suggestion is that the prioritization of replay experiences in decision-making problems is based on their effect on the choice of action. We show that this implies that subjects should replay sub-optimal actions that they dysfunctionally choose rather than optimal ones, when, by being forgetful, they experience large amounts of uncertainty in their internal models of the world. We use this to account for recent experimental data demonstrating exactly pessimal replay, fitting model parameters to the individual subjects’ choices.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Robust dynamic experiments for the precise estimation of respiration and fermentation parameters of fruit and vegetables</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arno Strouwen, Bart M. Nicolaï, Peter Goos</p>

Dynamic models based on non-linear differential equations are increasingly being used in many biological applications. Highly informative dynamic experiments are valuable for the identification of these dynamic models. The storage of fresh fruit and vegetables is one such application where dynamic experimentation is gaining momentum. In this paper, we construct optimal O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> gas input profiles to estimate the respiration and fermentation kinetics of pear fruit. The optimal input profiles, however, depend on the true values of the respiration and fermentation parameters. Locally optimal design of input profiles, which uses a single initial guess for the parameters, is the traditional method to deal with this issue. This method, however, is very sensitive to the initial values selected for the model parameters. Therefore, we present a robust experimental design approach that can handle uncertainty on the model parameters.

                The commonly accepted model to quantify the specificity of transcription factor binding to DNA is the position weight matrix, also called the position-specific scoring matrix. Position weight matrices are used in thousands of projects and computational tools in regulatory genomics, including prediction of the regulatory potential of single-nucleotide variants. Yet, recently Yan et al. presented new experimental method for analysis of regulatory variants and, based on its results, reported that "the position weight matrices of most transcription factors lack sufficient predictive power". Here, we re-analyze the rich experimental dataset obtained by Yan et al. and show that appropriately selected position weight matrices in fact can successfully quantify transcription factor binding to alternative alleles.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The paradox of food production, consumption, poverty and malnutrition in Tanzania: an ecological study design [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There have been claims amongst nutrition stakeholders in Tanzania that the food basket regions, are the regions most affected by stunting among  children. However, this study could not find evidence that combines food production and stunting levels, to substantiate this claim. Therefore, this study aims to compare data on stunting, food production and consumption within administrative regions of the Tanzania mainland. Methods: The study used an ecological study design to show the relationship between stunting, poverty, food production and consumption across administrative regions in Tanzania. The study used data from three national wide surveys: 2017/2018 Household Budget Survey (HBS), Tanzania National Nutrition Survey (TNNS) 2018 and Agriculture Statistics for Food Security report 2018/2019. Results: The study showed that there is a positive relationship between the prevalence of stunting and food production (r=0.43, p=0.03), while there is a negative relationship between stunting and the level of both the average monthly household consumption expenditure (r = -0.48, p = 0.01) and average monthly household food consumption expenditure (r = -0.509, p = 0.01). It was further found that some regions which have higher levels of stunting such as Njombe, have the lowest level of basic need poverty. Conclusion: The study found a positive relationship between food production and the prevalence of stunting using data across regions in mainland Tanzania. This is an indication that regional food security may not entail nutrition security, hence a call for more advocacy on nutrition-sensitive agriculture.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The mutationathon highlights the importance of reaching standardization in estimates of pedigree-based germline mutation rates</a></h4>

              
                In the past decade, several studies have estimated the human per-generation germline mutation rate using large pedigrees. More recently, estimates for various non-human species have been published. However, methodological differences among studies in detecting germline mutations and estimating mutation rates make direct comparisons difficult. Here, we describe the many different steps involved in estimating pedigree-based mutation rates, including sampling, sequencing, mapping, variant calling, filtering, and how to appropriately account for false-positive and false-negative rates. For each step, we review the different methods and parameter choices that have been used in the recent literature. Additionally, we present the results from a 'Mutationathon', a competition organized among five research labs to compare germline mutation rate estimates for a single pedigree of rhesus macaques. We report almost a two-fold variation in the final estimated rate among groups using different post-alignment processing, calling, and filtering criteria and provide details into the sources of variation across studies. Though the difference among estimates is not statistically significant, this discrepancy emphasizes the need for standardized methods in mutation rate estimations and the difficulty in comparing rates from different studies. Finally, this work aims to provide guidelines for computational and statistical benchmarks for future studies interested in identifying germline mutations from pedigrees.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons integrates homeostatic state with dopamine signalling in the striatum</a></h4>

              
                Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons increase motivation for food, however whether metabolic sensing of homeostatic state in AgRP neurons potentiates motivation by interacting with dopamine reward systems is unexplored. As a model of impaired metabolic-sensing, we used the AgRP-specific deletion of carnitine acetyltransferase (<i>Crat</i>) in mice. We hypothesized that metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons is required to increase motivation for food reward by modulating accumbal or striatal dopamine release. Studies confirmed that <i>Crat</i> deletion in AgRP neurons (KO) impaired <i>ex vivo</i> glucose-sensing, as well as <i>in vivo</i> responses to peripheral glucose injection or repeated palatable food presentation and consumption. Impaired metabolic-sensing in AgPP neurons reduced acute dopamine release (seconds) to palatable food consumption and during operant responding, as assessed by GRAB-DA photometry in the nucleus accumbens, but not the dorsal striatum. Impaired metabolic-sensing in AgRP neurons suppressed radiolabelled 18F-fDOPA accumulation after ~30 minutes in the dorsal striatum but not the nucleus accumbens. Impaired metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons suppressed motivated operant responding for sucrose rewards during fasting. Thus, metabolic-sensing in AgRP neurons is required for the appropriate temporal integration and transmission of homeostatic hunger-sensing to dopamine signalling in the striatum.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Chromatin topology defines estradiol-primed progesterone receptor and PAX2 binding in endometrial cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Estrogen (E2) and Progesterone (Pg), via their specific receptors (ERalpha and PR), are major determinants in the development and progression of endometrial carcinomas, However, their precise mechanism of action and the role of other transcription factors involved are not entirely clear. Using Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells, we report that E2 treatment exposes a set of progestin-dependent PR binding sites which include both E2 and progestin target genes. ChIP-seq results from hormone-treated cells revealed a non-random distribution of PAX2 binding in the vicinity of these estrogen-promoted PR sites. Altered expression of hormone regulated genes in PAX2 knockdown cells suggests a role for PAX2 in fine-tuning ERalpha and PR interplay in transcriptional regulation. Analysis of long-range interactions by Hi-C coupled with ATAC-seq data showed that these regions, that we call 'progestin control regions' (PgCRs), exhibited an open chromatin state even before hormone exposure and were non-randomly associated with regulated genes. Nearly 20% of genes potentially influenced by PgCRs were found to be altered during progression of endometrial cancer. Our findings suggest that endometrial response to progestins in differentiated endometrial tumor cells results in part from binding of PR together with PAX2 to accessible chromatin regions. What maintains these regions open remains to be studied.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Recapitulating human cardio-pulmonary co-development using simultaneous multilineage differentiation of pluripotent stem cells</a></h4>

              
                The extensive crosstalk between the developing heart and lung is critical to their proper morphogenesis and maturation. However, there remains a lack of models that investigate the critical cardio-pulmonary mutual interaction during human embryogenesis. Here, we reported a novel stepwise strategy for directing the simultaneous induction of both mesoderm-derived cardiac and endoderm-derived lung epithelial lineages within a single differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) via temporal specific tuning of WNT and nodal signaling in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Using 3D suspension culture, we established concentric cardio-pulmonary micro-Tissues (mTs), and expedited alveolar maturation in the presence of cardiac accompaniment. Upon withdrawal of WNT agonist, the cardiac and pulmonary components within each dual-lineage mT effectively segregated from each other with concurrent initiation of cardiac contraction. We expect that our multilineage differentiation model will offer an experimentally tractable system for investigating human cardio-pulmonary interaction and tissue boundary formation during embryogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Systematic investigation of the link between enzyme catalysis and cold adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Cold temperature is prevalent across the biosphere and slows the rates of chemical reactions. Increased catalysis has been predicted to be a dominant adaptive trait of enzymes to reduced temperature, and this expectation has informed physical models for enzyme catalysis and influenced bioprospecting strategies. To systematically test rate enhancement as an adaptive trait to cold, we paired kinetic constants of 2223 enzyme reactions with their organism’s optimal growth temperature (<i>T</i><sub>Growth</sub>) and analyzed trends of rate constants as a function of <i>T</i><sub>Growth</sub>. These data do not support a general increase in rate enhancement in cold adaptation. In the model enzyme ketosteroid isomerase (KSI), there is prior evidence for temperature adaptation from a change in an active site residue that results in a tradeoff between activity and stability. Nevertheless, we found that little of the rate constant variation for 20 KSI variants was accounted for by <i>T</i><sub>Growth</sub>. In contrast, and consistent with prior expectations, we observed a correlation between stability and <i>T</i><sub>Growth</sub> across 433 proteins. These results suggest that temperature exerts a weaker selection pressure on enzyme rate constants than stability and that evolutionary forces other than temperature are responsible for the majority of enzymatic rate constant variation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Motor planning brings human primary somatosensory cortex into action-specific preparatory states</a></h4>

              
                Motor planning plays a critical role in producing fast and accurate movement. Yet, the neural processes that occur in human primary motor and somatosensory cortex during planning, and how they relate to those during movement execution, remain poorly understood. Here we used 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a delayed movement paradigm to study single finger movement planning and execution. The inclusion of no-go trials and variable delays allowed us to separate what are typically overlapping planning and execution brain responses. Although our univariate results show widespread deactivation during finger planning, multivariate pattern analysis revealed finger-specific activity patterns in contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1), which predicted the planned finger action. Surprisingly, these activity patterns were as informative as those found in contralateral primary motor cortex (M1). Control analyses ruled out the possibility that the detected information was an artifact of subthreshold movements during the preparatory delay. Furthermore, we observed that finger-specific activity patterns during planning were highly correlated to those during execution. These findings reveal that motor planning activates the specific S1 and M1 circuits that are engaged during the execution of a finger press, while activity in both regions is overall suppressed. We propose that preparatory states in S1 may improve movement control through changes in sensory processing or via direct influence of spinal motor neurons.

                Peripheral nerves are vascularized by a dense network of blood vessels to guarantee their complex function. Despite the crucial role of vascularization to ensure nerve homeostasis and regeneration, the mechanisms governing nerve invasion by blood vessels remain poorly understood. We found, in mice, that the sciatic nerve invasion by blood vessels begins around embryonic day 16 and continues until birth. Interestingly, intra-nervous blood vessel density significantly decreases during post-natal period, starting from P10. We show that, while the axon guidance molecule Netrin-1 promotes nerve invasion by blood vessels via the endothelial receptor UNC5B during embryogenesis, myelinated Schwann cells negatively control intra-nervous vascularization during postnatal period.

                Success in many real-world tasks depends on our ability to dynamically track hidden states of the world. To understand the underlying neural computations, we recorded brain activity in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of monkeys navigating by optic flow to a hidden target location within a virtual environment, without explicit position cues. In addition to sequential neural dynamics and strong interneuronal interactions, we found that the hidden state -- monkey's displacement from the goal -- was encoded in single neurons, and could be dynamically decoded from population activity. The decoded estimates predicted navigation performance on individual trials. Task manipulations that perturbed the world model induced substantial changes in neural interactions, and modified the neural representation of the hidden state, while representations of sensory and motor variables remained stable. The findings were recapitulated by a task-optimized recurrent neural network model, suggesting that neural interactions in PPC embody the world model to consolidate information and track task-relevant hidden states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimal control methods for nonlinear parameter estimation in biophysical neuron models</a></h4>

              
                Functional forms of biophysically-realistic neuron models are constrained by neurobiological and anatomical considerations, such as cell morphologies and the presence of known ion channels. Despite these constraints, neurons models still contain unknown static parameters which must be inferred from experiment. This inference task is most readily cast into the framework of state-space models, which systematically takes into account partial observability and measurement noise. Inferring only dynamical state variables such as membrane voltages is a well-studied problem, and has been approached with a wide range of techniques beginning with the well-known Kalman filter. Inferring both states and fixed parameters, on the other hand, is less straightforward. Here, we develop a method for joint parameter and state inference that combines traditional state space modeling with chaotic synchronization and optimal control. Our methods are tailored particularly to situations with considerable measurement noise, sparse observability, very nonlinear or chaotic dynamics, and highly uninformed priors. We illustrate our approach both in a canonical chaotic model and in a phenomenological neuron model, showing that many unknown parameters can be uncovered reliably and accurately from short and noisy observed time traces. Our method holds promise for estimation in larger-scale systems, given ongoing improvements in calcium reporters and genetically-encoded voltage indicators.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Heterosynaptic NMDA Receptor Plasticity in Hippocampal Dentate Granule Cells</a></h4>

              
                The dentate gyrus is a key relay station that controls information transfer from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus proper. This process heavily relies on dendritic integration by dentate granule cells (GCs) of excitatory synaptic inputs from medial and lateral entorhinal cortex via medial and lateral perforant paths (MPP and LPP, respectively). N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) can contribute significantly to the integrative properties of neurons. While early studies reported that excitatory inputs from entorhinal cortex onto GCs can undergo activity-dependent long-term plasticity of NMDAR-mediated transmission, the input-specificity of this plasticity along the dendritic axis remains unknown. Here, we examined the NMDAR plasticity rules at MPP-GC and LPP-GC synapses using physiologically relevant patterns of stimulation in acute rat hippocampal slices. We found that MPP-GC, but not LPP-GC synapses, expressed homosynaptic NMDAR-LTP. In addition, induction of NMDAR-LTP at MPP-GC synapses heterosynaptically potentiated distal LPP-GC NMDAR plasticity. The same stimulation protocol induced homosynaptic -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-LTP at MPP-GC but heterosynaptic AMPAR-LTD at distal LPP synapses, demonstrating that NMDAR and AMPAR are governed by different plasticity rules. Remarkably, heterosynaptic but not homosynaptic NMDAR-LTP required Ca2+ release from intracellular, ryanodine-dependent Ca2+ stores. Lastly, the induction and maintenance of both homo- and heterosynaptic NMDAR-LTP were blocked by GluN2D antagonism, suggesting the recruitment of GluN2D-containing receptors to the synapse. Our findings uncover a mechanism by which distinct inputs to the dentate gyrus may interact functionally and contribute to hippocampal-dependent memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GR-regulated enhancers play a central role in the gene regulatory networks underlying drug addiction</a></h4>

              
                Substance abuse and addiction represent a major public health problem that impacts multiple dimensions of society, including healthcare, economy, and workforce. In 2021, over 100,000 drug overdose deaths have been reported in the US with an alarming increase in fatalities related to opioids and psychostimulants. Understanding of the fundamental gene regulatory mechanisms underlying addiction and related behaviors could facilitate more effective treatments. To explore how repeated drug exposure alters gene regulatory networks in the brain, we combined capped small (cs)RNA-seq, which accurately captures nascent-like initiating transcripts from total RNA, with Hi-C and single nuclei (sn)ATAC-seq. We profiled initiating transcripts in two addiction-related brain regions, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc), from rats that were never exposed to drugs or were subjected to prolonged abstinence after oxycodone or cocaine intravenous self-administration (IVSA). Interrogating over 100,000 active transcription start regions (TSRs) revealed that most TSRs had hallmarks of bona-fide enhancers and highlighted the KLF/SP1, RFX and AP1 transcription factors families as central to establish brain-specific gene regulatory programs. Analysis of rats with addiction-like behaviors versus controls identified addiction-associated repression of transcription at regulatory enhancers recognized by nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C (NR3C) factors, which include glucocorticoid receptors. Cell-type deconvolution analysis using snATAC-seq uncovered a potential role of glial cells in driving the gene regulatory programs associated with addiction-related phenotypes. These findings highlight the power of advanced transcriptomics methods to provide insight into how addiction perturbs gene regulatory programs in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Propofol anesthesia alters cortical traveling waves</a></h4>

              
                Oscillatory dynamics in cortex seem to organize into traveling waves that serve a variety of functions. Recent studies show that propofol, a widely used anesthetic, dramatically alters cortical oscillations by increasing slow-delta oscillatory power and coherence. It is not known how this affects traveling waves. We compared traveling waves across the cortex of non-human primates (NHPs) before, during, and after propofol-induced loss-of-consciousness (LOC). After LOC, traveling waves in the slow-delta (~ 1Hz) range increased, grew more organized, and travelled in different directions relative to the awake state. Higher frequency (8-30 Hz) traveling waves, by contrast, decreased, lost structure, and switched to directions where the slow-delta waves were less frequent. The results suggest that LOC may be due, in part, to changes in slow-delta traveling waves that, in turn, alter and disrupt traveling waves in the higher frequencies associated with cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mid-level feature differences underlie early animacy and object size distinctions: Evidence from EEG decoding</a></h4>

              
                Responses to visually-presented objects along the cortical surface of the human brain have a large-scale organization reflecting the broad categorical divisions of animacy and object size. Mounting evidence indicates that this topographical organization is driven by differences between objects in mid-level perceptual features. With regard to the timing of neural responses, images of objects quickly evoke neural responses with decodable information about animacy and object size, but are mid-level features sufficient to evoke these rapid neural responses? Or is slower iterative neural processing required to untangle information about animacy and object size from mid-level features? To answer this question, we used electroencephalography(EEG) to measure human neural responses to images of objects and their texform counterparts - unrecognizable images which preserve some mid-level feature information about texture and coarse form. We found that texform images evoked neural responses with early decodable information about both animacy and real-world size, as early as responses evoked by original images. Further, successful cross-decoding indicates that both texform and original images evoke information about animacy and size through a common underlying neural basis. Broadly, these results indicate that the visual system contains a mid-level feature bank carrying linearly decodable information on animacy and size, which can be rapidly activated without requiring explicit recognition or protracted temporal processing.

                Mutations in the UBQLN2 gene cause X-linked dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and/or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) characterised by ubiquilin 2 aggregates in neurons of the motor cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and spinal cord. However, ubiquilin 2 neuropathology is also seen in sporadic and familial ALS or FTD cases not caused by UBQLN2 mutations, particularly C9ORF72-linked cases. This makes the mechanistic role of ubiquilin 2 mutations and the value of ubiquilin 2 pathology for predicting genotype unclear. Here we examine a cohort of 31 genotypically diverse ALS cases with or without FTD, including four cases with UBQLN2 mutations (resulting in p.P497H, p.P506S, and two cases with p.T487I). Using double-, triple-, and six-label fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we mapped the co-localisation of ubiquilin 2 with phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43), dipeptide repeat aggregates, and p62, in the hippocampus of controls (n=5), or ALS with or without FTD in sporadic (n=19), unknown familial (n=3), SOD1-linked (n=1), C9ORF72-linked (n=4), and UBQLN2-linked (n=4) cases. We differentiate between i) ubiquilin 2 aggregation together with, or driven by, pTDP-43 or dipeptide repeat proteins, and ii) ubiquilin 2 self-aggregation driven by UBQLN2 gene mutations. Together we describe a hippocampal protein aggregation signature that fully distinguishes mutant from wildtype ubiquilin 2 in ALS with or without FTD, whereby mutant ubiquilin 2 is more prone than wildtype to aggregate independently of driving factors. This neuropathological signature can be used to assess the pathogenicity of UBQLN2 gene mutations and to understand the mechanisms of UBQLN2-linked disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal Transplants of Fetal GABAergic Progenitors Regulate Adult Neurogenesis in Mice with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                GABAergic interneurons within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus regulate adult neurogenesis, including proliferation, migration, and maturation of new granule cells born in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG). In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), some adult-born granule cells migrate ectopically into the hilus, and these cells contribute to increased hyperexcitability and seizures. Yet, transplanting embryonic day 13.5 fetal mouse medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) GABAergic progenitors into the hippocampus of mice with TLE ameliorates spontaneous seizures, due in part, to increased postsynaptic inhibition of adult-born granule cells. Here, we asked whether MGE progenitor transplantation affects earlier stages of adult neurogenesis, by comparing patterns of neurogenesis in naive mice and epileptic (TLE) mice, with or without MGE transplants. In naive and TLE mice, transplanted MGE cells showed comparable migration and process outgrowth. However, in TLE mice with MGE transplants, fewer adult-born Type 3 progenitors migrated ectopically. Furthermore, more Type 3 progenitors survived and migrated into the granule cell layer (GCL), as determined by immunostaining for doublecortin or the thymidine analogue, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). To determine whether MGE transplants affected earlier stages of adult neurogenesis, we compared proliferation in the SGZ two-hours after pulse labeling with BrdU in naive vs. TLE mice and found no significant differences. Furthermore, MGE progenitor transplantation had no effect on cell proliferation in the SGZ. Moreover, when compared to naive mice, TLE mice showed increases in inverted Type 1 progenitors and Type 2 progenitors, concomitant with a decrease in the normally oriented radial Type 1 progenitors. Strikingly, these alterations were abrogated by MGE transplantation. Thus, MGE transplants appear to reverse seizure-induced abnormalities in adult neurogenesis by increasing differentiation and radial migration of adult-born granule cell progenitors, outcomes that may ameliorate seizures.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hydrodynamic and Polyelectrolyte Properties of Actin Filaments: Theory and Experiments</a></h4>

              
                Actin filament's polyelectrolyte and hydrodynamic properties, their interactions with the biological environment, and external force fields play an essential role in their biological activities in eukaryotic cellular processes. In this article, we introduce a unique approach that combines dynamics and electrophoresis light scattering experiments, an extended semiflexible worm-like chain model, and an asymmetric polymer length distribution theory to characterize the polyelectrolyte and hydrodynamic properties of actin filaments in aqueous electrolyte solutions. We used the same sample and experimental conditions and considered several g-actin and polymerization buffers to elucidate the impact of their chemical composition, reducing agents, pH values, and ionic strengths on the filament translational diffusion coefficient, electrophoretic mobility, structure factor, asymmetric length distribution, effective filament diameter, electric charge, zeta potential, and semiflexibility. Compared to those values obtained from molecular structure models, our results revealed a lower value of the effective G-actin charge and a more significant value of the effective filament diameter due to the formation of the double layer of the electrolyte surrounding the filaments. Additionally, compared to the values usually reported from electron micrographs, the lower values of our results for the persistence length and average contour filament length agrees with the significant difference in the association rates at the filament ends that shift to submicro lengths, the maximum of the length distribution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">How salience enhances inhibitory control: An analysis of electro-cortical mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Stop-signal tasks (SSTs) combined with human electro-cortical recordings (Event-Related Potentials, ERPs) have revealed mechanisms associated with successful stopping (relative to failed), presumably contributing to inhibitory control. The corresponding ERP signatures have been labeled stop N1 (+/- 100-ms latency), stop N2 (200 ms), and stop P3 (160-250 ms), and argued to reflect more proactive (N1) versus more reactive (N2, P3) mechanisms. However, stop N1 and stop N2, as well as latencies of stop-P3, appear to be quite inconsistent across studies. The present work addressed the possible influence of stop-signal salience, expecting high salience to induce clear stop N1s but reduced stop N2s, and short-latency stop P3s. Three SST varieties were combined with high-resolution EEG. An imperative visual (go) stimulus was occasionally followed by a subsequent (stop) stimulus that signalled to withhold the just initiated response. Stop-Signal Reaction Times (SSRTs) decreased linearly from visual-low to visual-high-salience to auditory. Auditory Stop N1 was replicated. A C1-like visual evoked potential (latency < 100 ms) was observed only with high salience, but not robustly associated with successful versus failed stops. Using the successful-failed contrast a visual stop-N1 analogue (112-156 ms post-stop-signal) was identified, as was right-frontal stop N2, but neither was sensitive to salience. Stop P3 had shorter latency for high than for low salience, and the extent of the early high-salience stop P3 correlated inversely with SSRT. These results suggest that salience-enhanced inhibitory control as manifest in SSRTs is associated with reactive rather than proactive electrocortical mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Error quantification in multi-parameter mapping facilitates robust estimation and enhanced group level sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Multi-Parameter Mapping (MPM) is a comprehensive quantitative neuroimaging protocol that enables estimation of four physical parameters (longitudinal and effective transverse relaxation rates R1 and R2*, proton density PD, and magnetization transfer saturation MTsat) that are sensitive to microstructural tissue properties such as iron and myelin content. Their capability to reveal microstructural brain differences, however, is tightly bound to controlling random noise and artefacts (e.g. caused by head motion) in the signal. Here, we introduced a method to estimate the local error of PD, R1, and MTsat maps that captures both noise and artefacts on a routine basis without requiring additional data. To investigate the method's sensitivity to random noise, we calculated the model-based signal-to-noise ratio (mSNR) and showed in measurements and simulations that it correlated linearly with an experimental raw-image-based SNR map. We found that the mSNR varied with MPM protocols, magnetic field strength (3T vs. 7T) and MPM parameters: it halved from PD to R1 and decreased from PD to MT_sat by a factor of 3-4. Exploring the artefact-sensitivity of the error maps, we generated robust MPM parameters using two successive acquisitions of each contrast and the acquisition-specific errors to down-weight erroneous regions. The resulting robust MPM parameters showed reduced variability at the group level as compared to their single-repeat or averaged counterparts. The error and mSNR maps may better inform power-calculations by accounting for local data quality variations across measurements. Code to compute the mSNR maps and robustly combined MPM maps is available in the open-source hMRI toolbox.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Efficient generation of lower induced Motor Neurons by coupling Ngn2 expression with developmental cues</a></h4>

              
                Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a powerful tool for disease modelling and drug discovery, especially when access to primary tissue is limited, such as in the brain. Current neuronal differentiation approaches use either small molecules for directed differentiation or transcription-factor-mediated programming. In this study we coupled the overexpression of the neuralising transcription factor Neurogenin2 (Ngn2) with small molecule patterning to differentiate hPSCs into lower induced Motor Neurons (liMoNes). We showed that this approach induced activation of the motor neuron (MN) specific transcription factor Hb9/MNX1, using an Hb9::GFP-reporter line, with up to 95% of cells becoming Hb9::GFP+. These cells acquired and maintained expression of canonical early and mature MN markers. Molecular and functional profiling revealed that liMoNes resembled bona fide hPSC-derived MN differentiated by conventional small molecule patterning. liMoNes exhibited spontaneous electrical activity, expressed synaptic markers and formed contacts with muscle cells in vitro. Pooled, multiplex single-cell RNA sequencing on 50 cell lines revealed multiple anatomically distinct MN subtypes of cervical and brachial, limb-innervating MNs in reproducible quantities. We conclude that combining small molecule patterning with Ngn2 can facilitate the high-yield, robust and reproducible production of multiple disease-relevant MN subtypes, which is fundamental in the path to propel forward our knowledge of motoneuron biology and its disruption in disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Combining ultra-high-field fMRI adaptation and computational modelling to estimate neuronal frequency selectivity in human auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Frequency selectivity is a ubiquitous property of auditory neurons. Measuring it in human auditory cortex may be crucial for understanding common auditory deficits, but current non-invasive neuroimaging techniques can only measure the aggregate response of large populations of cells, thereby overestimating tuning width. Here we attempted to estimate neuronal frequency tuning in human auditory cortex using a combination of fMRI-adaptation paradigm at 7T and computational modelling. We measured the BOLD response in the auditory cortex of eleven participants to a high frequency (3.8 kHz) probe presented alone or preceded by adaptors at different frequencies (0.5 to 3.8 kHz). From these data, we derived both the response tuning curves (the BOLD response to adaptors alone as a function of adaptor frequency) and adaptation tuning curves (the degree of response suppression to the probe as a function of adaptor frequency, assumed to reflect neuronal tuning) in primary and secondary auditory cortical areas, delineated in each participant. Results suggested the existence of both frequency-independent and frequency-specific adaptation components, with the latter being more frequency-tuned than response tuning curves. Using a computational model of neuronal adaptation and BOLD non-linearity in topographically-organized cortex, we demonstrate both that the frequency-specific adaptation component overestimates the underlying neuronal frequency tuning and that frequency-specific and frequency-independent adaptation component cannot easily be disentangled from the adaptation tuning curve. By fitting our model directly to the response and adaptation tuning curves, we derive a range of plausible values for neuronal frequency tuning. Our results suggest that fMRI adaptation is suitable for measuring neuronal frequency tuning properties in human auditory cortex, provided population effects and the non-linearity of BOLD response are taken into account.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">HIV and FIV glycoproteins increase cellular tau pathology via cGMP-dependent kinase II activation</a></h4>

              
                As the development of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drastically improves the lifespan of individuals with HIV, many are now entering the prime age when Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like symptoms begin to manifest. Hyperphosphorylated tau, a known AD pathological characteristic, has been prematurely increased in the brains of HIV-infected patients as early as in their 30s and is increased with age. This thus suggests that HIV infection may lead to accelerated AD phenotypes. However, whether HIV infection causes AD to develop more quickly in the brain is not yet fully determined. Interestingly, we have previously revealed that viral glycoproteins, HIV gp120 and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) gp95, induce neuronal hyperexcitation via cGMP-dependent kinase II (cGKII) activation in cultured hippocampal neurons. Here, we use cultured mouse cortical neurons to demonstrate that HIV gp120 and FIV gp95 are sufficient to increase cellular tau pathology, including intracellular tau hyperphosphorylation and tau release to the extracellular space. We further reveal that viral glycoprotein-induced cellular tau pathology requires cGKII activation. Together, HIV infection likely accelerates AD-related tau pathology via cGKII activation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex differences in pain-related behaviors and clinical progression of disease in mouse models of visceral pain</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have reported sex differences in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, including differences in visceral pain perception. Despite this, sex differences in behavioral manifestations of visceral pain and underlying pathology of the gastrointestinal tract have been largely understudied in preclinical research. In this study, we evaluated potential sex differences in spontaneous visceral nociceptive responses, referred abdominal hypersensitivity, disease progression and bowel pathology in mouse models of acute and persistent colon inflammation. Our experiments show that females exhibit more visceral nociceptive responses and referred abdominal hypersensitivity than males in the context of acute but not persistent colon inflammation. We further demonstrate that, following acute and persistent colon inflammation, visceral pain-related behavioral responses in females and males are distinct, with increases in licking of the abdomen only observed in females and increases in abdominal contractions only seen in males. During persistent colon inflammation, males exhibit worse disease progression than females, which is manifested as worse physical appearance and higher weight loss. However, no measurable sex differences were observed in persistent inflammation-induced bowel pathology, stool consistency or fecal blood. Overall, our findings demonstrate that visceral pain-related behaviors and disease progression in the context of acute and persistent colon inflammation are sex-dependent, highlighting the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in future mechanistic studies of visceral pain as well as in the development of diagnostics and therapeutic options for chronic gastrointestinal diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">"Learning in reverse: Dopamine errors drive excitatory and inhibitory components of backward conditioning in an outcome-specific manner".</a></h4>

              
                For over two decades, midbrain dopamine was considered synonymous with the prediction error in temporal-difference reinforcement learning. Central to this proposal is the notion that reward-predictive stimuli become endowed with the scalar value of predicted rewards. When these cues are subsequently encountered, their predictive value is compared to the value of the actual reward received allowing for the calculation of prediction errors. Phasic firing of dopamine neurons was proposed to reflect this computation, facilitating the backpropagation of value from the predicted reward to the reward-predictive stimulus, thus reducing future prediction errors. There are two critical assumptions of this proposal: 1) that dopamine errors can only facilitate learning about scalar value and not more complex features of predicted rewards, and 2) that the dopamine signal can only be involved in anticipatory learning in which cues or actions precede rewards. Recent work has challenged the first assumption, demonstrating that phasic dopamine signals across species are involved in learning about more complex features of the predicted outcomes, in a manner that transcends this value computation. Here, we tested the validity of the second assumption. Specifically, we examined whether phasic midbrain dopamine activity would be necessary for backward conditioning- when a neutral cue reliably follows a rewarding outcome. Using a specific Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) procedure, we show rats learn both excitatory and inhibitory components of a backward association, and that this association entails knowledge of the specific identity of the reward and cue. We demonstrate that brief optogenetic inhibition of ventral tegmental area dopamine (VTA DA) neurons timed to the transition between the reward and cue, reduces both of these components of backward conditioning. These findings suggest VTA DA neurons are capable of facilitating associations between contiguously occurring events, regardless of the content of those events. We conclude that these data are in line with suggestions that the VTA DA error acts as a universal teaching signal. This may provide insight into why dopamine function has been implicated in a myriad of psychological disorders that are characterized by very distinct reinforcement-learning deficits.

                Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is primarily a respiratory disease, however, an increasing number of reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection can also cause severe neurological manifestations, including precipitating cases of probable Parkinson's disease. As microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation is a major driver of neurodegeneration, here we interrogated whether SARS-CoV-2 can promote microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation utilising a model of human monocyte-derived microglia. We identified that SARS-CoV-2 isolates can bind and enter microglia, triggering inflammasome activation in the absence of viral replication. Mechanistically, microglial NLRP3 could be both primed and activated with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in a NF{kappa}B and ACE2-dependent manner. Notably, virus- and spike protein-mediated inflammasome activation in microglia was significantly enhanced in the presence of -synuclein fibrils, which was entirely ablated by NLRP3-inhibition. These results support a possible mechanism of microglia activation by SARS-CoV-2, which could explain the increased vulnerability to developing neurological symptoms akin to Parkinson's disease in certain COVID-19 infected individuals, and a potential therapeutic avenue for intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimization of an unscented Kalman filter for an embedded platform</a></h4>

              
                The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is finding increased application in biological fields. While realizing a complex UKF system in a low-power embedded platform offers many potential benefits including wearability, it also poses significant design challenges. Here we present a method for optimizing a UKF system for realization in an embedded platform. The method seeks to minimize both computation time and error in UKF state reconstruction and forecasting. As a case study, we applied the method to a model for the rat sleep-wake regulatory system in which 432 variants of the UKF over six different variables are considered. The optimization method is divided into three stages that assess computation time, state forecast error, and state reconstruction error. We apply a cost function to variants that pass all three stages to identify a variant that computes 27 times faster than the reference variant and maintains required levels of state estimation and forecasting accuracy. We draw the following insights: 1) process noise provides leeway for simplifying the model and its integration in ways that speed computation time while maintaining state forecasting accuracy, 2) the assimilation of observed data during the UKF correction step provides leeway for simplifying the UKF structure in ways that speed computation time while maintaining state reconstruction accuracy, and 3) the optimization process can be accelerated by decoupling variables that directly impact the underlying model from variables that impact the UKF structure.

                Aggregated alpha-synuclein (-synuclein) is the main component of Lewy bodies (LBs), Lewy neurites (LNs), and glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs), which are pathological hallmarks of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), respectively. Initiating factors that culminate in forming LBs/LNs/GCIs remain elusive. Several species of -synuclein exist, including phosphorylated and nitrated forms. It is unclear which -synuclein post-translational modifications (PTMs) appear within aggregates throughout disease pathology. Herein we aimed to establish the predominant -synuclein PTMs in post-mortem IPD and MSA pathology using immunohistochemistry. We examined the patterns of three -synuclein PTMs (pS87, pS129, nY39) simultaneously in pathology-affected regions of 15 PD, 5 MSA, 6 neurologically normal controls. All antibodies recognized LBs, LNs, and GCIs, albeit to a variable extent. pS129 -synuclein antibody was particularly immunopositive for LNs and synaptic dot-like structures followed by nY39 -synuclein antibody. GCIs, neuronal inclusions, and small threads were positive for nY39 -synuclein in MSA. Quantification of the LB scores revealed that pS129 -synuclein was the dominant and earliest -synuclein PTM followed by nY39 -synuclein, while lower amounts of pSer87 -synuclein appeared later in disease progression in PD. These results may have implications for novel biomarker and therapeutic developments.

                Continuous persist activity of the competitive network is related to many functions, such as working memory, oculomotor integrator and decision making. Many competition models with mutual inhibition structures achieve activity maintenance via positive feedback, which requires meticulous fine tuning of the network parameters strictly. Negative derivative feedback, according to recent research, might represent a novel mechanism for sustaining neural activity that is more resistant to multiple neural perturbations than positive feedback. Many classic models with only mutual inhibition structure are not capable of providing negative derivative feedback because double-inhibition acts as a positive feedback loop, and lack of negative feedback loop that is indispensable for negative derivative feedback. Here in the proposal, we aim to derive a new competition network with negative derivative feedback. The network is made up of two symmetric pairs of EI populations that the four population are completely connected. We conclude that the negative derivative occurs in two circumstances, in which one the activity of the two sides is synchronous but push-pull-like in the other, as well as the switch of two conditions in mathematical analysis and numerical simulation.

                Synaptic plasticity is required for learning and follows Hebb's Rule, the computational principle underpinning associative learning. In recent years, a complementary type of brain plasticity has been identified in myelinated axons, which make up the majority of brain's white matter. Like synaptic plasticity, myelin plasticity is required for learning, but it is unclear whether it is Hebbian or whether it follows different rules. Here, we provide evidence that white matter plasticity operates following Hebb's Rule in humans. Across two experiments, we find that co-stimulating cortical areas to induce Hebbian plasticity leads to relative increases in cortical excitability and associated increases in a myelin marker within the stimulated fiber bundle. We conclude that Hebbian plasticity extends beyond synaptic changes, and can be observed in human white matter fibers.

                FTY720 (fingolimod) is a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator and sphingosine analogue approved for multiple sclerosis (MS) therapy, which can functionally antagonize the S1P receptor, S1P1. Vitamin B12 (B12) deficiency produces neurological manifestations resembling MS. Here, we report a new mechanism where FTY720 suppresses neuroinflammation by regulating B12 metabolic pathways. Nuclear RNA-seq of c-Fos-activated astrocytes (called ieAstrocytes) from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) spinal cords identified up-regulation of CD320, a transcobalamin 2 (TCN2)-B12 receptor, by S1P1 inhibition. CD320 was reduced in MS plaques. Deficiency of CD320 or dietary B12 worsened EAE and eliminated FTY720 efficacy, while concomitantly down-regulating type I interferon signaling. TCN2 functioned as a chaperone for FTY720 and sphingosine, which induced astrocytic CD320 internalization. An accompanying paper identified a requirement for astrocyte sphingosine kinases in FTY720 efficacy and its altered expression in MS brains, molecularly linking MS and B12 deficiency that can be accessed by sphingolipid/fingolimod metabolic pathways.

                Efficient neurotransmission is essential for organism survival and is enhanced by myelination. However, the genes that regulate myelin and myelinating glial cell development have not been fully characterized. Data from our lab and others demonstrates that cd59, which encodes for a small GPI-anchored glycoprotein, is highly expressed in developing zebrafish, rodent, and human oligodendrocytes (OLs) and Schwann cells (SCs), and that patients with CD59 dysfunction develop neurological dysfunction during early childhood. Yet, the function of CD59 in the developing nervous system is currently undefined. In this study, we demonstrate that cd59 is expressed in a subset of developing SCs. Using cd59 mutant zebrafish, we show that developing SCs proliferate excessively, which leads to reduced myelin volume, altered myelin ultrastructure, and perturbed node of Ranvier assembly. Finally, we demonstrate that complement activity is elevated in cd59 mutants and that inhibiting inflammation restores SC proliferation, myelin volume, and nodes of Ranvier to wildtype levels. Together, this work identifies Cd59 and developmental inflammation as key players in myelinating glial cell development, highlighting the collaboration between glia and the innate immune system to ensure normal neural development.

                Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is observed in many neurological pathologies, e.g. hydrocephalus and stroke. This condition is routinely relieved with neurosurgical approaches, since effective and targeted pharmacological tools are still lacking. The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide (AZE), may be employed to treat elevated ICP. However, its effectiveness is questioned, its location of action unresolved, and its tolerability low. Here, we employed in vivo and ex vivo approaches to reveal the efficacy and mode of action of AZE in the rat brain. The drug effectively reduced the ICP, irrespective of the mode of drug administration and level of anaesthesia. The effect occurred via a direct action on the choroid plexus and an associated decrease in cerebrospinal fluid secretion, and not indirectly via the systemic action of AZE on renal and vascular processes. Upon a single administration, the reduced ICP endured for approximately 10 h post-AZE delivery with no long-term changes of brain water content or choroidal transporter expression. However, a persistent reduction of ICP was secured with repeated AZE administrations throughout the day. Future specific targeting of choroidal carbonic anhydrases may limit the systemic side effects, and therefore enhance the treatment tolerability and effectiveness in select patient groups experiencing elevated ICP.

                Background: While reactive aggression (in response to a perceived threat or provocation) is part of humans' adaptive behavioral repertoire, it can violate social and legal norms. Understanding brain function in individuals with high levels of reactive aggression as they process anger- and aggression-eliciting stimuli is critical for refining interventions. Three neurobiological models of reactive aggression - the limbic hyperactivity, prefrontal hypoactivity, and dysregulated limbic-prefrontal connectivity models - have been proposed. However, these models are based on neuroimaging studies involving mainly healthy individuals, leaving it unclear which model best describes brain function in aggression-prone individuals. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search (PubMed and Psycinfo) and Multilevel Kernel Density meta-analysis (MKDA) of nine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of brain responses to tasks putatively eliciting anger and aggression in aggression-prone individuals alone, and relative to healthy controls. Results: Aggression-prone individuals exhibited greater activity during reactive aggression relative to baseline in the superior temporal gyrus and in regions comprising the cognitive control and default mode networks (right posterior cingulate cortex, precentral gyrus, precuneus, right inferior frontal gyrus). Compared to healthy controls, aggression-prone individuals exhibited increased activity in limbic regions (left hippocampus, left amygdala, left parahippocampal gyrus) and temporal regions (superior, middle, inferior temporal gyrus), and reduced activity in occipital regions (left occipital cortex, left calcarine cortex). Conclusions: These findings lend support to the limbic hyperactivity model and further indicate altered temporal and occipital activity in anger- and aggression-eliciting situations that involve face and speech processing.

                Visual systems have adapted to the structure of natural stimuli. In the retina, center-surround receptive fields (RFs) of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) appear to efficiently encode natural sensory signals. Conventionally, it has been assumed that natural scenes are isotropic and homogeneous; thus, the RF properties are expected to be uniform across the visual field. However, natural scene statistics such as luminance and contrast are not uniform and vary significantly across elevation. Here, by combining theory and novel experimental approaches, we demonstrate that this inhomogeneity is exploited by RGC RFs across the entire retina to increase the coding efficiency. We formulated three predictions derived from the efficient coding theory: (i) optimal RFs should strengthen their surround from the dimmer ground to the brighter sky, (ii) RFs should simultaneously decrease their center size and (iii) RFs centered at the horizon should have a marked surround asymmetry due to a stark contrast drop-off. To test these predictions, we developed a new method to image high-resolution RFs of thousands of RGCs in individual retinas. We found that the RF properties match theoretical predictions, and consistently change their shape from dorsal to the ventral retina, with a distinct shift in the RF surround at the horizon. These effects are observed across RGC subtypes, which were thought to represent visual space homogeneously, indicating that functional retinal streams share common adaptations to visual scenes. Our work shows that RFs of mouse RGCs exploit the non-uniform, panoramic structure of natural scenes at a previously unappreciated scale, to increase coding efficiency.

We present NNeurite, a set of mathematical and computational techniques specialized for the analysis of time-lapse microscopy images of neurite activity in small behaving animals. Starting from noisy and unstable microscopy images containing an unknown number of small neurites, NNeurite simultaneously aligns images, denoises signals and extracts the location and the temporal activity of the sources of Ca2+ transients. At the core of NNeurite is a novel artificial neuronal network(NN) which we have specifically designed to solve the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)problem modeling source separation in fluorescence microscopy images. For the first time, we have embedded non-rigid image alignment in the NMF optimization procedure, hence allowing to stabilize images based on the transient and weak neurite signals. NNeurite processing is free of any human intervention as NN training is unsupervised and the unknown number of Ca2+ sources is automatically obtained by the NN-based computation of a low-dimensional representation of time-lapse images. Importantly, the spatial shapes of the sources of Ca2+ fluorescence are not constrained in NNeurite, which allowed to automatically extract the micrometer-scale details of dendritic and axonal branches, such dendritic spines and synaptic boutons, in the cortex of behaving mice. We provide NNeurite as a free and open-source library to support the efforts of the community in advancing in vivo microscopy of neurite activity.

                Copy number variations (CNV) are associated with psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), and most, including the recurrent 15q13.3 microdeletion disorder, have unknown disease mechanisms. We used a heterozygous 15q13.3 microdeletion mouse model and patient iPSC-derived neurons to reveal developmental defects in neuronal maturation and network activity. To identify the underlying molecular dysfunction, we developed a neuron-specific proximity-labeling proteomics (BioID2) pipeline, combined with patient mutations, to target the 15q13.3 CNV genetic driver OTUD7A. OTUD7A is an emerging independent NDD risk gene with no known function in the brain, but has putative deubiquitinase (DUB) function. The OTUD7A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network revealed interactions with synaptic, axonal, and cytoskeletal proteins and was enriched for known ASD and epilepsy risk genes. The interactions between OTUD7A and the NDD risk genes Ankyrin-G (Ank3) and Ankyrin-B (Ank2) were disrupted by an epilepsy-associated OTUD7A L233F variant. Further investigation of Ankyrin-G in mouse and human 15q13.3 microdeletion and OTUD7AL233F/L233F models revealed protein instability, increased polyubiquitination, and decreased levels in the axon initial segment (AIS), while structured illumination microscopy identified reduced Ankyrin-G nanodomains in dendritic spines. Functional analysis of human 15q13.3 microdeletion and OTUD7AL233F/L233F models revealed shared and distinct impairments to axonal growth and intrinsic excitability. Importantly, restoring OTUD7A or Ankyrin-G expression in 15q13.3 microdeletion neurons led to a reversal of abnormalities. These data reveal a critical OTUD7A-Ankyrin pathway in neuronal development, which is impaired in the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome, leading to neuronal dysfunction. Further, our study highlights the utility of targeting CNV genes using cell-type specific proteomics to identify shared and unexplored disease mechanisms across NDDs.

                Despite the fovea's singular importance for active human vision, the impact of large eye movements on foveal processing remains elusive. Building on findings from passive fixation tasks, we hypothesized that during the preparation of rapid eye movements (saccades), foveal processing anticipates soon-to-be fixated visual features. Using a dynamic large-field noise paradigm, we indeed demonstrate that sensitivity for defining features of a saccade target is enhanced in the pre-saccadic center of gaze. Enhancement manifested in higher Hit Rates for foveal probes with target-congruent orientation, and a sensitization to incidental, target-like orientation information in foveally presented noise. Enhancement was spatially confined to the center of gaze and its immediate vicinity. We suggest a crucial contribution of foveal processing to trans-saccadic visual continuity which has previously been overlooked: Foveal processing of saccade targets commences before the movement is executed and thereby enables a seamless transition once the center of gaze reaches the target.

                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease that alters central nervous system (CNS) functions. Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form, which can transform into secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) that is associated with progressive neurodegeneration. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of MS lesions identified disease-related transcriptomic alterations; however, their relationship to non-lesioned MS brain regions has not been reported and which could identify prodromal or other disease susceptibility signatures. Here, snRNA-seq was used to generate high-quality RRMS vs. SPMS datasets of 33,197 nuclei from 8 normal-appearing MS brains, which revealed divergent cell type-specific changes. Notably, SPMS brains downregulated astrocytic sphingosine kinases (SPHK1/2), the enzymes required to phosphorylate and activate the MS drug, fingolimod. This reduction was modeled with astrocyte-specific Sphk1/2 null mice in which fingolimod lost activity, supporting functionality of observed transcriptomic changes. These data provide an initial resource for studies of single cells from non-lesioned RRMS and SPMS brains.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The neurophysiological processes reflecting body illusions such as the rubber hand remain debated. Previous studies investigating the neural responses evoked by the illusion-inducing stimulation have provided diverging reports as to when these responses reflect the illusory state of the artificial limb becoming embodied. One reason for these diverging reports may be that different studies contrasted different experimental conditions to isolate potential correlates of the illusion, but individual contrasts may reflect multiple facets of the adopted experimental paradigm and not just the illusory state. To resolve these controversies, we recorded EEG responses in human participants and combined multivariate (cross-)classification with multiple Illusion and non-Illusion conditions. These conditions were designed to probe for markers of the illusory state that generalize across the spatial arrangements of limbs or the specific nature of the control object (a rubber hand or participant&rsquo;s real hand), hence which are independent of the precise experimental conditions used as contrast for the illusion. Our results reveal a parcellation of evoked responses into a temporal sequence of events. Around 125 and 275 ms following stimulus onset, the neurophysiological signals reliably differentiate the illusory state from non-Illusion epochs. These results consolidate previous work by demonstrating multiple neurophysiological correlates of the rubber hand illusion and illustrate how multivariate approaches can help pinpointing those that are independent of the precise experimental configuration used to induce the illusion.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We studied the expression of neurogranin in the brain and some sensory organs (barbel taste buds, olfactory organ and retina) of adult zebrafish. Database analysis shows zebrafish has two paralog neurogranin genes (<i>nrgna</i> and <i>nrgnb</i>) that translate into three peptides with a conserved IQ-domain, as in mammals. Western blots of zebrafish brain extracts using an anti-neurogranin antiserum revealed three separate bands, confirming the presence of three neurogranin peptides. Immunohistochemistry shows neurogranin-like expression in the brain and sensory organs (taste buds, neuromasts and olfactory epithelium), not being able to discern its three different peptides. In the retina, the most conspicuous positive cells were bipolar neurons. In the brain, immunopositive neurons were observed in all major regions (pallium, subpallium, preoptic area, hypothalamus, diencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon, including the cerebellum), a more extended distribution than in mammals. Interestingly, dendrites, cell bodies and axon terminals of some neurons were immunopositive, thus zebrafish neurogranins may play presynaptic and postsynaptic roles. Most positive neurons were found in primary sensory centers (viscerosensory column and medial octavolateral nucleus) and integrative centers (pallium, subpallium, optic tectum and cerebellum), which have complex synaptic circuitry. However, we also observed expression in areas not related to sensory or integrative functions, such as in CSF-contacting cells associated with the hypothalamic recesses, which exhibited high neurogranin-like immunoreactivity. Together, these results reveal important differences with the patterns reported in mammals, suggesting divergent evolution from the common ancestor.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Bacterial and fungal co-infections among ICU COVID-19 hospitalized patients in a Palestinian hospital: a retrospective cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Diagnosis of co-infections with multiple pathogens among hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients can be jointly challenging and essential for appropriate treatment, shortening hospital stays and preventing antimicrobial resistance. This study proposes to investigate the burden of bacterial and fungal co-infections outcomes on COVID-19 patients. It is a single center cross-sectional study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at Beit-Jala hospital in Palestine. Methods: The study included 321 hospitalized patients admitted to the ICU between June 2020 and March 2021 aged ≥20 years, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay conducted on a nasopharyngeal swab. The patient's information was gathered using graded data forms from electronic medical reports. Results: The diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infection was proved through the patient’s clinical presentation and positive blood or sputum culture results. All cases had received empirical antimicrobial therapy before the intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and different regimens during the ICU stay. The rate of bacterial co-infection was 51.1%, mainly from gram-negative isolates (Enterobacter species and K.pneumoniae). The rate of fungal co-infection caused by A.fumigatus was 48.9%, and the mortality rate was 8.1%. However, it is unclear if it had been attributed to SARS-CoV-2 or coincidental. Conclusions: Bacterial and fungal co-infection is common among COVID-19 patients at the ICU in Palestine, but it is not obvious if these cases are attributed to SARS-CoV-2 or coincidental, because little data is available to compare it with the rates of secondary infection in local ICU departments before the pandemic. Comprehensively, those conclusions present data supporting a conservative antibiotic administration for severely unwell COVID-19 infected patients. Our examination regarding the impacts of employing antifungals to manage COVID-19 patients can work as a successful reference for future COVID-19 therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pre-Clinical Study: Immunohistochemical evaluation of matrix metalloproteinase-13 on rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) socket healing after application of platelet-rich fibrin with and without hydroxyapatite [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Tissue engineering technology has been used globally and proven to accelerate wound healing. This study aimed to analyse the effect of adding hydroxyapatite (HA) as a scaffold to platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) as a growth factor in accelerating the wound healing process as seen from the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13). Methods: This research is an animal experiment conducted on 18 rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Rabbits were randomly divided into the following three groups of treatment: (G1) the application of PRF group, (G2) the application of PRF+HA group and (C) the control group without any application. Furthermore, each treatment group was split randomly into three groups of observation time. Periodontal tissue biopsy was performed to analyse the histopathological features that were examined on the basis of the level of MMP-13 immunoexpression. Results: MMP-13 immunoexpression in the PRF+HA group showed better histoscore results, indicating a substantial reduction in MMP-13 values compared with other groups. The healing process was shown to increase with increasing observation time (p<0.05), and the PRF+HA group outperformed the PRF and control groups. On day 3, MMP-13 exhibited a dark brown colour of Immunohistochemistry (IHC), which indicated an increase in the expression value of MMP-13 in the early stages of healing, namely, inflammation. On day 14, light brown IHC was seen, especially in group 2, as a reference that the remodeling process had begun. Conclusions: This study indicates that the application of HA can accelerate the socket healing process by decreasing the level of immunoexpression of MMP-13. HA is an alloplastic material that has inherent bioactive properties that support osteoconduction, which functions as a scaffold in the form of a fibrin matrix that can bind MMPs so that it can accelerate the wound healing process.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Foundation in Law students’ reading awareness of the case law genre [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A text of different genre might pose a different problem to students and different genre requires different approach in understanding and comprehending it. Developing the expertise in reading legal texts at an early stage of learning will be very beneficial to the students of law.  This study examines the level of pre-university/foundation in law students’ awareness for the case law genre, and the aim of this study is to investigate the extent of awareness of the case law genre among the foundation in law students.  Methods: Five students who were pursuing their study in the foundation/pre-university level were selected as the subjects in this study.  Qualitative data were obtained through the think-aloud procedure and questionnaire which was administered after the think-aloud procedure. The transcription of each student’s verbal reports was scrutinised for evidence of genre awareness while the answers given in the questionnaire were used to support the findings of the study.  Genre analysis of 4-Move structure was used to identify the students’ level of awareness. Results: The findings indicate that the students were aware of the case law genre. However, they displayed a mixed-level of awareness. Conclusion: It is hoped that this study can provide some insights into the reading behaviour of law students especially when reading case law. Knowing and understanding the case law structure is integral for law students, and analysing students understanding of reading case law can help both the students and English for Academic Purposes (EAP) educators.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Development of a computer-assisted instructional package for life skills to prevent risky sexual behaviors in early adolescents, Bangkok, Thailand [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of a newly developed computer-assisted instructional package for life skills (CAIFLS) specifically designed to raise awareness of risky sexual behaviors among Thai early adolescents in Bangkok. Methods:  The research process included two phases: (1) the development and (2) the use and evaluation of the newly developed CAIFLS package. First, 5 teachers and 5 Grade 7 students of a Bangkok school were interviewed to collect information needed for the development of CAIFLS. The second phase was to implement learning activities through CAIFLS with a total of 87 Bangkok school students, consisting of 44 students for the experimental group who received CAIFLS for 4 sessions, and 43 students for the control group who received routine class lecture. CAIFLS instructions, lesson plans and worksheets were designed as the experiment methods. Then questionnaires of life skills assessments and student satisfaction were used to investigate the effects and the student satisfaction of CAIFLS.  Results: The findings revealed that the efficiency values of the CAIFLS package were 80.2/82.5, higher than the set criteria of 80/80. Mean scores on life skills for the experimental group significant increased (p < .05), which was higher than the control group. The students also showed their satisfaction of CAIFLS at a high level (M = 4.20, S.D. = 0.29) Conclusions: CAIFLS can be used as an effective learning tool to enhance life skills to prevent risky sexual behaviors among Thai early adolescents.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Experimental-analytical approach to assessing mechanosensitive cartilage blood marker kinetics in healthy adults: dose-response relationship and interrelationship of nine candidate markers [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To determine the suitability of selected blood biomarkers of articular cartilage as mechanosensitive markers and to investigate the dose-response relationship between ambulatory load magnitude and marker kinetics in response to load.  Methods: Serum samples were collected from 24 healthy volunteers before and at three time points after a 30-minute walking stress test performed on three test days. In each experimental session, one of three ambulatory loads was applied: 100% body weight (BW); 80%BW; 120%BW. Serum concentrations of COMP, MMP-3, MMP-9, ADAMTS-4, PRG-4, CPII, C2C and IL-6 were assessed using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. A two-stage analytical approach was used to determine the suitability of a biomarker by testing the response to the stress test (criterion I) and the dose-response relationship between ambulatory load magnitude and biomarker kinetics (criterion II).  Results. COMP, MMP-3 and IL-6 at all three time points after, MMP-9 at 30 and 60 minutes after, and ADAMTS-4 and CPII at immediately after the stress test showed an average response to load or an inter-individual variation in response to load of up to 25% of pre-test levels. The relation to load magnitude on average or an inter-individual variation in this relationship was up to 8% from load level to load level. There was a positive correlation for the slopes of the change-load relationship between COMP and MMP-3, and a negative correlation for the slopes between COMP, MMP-3 and IL-6 with MMP-9, and COMP with IL6.  Conclusions: COMP, MMP-3, IL-6, MMP-9, and ADAMTS-4 warrant further investigation in the context of articular cartilage mechanosensitivity and its role in joint degeneration and OA. While COMP seems to be able to reflect a rapid response, MMP-3 seems to reflect a slightly longer lasting, but probably also more distinct response. MMP-3 showed also the strongest association with the magnitude of load.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The activity of human enhancers is modulated by the splicing of their associated lncRNAs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jennifer Yihong Tan, Ana Claudia Marques</p>

Pervasive enhancer transcription is at the origin of more than half of all long noncoding RNAs in humans. Transcription of enhancer-associated long noncoding RNAs (elncRNA) contribute to their cognate enhancer activity and gene expression regulation in <i>cis</i>. Recently, splicing of elncRNAs was shown to be associated with elevated enhancer activity. However, whether splicing of elncRNA transcripts is a mere consequence of accessibility at highly active enhancers or if elncRNA splicing directly impacts enhancer function, remains unanswered. We analysed genetically driven changes in elncRNA splicing, in humans, to address this outstanding question. We showed that splicing related motifs within multi-exonic elncRNAs evolved under selective constraints during human evolution, suggesting the processing of these transcripts is unlikely to have resulted from transcription across spurious splice sites. Using a genome-wide and unbiased approach, we used nucleotide variants as independent genetic factors to directly assess the causal relationship that underpin elncRNA splicing and their cognate enhancer activity. We found that the splicing of most elncRNAs is associated with changes in chromatin signatures at cognate enhancers and target mRNA expression. We provide evidence that efficient and conserved processing of enhancer-associated elncRNAs contributes to enhancer activity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An empirical examination of customer advocacy influenced by engagement behaviour and predispositions of FinTech customers in India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The extensive adoption and usage of emerging technologies furthered by the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has reduced direct face to face communications. New FinTech (financial technology) apps and technologies are flooding the Indian digital payments market and competitors are striving hard to attract and retain their customers. Especially when customer engagement behaviours (CEBs) are digital in nature, it is essential to gauge the intrinsically driven customer motivations which drive a positive CEB. The objective of this paper was to empirically test the influence of customer-based antecedents such as emotions, moral identity, self-concept, communal focus, perceived cost and perceived benefits on non-transactional experiential customer engagement behaviours (CEBs) and CEB’s effect on customer advocacy in the FinTech industry. Methods: Data from 380 financial app users in south India were gathered by administering a survey that captured customer predispositions, CEBs, and customer advocacy. Structural equation modelling (SEM) using smart PLS (partial least squares) 3.0 was applied to test the theoretical model. Results: Results indicate that CEB fully mediates the relationship between self-concept and customer advocacy. The positive CEBs get formed through customer predispositions leading to referral/advocacy behaviours. Conclusions: This paper provides directions for FinTech practitioners, marketers, technologists, and academicians to devise marketing strategies customized to customer needs and factors. This is one of the first research studies to demonstrate and empirically validate the CEB model for the FinTech industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mental illness due to homelessness: a qualitative case study in Melaka, Malaysia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Extreme poverty can result in people barely surviving with poor living standards to the extent of living on the streets, often in fear. With limited access to healthcare services and a clean environment, they are more vulnerable to life adversities. Highly stressful living conditions like these can cause mental illnesses such as depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, psychological distress, and others. Purpose: This research aimed to investigate factors that led to the development of mental illness among homeless people under extreme poverty. Design/methodology/approach: This was a qualitative case study that involved a face-to-face interview with a key informant at the Pertubuhan Kebajikan Villa Harapan Melaka (Villa Harapan). Villa Harapan is a licensed caretaker centre established by the Department of Welfare, Melaka that provides shelter to homeless people with mental illness. Findings: Homeless people suffered from mental disturbances due to loss of jobs, lack of income, broken families, separation from their children, and other vulnerabilities. They are not getting appropriate care and attention for their problem and sickness. Non-supportive family, extreme poverty, and chronic stress were the main factors that led to mental illness among Villa Harapan residents. Research limitations: The study focused on the mental illness of dispossessed people who were brought to Villa Harapan by the Welfare Department. Originality/value: This was an empirical case study on mental illness among homeless people at a care centre known as Villa Harapan.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dataset: Knowledge and attitude retention following an implicit bias classroom workshop [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Baylor College of Medicine provides a classroom-based implicit bias workshop to all third-year medical students to increase students’ awareness of their unconscious bias and develop strategies for reducing health care disparities. The workshop meets our immediate goals and objectives. However, we are unsure if the benefit would be long-term or diminish over time. Methods: To examine the concept retention from the implicit bias classroom workshop, we administered a self-developed seven-item seven-point Likert-scale survey to our medical students at pre-, post-, and one-year post-workshop attendance. Results: The data set was comprised of survey results from two cohorts of our third and fourth-year medical students from 2018 to 2020 and included 289 completed records at three measurement points. The data included: Student Identifiers, Sex, Race/Ethnicity, Student Enrollment Type, Cohort, and three repeated measures results for each of the seven items, which were documented in wide format. The data may be of interest to those who wish to examine how factors including elapsed time, race, and sex may associate with attitudes and understandings of implicit bias following related training, and those interested in analytical methods on longitudinal research in general.

                Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major public health crisis worldwide. In less than 12 months since the World Health Organization declared the outbreak, several different COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and deployed mostly in developed countries since January 2021. However, hesitancy to accept the newly developed vaccines is a well-known public health challenge that needs to be addressed. The aim of this study was to measure willingness and hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines among health care practitioners' (HCPs) in Saudi Arabia.   Methods: A cross-sectional study using an online self-reported survey was conducted among HCPs in Saudi Arabia between April 4th to April 25th 2021 using snowball sampling. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify the possible factors affecting HCPs’ willingness and hesitancy to receive COVID-19 vaccines.   Results: Out of 776 participants who started the survey, 505 (65%) completed it and were included in the results. Among all HCPs, 47 (9.3%) either said “no” to receive the vaccine [20 (4%)] or were hesitant to receive it [27 (5.3%)]. Of the total number of the HCPs, 376 (74.5%) already received the COVID-19 vaccine, and 48 (9.50%) were registered to receive it. The main reason of agreement to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was “wanting to protect self and others from getting the infection” (24%).   Conclusion: Our findings have shown that hesitancy toward receiving COVID-19 vaccines among HCPs in Saudi Arabia is limited and therefore may not be a serious issue. The outcomes of this study may help to understand factors that lead to vaccine hesitancy in Saudi Arabia and help public health authorities to design targeted health education interventions aiming to increase uptake of these vaccines.

                Introduction: Acne is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the pilosebaceous unit with differential pathogenesis. To elucidate the roles of hormones in acne pathogenesis, we conducted a study to evaluate the serum testosterone, estradiol, progesterone levels in women with acne vulgaris. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study, and 175 women with acne vulgaris were examined; their serum estradiol, progesterone, testosterone were analyzed by chemiluminescence technique and compared with the healthy control group. Results: Increased serum hormone levels in women with acne vulgaris were accounted for 29.7%, and hyperandrogenism was accounted for 16.0% of cases. We found significant differences in testosterone levels (mean value, 55.67±25.56 versus 38.37±10.16 ng/dL, p<0.05) respectively in the acne group and the control group. However, the estradiol level of the acne group (323.15±93.31 pmol/L) was lower than the control group (370.94±58.88 pmol/L) with p<0.05). No statistically significant differences were found for progesterone (0.60±0.38 versus 0.50±0.15 ng/mL, p>0.05) levels. Moreover, we did not find the relationship between serum hormone levels and the severity of acne vulgaris. Conclusion: This study showed that the female acne vulgaris patients may have high serum testosterone levels and low serum estradiol levels compared with those of female controls. However, hormone alterations had no correlation with the acne grades.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing nogo receptor-interacting protein 1 (LINGO-1), a negative regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, is associated with cognitive function, and its expression is highly upregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Anti-LINGO-1 antibody treatment can effectively antagonize the negative regulatory effect of LINGO-1. In this study, we aim to assess the effect of anti-LINGO-1 antibody treatment on cognition and hippocampal oligodendrocytes in an AD transgenic animal model. First, 10-month-old male APP/PS1 mice were administered anti-LINGO-1 antibody for 8 weeks. Then, learning and memory abilities were assessed with the Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests, and amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition and hippocampal oligodendrocytes were investigated by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and stereology. We found that anti-LINGO-1 antibody alleviated the deficits in spatial learning and memory abilities and working and reference memory abilities, decreased the density of LINGO-1 positive cells, decreased Aβ deposition, significantly increased the number of mature oligodendrocytes and the density of myelin, reversed the abnormal increases in the number of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and the densities of oligodendrocytes precursor cells in APP/PS1 mice. Our results provide evidence that LINGO-1 might be involved in the process of oligodendrocyte dysmaturity in the hippocampus of AD mice and that antagonizing LINGO-1 can alleviate cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice and decrease Aβ deposition and promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation in the hippocampus of these mice. Our findings suggest that changes in LINGO-1 and oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD and that antagonizing LINGO-1 might be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of whitening toothpaste on surface roughness and microhardness of human teeth: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Whitening toothpastes exert a whitening effect on teeth through higher surface cleaning effectiveness resulting from the abrasive properties of the paste or specific chemical components. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conceptualized to examine the relationship between whitening toothpastes and surface roughness as well as microhardness of human teeth and to clarify the evidence base available around this relationship by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in this topic area, looking at in vitro randomized control trials. Methods: Criteria for including studies in the review were done based on population, intervention, comparison, outcomes and study and studies were identified from electronic databases. Covidence® was used for data screening and data extraction. The CONSORT tool was used for checking relevant content and methodology used in each of the papers reviewed. Systematic review was done followed by meta-analysis, using Review Manager. Results: A total of 125 articles were obtained on key word search. After duplicate removal and title screening, 17 articles were eligible for full text review. Finally, 7 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on 4 studies. The forest plot for surface roughness showed that that the meta-analytic effect was statistically significant with surface roughness value being higher in the intervention group. The forest plot for microhardness showed that the meta-analytic effect was statistically significant with the microhardness value being lesser in the intervention group. Conclusions: Although whitening toothpastes typically can lighten tooth color by about one or two shades, there is some evidence to show that these toothpastes also affect the mineral content of teeth by increasing surface roughness and reducing microhardness. More evidence and further research are needed to identify the type of whitening agent which will whiten the tooth effectively while maintaining the integrity of the tooth structure.

     alt="Pharmacological activation of the Sonic hedgehog pathway with a Smoothened small molecule agonist ameliorates the severity of alcohol-induced morphological and behavioral birth defects in a zebrafish model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder"/>
<p>Exposure of zebrafish embryos to acute ethanol during the late gastrulation phase (8–10 hpf) results in defects in brain development (midbrain–hindbrain boundary formation; microphthalmia) and long-lasting behavioral deficits (increase in risk taking behavior). The addition of a sonic hedgehog pathway agonist to the zebrafish embryos immediately after the ethanol exposure (10–12 hpf) rescues both the short-term morphological and long-term behavioral defects.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Ethanol exposure during the early stages of embryonic development can lead to a range of morphological and behavioral differences termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). In a zebrafish model, we have shown that acute ethanol exposure at 8–10 hr postfertilization (hpf), a critical time of development, produces birth defects similar to those clinically characterized in FASD. Dysregulation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway has been implicated as a molecular basis for many of the birth defects caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. We observed in zebrafish embryos that <i>shh</i> expression was significantly decreased by ethanol exposure at 8–10 hpf, while <i>smo</i> expression was much less affected. Treatment of zebrafish embryos with SAG or purmorphamine, small molecule Smoothened agonists that activate Shh signaling, ameliorated the severity of ethanol-induced developmental malformations including altered eye size and midline brain development. Furthermore, this rescue effect of Smo activation was dose dependent and occurred primarily when treatment was given after ethanol exposure. Markers of Shh signaling (<i>gli1/2</i>) and eye development (<i>pax6a</i>) were restored in embryos treated with SAG post-ethanol exposure. Since embryonic ethanol exposure has been shown to produce later-life neurobehavioral impairments, juvenile zebrafish were examined in the novel tank diving test. Our results further demonstrated that in zebrafish embryos exposed to ethanol, SAG treatment was able to mitigate long-term neurodevelopmental impairments related to anxiety and risk-taking behavior. Our results indicate that pharmacological activation of the Shh pathway at specific developmental timing markedly diminishes the severity of alcohol-induced birth defects.</p>

                McCubbrey et al. show that efferocytosis elicits accumulation of intracellular polyamines, spermidine and spermine, in engulfing macrophages. Efferocytosis does not increase polyamine synthesis but triggers endocytic import of polyamines. Blocking endocytic import prevents polyamine accumulation after efferocytosis and reduces the ability of efferocytosis to suppress IL-1β and IL-6.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">2-Hydroxyglutarate destabilizes chromatin regulatory landscape and lineage fidelity to promote cellular heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                Kusi et al. show that the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) initiates cell-level epigenome fluctuations in the chromatin regulatory landscape, accompanied by loss of lineage fidelity. Breast tumors with high 2HG accumulation exhibit enhanced cellular heterogeneity with undifferentiated stem-like epigenomic signatures. The findings suggest metabolic derangement as a molecular origin of breast cancer heterogeneity.

                Local translation regulates the subcellular proteome in neurons but has not been characterized in midbrain dopamine neurons, cells with large dendrites and axonal arborizations. Hobson et al. investigate messenger RNA localization and translation in midbrain dopamine neurons in the mouse brain, finding ribosomes and dopaminergic mRNAs in dendrites, but not axons.

                Through orthogonal phosphoproteomic, metabolomic, and chemical genomics approaches, Abt et al. reveal that in pancreas cancer cells, type I interferon shifts nucleotide metabolism toward catabolism and activates the replication stress response kinase ATR. In combination with interferon signaling, ATR inhibition induces lethal DNA damage and limits PDAC tumor growth.

                Scarpa et al. demonstrate that, despite what had been reported by Del Río-Martín et al. (2019), Pitxak mutant mice do indeed entrain behavior and metabolism to scheduled feeding. Key methodological differences between these studies are discussed, and long-term, calorie-restricted feeding conditions are essential for proper visualization of behavioral entrainment to scheduled feeding. It is remarkable that, despite having so few dopamine neurons in their substantia nigra and almost completely lacking lenses and retinal function, the Pitx3ak mutants can maintain circadian rhythms and entrain to feeding.
