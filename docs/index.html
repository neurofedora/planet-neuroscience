Cerebellar granule cells are a popular target of neuroanatomical hyperbole, being so small and so numerous. Early theorists proposed unique roles for this vast cell population, ideas that continue to be tested through contemporary approaches. In 2017, a cluster of empirical and theoretical papers offered a fresh and singular look into the functions of granule cells and the computational advantages of their idiosyncratic circuit organization.

Locomotion is generated by intrinsically oscillating circuits in the spinal cord that are modulated by information from the brain and periphery. In their seminal 1987 publication, Buchanan and Grillner provided for the first time evidence for excitatory spinal neurons receiving inputs from descending commands and sensory afferents, and synapsing onto motoneurons and commissural inhibitory interneurons. These critical findings established the circuit model for central pattern generators incorporating excitatory interneurons’ role in the rhythm-production mechanism.

The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is a highly conserved signaling system regulating a range of developmental processes. A 1997 paper by Goodrich and colleagues provided major contributions to understanding the Hh pathway by mutating the gene encoding the Hh receptor, Patched, and thereby developing a mouse model for a human cancer predisposition syndrome, known as Gorlin syndrome. These studies provided one of the first genetically engineered mouse models for brain tumors.

Across the animal kingdom, odors are known as potent stimuli that directly steer behavior. In 2007, Hitoshi Sakano and colleagues used the power of mouse genetics to manipulate the odor map in the olfactory bulb. Elegant behavioral, anatomical, and physiological analyses revealed an apparent dichotomy in how the brain interprets the odor map. Their work paved a way to think of behavioral contingencies as part of early olfactory processing, highlighting innate and learned pathways.

<p>by Joanne C. Van Slooten, Sara Jahfari, Tomas Knapen, Jan Theeuwes</p>

Cognition can reveal itself in the pupil, as latent cognitive processes map onto specific pupil responses. For instance, the pupil dilates when we make decisions and these pupil size fluctuations reflect decision-making computations during and after a choice. Surprisingly little is known, however, about how pupil responses relate to decisions driven by the learned value of stimuli. This understanding is important, as most real-life decisions are guided by the outcomes of earlier choices. The goal of this study was to investigate which cognitive processes the pupil reflects during value-based decision-making. We used a reinforcement learning task to study pupil responses during value-based decisions and subsequent decision evaluations, employing computational modeling to quantitatively describe the underlying cognitive processes. We found that the pupil closely tracks reinforcement learning processes independently across participants and across trials. Prior to choice, the pupil dilated as a function of trial-by-trial fluctuations in value beliefs about the to-be chosen option and predicted an individual’s tendency to exploit high value options. After feedback a biphasic pupil response was observed, the amplitude of which correlated with participants’ learning rates. Furthermore, across trials, early feedback-related dilation scaled with value uncertainty, whereas later constriction scaled with signed reward prediction errors. These findings show that pupil size fluctuations can provide detailed information about the computations underlying value-based decisions and the subsequent updating of value beliefs. As these processes are affected in a host of psychiatric disorders, our results indicate that pupillometry can be used as an accessible tool to non-invasively study the processes underlying ongoing reinforcement learning in the clinic.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5hv21urPU1s" width="1" />

<p>by Wei Wang, Shanzhuo Zhang, Haibo Ni, Clifford J. Garratt, Mark R. Boyett, Jules C. Hancox, Henggui Zhang</p>

Cardiac electrical alternans (CEA), manifested as T-wave alternans in ECG, is a clinical biomarker for predicting cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. However, the mechanism underlying the spontaneous transition from CEA to arrhythmias remains incompletely elucidated. In this study, multiscale rabbit ventricular models were used to study the transition and a potential role of <i>I</i><sub>Na</sub> in perpetuating such a transition. It was shown CEA evolved into either concordant or discordant action potential (AP) conduction alternans in a homogeneous one-dimensional tissue model, depending on tissue AP duration and conduction velocity (CV) restitution properties. Discordant alternans was able to cause conduction failure in the model, which was promoted by impaired sodium channel with either a reduced or increased channel current. In a two-dimensional homogeneous tissue model, a combined effect of rate- and curvature-dependent CV broke-up alternating wavefronts at localised points, facilitating a spontaneous transition from CEA to re-entry. Tissue inhomogeneity or anisotropy further promoted break-up of re-entry, leading to multiple wavelets. Similar observations have also been seen in human atrial cellular and tissue models. In conclusion, our results identify a mechanism by which CEA spontaneously evolves into re-entry without a requirement for premature ventricular complexes or pre-existing tissue heterogeneities, and demonstrated the important pro-arrhythmic role of impaired sodium channel activity. These findings are model-independent and have potential human relevance.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ulraRupDlYg" width="1" />

Toxicity is an important factor in failed drug development, and its efficient identification and prediction is a major challenge in drug discovery. We have explored the potential of microscopy images of fluorescently labeled nuclei for the prediction of toxicity based on nucleus pattern recognition. Deep learning algorithms obtain abstract representations of images through an automated process, allowing them to efficiently classify complex patterns, and have become the state-of-the art in machine learning for computer vision. Here, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) were trained to predict toxicity from images of DAPI-stained cells pre-treated with a set of drugs with differing toxicity mechanisms. Different cropping strategies were used for training CNN models, the nuclei-cropping-based Tox_CNN model outperformed other models classifying cells according to health status. Tox_CNN allowed automated extraction of feature maps that clustered compounds according to mechanism of action. Moreover, fully automated region-based CNNs (RCNN) were implemented to detect and classify nuclei, providing per-cell toxicity prediction from raw screening images. We validated both Tox_(R)CNN models for detection of pre-lethal toxicity from nuclei images, which proved to be more sensitive and have broader specificity than established toxicity readouts. These models predicted toxicity of drugs with mechanisms of action other than those they had been trained for and were successfully transferred to other cell assays. The Tox_(R)CNN models thus provide robust, sensitive, and cost-effective tools for <i>in vitro</i> screening of drug-induced toxicity. These models can be adopted for compound prioritization in drug screening campaigns, and could thereby increase the efficiency of drug discovery.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rKs-Qld8OJg" width="1" />

<p>We investigated the therapeutic potential of the interleukin‐6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab in 7 patients with new onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) who remained refractory to conventional immunotherapy with rituximab (n = 5) or without rituximab (n = 2). Status epilepticus (SE) was terminated after 1 or 2 doses of tocilizumab in 6 patients with a median interval of 3 days from the initiation. They had no recurrence of SE during the observation. However, 2 patients experienced severe adverse events related to infection during the tocilizumab therapy. Further prospective controlled studies are warranted to validate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with NORSE. Ann Neurol 2018</p>

<p>Levodopa‐induced dyskinesia is a common complication in Parkinson disease. Pathogenic mechanisms include phasic stimulation of dopamine receptors, nonphysiological levodopa‐to‐dopamine conversion in serotonergic neurons, hyperactivity of corticostriatal glutamatergic transmission, and overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dopamine‐releasing axons. Delay in initiating levodopa is no longer recommended, as dyskinesia development is a function of disease duration rather than cumulative levodopa exposure. We review current and in‐development treatments for peak‐dose dyskinesia but suggest that improvements in levodopa delivery alone may reduce its future prevalence. Ann Neurol 2018</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cortical gray matter (GM) pathology, involving demyelination and neurodegeneration, associated with meningeal inflammation, could be important in determining disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, we need to know more about how cortical demyelination, neurodegeneration, and meningeal inflammation contribute to pathology at early stages of MS to better predict long‐term outcome.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Tissue blocks from short disease duration MS (n = 12, median disease duration = 2 years), progressive MS (n = 21, disease duration = 25 years), non‐diseased controls (n = 11), and other neurological inflammatory disease controls (n = 6) were quantitatively analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and in situ hybridization.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cortical GM demyelination was extensive in some cases of acute MS (range = 1–48% of total cortical GM), and subpial lesions were the most common type (62%). The numbers of activated (CD68<sup>+</sup>) microglia/macrophages were increased in cases with subpial lesions, and the density of neurons was significantly reduced in acute MS normal appearing and lesion GM, compared to controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.005). Significant meningeal inflammation and lymphoid‐like structures were seen in 4 of 12 acute MS cases. The extent of meningeal inflammation correlated with microglial/macrophage activation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), but not the area of cortical demyelination, reflecting the finding that lymphoid‐like structures were seen adjacent to GM lesions as well as areas of partially demyelinated/remyelinated, cortical GM.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that cortical demyelination, neuronal loss, and meningeal inflammation are notable pathological hallmarks of acute MS and support the need to identify early biomarkers of this pathology to better predict outcome. Ann Neurol 2018</p>

<p>We conducted a European‐only and transancestral genome‐wide association meta‐analysis in 72,147 stroke patients and 823,869 controls using data from UK Biobank (UKB) and the MEGASTROKE consortium. We identified an exonic polymorphism in <i>NOS3</i> (rs1799983, p.Glu298Asp; <i>p</i> = 2.2E‐8, odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04–1.07) and variants in an intron of <i>COL4A1</i> (rs9521634; <i>p</i> = 3.8E‐8, OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03–1.06) and near <i>DYRK1A</i> (rs720470; <i>p</i> = 6.1E‐9, OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.03–1.07) at genome‐wide significance for stroke. Effect sizes of known stroke loci were highly correlated between UKB and MEGASTROKE. Using Mendelian randomization, we further show that genetic variation in the nitric oxide synthase–nitric oxide pathway in part affects stroke risk via variation in blood pressure.

<p>Patients with visual snow syndrome (VS) suffer from a debilitating continuous visual disturbance of unknown mechanism. The present study tested the hypothesis of dysfunctional visual processing using visual evoked potentials. Eighteen patients were compared to age‐matched migraineurs (M) and healthy controls (C) using 2‐way analysis of variance with group (VS, M, C) and gender as factors. Visual evoked potentials from patients with VS demonstrated increased N145 latency (in milliseconds, VS: 152.7 ± 7.9 vs M: 145.3 ± 9.8 vs C: 145.5 ± 9.4; <i>F</i> = 3.28; <i>p</i> = 0.046) and reduced N75–P100 amplitudes (in microvolts, VS: 7.4 ± 3.5 vs M: 12.5 ± 4.7 vs C: 10.8 ± 3.4; <i>F</i> = 3.16; <i>p</i> = 0.051). Dunnett post hoc analysis was significant for all comparisons between VS and controls. These findings are in agreement with the idea that the primary disturbance in VS is a dysfunction of the visual association cortex. Ann Neurol 2018</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 5% of cerebral small vessel diseases are hereditary, which include <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders. <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> encode type IV collagen α1/2 chains in the basement membranes of cerebral vessels. <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> mutations impair the secretion of collagen to the extracellular matrix, thereby resulting in vessel fragility. The diagnostic yield for <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> variants is around 20 to 30%, suggesting other mutated genes might be associated with this disease. This study aimed to identify novel genes that cause <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole exome sequencing was performed in 2 families with suspected <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders. We validated the role of <i>COLGALT1</i> variants by constructing a 3‐dimensional structural model, evaluating collagen β (1‐O) galactosyltransferase 1 (ColGalT1) protein expression and ColGalT activity by Western blotting and collagen galactosyltransferase assays, and performing in vitro RNA interference and rescue experiments.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Exome sequencing demonstrated biallelic variants in <i>COLGALT1</i> encoding ColGalT1, which was involved in the post‐translational modification of type IV collagen in 2 unrelated patients: c.452 T &gt; G (p.Leu151Arg) and c.1096delG (p.Glu366Argfs*15) in Patient 1, and c.460G &gt; C (p.Ala154Pro) and c.1129G &gt; C (p.Gly377Arg) in Patient 2. Three‐dimensional model analysis suggested that p.Leu151Arg and p.Ala154Pro destabilized protein folding, which impaired enzymatic activity. ColGalT1 protein expression and ColGalT activity in Patient 1 were undetectable. RNA interference studies demonstrated that reduced ColGalT1 altered COL4A1 secretion, and rescue experiments showed that mutant <i>COLGALT1</i> insufficiently restored COL4A1 production in cells compared with wild type.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Biallelic <i>COLGALT1</i> variants cause cerebral small vessel abnormalities through a common molecular pathogenesis with <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders. Ann Neurol 2018</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The trigeminal autonomic reflex plays an important role in primary headache syndromes. Noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) may be an effective modulator of this reflex.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Twenty‐two healthy volunteers underwent kinetic oscillation stimulation (KOS) of the left nostril as a reliable trigger of the trigeminal autonomic reflex. Previous to KOS, left cervical nVNS, sham simulation, or no stimulation was applied. Lacrimation was quantified using the standardized Schirmer ll test.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Treatment with cervical nVNS significantly reduced lacrimation between no stimulation and nVNS on the ipsilateral side (minute 5: <i>p</i> = 0.026, η<i>p</i>
   <sup>2</sup> = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39–18.04; no stimulation: minute 5, 14.4 ± 9.3 mm; nVNS: minute 5, 4.7 ± 8.6 mm, mean ± standard deviation) as well as between sham stimulation and nVNS (minute 5: <i>p</i> = 0.030, η<i>p</i>
   <sup>2</sup> = 0.85, 95% CI = 1.04–17.24; sham: minute 5, 13.9 ± 6.4 mm). On the contralateral side, no significant increase between baseline and KOS was observed for nVNS (minute 5: <i>p</i> = 0.614, <i>d</i> = 0.12, 95% CI = −7.09 to 4.31; minute 5, 1.4 ± 11.5 mm) compared to both sham stimulation (minute 5: <i>p</i> = 0.023, <i>d</i> = 0.57, 95% CI = −11.46 to −0.96; minute 5, 6.2 ± 10.9 mm) and no stimulation (minute 5: <i>p</i> &lt; 0.030, <i>d</i> = 0.62, 95% CI = −13.45 to −0.81; minute 5, 7.1 ± 11.4 mm).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cervical nVNS resulted in a robust bilateral reduction of provoked lacrimation. This effect could be mediated either by direct bilateral activation of structures such as the nucleus of the solitary tract or by a top‐down modulation via the hypothalamus. Ann Neurol 2018</p>

<p>To understand how neural networks process information, it is important to
investigate how neural network dynamics varies with respect to different
stimuli. One challenging task is to design efficient statistical approaches to
analyze multiple spike train data obtained from a short recording time. Based
on the development of high-dimensional statistical methods, it is able to deal
with data whose dimension is much larger than the sample size. However, these
methods often require statistically independent samples to start with, while
neural data are correlated over consecutive sampling time bins. We develop an
approach to pretreat neural data to become independent samples over time by
transferring the correlation of dynamics for each neuron in different sampling
time bins into the correlation of dynamics among different dimensions within
each sampling time bin. We verify the method using simulation data generated
from Integrate-and-fire neuron network models and a large-scale network model
of primary visual cortex within a short time, e.g., a few seconds. Our method
may offer experimenters to use the advantage of the development of statistical
methods to analyze high-dimensional neural data.

<p>The normative interplay between circadian and reward function is well
understood in animal models, and is of growing interest as an aetiological
explanation in psychopathologies. While circadian modulation of reward function
has been demonstrated in human behavioural data, a key gap is lack information
at the neural level. In 2017, we published results of a first step in
addressing this lacuna, demonstrating a diurnal rhythm in fMRI-measured reward
activation. In 2018, Steel et al wrote a constructive critique of our findings,
and the aim of this paper is to outline how future research could improve on
our first proof-of-concept study. Key challenges include addressing divergent
and convergent validity (by addressing non-reward neural variation, and testing
for absence of variation in threat-related pathways), preregistration and power
analysis to protect against false positives, wider range of fMRI methods (to
directly test our post-hoc hypothesis of some form of reward prediction error,
and multiple phases of reward), the parallel collection of behavioural data
(particularly self-reported positive affect, and actigraphically measured
activity) to illuminate the nature of the reward activation across the day, and
some attempt to parse out circadian versus homeostatic/masking influences on
any observed diurnal rhythm in neural reward activation.

<p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly thought to recognise
objects by learning increasingly complex representations of object shapes. Some
recent studies hint to a more important role of image textures. We here put
these conflicting hypotheses to a quantitative test by evaluating CNNs and
human observers on images with a texture-shape cue conflict. We show that
ImageNet-trained CNNs are strongly biased towards recognising textures rather
than shapes, which is in stark contrast to human behavioural evidence and
reveals fundamentally different classification strategies. We then demonstrate
that the same standard architecture (ResNet-50) that learns a texture-based
representation on ImageNet is able to learn a shape-based representation
instead when trained on "Stylized-ImageNet", a stylized version of ImageNet.
This provides a much better fit for human behavioural performance in our
well-controlled psychophysical lab setting (nine experiments totalling 48,560
psychophysical trials across 97 observers) and comes with a number of
unexpected emergent benefits such as improved object detection performance and
previously unseen robustness towards a wide range of image distortions,
highlighting advantages of a shape-based representation.

<p>We study the statistical properties of the stationary firing-rate states of a
neural network model with quenched disorder. The model has arbitrary size,
discrete-time evolution equations and binary firing rates, while the topology
and the strength of the synaptic connections are randomly generated from known,
generally arbitrary, probability distributions. We derived semi-analytical
expressions of the occurrence probability of the stationary states and the mean
multistability diagram of the model, in terms of the distribution of the
synaptic connections and of the external stimuli to the network. Our
calculations rely on the probability distribution of the bifurcation points of
the stationary states with respect to the external stimuli, which can be
calculated in terms of the permanent of special matrices, according to extreme
value theory. While our semi-analytical expressions are exact for any size of
the network and for any distribution of the synaptic connections, we also
specialized our calculations to the case of statistically-homogeneous
multi-population networks. In the specific case of this network topology, we
calculated analytically the permanent, obtaining a compact formula that
outperforms of several orders of magnitude the
Balasubramanian-Bax-Franklin-Glynn algorithm. To conclude, by applying the
Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem, we derived asymptotic expressions of the
stationary-state statistics of multi-population networks in the
large-network-size limit, in terms of the Gumbel (double exponential)
distribution. We also provide a Python implementation of our formulas and some
examples of the results generated by the code.

<p>Stochastic resonance is a non-linear phenomenon, in which the sensitivity of
signal detectors can be enhanced by adding random noise to the detector input.
Here, we demonstrate that noise can also improve the information flux in
recurrent neural networks. In particular, we show for the case of three-neuron
motifs that the mutual information between successive network states can be
maximized by adding a suitable amount of noise to the neuron inputs. This
striking result suggests that noise in the brain may not be a problem that
needs to be suppressed, but indeed a resource that is dynamically regulated in
order to optimize information processing.

<p>The field of brain-computer interfaces is poised to advance from the
traditional goal of controlling prosthetic devices using brain signals to
combining neural decoding and encoding within a single neuroprosthetic device.
Such a device acts as a "co-processor" for the brain, with applications ranging
from inducing Hebbian plasticity for rehabilitation after brain injury to
reanimating paralyzed limbs and enhancing memory. We review recent progress in
simultaneous decoding and encoding for closed-loop control and plasticity
induction. To address the challenge of multi-channel decoding and encoding, we
introduce a unifying framework for developing brain co-processors based on
artificial neural networks and deep learning. These "neural co-processors" can
be used to jointly optimize cost functions with the nervous system to achieve
desired behaviors ranging from targeted neuro-rehabilitation to augmentation of
brain function.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41301">The spatial separation of processing and transport functions to the interior and periphery of the Golgi stack</a></h4>

It is unclear how the two principal functions of the Golgi complex, processing and transport, are spatially organized. Studying such spatial organization by optical imaging is challenging, partially due to the dense packing of stochastically oriented Golgi stacks. Using super-resolution microscopy and markers such as Giantin, we developed a method to identify en face and side views of individual nocodazole-induced Golgi mini-stacks. Our imaging uncovered that Golgi enzymes preferentially localize to the cisternal interior, appearing as a central disk or inner-ring, whereas components of the trafficking machinery reside at the periphery of the stack, including the cisternal rim. Interestingly, conventional secretory cargos appeared at the cisternal interior during their intra-Golgi trafficking and transiently localized to the cisternal rim before exiting the Golgi. In contrast, bulky cargos were found only at the rim. Our study therefore directly demonstrates the spatial separation of processing and transport functions within the Golgi complex.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41090">Rejection of immunogenic tumor clones is limited by clonal fraction</a></h4>

Tumors often co-exist with T cells that recognize somatically mutated peptides presented by cancer cells on major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I). However, it is unknown why the immune system fails to eliminate immune-recognizable neoplasms before they manifest as frank disease. To understand the determinants of MHC-I peptide immunogenicity in nascent tumors, we tested the ability of thousands of MHC-I ligands to cause tumor subclone rejection in immunocompetent mice by use of a new ‘PresentER’ antigen presentation platform. Surprisingly, we show that immunogenic tumor antigens do not lead to immune-mediated cell rejection when the fraction of cells bearing each antigen (‘clonal fraction’) is low. Moreover, the clonal fraction necessary to lead to rejection of immunogenic tumor subclones depends on the antigen. These data indicate that tumor neoantigen heterogeneity has an underappreciated impact on immune elimination of cancer cells and has implications for the design of immunotherapeutics such as cancer vaccines.

Recurrent loss of pelvic appendages in sticklebacks has previously been linked to natural mutations in a pelvic enhancer that maps upstream of <i>Pitx1</i>. The sequence of this upstream <i>PelA</i> enhancer is not conserved to mammals, so we have surveyed a large region surrounding the mouse <i>Pitx1</i> gene for other possible hind limb control sequences. Here we identify a new pelvic enhancer, <i>PelB</i>, that maps downstream rather than upstream of <i>Pitx1. PelB</i> drives expression in the posterior portion of the developing hind limb, and deleting the sequence from mice alters the size of several hind limb structures. <i>PelB</i> sequences are broadly conserved from fish to mammals. A wild stickleback population lacking the pelvis has an insertion/deletion mutation that disrupts the structure and function of <i>PelB</i>, suggesting that changes in this ancient enhancer contribute to evolutionary modification of pelvic appendages in nature.

The discovery of genetic forms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) has highlighted the importance of the autophagy/lysosomal and mitochondrial/oxidative stress pathways in disease pathogenesis. However, recently identified PD-linked genes, including DNAJC6 (auxilin), SYNJ1 (synaptojanin 1), and the PD risk gene SH3GL2 (endophilin A1), have also highlighted disruptions in synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE) as a significant contributor to disease pathogenesis. Additionally, the roles of other PD genes such as LRRK2, PRKN, and VPS35 in the regulation of SVE are beginning to emerge.

During the exploration of novel environments, place fields are rapidly formed in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Place cell firing rate increases in early stages of exploration of novel environments but returns to baseline levels in familiar environments. However, although similar in amplitude and width, place fields in familiar environments are more stable than in novel environments. We propose a computational model of the hippocampal CA1 network, which describes the formation, the dynamics and the stabilization of place fields. We show that although somatic disinhibition is sufficient to form place cells, dendritic inhibition along with synaptic plasticity is necessary for stabilization. Our model suggests that place cell stability is due to large excitatory synaptic weights and large dendritic inhibition. We show that the interplay between somatic and dendritic inhibition balances the increased excitatory weights, so that place cells return to their baseline firing rate after exploration. Our model suggests that different types of interneurons are essential to unravel the mechanisms underlying place field plasticity. Finally, we predict that artificial induced dendritic events can shift place fields even after place field stabilization.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/483842v1?rss=1">Human online adaptation to changes in prior probability</a></h4>

Optimal sensory decision-making requires the combination of uncertain sensory signals with prior expectations. The effect of prior probability is often described as a shift in the decision criterion. Can observers track sudden changes in probability? To answer this question, we used a change-point detection paradigm that is frequently used to examine behavior in changing environments. In a pair of orientation-categorization tasks, we investigated the effects of changing probabilities on decision-making. In both tasks, category probability was updated using a sample-and-hold procedure. We developed an ideal Bayesian change-point detection model in which the observer marginalizes over both the current run length (i.e., time since last change) and the current category probability. We compared this model to various alternative models that correspond to different strategies -- from approximately Bayesian to simple heuristics -- that the observers may have adopted to update their beliefs about probabilities. We find that probability is estimated following an exponential averaging model with a bias towards equal priors, consistent with a conservative bias. The mechanism underlying change of decision criterion is a combination of on-line estimation of prior probability and a stable, long-term equal-probability prior, thus operating at two very different timescales.

Real-life decisions are often between options with multiple value-relevant attributes. Neuroeconomic models propose that the value associated with each attribute is integrated in a global value for each option. However, evidence from patients with ventromedial frontal (VMF) damage argues against a very general role for this region in value integration, suggesting instead that it contributes critically to specific value inference or comparison processes. Here, we tested value-based decision-making between artificial multi-attribute objects in 12 men and women with focal damage to VMF, compared to a healthy control group (N=24) and a control group with frontal lobe damage sparing VMF (N=12). In a configural condition, overall object value was predicted by the conjunction of two attributes, while in an elemental condition, object value could be assessed by combining the independent values of individual attributes. Patients with VMF damage were impaired in making choices when value was uniquely predicted by the configuration of attributes, but intact when choosing based on elemental attribute-values. This is evidence that VMF is critical for inferring the value of whole objects in multi-attribute choice. These findings have implications for models of value-based choice, and add to emerging views of how this region may interact with medial temporal lobe systems involved in configural object processing and relational memory.

This confirmatory study aimed to unravel the neural structural connectivity of Olfactory-Saccadic pathways extending between Piriform and Entorhinal Cortices to Frontal Eye Field (FEF), and to correlate its functional importance with possible clinical implications, using Diffusion Imaging fiber Tractography. The confirmatory observational analysis used thirty-two healthy adults, ultra-high b-value, diffusion imaging datasets from an Open access platform in Human Connectome Project (HCP). In all the datasets from both the sexes, fibers were traced and the neural structural connectivity was confirmed. The hemispheric differences between male and female subjects were analysed using independent sample t-test. Thus, the study confirmed the structural existences of Olfactory-saccadic pathways that may be involved in influencing the movements of the neck and eyeball gaze (saccadic eye movement), towards the spatial orientation of olfactory stimulus.

Generating recombinant monoclonal antibodies (R-mAbs) from mAb-producing hybridomas offers numerous advantages that increase the effectiveness, reproducibility, and transparent reporting of research. We report here the generation of a novel resource in the form of a library of recombinant R-mAbs validated for neuroscience research. We cloned immunoglobulin G (IgG) variable domains from cryopreserved hybridoma cells and input them into an integrated pipeline for expression and validation of functional R-mAbs. To improve efficiency over standard protocols, we eliminated aberrant Sp2/0-Ag14 hybridoma-derived variable light transcripts using restriction enzyme treatment. Further, we engineered a plasmid backbone that allows for switching of the IgG subclasses without altering target binding specificity to generate R-mAbs useful in simultaneous multiplex labeling experiments not previously possible. The method was also employed to rescue IgG variable sequences and generate functional R-mAbs from a non-viable cryopreserved hybridoma. All R-mAb sequences and plasmids will be archived and disseminated from open source suppliers.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/483453v1?rss=1">Low oxygen post conditioning improves stroke-induced cognitive impairment</a></h4>

Post-stroke cognitive impairment has proven to be notoriously difficult to treat. In the current study, we sought to both better understand cellular changes that underpin cognitive deficits and to consider the potential restorative benefits of low oxygen post conditioning (LOPC). We were motivated to use LOPC as an intervention as it is one of the few experimental interventions previously shown to improve cognitive function post-stroke. Experimental stroke was induced by photothrombotic occlusion in adult male C57BL/6 mice. Mice were randomly assigned to either a normal atmospheric air exposure or low oxygen (11% O2) exposure groups three days post-occlusion. On day 17 post-stroke, mice were euthanized for histology or biochemical analyses. Stroked mice exposed to LOPC was associated with marked reductions in amyloid-beta both in its absolute level and in the extent of its oligomerization. Exposure to LOPC post-stroke also improved cellular deficits induced by stroke including an increase in vessel density, a reduction in vascular leakage, and restoration of AQP4 polarisation. Critically, stroked mice exposed to LOPC exhibited robust improvements in cognitive function post-stroke, assessed using a touchscreen based paired-associate learning task. These findings provide compelling pre-clinical evidence of the potential clinical utility of LOPC for enhancing recovery post-stroke.

A sense of agency can be defined as a subjective experience that I am the one who is causing or generating an action. Several brain regions have been proposed as neural substrates of the subjective experience; however, how the information is processed and organized by each region to achieve the sense of agency still remains unclear. In this study, we have clarified the neural representations corresponding to three processes namely, sensorimotor error, feeling of agency, and judgment of agency. Specifically, we found that the widespread sensorimotor areas represent sensorimotor error information. The right inferior parietal lobe represents the information solely on self-/other-attribution even during movements, which corresponds to the feeling of agency. Finally, the right inferior frontal gyrus shows a distinct representation between self- and other-attribution immediately before reporting the judgment on the movement attribution. These results suggest that the brain builds a sense of agency by developing distinct types of information each corresponding to the three processes with the passage of time.

When an action is familiar, we are able to anticipate how it will change the state of the world. These expectations can result from retrieval of action-outcome associations in the hippocampus and the reinstatement of anticipated outcomes in visual cortex. How does this role for the hippocampus in action-based prediction change over time? We used high-resolution fMRI and a dual-training behavioral paradigm to examine how the hippocampus interacts with visual cortex during predictive and nonpredictive actions learned either three days earlier or immediately before the scan. Just-learned associations led to comparable background connectivity between the hippocampus and V1/V2, regardless of whether actions predicted outcomes. However, three-day-old associations led to stronger background connectivity and greater differentiation between neural patterns for predictive vs. nonpredictive actions. Hippocampal prediction may initially reflect indiscriminate binding of co-occurring of events, with action information pruning weaker associations and leading to more selective and accurate predictions over time.

Actual causes of Parkinson's disease (PD) are still unknown. In any case, a better comprehension of genetic and ecological influences to the PD and their interaction will assist physicians and patients to evaluate individual hazard for the PD, and definitely, there will be a possibility to find a way to reduce the progression of the PD. We introduced quantitative frameworks to reveal the complex relationship of various biasing genetic factors for the PD. In this study, we analyzed gene expression microarray data from the PD, ageing (AG), severe alcohol consumption (AC), type II diabetes (T2D), high body fat (HBF), hypercholesterolemia (HC), high dietary fat (HDF), red meat dietary (RMD), sedentary lifestyle (SL), smoking (SM), and control datasets. We have developed genetic associations of various factors with the PD based on the neighbourhood-based benchmarking and multilayer network topology. We identified 1343 significantly dysregulated genes in the PD patients compared to the healthy control, where we have 779 genes down-regulated and 544 genes up-regulated. 69 genes were highly expressed in both for the PD and alcohol consumption whereas the number of shared genes for the PD and the type II diabetes is 51. However, the PD shared 45, 43 and 42 significantly expressed genes with the ageing, high dietary fat and high body fat respectively. The PD shared less than 40 significant transcripts with other factors. Ontological and pathway analyses have identified significant gene ontology and molecular pathways that enhance our understanding of the fundamental molecular procedure of the PD progression. Therapeutic targets of the PD could be developed using these identified target genes, ontologies and pathways. Our formulated methodologies demonstrate a network-based approach to understand the disease mechanism and the causative reason of the PD, and the identification for therapeutic targets of the PD.

How the brain encodes the speech acoustic signal into phonological representations (distinctive features) is a fundamental question for the neurobiology of language. Whether this process is characterized by tonotopic maps in primary or secondary auditory areas, with bilateral or leftward activity, remains a long-standing challenge. Magnetoencephalographic and ECoG studies failed to show hierarchical and asymmetric hints for speech processing. We employed high-density electroencephalography to map the Salento Italian vowel system onto cortical sources using the N1 auditory evoked component. We found evidence that the N1 is characterized by hierarchical and asymmetric indexes structuring vowels representation. We identified them with two N1 subcomponents: the typical N1 (N1a) peaking at 125-135 ms and localized in the primary auditory cortex bilaterally with a tangential distribution and a late phase of the N1 (N1b) peaking at 145-155 ms and localized in the left superior temporal gyrus with a radial distribution. Notably, we showed that the processing of distinctive feature representations begins early in the primary auditory cortex and carries on in the superior temporal gyrus along lateral-medial, anterior-posterior and inferior-superior gradients. It is the dynamical interface of both auditory cortices and the interaction effects between different distinctive features that generate the categorical representations of vowels.

The hippocampus features structurally and functionally distinct anterior and posterior segments. Relatively few studies have examined how these change during aging or in response to pharmacological interventions. Alterations in hippocampal connectivity and changes in glucose regulation have each been associated with cognitive decline in aging. A distinct line of research suggests that administration of glucose can lead to a transient improvement in hippocampus-dependent memory. Here we probe age, glucose and human cognition with a special emphasis on resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the hippocampus along its longitudinal axis to the rest of the brain. Using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design thirty-two healthy adults (16 young and 16 older) ingested a drink containing 25g glucose or placebo across two counterbalanced sessions. They then underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive testing. There was a clear dissociation in the effects of glucose by age. In older participants rsFC between posterior hippocampus (pHPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) increased after glucose ingestion, whereas in younger participants connectivity decreased. Magnitude change in rsFC from pHPC to mPFC was correlated with individual glucose regulation and gains in performance on a spatial navigation task. Our results demonstrate that glucose administration can attenuate cognitive performance deficits in older adults with impaired glucose regulation and suggest that increases in pHPC-mPFC rsFC are beneficial for navigation task performance in older participants. This study is the first to demonstrate the selective modulation of pHPC connectivity in the acute setting.

Background and Purpose: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a heterogeneous condition associated with a wide range of brain imaging abnormalities. Early life stress (ELS) contributes to this heterogeneity, but we do not know how a history of ELS influences traditionally defined brain signatures of PTSD. Here we used a data-driven method to identify shared and unique neuroimaging markers of ELS and PTSD in 97 military veterans. We hypothesized that clustering standard regions of interest would improve classification accuracy of PTSD and ELS, relative to using individual atlas-defined brain regions, with moderate overlap in the patterns associated with each condition. Methods: We used a novel machine learning method - evolving partitions to improve classification (EPIC) - to determine how combinations of cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical brain volumes, could contribute to classification of veterans with PTSD (n=40) relative to trauma-exposed controls (n=57), and classification of ELS within the PTSD (ELS+ n=16; ELS- n=24) and control groups (ELS+ n=16; ELS- n=41). Additional inputs included intracranial volume, age, sex, and self-reported depression. Results: EPIC improved classification of PTSD, with 71% accuracy, on average. Within groups, EPIC classified ELS with 70% accuracy in controls on average, and 67% accuracy in PTSD; accuracy ranged from 75-84% for the best run of each analysis. For each binary analysis, EPIC identified unique predictors and combinations of neuroimaging variables that contributed to improve group classification from the classifier that modeled input features individually. Self-reported depression was a stronger predictor of PTSD and ELS than any combination of neuroimaging variables, along with adult trauma exposure in controls. Temporoparietal metrics were the strongest neuroimaging predictors of PTSD after depression, whereas regions of the cingulate cortex were strong markers of ELS in both subgroups. Conclusions: Combinatorial machine learning methods such as EPIC may boost power to delineate underlying structural signatures of stress-related neuropathology.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/481689v1?rss=1">The impact of ischemic stroke on connectivity gradients</a></h4>

Understanding the relationship between localized anatomical damage, reorganization, and functional deficits is a major challenge in stroke research. Previous work has shown that localized lesions cause widespread functional connectivity alterations in structurally intact areas, thereby affecting a whole network of interconnected regions. Recent advances suggest an alternative to discrete functional networks by describing a connectivity space based on a low-dimensional embedding of the full connectivity matrix. The dimensions of this space, described as connectivity gradients, capture the similarity of areas' connections along a continuous space. Here, we defined a three-dimensional connectivity space template based on functional connectivity data from healthy controls. By projecting lesion locations into this space, we demonstrate that ischemic strokes resulted in dimension-specific alterations in functional connectivity over the first week after symptoms onset. Specifically, changes in functional connectivity were captured along connectivity Gradients 1 and 3. The degree of change in functional connectivity was determined by the distance from the lesion along these connectivity gradients regardless of the anatomical distance from the lesion. Together, these results provide a novel framework to study reorganization after stroke and suggest that, rather than only impacting on anatomically proximate areas, the indirect effects of ischemic strokes spread along the brain relative to the space defined by its connectivity.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/481358v1?rss=1">Features of criticality are asymmetric in the zebrafish habenula</a></h4>

The habenula is an evolutionarily conserved structure of the vertebrate brain essential for behavioural flexibility and mood control. It is spontaneously active and is able to access diverse states upon exposure to stimulation. Information processing in the habenula can potentially be understood through criticality, which describes a system at the boundary between different dynamical states. Here we analyze two-photon calcium imaging time-series of a single plane of the dorsal habenula of larval zebrafish for statistical features of criticality, namely avalanche distributions and shape collapse. We find that the dorsal habenula, which has left-right asymmetry in connectivity and function, displays asymmetric features of criticality, with the left dorsal habenula being at or near a critical state, while the right side is not. Deviations from theoretical predictions were understood through a branching model to result from subsampling. These observations provide evidence that a sub-cortical region of the vertebrate brain operates at a critical state in the intact animal.

Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a state of unrelenting seizure activity. It is associated with a rapidly rising mortality rate, and thus constitutes a medical emergency. Benzodiazepines, which act as positive modulators of chloride (Cl-) permeable GABAA receptors, are indicated as the first line of treatment, but this is ineffective in many cases. We found that 48% of children presenting with SE were unresponsive to benzodiazepine treatment, and critically, that the duration of SE at the time of treatment is an important predictor of non-responsiveness. We therefore investigated the cellular mechanisms that underlie acquired benzodiazepine resistance, using rodent organotypic brain slices. Removing Mg2+ ions leads to an evolving pattern of epileptiform activity, and eventually to a persistent state of repetitive discharges that strongly resembles clinical EEG recordings of SE. We show that the persistent SE-like activity is associated with a reduction in GABAA receptor conductance and Cl- extrusion capability. We explored the effect on intraneuronal Cl- using both gramicidin, perforated-patch clamp recordings and Cl- imaging. This showed that during SE-like activity, reduced Cl- extrusion capacity was further exacerbated by activity-dependent Cl- loading, resulting in a persistently high intraneuronal Cl-. Consistent with these results, we found that optogenetic stimulation of GABAergic interneurons in the SE-like state, actually enhanced epileptiform activity in a GABAAR dependent manner. Together our findings describe a novel potential mechanism underlying benzodiazepine-resistant SE, with relevance to how this life-threatening condition should be managed in the clinic.

<p>by Brandon M. Butler, I. Can Kazan, Avishek Kumar, S. Banu Ozkan</p>

The conformational dynamics of proteins is rarely used in methodologies used to predict the impact of genetic mutations due to the paucity of three-dimensional protein structures as compared to the vast number of available sequences. Until now a three-dimensional (3D) structure has been required to predict the conformational dynamics of a protein. We introduce an approach that estimates the conformational dynamics of a protein, without relying on structural information. This <i>de novo</i> approach utilizes coevolving residues identified from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using Potts models. These coevolving residues are used as contacts in a Gaussian network model (GNM) to obtain protein dynamics. B-factors calculated using sequence-based GNM (Seq-GNM) are in agreement with crystallographic B-factors as well as theoretical B-factors from the original GNM that utilizes the 3D structure. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of the calculated B-factors from the Seq-GNM approach to discriminate genomic variants according to their phenotypes for a wide range of proteins. These results suggest that protein dynamics can be approximated based on sequence information alone, making it possible to assess the phenotypes of nSNVs in cases where a 3D structure is unknown. We hope this work will promote the use of dynamics information in genetic disease prediction at scale by circumventing the need for 3D structures.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wxCLJAXCQQo" width="1" />

<p>by Holger Mohr, Katharina Zwosta, Dimitrije Markovic, Sebastian Bitzer, Uta Wolfensteller, Hannes Ruge</p>

Trial-and-error learning is a universal strategy for establishing which actions are beneficial or harmful in new environments. However, learning stimulus-response associations solely via trial-and-error is often suboptimal, as in many settings dependencies among stimuli and responses can be exploited to increase learning efficiency. Previous studies have shown that in settings featuring such dependencies, humans typically engage high-level cognitive processes and employ advanced learning strategies to improve their learning efficiency. Here we analyze in detail the initial learning phase of a sample of human subjects (N = 85) performing a trial-and-error learning task with deterministic feedback and hidden stimulus-response dependencies. Using computational modeling, we find that the standard Q-learning model cannot sufficiently explain human learning strategies in this setting. Instead, newly introduced deterministic response models, which are theoretically optimal and transform stimulus sequences unambiguously into response sequences, provide the best explanation for 50.6% of the subjects. Most of the remaining subjects either show a tendency towards generic optimal learning (21.2%) or at least partially exploit stimulus-response dependencies (22.3%), while a few subjects (5.9%) show no clear preference for any of the employed models. After the initial learning phase, asymptotic learning performance during the subsequent practice phase is best explained by the standard Q-learning model. Our results show that human learning strategies in the presented trial-and-error learning task go beyond merely associating stimuli and responses via incremental reinforcement. Specifically during initial learning, high-level cognitive processes support sophisticated learning strategies that increase learning efficiency while keeping memory demands and computational efforts bounded. The good asymptotic fit of the Q-learning model indicates that these cognitive processes are successively replaced by the formation of stimulus-response associations over the course of learning.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PG_zAuAfJnk" width="1" />

To map the neural substrate of mental function, cognitive neuroimaging relies on controlled psychological manipulations that engage brain systems associated with specific cognitive processes. In order to build comprehensive atlases of cognitive function in the brain, it must assemble maps for many different cognitive processes, which often evoke overlapping patterns of activation. Such data aggregation faces contrasting goals: on the one hand finding correspondences across vastly different cognitive experiments, while on the other hand precisely describing the function of any given brain region. Here we introduce a new analysis framework that tackles these difficulties and thereby enables the generation of brain atlases for cognitive function. The approach leverages ontologies of cognitive concepts and multi-label brain decoding to map the neural substrate of these concepts. We demonstrate the approach by building an atlas of functional brain organization based on 30 diverse functional neuroimaging studies, totaling 196 different experimental conditions. Unlike conventional brain mapping, this functional atlas supports robust <i>reverse inference</i>: predicting the mental processes from brain activity in the regions delineated by the atlas. To establish that this reverse inference is indeed governed by the corresponding concepts, and not idiosyncrasies of experimental designs, we show that it can accurately decode the cognitive concepts recruited in new tasks. These results demonstrate that aggregating independent task-fMRI studies can provide a more precise global atlas of selective associations between brain and cognition.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5NpxV5X7aGY" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Traditionally, angiographic vasospasm (aVS) has been thought to cause delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). However, successful treatment of aVS alone does not result in improved neurological outcome. Therefore, there may be other potential causes of poor neurological outcome, including spreading depolarization (SD). A recent study showed beneficial effects of cilostazol on DCI and neurological outcome. The present prospective clinical trial and experimental study focused on effects of cilostazol on SDs.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fifty aSAH patients were treated with clip ligation and randomly assigned to a cilostazol (n = 23) or control group (n = 27). Effects of cilostazol on DCI, aVS, and SDs, measured with subdural electrodes, were examined. The effect of cilostazol on SD‐induced perfusion deficits (spreading ischemia) was assessed in an aSAH‐mimicking model.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There was a trend for less DCI in the cilostazol group, but it did not reach our threshold for statistical significance (13.0% vs 40.0%, odds ratio = 0.266, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.059–1.192, <i>p</i> = 0.084). However, the total SD‐induced depression duration per recording day (22.2 vs 30.2 minutes, β = −251.905, 95% CI = −488.458 to −15.356, <i>p</i> = 0.043) and the occurrence of isoelectric SDs (0 vs 4 patients, β = −0.916, 95% CI = −1.746 to −0.085, <i>p</i> = 0.037) were significantly lower in the cilostazol group. In rats, cilostazol significantly shortened SD‐induced spreading ischemia compared to vehicle (Student <i>t</i> test, difference = 30.2, 95% CI = 5.3–55.1, <i>p</i> = 0.020).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Repair of the neurovascular response to SDs by cilostazol, as demonstrated in the aSAH‐mimicking model, may be a promising therapy to control DCI. Ann Neurol 2018; 1–13</p>

Abstract<p>Abnormal gamma band power across cortex and striatum is an important phenotype of Huntington's disease (HD) in both patients and animal models, but neither the origin nor the functional relevance of this phenotype is well understood. Here, we analyzed local field potential (LFP) activity in freely behaving, symptomatic R6/2 and Q175 mouse models and corresponding wild-type (WT) controls. We focused on periods of quiet rest, which show strong gamma activity in HD mice. Simultaneous recording from motor cortex and its target area in dorsal striatum in the R6/2 model revealed exaggerated functional coupling over that observed in WT between the phase of delta frequencies (1-4 Hz) in cortex and striatum and striatal amplitude modulation of low gamma frequencies (25-55 Hz) (i.e. "phase amplitude coupling"), but no evidence that abnormal cortical activity alone can account for the increase in striatal gamma power. Both HD mouse models had stronger coupling of gamma amplitude to delta phase and more uni-modal phase distributions than their WT counterparts. To assess the possible role of striatal fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in these phenomena, we developed a computational model based on additional striatal recordings from Q175 mice. Changes in peak gamma frequency and power ratio were readily reproduced by our computational model, accounting for several experimental findings reported in the literature. Our results suggest that HD is characterized by both a reorganization of cortico-striatal drive and specific population changes related to intra-striatal synaptic coupling.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> In HD, functional impairments first impact movement (chorea, dyskinesia) and cognition (executive functions, abstract thinking). Neuronal dysfunction associated with deficits appear first in cerebral cortex and striatum, which displays abnormally strong power in the low gamma band (25-55 Hz). Fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) are a neuronal subtype putatively capable of forming networks that resonate at the gamma frequency. Here we show that FSI networks can implement an early routing bias for more abundant neuronal subtypes in striatum. Specifically, by analyzing <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiological recordings from HD mice at rest when gamma is strong and using computational modeling, we identify coupling changes between cortex and striatum sufficient to generate periods of abnormal FSI network gamma in response to slow wave cortical inputs.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) is a clinically approved thiol‐containing redox modulatory compound currently in trials for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although generically labeled as an “antioxidant,” poor understanding of its site(s) of action is a barrier to its use in neurological practice. Here, we examined the efficacy and mechanism of action of NAC in rodent models of hemorrhagic stroke.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Hemin was used to model ferroptosis and hemorrhagic stroke in cultured neurons. Striatal infusion of collagenase was used to model intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in mice and rats. Chemical biology, targeted lipidomics, arachidonate 5‐lipoxygenase (ALOX5) knockout mice, and viral‐gene transfer were used to gain insight into the pharmacological targets and mechanism of action of NAC.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>NAC prevented hemin‐induced ferroptosis by neutralizing toxic lipids generated by arachidonate‐dependent ALOX5 activity. NAC efficacy required increases in glutathione and is correlated with suppression of reactive lipids by glutathione‐dependent enzymes such as glutathione <i>S</i>‐transferase. Accordingly, its protective effects were mimicked by chemical or molecular lipid peroxidation inhibitors. NAC delivered postinjury reduced neuronal death and improved functional recovery at least 7 days following ICH in mice and can synergize with clinically approved prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>NAC is a promising, protective therapy for ICH, which acted to inhibit toxic arachidonic acid products of nuclear ALOX5 that synergized with exogenously delivered protective PGE<sub>2</sub> in vitro and in vivo. The findings provide novel insight into a target for NAC, beyond the generic characterization as an antioxidant, resulting in neuroprotection and offer a feasible combinatorial strategy to optimize efficacy and safety in dosing of NAC for treatment of neurological disorders involving ferroptosis such as ICH.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The spectrum of clinical symptom changes during the course of Parkinson disease (PD). Levodopa therapy, while offering remarkable control of classical motor symptoms, causes abnormal involuntary movements as the disease progresses. This levodopa‐induced dyskinesia (LID) has been associated with abnormal cortical plasticity. Because slow wave activity (SWA) of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep underlies adjustment of cortical excitability, we sought to elucidate the relationship between this physiological process and LID.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thirty‐six patients at different stages of PD underwent whole‐night video polysomnography–high‐density electroencephalography (vPSG‐hdEEG), preceded by 1 week of actigraphy. To represent the broad spectrum of the disease, patients were divided into 3 groups by disease stage—(1) de novo (n = 9), (2) advanced (n = 13), and (3) dyskinetic (DYS; n = 14)—were compared to an age‐matched control group (n = 12). The SWA‐NREM content of the vPSG‐hdEEG was then temporally divided into 10 equal parts, from T1 to T10, and power and source analyses were performed. T2‐T3‐T4 were considered early sleep and were compared to T7‐T8‐T9, representing late sleep.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that all groups, except the DYS group, manifested a clear‐cut SWA decrease between early and late sleep.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data demonstrate a strong pathophysiological association between sleep and PD. Given that SWA may be a surrogate for synaptic strength, our data suggest that DYS patients do not have adequate synaptic downscaling. Further analysis is needed to determine the effect of drugs that can enhance cortical SWA in LID. Ann Neurol 2018; 1–13</p>

<p>Many neurodegenerative diseases are recognized to include a disconnection
syndrome initiated by the neuronal atrophy process. In Alzheimer's disease
(AD), the progressive destruction of axonal pathways leads to aberrant network
reconfigurations both at the structural and functional level. In such network
reorganization, the core and peripheral nodes appear to be crucial for the
prediction of clinical outcome due to their ability to influence large-scale
functional integration. However, the role of the different types of brain
connectivity in such prediction still remains unclear. Using a multiplex
network approach we integrated information from DWI, fMRI and MEG brain
connectivity to extract an enriched description of the core-periphery structure
in a group of AD patients and age-matched controls. Results showed that the
regional coreness - i.e., the probability of a region to be in the multiplex
core - was mainly driven by DWI structural connectivity with significant
contributions of fMRI and MEG functional connectivity, respectively at 0.1-0.3
Hz and 8-10 Hz. At the global scale, we showed that the coreness significantly
decreased in AD patients as a result of the randomization process initiated by
the neurodegeneration. At the local scale, the most impacted areas were in the
core of the network - including temporal, parietal and occipital areas - while
we reported compensatory increments for the peripheral regions in the
sensorimotor system. Finally, these multiplex network changes significantly
predicted the cognitive and memory impairment of patients as measured
respectively by the MMSE and FCSRT clinical scores. Taken together these
results indicate that a more accurate description of neurodegenerative diseases
can be obtained from the multimodal integration of neuroimaging-derived network
data.

<p>Slow waves (SWs) occur both during natural sleep and anesthesia and are
universal across species. Even though electrophysiological recordings have been
largely used to characterize brain states, they are limited in the spatial
resolution and cannot target specific neuronal population. Recently,
large-scale optical imaging techniques coupled with functional indicators
overcame these restrictions. Here we combined wide-field fluorescence
microscopy and a transgenic mouse model expressing a calcium indicator
(GCaMP6f) in excitatory neurons to study SW propagation over the meso-scale
under ketamine anesthesia. We developed "de novo" a versatile analysis pipeline
to quantify the spatio-temporal propagation of the SWs in the frequency band
[0.5, 4] Hz. Moreover, we designed a computational simulator based on a simple

<p>Developmental dyslexia is characterized by the inability to acquire typical
reading and writing skills. Dyslexia has been frequently linked to cerebral
cortex alterations; however recent evidence also points towards sensory
thalamus dysfunctions: dyslexics showed reduced responses in the left auditory
thalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB) during speech processing in contrast to
neurotypical readers. In addition, in the visual modality, dyslexics have
reduced structural connectivity between the left visual thalamus (lateral
geniculate nucleus, LGN) and V5/MT, a cerebral cortex region involved in visual
movement processing. Higher LGN-V5/MT connectivity in dyslexics was associated
with the faster rapid naming of letters and numbers (RANln), a measure that is
highly correlated with reading proficiency. We here tested two hypotheses that
were directly derived from these previous findings. First, we tested the
hypothesis that dyslexics have reduced structural connectivity between the left
MGB and the auditory motion-sensitive part of the left planum temporale (mPT).
Second, we hypothesized that the amount of left mPT-MGB connectivity correlates
with dyslexics RANln scores. Using diffusion tensor imaging based probabilistic
tracking we show that male adults with developmental dyslexia have reduced
structural connectivity between the left MGB and the left mPT, confirming the
first hypothesis. Stronger left mPT-MGB connectivity was not associated with
faster RANnl scores in dyslexics, but in neurotypical readers. Our findings
provide first evidence that reduced cortico-thalamic connectivity in the
auditory modality is a feature of developmental dyslexia, and that it may also
impact on reading related cognitive abilities in neurotypical readers.

<p>Resting-state functional Arterial Spin Labeling (rs-fASL) in clinical daily
practice and academic research stay discreet compared to resting-state BOLD.
However, by giving direct access to cerebral blood flow maps, rs-fASL leads to
significant clinical subject scaled application as CBF can be considered as a
biomarker in common neuropathology. Our work here focuses on the link between
overall quality of rs-fASL and duration of acquisition. To this end, we
consider subject self-Default Mode Network (DMN), and assess DMN quality
depletion compared to a gold standard DMN depending on the duration of
acquisition.

<p>Computational models of the respiratory central pattern generator (rCPG) are
usually based on biologically-plausible Hodgkin Huxley neuron models. Such
models require numerous parameters and thus are prone to overfitting. The HH
approach is motivated by the assumption that the biophysical properties of
neurons determine the network dynamics. Here, we implement the rCPG using
simpler Izhikevich resonate-and-fire neurons. Our rCPG model generates a
3-phase respiratory motor pattern based on established connectivities and can
reproduce previous experimental and theoretical observations. Further, we
demonstrate the flexibility of the model by testing whether intrinsic bursting
properties are necessary for rhythmogenesis. Our simulations demonstrate that
replacing predicted mandatory bursting properties of pre-inspiratory neurons
with spike adapting properties yields a model that generates comparable
respiratory activity patterns. The latter supports our view that the importance
of the exact modeling parameters of specific respiratory neurons is
overestimated.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40843">Neural activity related to volitional regulation of cortical excitability</a></h4>

To date there exists no reliable method to non-invasively upregulate or downregulate the state of the resting human motor system over a large dynamic range. Here we show that an operant conditioning paradigm which provides neurofeedback of the size of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), enables participants to self-modulate their own brain state. Following training, participants were able to robustly increase (by 83.8%) and decrease (by 30.6%) their MEP amplitudes. This volitional up-versus downegulation of corticomotor excitability caused an increase of late-cortical disinhibition (LCD), a TMS derived read-out of presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> disinhibition, which was accompanied by an increase of gamma and a decrease of alpha oscillations in the trained hemisphere. This approach paves the way for future investigations into how altered brain state influences motor neurophysiology and recovery of function in a neurorehabilitation context.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40308">Evolutionary pathways of repeat protein topology in bacterial outer membrane proteins</a></h4>

Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are the proteins in the surface of Gram-negative bacteria. These proteins have diverse functions but a single topology: the β-barrel. Sequence analysis has suggested that this common fold is a β-hairpin repeat protein, and that amplification of the β-hairpin has resulted in 8-26-stranded barrels. Using an integrated approach that combines sequence and structural analyses we find events in which non-amplification diversification also increases barrel strand number. Our network-based analysis reveals strand-number evolutionary pathways, including one that progresses from a primordial 8-stranded barrel to 16-strands and further, to 18-strands. Among these are mechanisms of strand number accretion without domain duplication, like a loop-to-hairpin transition. These mechanisms illustrate perpetuation of repeat protein topology without genetic duplication, likely induced by the hydrophobic membrane. Finally, we find that the evolutionary trace is particularly prominent in the C-terminal half of OMPs, implicating this region in the nucleation of OMP folding.

Acquired resistance to endocrine therapy remains a significant clinical burden for breast cancer patients. Somatic mutations in the <i>ESR1</i> (estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)) gene ligand-binding domain (LBD) represent a recognized mechanism of acquired resistance. Antiestrogens with improved efficacy versus tamoxifen might overcome the resistant phenotype in ER+ breast cancers. Bazedoxifene (BZA) is a potent antiestrogen that is clinically approved for use in hormone replacement therapies. We found that BZA possesses improved inhibitory potency against the Y537S and D538G ERα mutants compared to tamoxifen and has additional inhibitory activity in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib. In addition, comprehensive biophysical and structural biology studies show BZA's selective estrogen receptor degrading (SERD) properties that override the stabilizing effects of the Y537S and D538G ERα mutations.

Different aspects of spatial neglect, the disability to locate the position of the source of an external stimulus, has been studied frequently especially with regards to lack of response to visual stimuli. A modicum of papers fails to elaborate on that of the auditory field and even less conducted on the extraction of spatial information from olfactory stimuli. In this study we attempted to find a structural connection between the Olfactory Cortex (OC) and Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ), in order to suggest that processed olfactory information is carried from OC to TPJ, where the spatial information of the odor maybe acquired. Positive results were attained in all subjects with a lateralization observed in the right hemisphere.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/483396v1?rss=1">Oculomotor nerve requires an early interaction with muscle precursors for nerve guidance and branch patterning</a></h4>

Muscle function is dependent on innervation by the correct motor nerves. Motor nerves are composed of motor axons that extend through peripheral tissues as a compact bundle, but then diverge to create nerve branches to specific muscle targets. A transition point typically occurs as motor nerves grow near their targets, where the fasciculated nerve halts further growth, then later initiates branching to muscles. The motor nerve transition point is potentially an intermediate target acting as a guidepost to present specific cellular and molecular signals for navigation. Here we describe the navigation of the oculomotor nerve with respect to eye muscle precursor cells in mouse embryos. We found that the oculomotor nerve initially grew to the eye three days prior to the appearance of any eye muscles. The oculomotor axons spread to form a plexus within a mass of eye muscle precursors, then the nerve growth paused for more than two days. This plexus persisted during primary extraocular myogenesis, with a subsequent phase in which the nerve branched out to specific muscles. To test the functional significance of the nerve-precursor contact in the plexus, we genetically ablated muscle precursors early in nerve development, prior to nerve contact. Ablation of muscle precursors resulted in oculomotor nerve fibers failing to stop to form the plexus, but instead growing past the eye. In contrast, ablating the precursor pool at later stages, after the nerve has contacted the precursor cells, results in ectopic branching restricted near the eye. These results demonstrate that muscle precursors act as an intermediate target for nerve guidance, and are required for the oculomotor nerve to transition between nerve growth and distinct stages of terminal axon branching.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/483164v1?rss=1">Computational psychiatry 2.0 and implications for stress research</a></h4>

Stress-related disorders are highly prevalent in modern society and pose significant challenge to mental health. Being recently emerged branch of psychiatry computational psychiatry is geared toward mathematical modeling of psychiatric disorders. Harnessing power of computer sciences and statistics may bridge the complex nature of psychiatric illnesses with hidden brain computational mechanisms. Stress represents an adaptive response to environmental threats but, while getting chronic, it leads to progressive deflection from homeostasis or result in buildup of allostatic load, providing researches with unique opportunity to track patterns of deviations from adaptive responding toward full-blown disease development. Computational psychiatry toolkit enables us to quantitatively assess the extent of such deviations, to explicitly test competing hypotheses which compare the models with real data for goodness-of-fit and, finally, to tethering these computational operations to structural or functional brain alterations as may be revealed by non-invasive neuroimaging and stimulation techniques. It is worth noting that brain does not directly face environmental demands imposed on human or animal, but rather through detecting signals and acting out via bodily systems. Therefore, it is of critical importance to take homeostatic and allostatic mechanisms into account when considering sophisticated interactions between brain and body and how their partnership may result in establishment of stress-susceptible or resilient profiles. In this article, with a particulate focus on brain-gut interactions, we outline several possible directions to widen the scope of application of computational approach in mental health care field trying to integrate computational psychiatry, psychosomatics and nutritional medicine

The electrical connectivity in the inferior olive (IO) nucleus plays an important role in generating well-timed spiking activity. Here we combined electrophysiological and computational approaches to assess the functional organization of mice IO nucleus. Spontaneous fast and slow subthreshold events were commonly encountered during in vitro recordings. We show that the fast events represent a regenerative response in unique excitable spine-like structures in the axon hillock, whereas the slow events reflect the electrical connectivity between neurons ( spikelets). Recordings from cell pairs revealed the synchronized occurrence of distinct groups of spikelets; their rate and distribution enabled an accurate estimation of the number of connected cells and is suggestive of a clustered organization. This study thus provides a new perspective on the functional and structural organization of the olivary nucleus, insights into two different subthreshold non-synaptic events, and a novel experimental and theoretical approach to the study of electrically-coupled networks.

Background: The Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of elderly peoples characterized by dementia and the fatality is increased due to lack of early stage detection. The neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid based detection is limited with sensitivity and specificity and cost. Therefore, detecting AD from blood transcripts that mirror the expression of brain transcripts in the AD would be one way to improve the diagnosis and treatment of AD. The present study aimed to identify blood transcript that mirror the expression in brain of the AD. Materials and Methods: We used blood (GSE18309) and brain (GSE4757) based microarray gene expression datasets from NCBI-GEO. Result: We analyzed each datasets, and identified 9 common (CNBD1, SUCLG2-AS1, CCDC65, PDE4D, MTMR1, C3, SLC6A15, LINC01806, and FRG1JP) DEGs from blood and brain. Then we identified 18 significant genes (HSD17B1, GAS5, RPS5, VKORC1, GLE1, WDR1, RPL12, MORN1, RAD52, SDR39U1, NPHP4, MT1E, SORD, LINC00638, MCM3AP-AS1, GSDMD, RPS9, and GNL2) from eQTL data of blood and brain. The significant neurodegeneration associated molecular signaling pathways (Ribosome and complement pathways) were identified. We integrated the different omics data and revealed transcription factor (TFs) (SREBF2, NR1H2, NR1H3, PRDM1, XBP1), microRNAs (miRNAs) (miR-518e, miR-518a-3p, miR-518b, miR-518c, miR-518d-3p, miR-518f). Several histone modifications sites of the DEGs were identified. Conclusion: In sum, we identified new putative links between pathological processes in brain and blood cells. Thus, our formulated methodologies demonstrate the power of gene and gene expression analysis for brain-related pathologies transcriptomics, cis-eQTL, and epigentics data from brain and blood cells.

<p>by Hillary Koch, Dmytro Starenki, Sara J. Cooper, Richard M. Myers, Qunhua Li</p>

Sequencing of the T cell receptor repertoire is a powerful tool for deeper study of immune response, but the unique structure of this type of data makes its meaningful quantification challenging. We introduce a new method, the Gamma-GPD spliced threshold model, to address this difficulty. This biologically interpretable model captures the distribution of the TCR repertoire, demonstrates stability across varying sequencing depths, and permits comparative analysis across any number of sampled individuals. We apply our method to several datasets and obtain insights regarding the differentiating features in the T cell receptor repertoire among sampled individuals across conditions. We have implemented our method in the open-source R package powerTCR.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1HPkiYuzOtM" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the association between serum soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), a soluble type of an innate immune receptor expressed on the microglia, and the risk of dementia.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 1,349 Japanese community‐residents aged 60 and older without dementia were followed prospectively for 10 years (2002‐2012). Serum sTREM2 levels were quantified by using an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and divided into quartiles. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of serum sTREM2 levels on the risk of dementia.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>During the follow‐up, 300 subjects developed all‐cause dementia; 193 had Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 85 had vascular dementia (VaD). The age‐ and sex‐adjusted incidences of all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD elevated significantly with higher serum sTREM2 levels (all P for trend &lt;0.012). These associations were not altered after adjustment for confounding factors, including high‐sensitive C‐reactive protein. Subjects with the highest quartile of serum sTREM2 levels had significantly higher multivariable‐adjusted risks of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD than those with the lowest quartile (HR=2.03, 95% CI=1.39‐2.97, P&lt;0.001 for all‐cause dementia; HR=1.62, 95% CI=1.02‐2.55, P=0.04 for AD; HR=2.85, 95% CI=1.35‐6.02, P=0.006 for VaD). No significant heterogeneity in the association of serum sTREM2 levels with the development of dementia was observed among the other risk‐factor subgroups (all P for heterogeneity &gt;0.11).</p>


<h2>Interpretations</h2>
<p>The present findings suggest a significant association between increased serum sTREM2 levels and the risk of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD in the general elderly Japanese population.</p>

<p>The koniocellular (K) layers of the primate dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus house a variety of visual receptive field types, not all of which have been fully characterized. Here we made single-cell recordings targeted to the K layers of diurnal New World monkeys (marmosets). A subset of recorded cells was excited by both increments and decrements of light intensity (on/off-cells). Histological reconstruction of the location of these cells confirmed that they are segregated to K layers; we therefore refer to these cells as K-on/off cells. The K-on/off cells show high contrast sensitivity, strong bandpass spatial frequency tuning, and their response magnitude is strongly reduced by stimuli larger than the excitatory receptive field (silent suppressive surrounds). Stationary counterphase gratings evoke unmodulated spike rate increases or frequency-doubled responses in K-on/off cells; such responses are largely independent of grating spatial phase. The K-on/off cells are not orientation or direction selective. Some (but not all) properties of K-on/off cells are consistent with those of local-edge-detector/impressed-by-contrast cells reported in studies of cat retina and geniculate, and broad-thorny ganglion cells recorded in macaque monkey retina. The receptive field properties of K-on/off cells and their preferential location in the ventral K layers (K1 and K2) make them good candidates for the direct projection from geniculate to extrastriate cortical area MT/V5. If so, they could contribute to visual information processing in the dorsal ("where" or "action") visual stream.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We characterize cells in an evolutionary ancient part of the visual pathway in primates. The cells are located in the lateral geniculate nucleus (the main visual afferent relay nucleus), in regions called koniocellular layers that are known to project to extrastriate visual areas as well as primary visual cortex. The cells show high contrast sensitivity and rapid, transient responses to light onset and offset. Their properties suggest they could contribute to visual processing in the dorsal ("where" or "action") visual stream.</p>

<p>Predictive motor control is essential to achieve rapid and precise motor action in all vertebrates. Visuomotor transformations have been a popular model system to study the underlying neural mechanisms, in particular, the role of the cerebellum in both predictive and gain adaptations. In all species, large-field visual motion produces an involuntary conjugate ocular movement facilitating gaze stabilization called the optokinetic response. Gain adaptation can be induced by prolonged optokinetic visual stimulation; and if the visual stimulation is temporally periodic, predictive behavior emerges. Two predictive timing components were identifiable in this behavior. The first was prediction of stimulus initiation (when to move) and the other was stimulus termination (when to stop). We designed visual training that allowed us to evaluate initiation and termination independently that included the recording of cerebellar activity followed by acute and chronic cerebellar removal in goldfish of both sexes. We found that initiation and termination predictions were present in the cerebellum and more robust than conflicting visual sensory signals. Each prediction could be acquired independently, and both the acquisition and maintenance of each component were cerebellar-dependent. Subsequent analysis of the neuronal connectivity strongly supports the hypothesis that the acquired eye velocity behaviors were dependent on feedforward velocity buildup signals from the brainstem, but the adaptive timing mechanism itself originates within the circuitry of the cerebellum.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Predictive and rapid motor control is essential in our daily life, such as in the playing of musical instruments or sports. The current work evaluates timing of a visuomotor behavior shown to be similar in humans as well as goldfish. Given the latter species' known brainstem cerebellar neuronal connectivity and experimental advantage, it was possible to demonstrate the cerebellum to be necessary for acquisition and maintenance of both the initiation and termination components of when to move and to stop. All evidence in this study points to the adaptive predictive control site to lie within the cerebellar circuitry.</p>

<p>Reward-related stimuli can potently influence behavior; for example, exposure to drug-paired cues can trigger drug use and relapse in people with addictions. Psychological mechanisms that generate such outcomes likely include cue-induced cravings and attentional biases. Recent animal data suggest another candidate mechanism: reward-paired cues can enhance risky decision making, yet whether this translates to humans is unknown. Here, we examined whether sensory reward-paired cues alter decision making under uncertainty and risk, as measured respectively by the Iowa Gambling Task and a two-choice lottery task. In the cued versions of both tasks, gain feedback was augmented with reward-concurrent audiovisual stimuli. Healthy human volunteers (53 males, 78 females) performed each task once, one with and the other without cues (cued Iowa Gambling Task/uncued Vancouver Gambling Task: <i>n</i> = 63; uncued Iowa Gambling Task/cued Vancouver Gambling Task: <i>n</i> = 68), with concurrent eye-tracking. Reward-paired cues did not affect choice on the Iowa Gambling Task. On the two-choice lottery task, the cued group displayed riskier choice and reduced sensitivity to probability information. The cued condition was associated with reduced eye fixations on probability information shown on the screen and greater pupil dilation related to decision and reward anticipation. This pupil effect was unrelated to the risk-promoting effects of cues: the degree of pupil dilation for risky versus risk-averse choices did not differ as a function of cues. Together, our data show that sensory reward cues can promote riskier decisions and have additional and distinct effects on arousal.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Animal data suggest that reward-paired cues can promote maladaptive reward-seeking by biasing cost-benefit decision making. Whether this finding translates to humans is unknown. We examined the effects of salient reward-paired audiovisual cues on decision making under risk and uncertainty in human volunteers. Cues had risk-promoting effects on a risky choice task and independently increased task-related arousal as measured by pupil dilation. By demonstrating risk-promoting effects of cues in human participants, our data identify a mechanism whereby cue reactivity could translate into maladaptive behavioral outcomes in people with addictions.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/48/10349?rss=1">Synaptotoxicity in Alzheimer's Disease Involved a Dysregulation of Actin Cytoskeleton Dynamics through Cofilin 1 Phosphorylation</a></h4>

<p>Amyloid-β (Aβ) drives the synaptic impairment and dendritic spine loss characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how Aβ affects the actin cytoskeleton remains unknown and contentious. The actin-binding protein, cofilin-1 (cof1), is a major regulator of actin dynamics in dendritic spines, and is subject to phospho-regulation by multiple pathways, including the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway. While cof1 is implicated as a driver of the synaptotoxicity characteristic of the early phases of AD pathophysiology, questions remain about the molecular mechanisms involved. Cofilin-actin rods are observed in neurons exposed to Aβ oligomers (Aβo) and in tissue from AD patients, and others have described an increased cofilin phosphorylation (p-cof1) in AD patients. Here, we report elevated p-cof1 of the postsynaptic enriched fraction of synaptosomes from cortical samples of male APP/PS1 mice and human AD cases of either sex. In primary cortical neurons, Aβo induced rapid actin stabilization and increased p-cof1 in the postsynaptic compartment of excitatory synapses within 30 min. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of actin-GFP and calcium imaging in live neurons expressing active or inactive cof1 mutants suggest that cof1 phosphorylation is necessary and sufficient for Aβo-induced synaptic impairment via actin stabilization before the reported formation of cofilin-actin rods. Moreover, the clinically available and well-tolerated ROCK inhibitor, fasudil, prevented Aβo-induced actin stabilization, synaptic impairment, and synaptic loss by blocking cofilin phosphorylation. Aβo also blocked the LTP-induced insertion of the AMPAR subunit, GluA1, at the postsynaptic density, in a fasudil-sensitive manner. These data support an important role for ROCKs and cofilin in mediating Aβ-induced synaptic impairment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We report that amyloid-β oligomers rapidly induce aberrant stabilization of F-actin within dendritic spines, which impairs synaptic strength and plasticity. Activation of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway results in phosphorylation of cof1 and is sufficient to mediate Aβo-induced actin stabilization synaptic impairment and synaptic loss. Further, the ROCK inhibitor, fasudil, prevents cofilin phosphorylation, acute synaptic disruption, and synaptotoxicity in primary cortical neurons. Together, the herein presented data provide strong support for further study of the ROCK pathway as a therapeutic target for the cognitive decline and synaptotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>The extent to which subjective awareness influences reward processing, and thereby affects future decisions, is currently largely unknown. In the present report, we investigated this question in a reinforcement learning framework, combining perceptual masking, computational modeling, and electroencephalographic recordings (human male and female participants). Our results indicate that degrading the visibility of the reward decreased, without completely obliterating, the ability of participants to learn from outcomes, but concurrently increased their tendency to repeat previous choices. We dissociated electrophysiological signatures evoked by the reward-based learning processes from those elicited by the reward-independent repetition of previous choices and showed that these neural activities were significantly modulated by reward visibility. Overall, this report sheds new light on the neural computations underlying reward-based learning and decision-making and highlights that awareness is beneficial for the trial-by-trial adjustment of decision-making strategies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The notion of reward is strongly associated with subjective evaluation, related to conscious processes such as "pleasure," "liking," and "wanting." Here we show that degrading reward visibility in a reinforcement learning task decreases, without completely obliterating, the ability of participants to learn from outcomes, but concurrently increases subjects' tendency to repeat previous choices. Electrophysiological recordings, in combination with computational modeling, show that neural activities were significantly modulated by reward visibility. Overall, we dissociate different neural computations underlying reward-based learning and decision-making, which highlights a beneficial role of reward awareness in adjusting decision-making strategies.</p>

<p>Botulinum neurotoxin Type A (BoNT/A) is an effective treatment for several movement disorders, including spasticity and dystonia. BoNT/A acts by cleaving synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) at the neuromuscular junction, thus blocking synaptic transmission and weakening overactive muscles. However, not all the therapeutic benefits of the neurotoxin are explained by peripheral neuroparalysis, suggesting an action of BoNT/A on central circuits. Currently, the specific targets of BoNT/A central activity remain unclear. Here, we show that catalytically active BoNT/A is transported to the facial nucleus (FN) after injection into the nasolabial musculature of rats and mice. BoNT/A-mediated cleavage of SNAP-25 in the FN is prevented by intracerebroventricular delivery of antitoxin antibodies, demonstrating that BoNT/A physically leaves the motoneurons to enter second-order neurons. Analysis of intoxicated terminals within the FN shows that BoNT/A is transcytosed preferentially into cholinergic synapses. The cholinergic boutons containing cleaved SNAP-25 are associated with a larger size, suggesting impaired neuroexocytosis. Together, the present findings indicate a previously unrecognized source of reduced motoneuron drive after BoNT/A via blockade of central, excitatory cholinergic inputs. These data highlight the ability of BoNT/A to selectively target and modulate specific central circuits, with consequent impact on its therapeutic effectiveness in movement disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Botulinum neurotoxins are among the most potent toxins known. Despite this, their specific and reversible action prompted their use in clinical practice to treat several neuromuscular pathologies (dystonia, spasticity, muscle spasms) characterized by hyperexcitability of peripheral nerve terminals or even in nonpathological applications (i.e., cosmetic use). Substantial experimental and clinical evidence indicates that not all botulinum neurotoxin Type A (BoNT/A) effects can be explained solely by the local action (i.e., silencing of the neuromuscular junction). In particular, there are cases in which the clinical benefit exceeds the duration of peripheral neurotransmission blockade. In this study, we demonstrate that BoNT/A is transported to facial motoneurons, released, and internalized preferentially into cholinergic terminals impinging onto the motoneurons. Our data demonstrate a direct central action of BoNT/A.</p>

<p>Task- and phase-dependent reflex modulation during locomotion is well established, but we do not know the signals driving this modulation. To determine whether signals related to left–right symmetry of the locomotor pattern modulate cutaneous reflexes, we stimulated the superficial peroneal nerve in five intact female cats and in four spinal-transected cats (spinal cats, two males and two females) during split-belt locomotion at different left–right speeds. We compared cutaneous reflexes evoked in three ipsilateral and two contralateral hindlimb muscles during split-belt locomotion with those evoked during tied-belt (equal left–right speeds) locomotion at matched speeds of the slow and fast limbs. Our results showed similar phase-dependent modulation of cutaneous reflexes during tied-belt and split-belt locomotion in intact and spinal cats. During tied-belt locomotion in intact cats, an increase in speed significantly increased reflex modulation from minimum to maximum values, whereas in spinal cats, we observed a significant decrease. However, in all muscles of intact and spinal cats, split-belt locomotion significantly reduced reflex modulation compared with tied-belt locomotion independently of which limb was stepping on the slow or fast belt. Additionally, reflex modulation correlated more with spatial left–right symmetry, as opposed to a temporal one, in intact and spinal cats. Our results indicate that signals related to left–right symmetry reduce cutaneous reflex modulation independently of speed via a spinal mechanism. We propose that asymmetric sensory feedback from the left and right legs alters the state of the spinal network, thereby reducing cutaneous reflexes to prevent inputs from destabilizing a potentially unstable pattern.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> When we contact an obstacle during walking, receptors in the skin send signals to the CNS to alter the trajectory of the leg to maintain balance. This response, or reflex, is different when the leg is in the air and when it is contacting the ground. The reflex also differs when we walk at different speeds. Here, we investigated this reflex when the left and right legs were walking at different speeds on a split-belt treadmill in cats. We show that the reflex is smaller during split-belt locomotion compared with when both legs are walking at equal speeds. We propose that the spinal locomotor network controlling walking reduces the reflex response to optimize balance when gait is unstable.</p>

<p>The past decade has seen a large number of neuroimaging studies focused on the anticorrelated functional relationship between the default mode network (DMN) and the dorsal attention network (DAN). Due principally to the low temporal resolution of functional neuroimaging modalities, the fast-neuronal dynamics across these networks remain poorly understood. Here we report novel human intracranial electrophysiology data from six neurosurgical patients (four males) with simultaneous coverage of well characterized nodes of the DMN and DAN. Subjects performed an arithmetic processing task, shown previously to evoke reliable deactivations (below baseline) in the DMN, and activations in the DAN. In this cohort, we show that DMN deactivations lag DAN activations by approximately 200 ms. Our findings suggest a clear temporal order of processing across the two networks during the current task and place the DMN further than the DAN in a plausible information-processing hierarchy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The human brain contains an intrinsic and strictly organized network architecture. Our understanding of the interplay across association networks has relied primarily on the slow fluctuations of the hemodynamic response, and as such it has lacked essential evidence regarding the temporal dynamics of activity across these networks. The current study presents evidence from high spatiotemporal methods showing that well studied areas of the default mode network display delayed task-induced activity relative to divergent responses in dorsal attention network nodes. This finding provides direct and critical evidence regarding the temporal chronology of neuronal events across opposing brain networks.</p>

<p>When entering an environment, we can use the present visual information from the scene to either recognize the kind of place it is (e.g., a kitchen or a bedroom) or navigate through it. Here we directly test the hypothesis that these two processes, what we call "scene categorization" and "visually-guided navigation", are supported by dissociable neural systems. Specifically, we manipulated task demands by asking human participants (male and female) to perform a scene categorization, visually-guided navigation, and baseline task on images of scenes, and measured both the average univariate responses and multivariate spatial pattern of responses within two scene-selective cortical regions, the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and occipital place area (OPA), hypothesized to be separably involved in scene categorization and visually-guided navigation, respectively. As predicted, in the univariate analysis, PPA responded significantly more during the categorization task than during both the navigation and baseline tasks, whereas OPA showed the complete opposite pattern. Similarly, in the multivariate analysis, a linear support vector machine achieved above-chance classification for the categorization task, but not the navigation task in PPA. By contrast, above-chance classification was achieved for both the navigation and categorization tasks in OPA. However, above-chance classification for both tasks was also found in early visual cortex and hence not specific to OPA, suggesting that the spatial patterns of responses in OPA are merely inherited from early vision, and thus may be epiphenomenal to behavior. Together, these results are evidence for dissociable neural systems involved in recognizing places and navigating through them.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It has been nearly three decades since Goodale and Milner demonstrated that recognizing objects and manipulating them involve distinct neural processes. Today we show the same is true of our interactions with our environment: recognizing places and navigating through them are neurally dissociable. More specifically, we found that a scene-selective region, the parahippocampal place area, is active when participants are asked to categorize a scene, but not when asked to imagine navigating through it, whereas another scene-selective region, the occipital place area, shows the exact opposite pattern. This double dissociation is evidence for dissociable neural systems within scene processing, similar to the bifurcation of object processing described by Goodale and Milner (1992).</p>

<p>In mammals respiratory-locked hippocampal rhythms are implicated in the scaffolding and transfer of information between sensory and memory networks. These oscillations are entrained by nasal respiration and driven by the olfactory bulb. They then travel to the piriform cortex where they propagate further downstream to the hippocampus and modulate neural processes critical for memory formation. In humans, bypassing nasal airflow through mouth-breathing abolishes these rhythms and impacts encoding as well as recognition processes thereby reducing memory performance. It has been hypothesized that similar behavior should be observed for the consolidation process, the stage between encoding and recognition, were memory is reactivated and strengthened. However, direct evidence for such an effect is lacking in human and nonhuman animals. Here we tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of respiration on consolidation of episodic odor memory. In two separate sessions, female and male participants encoded odors followed by a 1 h awake resting consolidation phase where they either breathed solely through their nose or mouth. Immediately after the consolidation phase, memory for odors was tested. Recognition memory significantly increased during nasal respiration compared with mouth respiration during consolidation. These results provide the first evidence that respiration directly impacts consolidation of episodic events, and lends further support to the notion that core cognitive functions are modulated by the respiratory cycle.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Memories pass through three main stages in their development: encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Growing evidence from animal and human studies suggests that respiration plays an important role in the behavioral and neural mechanisms associated with encoding and recognition. Specifically nasal, but not mouth, respiration entrains neural oscillations that enhance encoding and recognition processes. We demonstrate that respiration also affects the consolidation stage. Breathing through the nose compared with the mouth during consolidation enhances recognition memory. This demonstrates, first, that nasal respiration is important during the critical period were memories are reactivated and strengthened. Second, it suggests that the neural mechanisms responsible may emerge from nasal respiration.</p>

<p>Neurons of the CNS elaborate highly branched dendritic arbors that host numerous dendritic spines, which serve as the postsynaptic platform for most excitatory synapses. The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in dendrite development and spine formation, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Tropomodulins (Tmods) are a family of actin-binding proteins that cap the slow-growing (pointed) end of actin filaments, thereby regulating the stability, length, and architecture of complex actin networks in diverse cell types. Three members of the Tmod family, Tmod1, Tmod2, and Tmod3 are expressed in the vertebrate CNS, but their function in neuronal development is largely unknown. In this study, we present evidence that Tmod1 and Tmod2 exhibit distinct roles in regulating spine development and dendritic arborization, respectively. Using rat hippocampal tissues from both sexes, we find that Tmod1 and Tmod2 are expressed with distinct developmental profiles: Tmod2 is expressed early during hippocampal development, whereas Tmod1 expression coincides with synaptogenesis. We then show that knockdown of Tmod2, but not Tmod1, severely impairs dendritic branching. Both Tmod1 and Tmod2 are localized to a distinct subspine region where they regulate local F-actin stability. However, the knockdown of Tmod1, but not Tmod2, disrupts spine morphogenesis and impairs synapse formation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by different members of the Tmod family plays an important role in distinct aspects of dendrite and spine development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The Tropomodulin family of molecules is best known for controlling the length and stability of actin myofilaments in skeletal muscles. While several Tropomodulin members are expressed in the brain, fundamental knowledge about their role in neuronal function is limited. In this study, we show the unique expression profile and subcellular distribution of Tmod1 and Tmod2 in hippocampal neurons. While both Tmod1 and Tmod2 regulate F-actin stability, we find that they exhibit isoform-specific roles in dendrite development and synapse formation: Tmod2 regulates dendritic arborization, whereas Tmod1 is required for spine development and synapse formation. These findings provide novel insight into the actin regulatory mechanisms underlying neuronal development, thereby shedding light on potential pathways disrupted in a number of neurological disorders.</p>

<p>Brainstem locus ceruleus neurons (LCn) are among the first neurons across the lifespan to evidence tau pathology, and LCn are implicated in tau propagation throughout the cortices. Yet, events influencing LCn tau are poorly understood. Activated persistently across wakefulness, LCn experience significant metabolic stress in response to chronic short sleep (CSS). Here we explored whether CSS influences LCn tau and the biochemical, neuroanatomical, and/or behavioral progression of tauopathy in male and female P301S mice. CSS in early adult life advanced the temporal progression of neurobehavioral impairments and resulted in a lasting increase in soluble tau oligomers. Intriguingly, CSS resulted in an early increase in AT8 and MC1 tau pathology in the LC. Over time tau pathology, including tangles, was evident in forebrain tau-vulnerable regions. Sustained microglial and astrocytic activation was observed as well. Remarkably, CSS resulted in significant loss of neurons in the two regions examined: the basolateral amygdala and LC. A second, distinct form of chronic sleep disruption, fragmentation of sleep, during early adult life also increased tau deposition and imparted early neurobehavioral impairment. Collectively, the findings demonstrate that early life sleep disruption has important lasting effects on the temporal progression in P301S mice, influencing tau pathology and hastening neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and neurobehavioral impairments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chronic short sleep (CSS) is pervasive in modern society. Here, we found that early life CSS influences behavioral, biochemical, and neuroanatomic aspects of the temporal progression of tauopathy in a mouse model of the P301S tau mutation. Specifically, CSS hastened the onset of motor impairment and resulted in a greater loss of neurons in both the locus ceruleus and basolateral/lateral amygdala. Importantly, despite a protracted recovery opportunity after CSS, mice evidenced a sustained increase in pathogenic tau oligomers, and increased pathogenic tau in the locus ceruleus and limbic system nuclei. These findings unveil early life sleep habits as an important determinant in the progression of tauopathy.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/48/10244?rss=1">Differentiation of Human Medial Prefrontal Cortex Activity Underlies Long-Term Resistance to Forgetting in Memory</a></h4>

<p>It is well known that distributing study events over time leads to better memory over long time scales, compared with massing study events together. One explanation for such long-term resistance to forgetting is that distributed study leads to neural differentiation in memory, which supports retrieval of past experiences by disambiguating highly similar memory representations. Neuroanatomical models of episodic memory retrieval propose that the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) work together to enable retrieval of behaviorally appropriate memories. However, it is not known how representations in these regions jointly support resistance to forgetting long after initial learning. Using fMRI, we measured differentiation in retrieved memory representations following an extended delay in male and female human participants. After 1 week, word–object associations were better remembered if studied across 2 d (overnight), allowing associations to be learned in distinct temporal contexts, compared with learning within a single day (same day). MPFC retrieval patterns showed differentiation for overnight relative to same day memories, whereas hippocampal patterns reflected associative retrieval success. Overnight memory differentiation in MPFC was higher for associative than item memories and higher than differentiation assessed over a brain-wide set of retrieval-active voxels. The memory-related difference in MPFC pattern differentiation correlated with memory success for overnight learning and with hippocampal–MPFC functional connectivity. These results show that learning information across days leads to differentiated MPFC memory representations, reducing forgetting after 1 week, and suggest this arises from persistent interactions between MPFC and hippocampus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neural activity in both the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) has been linked to memory-related representations, but prior work has not examined how these representations support episodic memory retrieval over extended time scales that are characteristic of everyday retrieval. We show that differentiation in MPFC activity 1 week after encoding is higher for retrieved information learned across 2 d compared with within a single day. In hippocampus, differentiation was greater for detailed memory retrieval but was not influenced by whether information had been learned over 1 or 2 d. Differentiation in MPFC predicted behavioral robustness to forgetting and was correlated with hippocampal–MPFC connectivity. The results suggest that context-based differentiation supports robust long-term memory via persistent MPFC–hippocampal interactions.</p>

<p>Collective movements are pervasive behaviours among social organisms and have
led to the development of many models. However, modelling animal trajectories
and social interactions in simple bounded environments remains a challenge.
Moreover, advances in the understanding of the sensory-motor loop and the
information processing by animals are leading to revisions of the traditional
assumptions made in decision-making algorithms. In this context, we develop a
methodology based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to describe the
collective motion of small zebrafish groups in a bounded environment. Although
ANN models are commonly used in artificial systems they are still
under-explored to model animal collective behaviours. Here, we present a
methodology to calibrate Multilayer Perceptrons by learning from real fish
experimental data. The ANNs are trained using either supervised learning or
various forms of evolutionary reinforcement learning methods (using the CMA-ES
and NSGA-III algorithms). We reveal that ANN models trained using evolutionary
methods are capable of generating realistic collective motions for groups of 5
zebrafish including the tank wall effects, a feature that is lacking in
previous models. Finally, we also discuss the benefits of optimised ANNs as
candidates for driving robotic lure with biologically realistic behaviour, a
method that is becoming increasingly popular to gather data and validate
assumptions on collective behaviours.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42870">Neural dynamics at successive stages of the ventral visual stream are consistent with hierarchical error signals</a></h4>

Ventral visual stream neural responses are dynamic, even for static image presentations. However, dynamical neural models of visual cortex are lacking as most progress has been made modeling static, time-averaged responses. Here, we studied population neural dynamics during face detection across three cortical processing stages. Remarkably, ~30 milliseconds after the initially evoked response, we found that neurons in intermediate level areas decreased their responses to typical configurations of their preferred face parts relative to their response for atypical configurations even while neurons in higher areas achieved and maintained a preference for typical configurations. These hierarchical neural dynamics were inconsistent with standard feedforward circuits. Rather, recurrent models computing prediction errors between stages captured the observed temporal signatures. This model of neural dynamics, which simply augments the standard feedforward model of online vision, suggests that neural responses to static images may encode top-down prediction errors in addition to bottom-up feature estimates.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41653">The hydrophobic nature of a novel membrane interface regulates the enzyme activity of a voltage-sensing phosphatase</a></h4>

Voltage-sensing phosphatases (VSP) contain a voltage sensor domain (VSD) similar to that of voltage-gated ion channels but lack a pore-gate domain. A VSD in a VSP regulates the cytoplasmic catalytic region (CCR). However, the mechanisms by which the VSD couples to the CCR remain elusive. Here we report a membrane interface (named 'the hydrophobic spine'), which is essential for the coupling of the VSD and CCR. Our molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the hydrophobic spine of <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> VSP (Ci-VSP) provides a hinge-like motion for the CCR through the loose membrane association of the phosphatase domain. Electrophysiological experiments indicate that the voltage-dependent phosphatase activity of Ci-VSP depends on the hydrophobicity and presence of an aromatic ring in the hydrophobic spine. Analysis of conformational changes in the VSD and CCR suggests that the VSP has two states with distinct enzyme activities and that the second transition depends on the hydrophobic spine.

The evolutionary increase in size and complexity of the primate neocortex is thought to underlie the higher cognitive abilities of humans. <i>ARHGAP11B</i> is a human-specific gene that, based on its expression pattern in fetal human neocortex and progenitor effects in embryonic mouse neocortex, has been proposed to have a key function in the evolutionary expansion of the neocortex. Here, we study the effects of<i> ARHGAP11B</i> expression in the developing neocortex of the gyrencephalic ferret. In contrast to its effects in mouse, ARHGAP11B markedly increases proliferative basal radial glia, a progenitor cell type thought to be instrumental for neocortical expansion, and results in extension of the neurogenic period and an increase in upper-layer neurons. Consequently, the postnatal ferret neocortex exhibits increased neuron density in the upper cortical layers and expands in both the radial and tangential dimensions. Thus, human-specific ARHGAP11B can elicit hallmarks of neocortical expansion in the developing ferret neocortex.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41228">Plant diversity maintains multiple soil functions in future environments</a></h4>

Biodiversity increases ecosystem functions underpinning a suite of services valued by society, including services provided by soils. To test whether, and how, future environments alter the relationship between biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions, we measured grassland plant diversity effects on single soil functions and ecosystem multifunctionality, and compared relationships in four environments: ambient conditions, elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, enriched N supply, and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and N in combination. Our results showed that plant diversity increased three out of four soil functions and, consequently, ecosystem multifunctionality. Remarkably, biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships were similarly significant under current and future environmental conditions, yet weaker with enriched N supply. Structural equation models revealed that plant diversity enhanced ecosystem multifunctionality by increasing plant community functional diversity, and the even provision of multiple functions. Conserving local plant diversity is therefore a robust strategy to maintain multiple valuable ecosystem services in both present and future environmental conditions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40126">TAPBPR mediates peptide dissociation from MHC class I using a leucine lever</a></h4>

Tapasin and TAPBPR are known to perform peptide editing on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules, however, the precise molecular mechanism(s) involved in this process remain largely enigmatic. Here, using immunopeptidomics in combination with novel cell-based assays that assess TAPBPR-mediate peptide exchange, we reveal a critical role for the K22-D35 loop of TAPBPR in mediating peptide exchange on MHC I. We identify a specific leucine within this loop that enables TAPBPR to facilitate peptide dissociation from MHC I. Moreover, we delineate the molecular features of the MHC I F pocket required for TAPBPR to promote peptide dissociation in a loop-dependent manner. These data reveal that chaperone-mediated peptide editing of MHC I can occur by different mechanisms dependent on the C-terminal residue that the MHC I accommodates in its F pocket and provide novel insights that may inform the therapeutic potential of TAPBPR manipulation to increase tumour immunogenicity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39658">Pericentromeric hypomethylation elicits an interferon response in an animal model of ICF syndrome</a></h4>

Pericentromeric satellite repeats are enriched in 5-methylcytosine (5mC). Loss of 5mC at these sequences is common in cancer and is a hallmark of Immunodeficiency, Centromere and Facial abnormalities (ICF) syndrome. While the general importance of 5mC is well-established, the specific functions of 5mC at pericentromeres are less clear. To address this deficiency, we generated a viable animal model of pericentromeric hypomethylation through mutation of the ICF-gene <i>ZBTB24</i>. Deletion of zebrafish <i>zbtb24</i> caused a progressive loss of 5mC at pericentromeres and ICF-like phenotypes. Hypomethylation of these repeats triggered derepression of pericentromeric transcripts and activation of an interferon-based innate immune response. Injection of pericentromeric RNA is sufficient to elicit this response in wild-type embryos, and mutation of the MDA5-MAVS dsRNA-sensing machinery blocks the response in mutants. These findings identify activation of the innate immune system as an early consequence of pericentromeric hypomethylation, implicating derepression of pericentromeric transcripts as a trigger of autoimmunity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38090">Rat behavior and dopamine release are modulated by conspecific distress</a></h4>

Rats exhibit ‘empathy’ making them a model to understand the neural underpinnings of such behavior. We show data consistent with these findings, but also that behavior and dopamine (DA) release reflects subjective rather than objective evaluation of appetitive and aversive events that occur to another. We recorded DA release in two paradigms: one that involved cues predictive of unavoidable shock to the conspecific and another that allowed the rat to refrain from reward when there were harmful consequences to the conspecific. Behavior and DA reflected pro-social interactions in that DA suppression was reduced during cues that predicted shock in the presence of the conspecific and that DA release observed on self-avoidance trials was present when the conspecific was spared. However, DA also increased when the conspecific was shocked instead of the recording rat and DA release during conspecific avoidance trials was lower than when the rat avoided shock for itself.

Dorso-ventral (D-V) patterning of the mandibular arch specifies upper versus lower jaw skeletal elements through a combination of Bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp), Endothelin-1 (Edn1), and Notch signaling, and this system is highly robust. We combine NanoString experiments of early D-V gene expression with live imaging of arch development in zebrafish to construct a computational model of the D-V mandibular patterning network. The model recapitulates published genetic perturbations in arch development. Patterning is most sensitive to changes in Bmp signaling, and the temporal order of gene expression modulates the response of the patterning network to noise. Thus, our integrated systems biology approach reveals non-intuitive features of the complex signaling system crucial for craniofacial development, including novel insights into roles of gene expression timing and stochasticity in signaling and gene regulation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nw45cvIUcgA" width="1" />

<p>by Oliver M. Crook, Claire M. Mulvey, Paul D. W. Kirk, Kathryn S. Lilley, Laurent Gatto</p>

Analysis of the spatial sub-cellular distribution of proteins is of vital importance to fully understand context specific protein function. Some proteins can be found with a single location within a cell, but up to half of proteins may reside in multiple locations, can dynamically re-localise, or reside within an unknown functional compartment. These considerations lead to uncertainty in associating a protein to a single location. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS) based spatial proteomics relies on supervised machine learning algorithms to assign proteins to sub-cellular locations based on common gradient profiles. However, such methods fail to quantify uncertainty associated with sub-cellular class assignment. Here we reformulate the framework on which we perform statistical analysis. We propose a Bayesian generative classifier based on Gaussian mixture models to assign proteins probabilistically to sub-cellular niches, thus proteins have a probability distribution over sub-cellular locations, with Bayesian computation performed using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm, as well as Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Our methodology allows proteome-wide uncertainty quantification, thus adding a further layer to the analysis of spatial proteomics. Our framework is flexible, allowing many different systems to be analysed and reveals new modelling opportunities for spatial proteomics. We find our methods perform competitively with current state-of-the art machine learning methods, whilst simultaneously providing more information. We highlight several examples where classification based on the support vector machine is unable to make any conclusions, while uncertainty quantification using our approach provides biologically intriguing results. To our knowledge this is the first Bayesian model of MS-based spatial proteomics data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xZZza2iv30E" width="1" />

<p>by Jun Li, Wei Zhu, Jun Wang, Wenfei Li, Sheng Gong, Jian Zhang, Wei Wang</p>

Quality assessment is essential for the computational prediction and design of RNA tertiary structures. To date, several knowledge-based statistical potentials have been proposed and proved to be effective in identifying native and near-native RNA structures. All these potentials are based on the inverse Boltzmann formula, while differing in the choice of the geometrical descriptor, reference state, and training dataset. Via an approach that diverges completely from the conventional statistical potentials, our work explored the power of a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach as a quality evaluator for RNA 3D structures, which used a 3D grid representation of the structure as input without extracting features manually. The RNA structures were evaluated by examining each nucleotide, so our method can also provide local quality assessment. Two sets of training samples were built. The first one included 1 million samples generated by high-temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the second one included 1 million samples generated by Monte Carlo (MC) structure prediction. Both MD and MC procedures were performed for a non-redundant set of 414 RNAs. For two training datasets (one including only MD training samples and the other including both MD and MC training samples), we trained two neural networks, named RNA3DCNN_MD and RNA3DCNN_MDMC, respectively. The former is suitable for assessing near-native structures, while the latter is suitable for assessing structures covering large structural space. We tested the performance of our method and made comparisons with four other traditional scoring functions. On two of three test datasets, our method performed similarly to the state-of-the-art traditional scoring function, and on the third test dataset, our method was far superior to other scoring functions. Our method can be downloaded from https://github.com/lijunRNA/RNA3DCNN.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JE7z7RP6F5Y" width="1" />

<p>This paper proposes that the distinctively human capacity for cumulative,
adaptive, open-ended cultural evolution came about through two
temporally-distinct cognitive transitions. First, the origin of Homo-specific
culture over two MYA was made possible by the onset of a finer-grained
associative memory that allowed episodes to be encoded in greater detail. This
in turn meant more overlap amongst the distributed representations of these
episodes, such that they could more readily evoke one another through
self-triggered recall (STR). STR enabled representational redescription, the
chaining of thoughts and actions, and the capacity for a stream of thought.
Second, fully cognitive modernity following the appearance of anatomical
modernity after 200,000 BP, was made possible by the onset of contextual focus
(CF): the ability to shift between an explicit convergent mode conducive to
logic and refinement of ideas, and an implicit divergent mode conducive to
free-association, viewing situations from radically new perspectives, concept
combination, analogical thinking, and insight. This paved the way for an
integrated, creative internal network of understandings, and behavioral
modernity. We discuss feasible neural mechanisms for this two-stage proposal,
and outline how STR and CF differ from other proposals. We provide
computational evidence for the proposal obtained with an agent-based model of
cultural evolution in which agents invent ideas for actions and imitate the
fittest of their neighbors' actions. Mean fitness and diversity of actions
across the artificial society increased with STR, and even more so with CF, but
CF was only effective if STR was already in place. CF was most effective
following a change in task, which supports its hypothesized role in escaping
mental fixation. The proposal is discussed in the context of transition theory
in the life sciences.

<p>We present the first real-time sleep staging system that uses deep learning
without the need for servers in a smartphone application for a wearable EEG. We
employ real-time adaptation of a single channel Electroencephalography (EEG) to
infer from a Time-Distributed 1-D Deep Convolutional Neural Network.
Polysomnography (PSG)-the gold standard for sleep staging, requires a human
scorer and is both complex and resource-intensive. Our work demonstrates an
end-to-end on-smartphone pipeline that can infer sleep stages in just single
30-second epochs, with an overall accuracy of 83.5% on 20-fold cross validation
for five-class classification of sleep stages using the open Sleep-EDF dataset.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09922">The most probable neural circuit exhibits low-dimensional sustained activity. (arXiv:1811.09922v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Cortical neurons whose activity is recorded in behavioral experiments has
been classified into several types such as stimulus-related neurons,
delay-period neurons, and reward-related neurons. Moreover, the population
activity of neurons during a reaching task can be described by dynamics in
low-dimensional space. These results suggest that the low-dimensional dynamics
of a few types of neurons emerge in the cerebral cortex that is trained to
perform a task. This study investigates a simple neural circuit emerges with a
few types of neurons. Assuming an infinite number of neurons in the circuit
with connection weights drawn from a Gaussian distribution, we model the
dynamics of neurons by using a kernel function. Given that the system is
infinitely large, almost all capable circuits approximate the most probable
circuit for the task. We simulate two delayed response tasks and a
motor-pattern generation task. The model network exhibits low-dimensional
dynamics in all tasks. Considering that the connection weights are drawn from a
Gaussian distribution, the most probable circuit is the circuit with the
smallest connection weight; that is, the simplest circuit with the simplest
dynamics. Finally, we relate the dynamics to algorithmic information theory.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09739">A probabilistic population code based on neural samples. (arXiv:1811.09739v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Sensory processing is often characterized as implementing probabilistic
inference: networks of neurons compute posterior beliefs over unobserved causes
given the sensory inputs. How these beliefs are computed and represented by
neural responses is much-debated (Fiser et al. 2010, Pouget et al. 2013). A
central debate concerns the question of whether neural responses represent
samples of latent variables (Hoyer &amp; Hyvarinnen 2003) or parameters of their
distributions (Ma et al. 2006) with efforts being made to distinguish between
them (Grabska-Barwinska et al. 2013). A separate debate addresses the question
of whether neural responses are proportionally related to the encoded
probabilities (Barlow 1969), or proportional to the logarithm of those
probabilities (Jazayeri &amp; Movshon 2006, Ma et al. 2006, Beck et al. 2012).
Here, we show that these alternatives - contrary to common assumptions - are
not mutually exclusive and that the very same system can be compatible with all
of them. As a central analytical result, we show that modeling neural responses
in area V1 as samples from a posterior distribution over latents in a linear
Gaussian model of the image implies that those neural responses form a linear
Probabilistic Population Code (PPC, Ma et al. 2006). In particular, the
posterior distribution over some experimenter-defined variable like
"orientation" is part of the exponential family with sufficient statistics that
are linear in the neural sampling-based firing rates.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41968">Piezo's membrane footprint and its contribution to mechanosensitivity</a></h4>

Piezo1 is an ion channel that gates open when mechanical force is applied to a cell membrane, thus allowing cells to detect and respond to mechanical stimulation. Molecular structures of Piezo1 reveal a large ion channel with an unusually curved shape. This study analyzes how such a curved ion channel interacts energetically with the cell membrane. Through membrane mechanical calculations, we show that Piezo1 deforms the membrane shape outside the perimeter of the channel into a curved 'membrane footprint'. This membrane footprint amplifies the sensitivity of Piezo1 to changes in membrane tension, rendering it exquisitely responsive. We assert that the shape of the Piezo channel is an elegant example of molecular form evolved to optimize a specific function, in this case tension sensitivity. Furthermore, the predicted influence of the membrane footprint on Piezo gating is consistent with the demonstrated importance of membrane-cytoskeletal attachments to Piezo gating.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41604">Molecular basis for activation of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase by a compound that increases HDL cholesterol</a></h4>

Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and LCAT-activating compounds are being investigated as treatments for coronary heart disease (CHD) and familial LCAT deficiency (FLD). Herein we report the crystal structure of human LCAT in complex with a potent piperidinylpyrazolopyridine activator and an acyl intermediate-like inhibitor, revealing LCAT in an active conformation. Unlike other LCAT activators, the piperidinylpyrazolopyridine activator binds exclusively to the membrane-binding domain (MBD). Functional studies indicate that the compound does not modulate the affinity of LCAT for HDL, but instead stabilizes residues in the MBD and facilitates channeling of substrates into the active site. By demonstrating that these activators increase the activity of an FLD variant, we show that compounds targeting the MBD have therapeutic potential. Our data better define the substrate binding site of LCAT and pave the way for rational design of LCAT agonists and improved biotherapeutics for augmenting or restoring reverse cholesterol transport in CHD and FLD patients.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41319">Managing a sustainable deep-sea ‘blue economy’ requires knowledge of what actually lives there</a></h4>

Ensuring that the wealth of resources contained in our oceans are managed and developed in a sustainable manner is a priority for the emerging 'blue economy'. However, modern ecosystem-based management approaches do not translate well to regions where we know almost nothing about the individual species found in the ecosystem. Here, we propose a new taxon-focused approach to deep-sea conservation that includes regulatory oversight to set targets for the delivery of taxonomic data. For example, a five-year plan to deliver taxonomic and genomic knowledge on a thousand species in regions of the ocean earmarked for industrial activity is an achievable target. High-throughput, integrative taxonomy can, therefore, provide the data that is needed to monitor various ecosystem services (such as the natural history, connectivity, value and function of species) and to help break the regulatory deadlock of high-seas conservation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40841">Natural variation in sugar tolerance associates with changes in signaling and mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis</a></h4>

How dietary selection impacts genome evolution to define the optimal range of nutrient intake is a poorly understood question with medical relevance. We have addressed this question by analyzing <i>Drosophila simulans</i> and <i>sechellia</i>, recently diverged species with differential diet choice. <i>D. sechellia</i> larvae, specialized to a nutrient scarce diet, did not survive on sugar rich conditions, while the generalist species <i>D. simulans</i> was sugar tolerant. Sugar tolerance in <i>D. simulans</i> was a tradeoff for performance on low energy diet and was associated with global reprogramming of metabolic gene expression. Hybridization and phenotype-based introgression revealed the genomic regions of <i>D. simulans</i> that were sufficient for sugar tolerance. These regions included genes that are involved in mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis and intracellular signaling, such as <i>PPP1R15</i>/<i>Gadd34 </i>and <i>SERCA</i>, which contributed to sugar tolerance. In conclusion, genomic variation affecting genes involved in global metabolic control defines the optimal range for dietary macronutrient composition.

<p>by Letícia Stock, Juliana Hosoume, Leonardo Cirqueira, Werner Treptow</p>

The direct-site hypothesis assumes general anesthetics bind ion channels to impact protein equilibrium and function, inducing anesthesia. Despite advancements in the field, a first principle all-atom demonstration of this structure-function premise is still missing. We focus on the clinically used sevoflurane interaction to anesthetic-sensitive Kv1.2 mammalian channel to resolve if sevoflurane binds protein’s well-characterized open and closed structures in a conformation-dependent manner to shift channel equilibrium. We employ an innovative approach relying on extensive docking calculations and free-energy perturbation of all potential binding sites revealed by the latter, and find sevoflurane binds open and closed structures at multiple sites under complex saturation and concentration effects. Results point to a non-trivial interplay of site and conformation-dependent modes of action involving distinct binding sites that increase channel open-probability at diluted ligand concentrations. Given the challenge in exploring more complex processes potentially impacting channel-anesthetic interaction, the result is revealing as it demonstrates the process of multiple anesthetic binding events alone may account for open-probability shifts recorded in measurements.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/R7l5I-sNaNM" width="1" />

<p>by Sarah F. Beul, Alexandros Goulas, Claus C. Hilgetag</p>

The architectonic type principle relates patterns of cortico-cortical connectivity to the relative architectonic differentiation of cortical regions. One mechanism through which the observed close relation between cortical architecture and connectivity may be established is the joint development of cortical areas and their connections in developmental time windows. Here, we describe a theoretical exploration of the possible mechanistic underpinnings of the architectonic type principle, by performing systematic computational simulations of cortical development. The main component of our <i>in silico</i> model was a developing two-dimensional cortical sheet, which was gradually populated by neurons that formed cortico-cortical connections. To assess different explanatory mechanisms, we varied the spatiotemporal trajectory of the simulated neurogenesis. By keeping the rules governing axon outgrowth and connection formation constant across all variants of simulated development, we were able to create model variants which differed exclusively by the specifics of when and where neurons were generated. Thus, all differences in the resulting connectivity were due to the variations in spatiotemporal growth trajectories. Our results demonstrated that a prescribed targeting of interareal connection sites was not necessary for obtaining a realistic replication of the experimentally observed relation between connection patterns and architectonic differentiation. Instead, we found that spatiotemporal interactions within the forming cortical sheet were sufficient if a small number of empirically well-grounded assumptions were met, namely planar, expansive growth of the cortical sheet around two points of origin as neurogenesis progressed, stronger architectonic differentiation of cortical areas for later neurogenetic time windows, and stochastic connection formation. Thus, our study highlights a potential mechanism of how relative architectonic differentiation and cortical connectivity become linked during development. We successfully predicted connectivity in two species, cat and macaque, from simulated cortico-cortical connection networks, which further underscored the general applicability of mechanisms through which the architectonic type principle can explain cortical connectivity in terms of the relative architectonic differentiation of cortical regions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YGzOoH1dEQs" width="1" />

<p>by Xiaodong Huang, Zhen Song, Zhilin Qu</p>

Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are spontaneous depolarizations during the repolarization phase of an action potential in cardiac myocytes. It is widely known that EADs are promoted by increasing inward currents and/or decreasing outward currents, a condition called reduced repolarization reserve. Recent studies based on bifurcation theories show that EADs are caused by a dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation, bringing in further mechanistic insights into the genesis and dynamics of EADs. In this study, we investigated the EAD properties, such as the EAD amplitude, the inter-EAD interval, and the latency of the first EAD, and their major determinants. We first made predictions based on the bifurcation theory and then validated them in physiologically more detailed action potential models. These properties were investigated by varying one parameter at a time or using parameter sets randomly drawn from assigned intervals. The theoretical and simulation results were compared with experimental data from the literature. Our major findings are that the EAD amplitude and takeoff potential exhibit a negative linear correlation; the inter-EAD interval is insensitive to the maximum ionic current conductance but mainly determined by the kinetics of I<sub>Ca,L</sub> and the dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation; and both inter-EAD interval and latency vary largely from model to model. Most of the model results generally agree with experimental observations in isolated ventricular myocytes. However, a major discrepancy between modeling results and experimental observations is that the inter-EAD intervals observed in experiments are mainly between 200 and 500 ms, irrespective of species, while those of the mathematical models exhibit a much wider range with some models exhibiting inter-EAD intervals less than 100 ms. Our simulations show that the cause of this discrepancy is likely due to the difference in I<sub>Ca,L</sub> recovery properties in different mathematical models, which needs to be addressed in future action potential model development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vXy6RgqS0DE" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0404-18.2018v1?rss=1">Adenosine signaling though A1 receptors inhibits chemosensitive neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus</a></h4>

Abstract<p>A subset of neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) function as respiratory chemoreceptors by regulating depth and frequency of breathing in response to changes in tissue CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>. The activity of chemosensitive RTN neurons is also subject to modulation by CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent purinergic signaling. However, mechanisms contributing to purinergic regulation of RTN chemoreceptors are not entirely clear. Recent evidence suggests adenosine inhibits RTN chemoreception <i>in vivo</i> by activation of A1 receptors. The goal of this study was to characterize effects of adenosine on chemosensitive RTN neurons and identify intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms underlying this response. Cell-attached recordings from RTN chemoreceptors in slices from rat or wild-type mouse pups (mixed sex) show that exposure to adenosine (1 µM) inhibits chemoreceptor activity by an A1 receptor-dependent mechanism. However, exposure to a selective A1 receptor antagonist (DPCPX, 30 nM) alone did not potentiate CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-stimulated activity, suggesting activation of A1 receptors does not limit chemoreceptor activity under these reduced conditions. Whole-cell voltage-clamp from chemosensitive RTN neurons show that exposure to adenosine activated an inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> conductance, and at the network level, adenosine preferentially decreased frequency of excitatory but not inhibitory postsynaptic currents. These results show that adenosine activation of A1 receptors inhibits chemosensitive RTN neurons by direct activation of a GIRK-like conductance, and presynaptically, by suppression of excitatory synaptic input to chemoreceptors.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Adenosine is a potent modulator of all aspects of breathing including chemoreception at the level of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN); however, mechanisms by which adenosine regulates activity of RTN chemoreceptors is not known. Here, we show that adenosine activation of A1 receptors inhibits RTN neurons by activation of an inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> conductance, and by selective suppression of excitatory synaptic input to chemoreceptors. These results identify a GIRK-like conductance as the first target of purinergic signaling in chemosensitive RTN neurons. This work may also have clinical relevance since A1 receptor antagonists like caffeine are used to treat respiratory problems in premature infancy.</p>

Abstract<p>The <i>Drosophila</i> Giant Fiber (GF) escape circuit is an extensively studied model for neuron connectivity and function. Researchers have long taken advantage of the simple linear neuronal pathway, which begins at peripheral sensory modalities, travels through the central GF Interneuron (GFI) to motor neurons, and terminates on wing/leg muscles. This circuit is more complex than it seems however, as there exists a complex web of coupled neurons connected to the GFI, which widely innervate the thoracic ganglion. Here, we define four new neuron clusters dye-coupled to the central GFI, which we name GF Coupled (GFC) 1-4. We identify new transgenic Gal4 drivers that express specifically in these neurons, and map both neuronal architecture and synaptic polarity. GFC1-4 share a central site of GFI connectivity, the Inframedial Bridge (IB), where the neurons each form electrical synapses. Targeted apoptotic ablation of GFC1 reveals a key role for proper development of the GF circuit, including the maintenance of GFI connectivity with upstream and downstream synaptic partners. GFC1 ablation frequently results in loss of one GFI, which is always compensated for by contralateral innervation from a branch of the persisting GFI axon. Overall, this work reveals extensively coupled interconnectivity within the GF circuit, and the requirement of coupled neurons for circuit development. Identification of this large population of electrically-coupled neurons in this classic model, and the ability to genetically manipulate these electrically synapsed neurons, expands the GF system capabilities for the nuanced, sophisticated circuit dissection necessary for deeper investigations into brain formation.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Genetic model neural circuits with individually identifiable neurons help us understand how nervous systems wire together during development, and then operate through coordinated chemical and electrical signaling. The <i>Drosophila</i> Giant Fiber circuit has long served as such a model, due to large neuron size, genetic malleability and easily visualized behavioral output: a jump in response to a threat. This study unveils new members of this circuit, all of which synapse with the circuit at one site on the central Giant Fiber Interneuron. We use new tools to identify and transgenically manipulate these neurons and show that these neurons are required for proper circuit development. This study provides a detailed circuit map for further dissection of neuronal connectivity and electrically-coupled communication.</p>

Abstract<p>Obesogenic diets lead to overeating and obesity by inducing the expression of genes involved in hedonic and homeostatic responses in specific brain regions. However, how the effects on gene expression are coordinated in the brain so far remains largely unknown. In our study, we provided mice with access to energy-dense diet, which induced overeating and overweight, and we explored the transcriptome changes across the main regions involved in feeding and energy balance: hypothalamus, frontal cortex and striatum. Interestingly, we detected two regulatory processes: a switch-like regulation with differentially expressed genes changing over 1.5-fold, and "fine-tuned" subtler changes of genes whose levels correlated with body weight and behavioral changes. We found that genes in both categories were positioned within specific topologically associating domains (TADs), which were often differently regulated across different brain regions. These TADs were enriched in genes relevant for the physiological and behavioral observed changes. Our results suggest that chromatin structure coordinates diet-dependent transcriptional regulation.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Mice fed with free-choice access to chocolate mixture become overweight and compulsive, recapitulating what happens during obesity. For the first time, we correlated these physical and behavioural changes with the transcriptome in the frontal cortex and the striatum, involved in the hedonic "liking" associated to eating, and the hypothalamus, involved in the homeostasic regulation of food intake. We detected two groups of genes: some transcript were strongly deregulated in term of fold changes; while others were only subtly deregulated but were especially correlating with measurements associated with body-weight and compulsivity. These genes were not randomly distributed, but were positioned in chromatin domains, many of which rich in genes differentially co-regulated across brain areas.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0008-18.2018v1?rss=1">Hierarchical Cognition causes Task Related Deactivations but not just in Default Mode Regions</a></h4>

Abstract<p>The well-known deactivation of the Default Mode Network (DMN) during external tasks is usually thought to reflect the suppression of internally directed mental activity during external attention. In 3 experiments with human participants we organized sequences of task events identical in their attentional and control demands into larger task episodes. We found that DMN deactivation across such sequential events was never constant, but was maximum at the beginning of the episode, then decreased gradually across the episode, reaching baseline towards episode completion, with the final event of the episode eliciting an activation. Crucially, this pattern of activity was not limited to a fixed set of DMN regions but, across experiments, was shown by a variable set of regions expected to be uninvolved in processing the ongoing task. This change in deactivation across sequential but identical events showed that the deactivation cannot be related to attentional/control demands which were constant across the episode, instead it has to be related to some episode related load that was maximal at the beginning and then decreased gradually as parts of the episode got executed. We argue that this load resulted from cognitive programs through which the entire episode was hierarchically executed as one unit. At the beginning of task episodes, programs related to their entire duration is assembled, causing maximal deactivation. As execution proceeds, elements within the program related to the completed parts of the episode dismantle, thereby decreasing the program load and causing a decrease in deactivation.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> We prepare breakfasts and write emails, and not individually execute their many component acts. The current study suggests that cognitive entities that enable such hierarchical execution of goal-directed behavior may cause the ubiquitously seen deactivation during external task execution. Further, while this deactivation has previously been associated with a defined set of the so called default mode regions, current study demonstrates that deactivation is shown by <i>any</i> region not <i>currently</i> involved in task execution, and in certain task episodes can even include attention related fronto-parietal regions as well as primary sensory and motor regions.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09588">Social Innovation and the Evolution of Creative, Sustainable Worldviews. (arXiv:1811.09588v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The ideas that we forge creatively as individuals and groups build on one
another in a manner that is cumulative and adaptive, forming open-ended
lineages across space and time. Thus, human culture is believed to evolve. The
pervasiveness of cross-domain creativity--as when a song inspires a
painting--would appear indicative of discontinuities in cultural lineages.
However, if what evolves through culture is our worldviews--the webs of
thoughts, ideas, and attitudes that constitutes our way of seeing being in the
world--then the problem of discontinuities is solved. The state of a worldview
can be affected by information assimilated in one domain, and this
change-of-state can be expressed in another domain. In this view, the gesture,
narrative, or artifact that constitutes a specific creative act is not what is
evolving; it is merely the external manifestation of the state of an evolving
worldview. Like any evolutionary process, cultural evolution requires a balance
between novelty, via the generation of variation, and continuity, via the
preservation of variants that are adaptive. In cultural evolution, novelty is
generated through creativity, and continuity is provided by social learning
processes, e.g., imitation. Both the generative and imitative aspects of
cultural evolution are affected by social media. We discuss the trajectory from
social ideation to social innovation, focusing on the role of
self-organization, renewal, and perspective-taking at the individual and social
group level.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09229">Quenched asymptotics for interacting diffusions on inhomogeneous random graphs. (arXiv:1811.09229v1 [math.PR])</a></h4>

<p>The aim of the paper is to address the behavior in large population of
diffusions interacting on a random, possibly diluted and inhomogeneous graph.
This is the natural continuation of a previous work, where the homogeneous
Erd\H os-R\'enyi case was considered. The class of graphs we consider includes
disordered $W$-random graphs, with possibly unbounded graphons. The main result
concerns a quenched convergence (that is true for almost every realization of
the random graph) of the empirical measure of the system towards the solution
of a nonlinear Fokker-Planck PDE with spatial extension, also appearing in
different contexts, especially in neuroscience. The convergence of the spatial
profile associated to the diffusions is also considered, and one proves that
the limit is described in terms of a nonlinear integro-differential equation
which matches the neural field equation in certain particular cases.

This paper uses voxelwise modeling to show that individual voxels in human scene-selective areas are tuned for the orientations and distances of surfaces. Simple 2D features cannot explain this tuning, and the model can reconstruct 3D scenes from fMRI activity.

Tang et al. demonstrate that adult NSCs act as a niche for the maturation of newborn neurons through the section of PTN. PTN activates AKT signaling to promote the morphological maturation and synaptic integration of newborn neurons through the ALK receptor.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25384?af=R">Six‐months assessment of a hand prosthesis with intraneural tactile feedback</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hand amputation is a highly disabling event, which significantly affects quality of life. An effective hand replacement can be achieved if the user, in addition to motor functions, is provided with the sensations that are naturally perceived while grasping and moving. Intraneural peripheral electrodes have shown promising results toward the restoration of the sense of touch. However, the long‐term usability and clinical relevance of intraneural sensory feedback have not yet been clearly demonstrated.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>To this aim, we performed a six months clinical study with three trans‐radial amputees who received implants of transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) in their median and ulnar nerves. After calibration, electrical stimulation was delivered through the TIMEs connected to artificial sensors in the digits of a prosthesis to generate sensory feedback, which was then used by the subjects while performing different grasping tasks.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All the subjects, notwithstanding their important clinical differences, reported stimulation‐induced sensations from the phantom hand for the whole duration of the trial. They also successfully integrated the sensory feedback into their motor control strategies while performing experimental tests simulating tasks of real life (with and without the support of vision). Finally, they reported a decrement of their phantom limb pain and a general improvement in mood state.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The promising results achieved with all subjects show the feasibility of the use of intraneural stimulation in clinical settings.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08763">Predictive models of brain connectivity based on transportation on a Riemannian manifold. (arXiv:1811.08763v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Predictive modelling of functional connectomes from structural connectomes
explores commonalities across multimodal imaging data. However, direct
application of multivariate approaches such as sparse Canonical Correlation
Analysis (sCCA) applies on the vectorised elements of functional connectivity
across subjects and it does not guarantee that the predicted models of
functional connectivity are Symmetric Positive Matrices (SPD). We suggest an
elegant solution based on the transportation of the connectivity matrices on a
Riemannian manifold, which notably improves the prediction performance of the
model. Subsequently, we construct a statistical framework to highlight brain
connections that are selected with probability well above chance and we
estimate their sCCA loadings based on a de-noising approach.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Genome-wide association studies have implicated many ion channels in schizophrenia pathophysiology. Although the functions of these channels are relatively well characterized by single-cell studies, the contributions of common variation in these channels to neurophysiological biomarkers and symptoms of schizophrenia remain elusive. Here, using computational modeling, we show that a common biomarker of schizophrenia, namely, an increase in delta-oscillation power, may be a direct consequence of altered expression or kinetics of voltage-gated ion channels or calcium transporters. Our model of a circuit of layer V pyramidal cells highlights multiple types of schizophrenia-related variants that contribute to altered dynamics in the delta-frequency band. Moreover, our model predicts that the same membrane mechanisms that increase the layer V pyramidal cell network gain and response to delta-frequency oscillations may also cause a deficit in a single-cell correlate of the prepulse inhibition, which is a behavioral biomarker highly associated with schizophrenia.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Emotions can be characterized by dimensions of arousal and valence (pleasantness). While the functional brain bases of emotional arousal and valence have been actively investigated, the neuromolecular underpinnings remain poorly understood. We tested whether the opioid and dopamine systems involved in reward and motivational processes would be associated with emotional arousal and valence. We used in vivo positron emission tomography to quantify μ-opioid receptor and type 2 dopamine receptor (MOR and D<sub>2</sub>R, respectively) availability in brains of 35 healthy adult females. During subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging carried out to monitor hemodynamic activity, the subjects viewed movie scenes of varying emotional content. Arousal and valence were associated with hemodynamic activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing, including amygdala, thalamus, and superior temporal sulcus. Cerebral MOR availability correlated negatively with the hemodynamic responses to arousing scenes in amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus, whereas no positive correlations were observed in any brain region. D<sub>2</sub>R availability—here reliably quantified only in striatum—was not associated with either arousal or valence. These results suggest that emotional arousal is regulated by the MOR system, and that cerebral MOR availability influences brain activity elicited by arousing stimuli.</span>

<p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) hold great promise for neural repair in cases of CNS injury and neurodegeneration; however, conventional cell-based transplant methods face the challenges of poor survival and inadequate neuronal differentiation. Here, we report an alternative, tissue-based transplantation strategy whereby cerebral organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) were grafted into lesioned mouse cortex. Cerebral organoid transplants exhibited enhanced survival and robust vascularization from host brain as compared to transplants of dissociated neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Engrafted cerebral organoids harbored a large NSC pool and displayed multilineage neurodifferentiation at two and four weeks after grafting. Cerebral organoids therefore represent a promising alternative source to NSCs or fetal tissues for transplantation, as they contain a large set of neuroprogenitors and differentiated neurons in a structured organization. Engrafted cerebral organoids may also offer a unique experimental paradigm for modeling human neurodevelopment and CNS diseases in the context of vascularized cortical tissue.</p>

Abstract<p>World class drum corps require cooperation among performance artists to render precisely synchronized and asynchronized events. For example, drum corps visual aesthetics often feature salient radial and rotational motion displays from color guard. Accordingly, extensive color guard training might predict superior visual timing sensitivity to asynchronies in radial and rotational motion displays. Less intuitively, one might instead predict superior visual timing sensitivity among world class drum corps musicians, who regularly sub-divide musical tempos into brief time units. This prediction arises from the possibility that auditory training transfers cross-modally. Here, we investigated whether precise visual temporal order judgments more strongly align with color guard’s visual training or musicians’ auditory training. To mimic color guard visual displays, stimuli comprised bilateral plaid patterns that radiated or rotated before changing direction asynchronously. Human participants indicated whether the direction changed first on the left or right –a temporal order judgment (TOJ). Twenty-five percussionists, 67 brass players, and 29 color guard from a world class drum corps collectively completed 67,760 visual TOJ trials. Percussionists exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did brass players, who exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did color guard. Group median thresholds spanned an order of magnitude, ranging between 29 milliseconds (percussionists judging rotational asynchronies) and 290 milliseconds (color guard judging radial asynchronies). The results suggest that visual timing can improve more by training cross-modally than intra-modally, even when intra-modal training and testing stimuli closely match. More broadly, pre-existing training histories can provide a unique window into the nervous system’s timing sensitivity.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Optimal cognitive and behavioral performance typically occurs when training conditions closely match testing conditions. This fundamental principle from learning and memory predicts greater visual test performance after visual training than after auditory training. Contrastingly, a fundamental sensory principle –superior temporal precision for auditory versus visual stimuli – predicts better visual test performance after auditory training than after visual training. We observed more precise visual timing among musical experts than among visual experts who had years of visual experience that closely matched the testing stimuli. The musicians’ superior performance suggests that shared neural events mediate the precision of auditory and visual timing. Moreover, these shared neural events provide greater temporal precision than does matching sensory modalities across training and testing contexts.</p>

<p>Auditory nerve single-unit recordings were obtained from two groups of young barn owls (age, between posthatching days 11 and 86) in terminal experiments under two different anesthetic regimes: ketamine (6–11 mg/kg) plus xylazine (~2 mg/kg); or isoflurane (1–1.5%) in oxygen, delivered via artificial respiration. In a second series of minimally invasive experiments, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded in the same four adult barn owls (<i>Tyto alba</i>; age, between 5 and 32 months) under three different anesthetic protocols: ketamine (10 mg/kg) plus xylazine (3 mg/kg), isoflurane (1–1.5%), and sevoflurane (2–3%) in carbogen. Finally, the ABR measurements on adult owls were repeated in terminal experiments including more invasive procedures such as artificial respiration and higher isoflurane dosage. The main finding was a significant deterioration of auditory sensitivity in barn owls under gas anesthesia, at the level of the auditory nerve (i.e., a very peripheral level of the auditory system). The effect was drastic in the young animals that experienced threshold elevations in auditory nerve single-unit responses of ≥20 dB. ABR thresholds assessed repeatedly in experiments on adult owls were also significantly higher under isoflurane and sevoflurane, on average by 7 and 15 dB, compared with ketamine/xylazine. This difference already occurred with minimal dosages and was reversibly enlarged with increased isoflurane concentration. Finally, there was evidence for confounding detrimental effects associated with artificial respiration over many hours, which suggested oxygen toxicity.</p>

<p>Synaptic AMPAR expression controls the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity. An excess of synaptic AMPARs leads to epilepsy in response to seizure-inducible stimulation. The appropriate regulation of AMPARs plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying epilepsy remain unclear. Our previous studies have revealed that a key modification of AMPAR trafficking to and from postsynaptic membranes is the reversible, posttranslational <i>S</i>-palmitoylation at the C-termini of receptors. To clarify the role of palmitoylation-dependent regulation of AMPARs <i>in vivo</i>, we generated GluA1 palmitoylation-deficient (Cys811 to Ser substitution) knock-in mice. These mutant male mice showed elevated seizure susceptibility and seizure-induced neuronal activity without impairments in synaptic transmission, gross brain structure, or behavior at the basal level. Disruption of the palmitoylation site was accompanied by upregulated GluA1 phosphorylation at Ser831, but not at Ser845, in the hippocampus and increased GluA1 protein expression in the cortex. Furthermore, GluA1 palmitoylation suppressed excessive spine enlargement above a certain size after LTP. Our findings indicate that an abnormality in GluA1 palmitoylation can lead to hyperexcitability in the cerebrum, which negatively affects the maintenance of network stability, resulting in epileptic seizures.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> AMPARs predominantly mediate excitatory synaptic transmission. AMPARs are regulated in a posttranslational, palmitoylation-dependent manner in excitatory synapses of the mammalian brain. Reversible palmitoylation dynamically controls synaptic expression and intracellular trafficking of the receptors. Here, we generated GluA1 palmitoylation-deficient knock-in mice to clarify the role of AMPAR palmitoylation <i>in vivo</i>. We showed that an abnormality in GluA1 palmitoylation led to hyperexcitability, resulting in epileptic seizure. This is the first identification of a specific palmitoylated protein critical for the seizure-suppressing process. Our data also provide insight into how predicted receptors such as AMPARs can effectively preserve network stability in the brain. Furthermore, these findings help to define novel key targets for developing anti-epileptic drugs.</p>

The mutant protein has an HA tag that has been stained with red fluorescence to localize the protein, revealing red filaments in the nucleus and in the surrounding cytoplasm. Filament structures are altered by this L108M mutation in the BTB domain of KCTD7. The nucleus of each cell is stained blue.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The present study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of coadministration of fingolimod with alteplase in acute ischemic stroke patients in a delayed time window.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This was a prospective, randomized, open‐label, blinded endpoint clinical trial, enrolling patients with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery proximal occlusion within 4.5 to 6 hours from symptom onset. Patients were randomly assigned to receive alteplase alone or alteplase with fingolimod. All patients underwent pretreatment and 24‐hour noncontrast computed tomography (CT)/perfusion CT/CT angiography. The coprimary endpoints were the decrease of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores over 24 hours and the favorable shift of modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) distribution at day 90. Exploratory outcomes included vessel recanalization, anterograde reperfusion, and retrograde reperfusion of collateral flow.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Each treatment group included 23 patients. Compared with alteplase alone, patients receiving fingolimod plus alteplase exhibited better early clinical improvement at 24 hours and a favorable shift of mRS distribution at day 90. In addition, patients who received fingolimod and alteplase exhibited a greater reduction in the perfusion lesion accompanied by suppressed infarct growth by 24 hours. Fingolimod in conjunction with alteplase significantly improved anterograde reperfusion of downstream territory and prevented the failure of retrograde reperfusion from collateral circulation.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Fingolimod may enhance the efficacy of alteplase administration in the 4.5‐ to 6‐hour time window in patients with a proximal cerebral arterial occlusion and salvageable penumbral tissue by promoting both anterograde reperfusion and retrograde collateral flow. These findings are instructive for the design of future trials of recanalization therapies in extended time windows. Ann Neurol 2018;84:725–736</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Several small case series identified <i>KCTD7</i> mutations in patients with a rare autosomal recessive disorder designated progressive myoclonic epilepsy (EPM3) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN14). Despite the name KCTD (potassium channel tetramerization domain), KCTD protein family members lack predicted channel domains. We sought to translate insight gained from yeast studies to uncover disease mechanisms associated with deficiencies in KCTD7 of unknown function.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Novel <i>KCTD7</i> variants in new and published patients were assessed for disease causality using genetic analyses, cell‐based functional assays of patient fibroblasts and knockout yeast, and electron microscopy of patient samples.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with <i>KCTD7</i> mutations can exhibit movement disorders or developmental regression before seizure onset, and are distinguished from similar disorders by an earlier age of onset. Although most published <i>KCTD7</i> patient variants were excluded from a genome sequence database of normal human variations, most newly identified patient variants are present in this database, potentially challenging disease causality. However, genetic analysis and impaired biochemical interactions with cullin 3 support a causal role for patient <i>KCTD7</i> variants, suggesting deleterious alleles of <i>KCTD7</i> and other rare disease variants may be underestimated. Both patient‐derived fibroblasts and yeast lacking Whi2 with sequence similarity to KCTD7 have impaired autophagy consistent with brain pathology.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Biallelic <i>KCTD7</i> mutations define a neurodegenerative disorder with lipofuscin and lipid droplet accumulation but without defining features of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis or lysosomal storage disorders. <i>KCTD7</i> deficiency appears to cause an underlying autophagy‐lysosome defect conserved in yeast, thereby assigning a biological role for KCTD7.

<p>
   <i>NBEA</i> is a candidate gene for autism, and de novo variants have been reported in neurodevelopmental disease (NDD) cohorts. However, <i>NBEA</i> has not been rigorously evaluated as a disease gene, and associated phenotypes have not been delineated. We identified 24 de novo <i>NBEA</i> variants in patients with NDD, establishing <i>NBEA</i> as an NDD gene. Most patients had epilepsy with onset in the first few years of life, often characterized by generalized seizure types, including myoclonic and atonic seizures. Our data show a broader phenotypic spectrum than previously described, including a myoclonic‐astatic epilepsy–like phenotype in a subset of patients. Ann Neurol 2018;84:796–803</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recent availability of amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) has provided us with a unique opportunity to measure the association of systemic vascular health with brain health after accounting for the impact of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologies. We wanted to quantify early cerebrovascular health–related magnetic resonance imaging brain measures (structure, perfusion, microstructural integrity) and evaluate their utility as a biomarker for cerebrovascular health.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used 2 independent samples (discovery, n = 390; validation, n = 1,035) of individuals, aged ≥ 60 years, along the cognitive continuum with imaging from the population‐based sample of Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We ascertained vascular health by summing up recently existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from health care records (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke). Using multiple regression models, we quantified associations between CMC and brain health after accounting for age, sex, education/occupation, and AD burden (from amyloid and tau PET).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Systemic vascular health was associated with medial temporal lobe thinning, widespread cerebral hypoperfusion, and loss of microstructural integrity in several white matter tracts including the corpus callosum and fornix. Further investigations suggested that microstructural integrity of the genu of the corpus callosum was suitable for assessing prodromal cerebrovascular health, had similar distributions in the discovery and independent validation datasets, and predicted cognitive performance above and beyond amyloid deposition.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Systemic vascular health has significant impact on brain structure and function. Quantifying prodromal cerebrovascular health–related brain measures that are independent of AD pathology–related changes has great utility for cognitive aging. Ann Neurol 2018;84:713–724</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a slowly progressive disease with weakness of bulbar and extremity muscles. There is no curative treatment for the disease, but several clinical trials have been conducted over the past years. The results from these trials have uncovered a great need to develop quantitative, reliable outcome measures. In this study, we prospectively investigated disease progression over 18 months in 29 patients with genetically confirmed SBMA, using quantitative outcome measures, including Dixon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used MRI to assess changes in muscle fat content and stationary dynamometry to assess changes in muscle strength. Disease progression was also investigated with the SBMA functional rating scale, bulbar rating scale, 6‐minute walk test, and blood samples, among others.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Mean muscle fat content, muscle strength in knee extensors, handgrip strength, walking distance, and creatinine levels changed significantly. Mean muscle fat content increased by 2 ± 1.25%, and knee extension strength decreased from 83 ± 60 to 76 ± 56Nm, handgrip strength from 31 ± 13 to 29 ± 13kg, walking distance from 362 ± 216 to 336 ± 219m, and creatinine level from 58 ± 21 to 54 ± 20 μmol/l. Functional rating scores did not change.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The present study demonstrates a slow and steady disease progression in SBMA. Dixon MRI detected increases in muscle fat content in all investigated muscles and is therefore a suitable candidate for an outcome measure in natural history or treatment studies in SBMA. The 6‐minute walk test and handgrip strength also seem to be reliable outcome measures for SBMA. Ann Neurol 2018;84:762–773</p>

How does our brain give rise to passive or active defensive responses when we are confronted with threats? In a recent study in Cell, Terburg, Scheggia and colleagues (Terburg et al., 2018) show that, in both humans and rats, a pathway originating from the amygdala can help suppress passive responses, thereby facilitating active responses to imminent threats.

The cerebellum, a brain structure historically considered to be important for motor coordination, is often overlooked in terms of its role in higher-order control processing. Using resting-state functional connectivity and precision mapping, Marek et al. (2018) illuminate the cerebellum as an important source of individual variation in brain function and cognition.

In the hippocampus, gamma power modulation by the theta rhythm is interpreted as the signature of temporally coordinated inputs that reflect ongoing processing. In this issue of Neuron, Lopes-Dos-Santos et al. (2018) develop a new methodology demonstrating that theta cycles can be viewed as individual computational units characterized by typical gamma profiles.

Using ex vivo patch-clamp recordings, optogenetics, and chemogenetics, Williams and Holtmaat dissect the circuits underlying sensory-driven LTP in the cortex. This reveals a circuit motif in which higher-order thalamocortical input gates plasticity of intracortical synapses via VIP-mediated disinhibition.

Fletcher and Williams demonstrate that neuronal computations are determined by neocortical location. Dendritic integration in the primary visual cortex is governed by neuronal morphology and biophysics, creating a gradient of information processing that challenges the idea of stereotyped microcircuit operation.

Reddan et al. demonstrate that threat responses can be extinguished through imagined simulations of the conditioned stimuli. Like real extinction, imagined extinction engages the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and related perceptual cortices. Nucleus accumbens activity predicts an individual’s ability to successfully extinguish via imagination.

<p>by Ryan R. Wick, Louise M. Judd, Kathryn E. Holt</p>

Multiplexing, the simultaneous sequencing of multiple barcoded DNA samples on a single flow cell, has made Oxford Nanopore sequencing cost-effective for small genomes. However, it depends on the ability to sort the resulting sequencing reads by barcode, and current demultiplexing tools fail to classify many reads. Here we present Deepbinner, a tool for Oxford Nanopore demultiplexing that uses a deep neural network to classify reads based on the raw electrical read signal. This ‘signal-space’ approach allows for greater accuracy than existing ‘base-space’ tools (Albacore and Porechop) for which signals must first be converted to DNA base calls, itself a complex problem that can introduce noise into the barcode sequence. To assess Deepbinner and existing tools, we performed multiplex sequencing on 12 amplicons chosen for their distinguishability. This allowed us to establish a ground truth classification for each read based on internal sequence alone. Deepbinner had the lowest rate of unclassified reads (7.8%) and the highest demultiplexing precision (98.5% of classified reads were correctly assigned). It can be used alone (to maximise the number of classified reads) or in conjunction with other demultiplexers (to maximise precision and minimise false positive classifications). We also found cross-sample chimeric reads (0.3%) and evidence of barcode switching (0.3%) in our dataset, which likely arise during library preparation and may be detrimental for quantitative studies that use multiplexing. Deepbinner is open source (GPLv3) and available at https://github.com/rrwick/Deepbinner.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zSKzkzc7_uc" width="1" />

<p>by Yusuf Ozuysal, David B. Kastner, Stephen A. Baccus</p>

To transmit information efficiently in a changing environment, the retina adapts to visual contrast by adjusting its gain, latency and mean response. Additionally, the temporal frequency selectivity, or bandwidth changes to encode the absolute intensity when the stimulus environment is noisy, and intensity differences when noise is low. We show that the On pathway of On-Off retinal amacrine and ganglion cells is required to change temporal bandwidth but not other adaptive properties. This remarkably specific adaptive mechanism arises from differential effects of contrast on the On and Off pathways. We analyzed a biophysical model fit only to a cell’s membrane potential, and verified pharmacologically that it accurately revealed the two pathways. We conclude that changes in bandwidth arise mostly from differences in synaptic threshold in the two pathways, rather than synaptic release dynamics as has previously been proposed to underlie contrast adaptation. Different efficient codes are selected by different thresholds in two independently adapting neural pathways.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sklOjZc6RaM" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Decision making often requires weighing costs and benefits of different options that vary in terms of reward magnitude and uncertainty. Previous studies using pharmacological inactivations have shown that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) pathway promotes choice towards larger/riskier rewards. Neural activity in BLA and NAc show distinct, phasic changes in firing prior to choice and following action outcomes, yet, how these temporally-discrete patterns of activity within BLA-NAc circuitry influence choice is unclear. We assessed how optogenetic silencing of BLA terminals in the NAc altered action selection during probabilistic decision making. Rats received intra-BLA infusions of viruses encoding the inhibitory opsin eArchT and were well-trained on a probabilistic discounting task, where they chose between smaller/certain rewards and larger rewards delivered in a probabilistic manner, with the odds of obtaining the larger reward changing over a session (50-12.5%). During testing, activity of BLA&amp;cenveo_unknown_entity_wingdings_F0E0;NAc inputs were suppressed with 4-7 s pulses of light delivered via optic fibers into the NAc during discrete task events: prior to choice or after choice outcomes. Inhibition prior to choice reduced selection of the preferred option, suggesting that during deliberation, BLA-NAc activity biases choice towards preferred rewards. Inhibition during reward omissions increased risky choice during the low-probability block, indicating that activity after non-rewarded actions serves to modify subsequent choice. In contrast, silencing during rewarded outcomes did not reliably affect choice. These data demonstrate how patterns of activity in BLA-NAc circuitry convey different types of information that guide action selection in situations involving reward uncertainty.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Amygdala projections to the nucleus accumbens form a neural circuit that has been implicated in guiding risk-related decision making, and dysfunction in this circuitry is thought to underlie aberrant decision making observed a variety of psychiatric illnesses. The present study used temporally-discrete optogenetic inhibition to identify how activity in amygdala inputs to the accumbens, during different phases of the decision process, promotes optimal decision making. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms through which these circuits contribute to normal and abnormal decisions involving reward uncertainty.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>Current theories suggest that the ability to control the body and to predict its associated sensory consequences is key for skilled motor behavior. It is also suggested that these abilities need both be updated when the mapping between motor commands and sensory consequences is altered. Here we challenge this view by investigating the transfer of adaptation to rotated visual feedback between one task in which human participants had to control a cursor with their hand in order to track a moving target, and another in which they had to predict with their eyes the visual consequences of their hand movement on the cursor. Hand and eye tracking performances were evaluated respectively through cursor-target and gaze-cursor distance. Results reveal a striking dissociation: although prior adaptation of hand tracking greatly facilitates eye tracking, adaptation of eye tracking does not transfer to hand tracking. We conclude that although the update of control is associated with the update of prediction, prediction can be updated independently of control. To account for this pattern of results we propose that task demands mediate the update of prediction and control. Although a joint update of prediction and control seemed mandatory for success in our hand tracking task, the update of control was only facultative for success in our eye tracking task. More generally those results promote the view that prediction and control are mediated by separate neural processes and suggest that people can learn to predict movement consequences without necessarily promoting their ability to control these movements.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Current theories suggest that accurately predicting the sensory consequences of one’s actions is central for perception, awareness of action, and motor learning. In the latter case, it is assumed that prediction errors are used to train the controller that transforms our desired sensory consequences into motor commands. Here we show that, following exposure to biased hand visual feedback, people can update their ability to predict visual consequences of hand movements without necessarily improving their ability to control these movements. This work challenges the view that the joint update of prediction and control is mandatory when facing a change in the mapping between motor commands and sensory consequences. Instead we propose that task demands mediate the update of prediction and control.</p>

Abstract<p>The nervous system seamlessly integrates perception and action. This ability is essential for stable representation of and appropriate responses to the external environment. How the sensorimotor integration underlying this ability occurs at the level of individual neurons is of keen interest. In <i>C. elegans,</i> RIA interneurons receive input from sensory pathways and have reciprocal connections with head motor neurons. RIA simultaneously encodes both head orientation and sensory stimuli, which may allow it to integrate these two signals to detect the spatial distribution of stimuli across head sweeps and generate directional head responses. Here, we show that blocking synaptic release from RIA disrupts head orientation behaviors in response to unilaterally presented stimuli. We found that sensory encoding in RIA is gated according to head orientation. This dependence on head orientation is independent of motor encoding in RIA, suggesting a second, posture-dependent pathway upstream of RIA. This gating mechanism may allow RIA to selectively attend to stimuli that are asymmetric across head sweeps. Attractive odor removal during head bends triggers rapid head withdrawal in the opposite direction. Unlike sensory encoding, this directional response is dependent on motor inputs to and synaptic output from RIA. Together, these results suggest that RIA is part of a sensorimotor pathway that is dynamically regulated according to head orientation at two levels: the first is a gate that filters sensory representations in RIA, and the second is a switch that routes RIA synaptic output to dorsal or ventral head motor neurons.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Simple head orientation behaviors in <i>C. elegans</i> provide an opportunity to dissect sensorimotor integration at the cellular and subcellular levels. We describe a single interneuron that coordinates posture, sensation, and movement to detect the spatial distribution of stimuli and direct motor output to guide navigation behavior. Our findings underscore the fundamental role of neural mechanisms for integrating sensory input into ongoing behavior.</p>

Abstract
<p>GABAergic cells constitute 20–40% of the cells that project from the inferior colliculus [(IC) a midbrain auditory hub] to the medial geniculate body [(MG) the main auditory nucleus of the thalamus]. Four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells have been identified based on their association with perineuronal nets (PNs) and dense rings of axosomatic terminals expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2 rings). These subtypes differ in their soma size and distribution within the IC. Based on previous work emphasizing large GABAergic cells as the origin of GABAergic IC–MG projections, we hypothesized that GABAergic IC cells surrounded by PNs and VGLUT2 rings, which tend to have larger somas, were more likely to project to the MG than smaller cells lacking these extracellular markers. Here, we injected retrograde tract tracers into the MG of guinea pigs of either sex and analyzed retrogradely labeled GABAergic cells in the ipsilateral IC for soma size and association with PNs and/or VGLUT2 rings. We found a range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC–MG pathway, which were reflective of the full range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC. Further, we found that all four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells participate in the IC–MG pathway, and that GABAergic cells lacking PNs and VGLUT2 rings were more prevalent within the pathway than would be expected based on their overall prevalence in the IC. These results may provide an anatomical substrate for the multiple roles of inhibition in the IC–MG pathway, which have emerged in electrophysiological studies.</p>

The robust computational design of functional proteins has the potential to deeply impact translational research and broaden our understanding of the determinants of protein function and stability. The low success rates of computational design protocols and the extensive in vitro optimization often required, highlight the challenge of designing proteins that perform essential biochemical functions, such as binding or catalysis. One of the most simplistic approaches for the design of function is to adopt functional motifs in naturally occurring proteins and transplant them to computationally designed proteins. The structural complexity of the functional motif largely determines how readily one can find host protein structures that are “designable”, meaning that are likely to present the functional motif in the desired conformation. One promising route to enhance the “designability” of protein structures is to allow backbone flexibility. Here, we present a computational approach that couples conformational folding with sequence design to embed functional motifs into heterologous proteins—Rosetta Functional Folding and Design (FunFolDes). We performed extensive computational benchmarks, where we observed that the enforcement of functional requirements resulted in designs distant from the global energetic minimum of the protein. An observation consistent with several experimental studies that have revealed function-stability tradeoffs. To test the design capabilities of FunFolDes we transplanted two viral epitopes into distant structural templates including one <i>de novo</i> “functionless” fold, which represent two typical challenges where the designability problem arises. The designed proteins were experimentally characterized showing high binding affinities to monoclonal antibodies, making them valuable candidates for vaccine design endeavors. Overall, we present an accessible strategy to repurpose old protein folds for new functions. This may lead to important improvements on the computational design of proteins, with structurally complex functional sites, that can perform elaborate biochemical functions related to binding and catalysis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7gRf2xrFcak" width="1" />

<p>by Grant Hartung, Claudia Vesel, Ryan Morley, Ali Alaraj, John Sled, David Kleinfeld, Andreas Linninger</p>

Recent advances in modeling oxygen supply to cortical brain tissue have begun to elucidate the functional mechanisms of neurovascular coupling. While the principal mechanisms of blood flow regulation after neuronal firing are generally known, mechanistic hemodynamic simulations cannot yet pinpoint the exact spatial and temporal coordination between the network of arteries, arterioles, capillaries and veins for the entire brain. Because of the potential significance of blood flow and oxygen supply simulations for illuminating spatiotemporal regulation inside the cortical microanatomy, there is a need to create mathematical models of the entire cerebral circulation with realistic anatomical detail. Our hypothesis is that an anatomically accurate reconstruction of the cerebrocirculatory architecture will inform about possible regulatory mechanisms of the neurovascular interface. In this article, we introduce large-scale networks of the murine cerebral circulation spanning the Circle of Willis, main cerebral arteries connected to the pial network down to the microcirculation in the capillary bed. Several multiscale models were generated from state-of-the-art neuroimaging data. Using a vascular network construction algorithm, the entire circulation of the middle cerebral artery was synthesized. Blood flow simulations indicate a consistent trend of higher hematocrit in deeper cortical layers, while surface layers with shorter vascular path lengths seem to carry comparatively lower red blood cell (RBC) concentrations. Moreover, the variability of RBC flux decreases with cortical depth. These results support the notion that plasma skimming serves a self-regulating function for maintaining uniform oxygen perfusion to neurons irrespective of their location in the blood supply hierarchy. Our computations also demonstrate the practicality of simulating blood flow for large portions of the mouse brain with existing computer resources. The efficient simulation of blood flow throughout the entire middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory is a promising milestone towards the final aim of predicting blood flow patterns for the entire brain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9OY-184gvy8" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Microglia are dynamic immune cells of the central nervous system, and their morphology is commonly used as a readout of cellular function. However, current morphological analysis techniques rely on either tracing of cells or 2D projection analysis, which are time-consuming, subject to bias, and may ignore important three-dimensional (3D) information. Therefore, we have created 3DMorph, a Matlab-based script that analyzes microglial morphology from 3D data. The program initially requires input of threshold levels, cell size expectations, and preferred methods of skeletonization. This makes 3DMorph easily scalable and adaptable to different imaging parameters or cell types. After these settings are defined, the program is completely automatic and can batch process files without user input. Output data includes cell volume, territorial volume, branch length, number of endpoints and branch points, and average distance between cells. We show that 3DMorph is accurate when compared to manual tracing, with significantly decreased user input time. Importantly, 3DMorph is capable of processing <i>in vivo</i> microglial morphology, as well as other 3D branching cell types, from mouse cranial windows or acute hippocampal slices. Therefore, we present a novel, user-friendly, scalable, and semi-automatic method of analyzing cell morphology in 3 dimensions. This method should improve the accuracy of cell measurements, remove user bias between conditions, increase reproducibility between experimenters and labs, and reduce user input time. We provide this open source code on GitHub so that it is free and accessible to all investigators.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Microglial morphology is often considered to be an indicator of cellular activity, however current techniques to analyze morphology either lose valuable z-dimension information or are time intensive to perform. Therefore, we introduce 3DMorph, a MATLAB-based program that semi-automatically processes individual microglial morphology from overlapping 3D clusters, improving accuracy and processing time compared to current tools. 3DMorph is straightforward to use and adaptable to many imaging or experimental parameters. Once user settings are selected, 3DMorph can run in batch mode to automatically process multiple files. We validate 3DMorph against current techniques, and demonstrate the ability to detect differences in microglial morphologies from different <i>ex vivo</i> experimental conditions, as well as from <i>in vivo</i> data, and images of other branching cell types.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0137-18.2018v1?rss=1">Development of GABAergic inputs is not altered in early maturation of adult born dentate granule neurons in Fragile X mice</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation and the most common known cause of autism. Loss of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in mice (<i>Fmr1</i> KO) leads to altered synaptic and circuit maturation in the hippocampus that are correlated with alterations in hippocampal-dependent behaviors. Previous studies have demonstrated that loss of FMRP increased the rate of proliferation of progenitor cells and altered their fate specification in adult <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. While these studies clearly demonstrate a role for FMRP in adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, it is not known whether the functional synaptic maturation and integration of adult born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) into hippocampal circuits is affected in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. Here we used retroviral labeling to birthdate abDGCs in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice which allowed us to perform targeted patch clamp recording to measure the development of synaptic inputs to these neurons at precise time points after differentiation. The frequency and amplitude of spontaneous GABAergic events increased over the first three weeks after differentiation, however this normal development of GABAergic synapses was not altered in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. Furthermore, the relatively depolarized GABA reversal potential (<i>E<sub>GABA</sub></i>) in immature abDGCs was unaffected by loss of FMRP as was the development of dendritic arbor of the adult generated neurons. These studies systematically characterized the functional development of abDGCs during the first four weeks after differentiation and demonstrate that the maturation of GABAergic synaptic inputs to these neurons is not grossly affected by the loss of FMRP.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Loss of FMRP causes Fragile X Syndrome, a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that causes multiple alterations in the development of synapses and neurons. Previous studies have described a role for FMRP in neurogenesis and hippocampal-dependent conditioning tasks linked to neurogenesis. This study systematically assessed the functional development of GABAergic inputs to adult born dentate granule cells during the first four weeks after differentiation of adult neural stem cells in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice.</p>

Covalent modification of proteins by ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains is one of the most prevalent post-translational modifications in eukaryotes. Different types of ubiquitin chains are assumed to selectively signal respectively modified proteins for different fates. In support of this hypothesis, structural studies have shown that the eight possible ubiquitin dimers adopt different conformations. However, at least in some cases, these structures cannot sufficiently explain the molecular basis of the selective signaling mechanisms. This indicates that the available structures represent only a few distinct conformations within the entire conformational space adopted by a ubiquitin dimer. Here, molecular simulations on different levels of resolution can complement the structural information. We have combined exhaustive coarse grained and atomistic simulations of all eight possible ubiquitin dimers with a suitable dimensionality reduction technique and a new method to characterize protein-protein interfaces and the conformational landscape of protein conjugates. We found that ubiquitin dimers exhibit characteristic linkage type-dependent properties in solution, such as interface stability and the character of contacts between the subunits, which can be directly correlated with experimentally observed linkage-specific properties.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6aIN2Kla9rU" width="1" />

<p>by Joana C. Xavier, Kiran Raosaheb Patil, Isabel Rocha</p>

Essential metabolic reactions are shaping constituents of metabolic networks, enabling viable and distinct phenotypes across diverse life forms. Here we analyse and compare modelling predictions of essential metabolic functions with experimental data and thereby identify core metabolic pathways in prokaryotes. Simulations of 15 manually curated genome-scale metabolic models were integrated with 36 large-scale gene essentiality datasets encompassing a wide variety of species of bacteria and archaea. Conservation of metabolic genes was estimated by analysing 79 representative genomes from all the branches of the prokaryotic tree of life. We find that essentiality patterns reflect phylogenetic relations both for modelling and experimental data, which correlate highly at the pathway level. Genes that are essential for several species tend to be highly conserved as opposed to non-essential genes which may be conserved or not. The tRNA-charging module is highlighted as ancestral and with high centrality in the networks, followed closely by cofactor metabolism, pointing to an early information processing system supplied by organic cofactors. The results, which point to model improvements and also indicate faults in the experimental data, should be relevant to the study of centrality in metabolic networks and ancient metabolism but also to metabolic engineering with prokaryotes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YfypktDVdWM" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Microglia, the resident immune cells in the central nervous system, play multiple roles during development. In the embryonic cerebral wall, microglia modulate the functions of neural stem/progenitor cells through their distribution in regions undergoing cell proliferation and/or differentiation. Previous studies using CX3CR1-GFP transgenic mice demonstrated that microglia extensively survey these regions. To simultaneously visualize microglia and neural-lineage cells that interact with each other, we applied the <i>in utero</i> electroporation (IUE) technique, which has been widely used for gene-transfer in neurodevelopmental studies, to CX3CR1-GFP mice (males and females). However, we unexpectedly faced a technical problem: although microglia are normally distributed homogeneously throughout the mid-embryonic cortical wall with only limited luminal entry, the intraventricular presence of exogenously derived plasmid DNAs induced microglia to accumulate along the apical surface of the cortex and aggregate in the choroid plexus. This effect was independent of capillary needle puncture of the brain wall or application of electrical pulses. The microglial response occurred at plasmid DNA concentrations lower than those routinely used for IUE, and was mediated by activation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), an innate immune sensor that recognizes unmethylated cytosine-phosphate guanosine (CpG) motifs abundant in microbial DNA. Administration of plasmid DNA together with oligonucleotide (ODN) 2088, the antagonist of TLR9, restored the normal (dispersed) intramural localization of microglia and decreased luminal accumulation of these cells. Thus, via TLR9, intraventricular plasmid DNA administration causes aberrant distribution of embryonic microglia, suggesting that the behavior of microglia in brain primordia subjected to IUE should be carefully interpreted.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Microglia have been recently shown to play multiple roles in the embryonic brain. In the trials for labeling neural-lineage cells using IUE technique in CX3CR1-GFP mice, in which microglia express GFP, to achieve dual live-imaging of these cell types, we unexpectedly found that intra-ventricular administration of plasmid DNA caused microglial aberrant accumulation along the luminal surface of the cerebral wall and in the choroid plexus. Notably, Co-administration of TLR9 antagonist into the ventricle together with plasmid DNA restored the normal dispersed localization of microglia in the mid-embryonic (E14) cortex, suggesting that massive microglial accumulation induced by plasmid DNA is primarily mediated by TLR9 activation. Our findings have implications for the application of IUE to investigate embryonic microglia.</p>

Abstract<p>Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of spinal motor neurons resulting in variable degrees of muscular wasting and weakness. It is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the <i>Survival Motor Neuron</i> (<i>SMN1</i>) gene. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>) mutants lacking <i>SMN</i> recapitulate several aspects of the disease including impaired movement and shorted life span. We examined whether genes previously implicated in life span extension conferred benefits to <i>C. elegans</i> lacking SMN. We find that reducing DAF-2/insulin receptor signaling activity promotes survival and improves locomotor behavior in this <i>C. elegans</i> model of SMA. The locomotor dysfunction in <i>C. elegans</i> lacking <i>SMN</i> correlated with structural and functional abnormalities in GABAergic neuromuscular junctions. Moreover, we demonstrated that reduction in DAF-2 signaling reversed these abnormalities. Remarkably, enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission alone was able to correct the locomotor dysfunction. Our work indicated that an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory activity within motor circuits and underlies motor system dysfunction in this SMA model. Interventions aimed at restoring the balance of excitatory/inhibitory activity in motor circuits could be of benefit to individuals with SMA.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> SMA is a pediatric motor neuron disease resulting from the loss of the SMN protein. While great effort has been expended on interventions aimed at increasing levels of compensatory SMN1, identification of genes that modify the SMA phenotype has lagged. Here we undertook a targeted genetic screen to identify SMA disease suppressors. We demonstrated that reduced insulin/insulin-like signaling is beneficial for not only longevity but also locomotor activity in SMA worm models. Our results from anatomical, functional, and genetic studies show that the impairment of GABAergic neurotransmission contributes to locomotor dysfunction in <i>smn-1</i> null worms. Enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission alone can correct the locomotor dysfunction. This work leads to new understanding of disease pathogenesis and opens up new opportunities for therapy.</p>

Abstract<p>Treatments to stop gray matter degeneration are needed to prevent progressive disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). We tested whether inhibiting mixed-lineage kinases (MLKs), which can drive inflammatory microglial activation and neuronal degeneration, could protect hippocampal synapses in C57BL/6 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a disease model that recapitulates the excitatory synaptic injury that occurs widely within the gray matter in MS. URMC-099, a broad spectrum MLK inhibitor with additional activity against LRRK2 and other kinases, prevented loss of PSD95-positive postsynaptic structures, shifted activated microglia toward a less inflammatory phenotype, and reversed deficits in hippocampal-dependent contextual fear conditioning in EAE mice when administered after the onset of motor symptoms. A narrow spectrum inhibitor designed to be highly selective for MLK3 failed to protect synapses in EAE hippocampi, and could not rescue cultured neurons from trophic deprivation in an <i>in vitro</i> model of MLK-driven neuronal degeneration. These results suggest that URMC-099 may have potential as a neuroprotective treatment in MS, and demonstrate that a broad spectrum of inhibition against a combination of MLK and other kinases is more effective in neuroinflammatory disease than selectively targeting a single kinase.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Multiple sclerosis (MS) causes progressive neurologic decline that correlates with damage to gray matter in the brain, and is not stopped by current treatments. We used a mouse model of MS, in which gray matter injury is associated with inflammatory molecules produced by activated microglia, to test novel neuroprotective treatments. URMC-099, a mixed-lineage kinase (MLK) inhibitor that has anti-inflammatory and direct neuroprotective properties, prevented loss of hippocampal synapses and reversed deficits in learning and memory in a mouse model of MS. An MLK inhibitor with a narrower range of specificity was not effective, suggesting that combination kinase inhibition with URMC-099 may have potential as a neuroprotective treatment in MS.</p>

Abstract
<p>Memory formation is a protracted process that initially involves the hippocampus and becomes increasingly dependent on the cortex over time, but the mechanisms of this transfer are unclear. We recently showed that hippocampal depletion of the histone variant H2A.Z enhances both recent and remote memories, but the use of virally mediated depletion reduced H2A.Z levels throughout testing, making its temporally specific function unclear. Given the lack of drugs that target histone variants, we tested existing drugs for efficacy against H2A.Z based on their targeting of known H2A.Z regulators. The Tip60 (part of H2A.Z deposition complex) inhibitor Nu9056 reduced H2A.Z binding, whereas the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin-A increased H2A.Z acetylation without influencing total H2A.Z in cultured hippocampal neurons. Tip60 (but not HDAC) inhibition 23 h after learning enhanced remote (tested at 7 d) and not recent (tested at 24 h) contextual fear memory in mice. In contrast, Tip60 inhibition 30 d after learning impaired recall of remote memory after 1 h, but protected the memory from further decline 24 h later. These data provide the first evidence of a delayed postlearning role for histone variants in supporting memory transfer during systems consolidation.</p>

Adaptation to the ever-changing world is critical for survival, and our brains are particularly tuned to remember events that differ from previous experiences. Novel experiences induce dopamine release in the hippocampus, a process which promotes memory persistence. While axons from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were generally thought to be the exclusive source of hippocampal dopamine, recent studies have demonstrated that noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) corelease noradrenaline and dopamine in the hippocampus and that their dopamine release boosts memory retention as well.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Clarifying learning-induced synaptic plasticity in hippocampal circuits is critical for understanding hippocampal mechanisms of memory acquisition and storage. Many in vitro studies have demonstrated learning-associated plasticity at hippocampal synapses. However, as a neural basis of memory encoding, the nature of synaptic plasticity underlying hippocampal neuronal responses to memorized stimulation remains elusive. Using in vivo whole-cell recording in anaesthetized adult rats and mice, we investigated synaptic activity of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) in response to a flash of visual stimulation as the conditioned stimulus (CS) in associative fear conditioning. We found that shortly (&lt;3 days) after conditioning, excitatory synaptic responses and spiking responses to the flash CS emerged in a large number (~70%) of CA1 PCs, a neuronal population previously unresponsive to the flash before conditioning. The learning-induced CA1 excitatory responsiveness was further indicated to result from postsynaptic unsilencing at flash-associated silent synapses, with NMDA receptor-gated responses we recently reported in naive animals. Our findings suggest that associative fear learning can induce excitatory responsiveness to the memorized CS in a large population of CA1 neurons, via a process of postsynaptic unsilencing at CA1 silent synapses, which may be critical for hippocampal acquisition and storage of associative memory.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The characterization of the functional significance of interindividual variation in brain morphometry is a core aim of cognitive neuroscience. Prior research has focused on interindividual variation at the level of regional brain measures thus overlooking the fact that each individual brain is a person-specific ensemble of interdependent regions. To expand this line of inquiry we introduce the person-based similarity index (PBSI) for brain morphometry. The conceptual unit of the PBSI is the individual person’s brain structural profile which considers all relevant morphometric measures as features of a single vector. In 2 independent cohorts (total of 1756 healthy participants), we demonstrate the foundational validity of this approach by affirming that the PBSI scores for subcortical volume and cortical thickness in healthy individuals differ between men and women, are heritable, and robust to variation in neuroimaging parameters, sample composition, and regional brain morphometry. Moreover, the PBSI scores correlate with age, body mass index, and fluid intelligence. Collectively, these results suggest that the person-based measures of brain morphometry are biologically and functionally meaningful and have the potential to advance the study of human variation in multivariate brain imaging phenotypes in healthy and clinical populations.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Adolescence is marked by increased vulnerability to mental disorders and maladaptive behaviors, including anorexia nervosa. Food-restriction (FR) stress evokes foraging, which translates to increased wheel running exercise (EX) for caged rodents, a maladaptive behavior, since it does not improve food access and exacerbates weight loss. While almost all adolescent rodents increase EX following FR, some then become resilient by suppressing EX by the second–fourth FR day, which minimizes weight loss. We asked whether GABAergic plasticity in the hippocampus may underlie this gain in resilience. In vitro slice physiology revealed doubling of pyramidal neurons’ GABA response in the dorsal hippocampus of food-restricted animals with wheel access (FR + EX for 4 days), but without increase of mIPSC amplitudes. mIPSC frequency increased by 46%, but electron microscopy revealed no increase in axosomatic GABAergic synapse number onto pyramidal cells and only a modest increase (26%) of GABAergic synapse lengths. These changes suggest increase of vesicular release probability and extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and unsilencing of GABAergic synapses. GABAergic synapse lengths correlated with individual’s suppression of wheel running and weight loss. These analyses indicate that EX can have dual roles—exacerbate weight loss but also promote resilience to some by dampening hippocampal excitability.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The human brain undergoes dramatic structural changes during childhood that co-occur with behavioral development. These age-related changes are documented for the brain’s gray matter and white matter. However, their interrelation is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated age-related effects in cortical thickness (CT) and in cortical surface area (SA) as parts of the gray matter volume as well as age effects in <span style="font-style: italic;">T</span><sub>1</sub> relaxation times in the white matter. Data from <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 170 children between the ages of 3 and 7 years contributed to the sample. We found a high spatial overlap of age-related correlations between SA and <span style="font-style: italic;">T</span><sub>1</sub> relaxation times of the corresponding white matter connections, but no such relation between SA and CT. These results indicate that during childhood the developmental expansion of the cortical surface goes hand-in-hand with age-related increase of white matter fiber connections terminating in the cortical surface.</span>
