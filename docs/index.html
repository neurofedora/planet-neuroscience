">Sequential coupling of sleep oscillations enables concept-neuron reactivation and supports information flow across the human hippocampal-cortical circuit</a></h4>

              
                Effective memory consolidation during sleep is thought to rely on the transfer of reactivated memory traces from the hippocampus to the cortex. However, the mechanisms supporting this essential dialogue across brain areas remain poorly understood. Here, we recorded single-neuron activity (n = 1097) in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) of 10 epilepsy patients across 21 nights of sleep. Before sleep, patients engaged in a memory task with stimuli eliciting concept-neuron responses. During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, neuronal firing locked to sharp wave-ripples (SWR) revealed a directed flow of information from the hippocampus to cortical targets. Notably, within SWR-driven activity, experience-dependent concept neurons exhibited elevated co-activation both within and across MTL regions, indicating selective reactivation of behaviorally relevant information. Cross-regional co-activation of concept cells was markedly enhanced when hippocampal SWRs coincided with cortical slow oscillation-spindle complexes, suggesting an active role of the cortex in shaping interregional communication. These findings provide evidence that SWRs in humans selectively reactivate experience-related neural ensembles across the hippocampal-cortical network, while synergistic interactions with cortical slow oscillation-spindle events might facilitate effective memory consolidation.

">Cortical astrocytes control stress resilience</a></h4>

              
                Background: Chronic stress exposure is a risk factor for several psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression (MDD), with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) playing a key role in mediating this stress susceptibility. However, most individuals who are exposed to chronic stress are resilient and do not develop psychopathology. Recent evidence suggests that glial cells, especially astrocytes, play an important role in controlling stress-induced anxiety- and depression-like behavior, yet their role in contributing to stress resilience is not understood. Methods: Using fiber photometry, chemogenetics, and RNA-sequencing in male mice, we establish a role for PFC astrocytes in stress resilience. Results: We demonstrate that stress-induced increases in astrocytic calcium activity are both necessary and sufficient for resilience. Bioinformatic analysis reveals robust transcriptional responses in PFC astrocytes that differ between susceptible vs. resilient mice and are unique when compared to astrocytic transcriptional changes in other limbic regions. Comparison with human RNA-sequencing data indicates that molecular changes observed in PFC astrocytes from susceptible mice converge with gene expression changes observed in MDD patients. Conclusions: Together, these data support targeting astrocytes as a potential therapy for negative behavioral consequences following stress exposure and reveal potential molecular mechanisms within PFC astrocytes that could contribute to depressive-like behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70069?af=R">Autophagy Impacts Dendritic Spines Differently in Proximal and Distal Dendrites of Hippocampus CA1 Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Autophagy is a cellular protein degradation mechanism essential for neuronal function. Recent work has begun to implicate autophagy in cellular functions beyond preserving homeostasis, such as synaptic plasticity and the regulation of dendritic spines. Work from our lab and others demonstrates that synaptic plasticity in distinct dendritic compartments is in part regulated by the uneven distribution of autophagosomes in CA1 apical dendrites. However, it remains unclear whether autophagy contributes to dendritic spine regulation in different dendritic segments. Here, we investigated the role of autophagy and caspase-3, a protein inhibiting autophagy during NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression, in the regulation of proximal and distal dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons. We conducted 3D neuron reconstruction of fluorescently labeled dendrites to analyze the volume, density, and subtype proportions of dendritic spines across compartments in ATG5 and caspase-3 knockout mice. ATG5 knockout mice had larger spines in distal dendrites as compared to proximal dendrites. Caspase-3 knockout mice did not display any difference between proximal and distal spine volume. Only ATG5 knockout mice exhibited reduced spine density as compared to controls. Both ATG5 and caspase-3 knockout mice possessed increased spine volume across all three spine subtypes: thin, stubby, and mushroom, along with a shift in spine subtypes with reduced proportions of thin and increased proportions of stubby and mushroom. These findings suggest that both autophagy and caspase-3 contribute to the regulation of spine volume and morphology. However, only autophagy appears to influence spine density. Moreover, autophagy uniquely regulates spine volume differently in proximal versus distal dendrites.</p>

                Cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations are found in most eukaryotic cells and are essential for energy production and gene expression. Lin et al. show that Ca2+ nanodomains adjacent to open store-operated CRAC channels are essential for Ca2+-dependent cytokine expression. This function of CRAC channels is crucial for excitation-transcription coupling in non-excitable cells.

                Tabor et al. demonstrated that knocking out microglial DGAT1 and DGAT2 exacerbated hippocampal neurodegeneration, introduced multiple behavioral deficits, and increased the abundance of endolysosomal neutral lipids within brain myeloid cells of 9.5-month-old male PS19 mice. DGAT-dependent microglial lipid droplet biogenesis may be adaptive in mammalian tauopathy.

                Huang et al. identify the mechanosensitive channel PIEZO1 as a plant immune hub that decodes insect-feeding-derived mechanical forces and Ca2+-activated defense responses. They characterize a self-amplifying immune circuit and identify that Bsp9, an evolutionarily conserved insect salivary effector, subverts this pathway. This work provides a framework for engineering plant disease resistance.

">Temporal dynamics of early somatosensory processing in goal-directed actions</a></h4>

              
                Tactile sensitivity is temporally modulated on a moving limb. Yet the functional significance of this modulation remains unclear. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we examined the temporal dynamics of early somatosensory processing in goal-directed reaching. Participants reached for their unseen left hand while brief vibrations were applied to the moving right index finger in different movement phases. Psychophysical results revealed tactile suppression during reaching, with sensitivity improving around maximum speed relative to the late movement phase. The EEG results were consistent with the psychophysical data. Specifically, the short-latency P45 component, originating in primary somatosensory cortex, was suppressed during reaching, but recovered around maximum speed. Reduced P45 amplitudes were associated with stronger tactile suppression measured behaviorally, linking early cortical activity to perceptual changes. This temporally specific modulation of tactile perception associated with early cortical processing suggests that the somatosensory system dynamically adapts its sensitivity to facilitate sensorimotor control in goal-directed actions.

">Impaired temporal prediction mechanisms in dyslexia</a></h4>

              
                Effective speech analysis involves deconstructing the acoustic signal into identifiable linguistic units, which depends on the ability to recognize and anticipate temporal patterns within the speech stream. However, these processes may be less efficient in individuals with dyslexia. This study investigated the effects of temporal context and related temporal predictions in dyslexic adult participants and matched control participants, using an auditory oddball task with non-verbal stimuli. Pure tones were presented in sequences, and participants were requested to discriminate the pitch of target stimuli. The temporal intervals between the sounds varied in regularity across the sequences, thereby creating contexts with different levels of temporal predictability. At the end of each sequence, participants were prompted to evaluate the perceived rhythmicity of the sequence and to assess their own performance in the auditory discrimination task. Dyslexic participants demonstrated overall lower accuracy in discriminating target sounds than controls. They also showed reduced influence of the temporal context of the sequences on response times, while controls responded faster in sequences that were temporally more regular and predictable. Additionally, individuals with dyslexia perceived the rhythmicity of sound sequences less accurately, overestimating the temporal regularity in irregular sequences and underestimating it in regular sequences. They also reported lower overall confidence in their ability to perform the task compared to control participants. Altogether, these findings provide converging evidence for altered temporal prediction abilities in dyslexia, which may impact auditory perception and then impair language processing.

">In vivo Proximity & Spatial Proteomics with CRISPR Screening Identify STXBP1 as a Protective Modifier of a-synuclein Toxicity in Dopamine Neurons.</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disease of adults involving the loss of dopaminergic neurons after a long, asymptomatic, prodromal period. a-synuclein, LRRK2, and VPS35 are linked to familial PD, however, how these mutations predispose dopamine neurons to death during the early prodromal phases remains unclear. Here, we used in vivo native proximity proteomics (iBioID) and dopaminergic neuron-specific subcellular proteomics across multiple PD models to uncover early alterations preceding neuronal loss. Our analyses identified convergent disruptions in synaptic protein abundance, indicating that presynaptic trafficking defects are early events in PD pathogenesis. Using a targeted CRISPR-based genetic screen in dopamine neurons, we demonstrated that mimicking this misregulation of STXBP1 amplifies vulnerability to a-synuclein, implicating it as a previously underappreciated toxicity buffering factor. These findings highlight convergent mechanisms that sensitize dopamine neuronal degeneration and that presynaptic vesicle SNARE-complex proteins could serve as key targets for disease-modifying therapies in PD and related neurodegenerative disorders.

">Brain-like dynamics in speech representations can emerge through self-supervised learning</a></h4>

              
                Speech representations in the human brain do not simply mirror the instantaneous speech signal; rather, they display several properties that are hypothesized to facilitate the integration of speech sounds into words. In particular, neural encodings of speech maintain information that has dissipated from the acoustics, and have also been argued to abstract over variability in how individual speech sounds are produced. Here, we investigate how such characteristics could arise. We introduce a computational framework that uses modern neural network models from speech technology to examine two factors in particular: the learning mechanism and the learning input. We find that self-supervised models trained without lexical or semantic feedback developed temporal dynamics similar to brain representations, regardless of whether they were trained on speech or non-speech audio. In contrast, only models trained on speech learn to abstract over variability due to word position and phonetic context. Overall, our results suggest that domain-general learning mechanisms can lead to several important properties of speech representations, but in some cases require domain-specific input in order to do so.

                <p>by Woo-Tek Lee, Eliot Hazeltine, Jiefeng Jiang</p>

Task knowledge can be encoded hierarchically such that complex tasks can be built by associating simpler tasks. This associative organization supports generalization to facilitate learning of related but novel complex tasks. To study how the brain implements generalization in hierarchical task learning, we trained human participants on two complex tasks that shared a simple task and tested them on novel complex tasks whose association could be inferred via the shared simple task. Behaviorally, we observed faster learning of the novel complex tasks than control tasks. Using electroencephalogram (EEG) data, we decoded constituent simple tasks when performing a complex task (i.e., EEG association effect). Crucially, the shared simple task, although not part of the novel complex task, could be reliably decoded from the novel complex task. This decoding strength was correlated with the EEG association effect and the behavioral generalization effect. The findings demonstrate how task learning can be accelerated by associative inference.

                <p>by Patrick M. Ferree, Jayla Cummings, Emma Garman, Jacqueline Solomon, Kassandra Soriano Martinez</p>

Many organisms carry extra, non-essential chromosomes known as B chromosomes (Bs), which are selfishly transmitted at super-mendelian levels to offspring. This heightened transmission, termed drive, occurs during gametogenesis, usually in one of the two parents. In some cases, Bs can experience an opposing process, drag, which reduces their transmission. If these processes occur together in the same organism, one in each parental sex, then they may facilitate the spread of Bs while countering their accumulation in the genome to harmful levels. While previous studies have elucidated mechanistic aspects of B drive, little is known about drag or other factors that govern the inheritance of these selfish genetic elements. Here, we examined the inheritance of Paternal Sex Ratio (PSR), a single-copy B in the jewel wasp, <i>Nasonia vitripennis</i>, which is transmitted paternally to offspring. PSR drives by converting female-destined embryos into PSR-transmitting males. Using genetic manipulation, we produced exceptional PSR-carrying females, which were used to assess B transmission potential. We found that females transmit PSR at an unexpectedly low level compared to univalent chromosomes in other organisms. This reduced transmission stems from remarkable loss of PSR from the egg’s nucleus upon entry into meiosis, an effect that may be caused by an absence of microtubule-based spindle fibers in meiosis I-arrested wasp eggs. We also found that PSR is strictly limited to a single copy per genome, likely because wasps having two PSR copies die during development. Our findings reveal the successful inheritance of this selfish B chromosome involves its restriction to a single copy and hidden female meiotic drag in addition to strong paternal drive.

                Aim To examine the determinants influencing cultural reproduction, comprehend the fundamental concepts of cultural reproduction, and evaluate the model of cultural reproduction as a manifestation of socio-cultural resilience. Materials and Methods The research employed the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology, utilizing the PRISMA protocol and the PICO framework. Data were sourced from Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, and Google Scholar, chosen based on inclusion criteria (2015–2025, empirical articles, pertinent to socio-cultural resilience). Out of the 688 initial articles, 143 studies satisfied the criteria. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to assess quality, and NVivo 14 was used for thematic synthesis to find patterns of direct relationships, mediation, and moderation between factors. Results and discussions The analysis identified eight principal factors: education, politics, family, economy, media, technology, religion, and community. Politics (15.3%) and education (17.6%) were the most important factors. Cultural reproduction operates through micro–macro interactions involving direct relationships (family, religion, community), mediation (education, media, politics, technology), and moderation (economics, technology). The resulting integrative model elucidates the way this amalgamation of factors enhances socio-cultural resilience via conservation and value adaptation. Conclusions Cultural reproduction serves both as a means of value preservation and as an adaptive mechanism that enhances social resilience. This research enhances Bourdieu’s theory by incorporating digital and participatory dimensions, providing a conceptual foundation for sustainable cultural policy.

                Background This study aims to detect the efficiency of two Artificial Intelligence (AI) translation models, ChatGPT and DeepSeek, in the translation of Yemeni San’ani Arabic (YSA) dialectical terms into English. As dialectal Arabic presents significant linguistic variability and cultural specificity, accurate translation remains a major challenge for the current ChatGPT and DeepSeek (and perhaps other AI models). Methods Fifty San’ani Arabic terms were involved in the translation process, assessing the ability of both models to capture their semantic fidelity, cultural relevance, and contextual accuracy. Results The study findings reveal that, while both models demonstrate a foundational understanding of Standard Arabic (SA), their performance diminishes considerably when faced with the nuances and idiomatic expressions of the San’ani Arabic dialect. ChatGPT displays a relatively better performance in certain cases, particularly when translating terms with dialectical connotations. However, both models exhibit limitations, such as literal translation, misinterpretation, or complete ignorance of the intended meaning. Conclusions The study concludes by highlighting the critical need for dialect-aware AI development and provides recommendations for improving the dialectical accuracy and cultural sensitivity of AI model translation.

                The proposed design of neural network in this article is based on new accurate approach for training by unconstrained optimization, especially update quasi-Newton methods are perhaps the most popular general-purpose algorithms. A limited memory BFGS algorithm is presented for solving large-scale symmetric nonlinear equations, where a line search technique without derivative information is used. On each iteration, the updated approximations of Hessian matrix satisfy the quasi-Newton form, which traditionally served as the basis for quasi-Newton methods. On the basis of the quadratic model used in this article, we add a new update of quasi-Newton form. One innovative features of this form's is its ability to estimate the energy function's or performance function with high order precision with second-order curvature while employ the given function value data and gradient. The global convergence of the proposed algorithm is established under some suitable conditions. Under some hypothesis the approach is established to be globally convergent. The updated approaches can be numerical and more efficient than the existing comparable traditional methods, as illustrated by numerical trials. Numerical results show that the given method is competitive to those of the normal BFGS methods. We show that solving a partial differential equation can be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, and use this formulation to propose several modifications to existing methods. Also the proposed algorithm is used to approximate the optimal scaling parameter, which can be used to eliminate the need to optimize this parameter. Our proposed update is tested on a variety of partial differential equations and compared to existing methods. These partial differential equations include the fourth order three dimensions nonlinear equation, which we solve in up to four dimensions, the convection-diffusion equation, all of which show that our proposed update lead to enhanced accuracy.

                Abstract* Background Social media marketing dynamics have been reshaped with the rise of micro-influencers, with the offering of community-driven and authentic brand engagement that goes beyond traditional celebrity endorsements and advertising. This study aims to systematically examine the micro-influencer research published between 2020 and 2025, focusing on identifying themes, research gaps, methodological characteristics, and providing future directions. Methods This paper focuses on providing a thorough systematic literature review (SLR) incorporating the PRISMA protocol on micro-influencers, while identifying interdependencies and relationships. 68 research papers that were derived from the Scopus database were analysed through bibliometric and content analysis. Bibliometric analysis was conducted using a combination of VOSviewer and Biblioshiny packages. Results were analysed through thematic clusters, co-occurrence, and bibliographic coupling analysis. Results The analysis depicts a steady growth in publications accelerated with digitalisation and post-COVID consumer shift that placed a commercial value on small-scale influencers. Research is fragmented across authenticity, trust, engagement, sponsorship disclosure, and niche-domains for micro-influencers. The literature is geographically skewed towards the West and high-income Asian countries. Less longitudinal evidence with strong methodological homogeneity was present. Algorithmic visibility, emerging platform comparisons, influencer labour, and non-commercial uses of micro-influencers were underexplored themes. Five research areas were identified from clustering. Conclusion Despite the rapid expansions, micro-influencer literature remains theoretically fragmented and unevenly distributed. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the literature on micro-influencers and provides implications and future research directions. Most studies focused on analysing a single platform with cross-sectional designs. This study highlights the need for thorough theoretical integration with methodological diversification, considering emerging platforms to better understand how micro influencers shape digital communication.

                Background Natural resources and their pharmaceutical products play an important role in disease management because of their potential for new drug discovery and historical traditional use in healthcare. This study aimed to investigate the effects of hesperidin and its derivatives on MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and leishmaniosis. Methods The colorimetric cell viability MTT assay was used to measure the efficacy of these compounds in inhibiting MCF-7 cell growth and the promastigote forms of Leishmania tropica. Cells treated with different concentrations (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μg/ml) of hesperidin and their derivative, derv.1(5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thiol), and derv. 2 (5-(methylthio)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-thiol) after 24 h exposure. Results The Results showed that hesperidin was the most effective in inhibiting MCF-7 cells, with a 58.3% inhibition rate at a concentration of 100 μg/ml, whereas the derivative (derv.2) exhibited the highest antileishmanial activity, with a 50.2% inhibition rate at the same concentration. The anticancer and antileishmanial effects were concentration-dependent, with inhibition rates decreasing at lower concentrations. Conclusions These findings indicate the potential role of hesperidin and its derivatives as anti-cancer and antileishmanial agents, suggesting new ways for further research into their medical applications.

                Background Pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis and is highly aggressive and deadly. Most pancreatic cancer diagnoses are adenocarcinomas, which account for more than 90 % of all cases. Developing effective therapeutic strategies requires an understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with pancreatic cancer progression. Small nucleolar RNA 64 (SNORA64) was presented as a predictive marker for pancreatic cancer stages in our previous study. SNORA64 showed a gradual loss of its expression throughout the carcinogenesis process, and it inhibited metastasis by interfering with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this study, we investigated the role of SNORA64 on an intrinsic apoptotic pathway in pancreatic cancers by using human pancreatic cell line derived from adenocarcinoma PK-8 with SNORA64 knockdown and the scramble to compare with. Methods QPCR techniques used to measure the gene expression level of apoptosis related genes and cell viability analyzer are implanted in this study as investigational methods. Results Pk-8 with low expression of SNORA64 shows significantly high expression of anti-apoptotic genes B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCl2) and B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (BCL-Xl) in contrast to the scramble control cell line. Conversely, the pro-apoptotic genes BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID), BCL2 Associated X (BAX), and BCL2 homologous antagonist/killer (BAK) show significantly low expression compared to the scramble control. However, there is no change in the expression of BAD and BIM in Pk-8 with SNORA64 knockdown compared to the scrambled control cell line. Furthermore, the Pk-8 with low expression of SNORA64 shows a significant high proliferation rate and viability percentage compared to the scramble control cell line. Conclusion The downregulation of SNORA64 affects apoptosis pathways by manipulating pro- and anti-apoptotic gene regulators. The SNORA64 interactions with apoptotic inhibitor molecules and downregulation of pro-apoptotic molecules significantly sustain cellular viability. Therefore; SNORA64 can be used to increase the cell sensitivity to death during treatment.

                Background Beta-hemolytic streptococci (BHS) constitute a significant etiology of tonsillitis and rheumatic heart disease (RHD), affecting approximately 55 million individuals and causing 360,000 deaths annually worldwide. In the Middle East and North Africa region, RHD prevalence reaches 389 per 100,000 population, though diagnostic inadequacies may obscure the true disease burden. This investigation compared polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection with conventional culture-based methods for BHS identification in Iraqi tonsillitis patients and assessed associated clinical, immunological, and systemic dissemination parameters. Methods A prospective cross-sectional study included 250 tonsillitis patients at Ramadi General Hospital, Iraq (April 2020–January 2025) and 25 healthy controls. Diagnostics comprised throat culture with Lancefield serogrouping, bacitracin testing, and PCR targeting the spy1258 gene. Blood specimens underwent PCR for systemic bacterial detection. Statistical analyses included chi-square testing, logistic regression, and diagnostic accuracy calculations. Results PCR detected Group A Streptococcus (GAS) in 52 of 83 (62.7%) culture-positive specimens, whereas Lancefield serogrouping identified only 19 (22.9%), representing a statistically significant threefold detection disparity (p < 0.001). PCR demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Groups C and F streptococci comprised the majority of isolates. Elevated anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titers (≥200 IU/mL) were observed in 42.2% of non-GAS infections. Among severe cases, 45.7% demonstrated positive blood PCR for GAS DNA, indicating systemic dissemination. The highest disease burden occurred in the 6–15 years age cohort (54.2% of all isolates). DNA extraction optimization achieved an estimated efficiency of 90.4% compared to negligible efficiency with standard methodologies. Conclusion PCR-based diagnostics detected threefold more GAS cases than serological methods, revealing significant underdiagnosis. Non-Group A streptococci showed pathogenic potential and may cause post-infectious complications, warranting revised diagnostic paradigms.

                Protein–protein interactions play a central role in cellular signaling, immune recognition, and therapeutic development, yet they are often characterized by weak affinities, transient binding, and pronounced conformational flexibility. These features present significant challenges for conventional structural biology techniques. Biophysical approaches, particularly nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) have emerged as powerful tools for elucidating peptide interactions under near-physiological conditions. NMR offers residue-level information on interaction interfaces, conformational changes, and protein dynamics in solution, making it uniquely suited for the analysis of weak and transient interactions. In contrast, ITC provides a direct and label-free measurement of binding thermodynamics, yielding quantitative parameters such as affinity, stoichiometry, and the enthalpic and entropic contributions to binding. This review highlights the principles, applications, and limitations of NMR and ITC in protein–protein interaction research, emphasizing how their combined use enables an integrated understanding of structure, dynamics, and energetics. Representative examples from the literature are discussed, including viral peptide–host protein interactions such as those involving Epstein–Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). Together, these studies illustrate the unique ability of NMR and ITC to capture structural and dynamic features of peptide recognition that are critical for understanding biological function and guiding peptide-based therapeutic design.

                Background With the aim of making it easier for researchers to produce policy-relevant research, the UK Government now requires all departments and arms-length bodies to publish annually-updated statements of their evidence needs, called ‘Areas of Research Interest’ (ARIs). We describe how ARIs are produced, and how they are used to support this aim. Aims and objectives In this paper we offer a description of ARIs and their development by UK governmental departments, and an assessment of how different stakeholders, including academia and funders, have responded to or otherwise used the ARIs. Key conclusions ARIs are a mechanism for organisations to share their research interests with external audiences in the form of a published document. In addition to this primary aim, they also have a much broader set of uses, including connecting departments with each other and helping intermediaries shape engagement plans. All groups would benefit from more robust evidence to choose effective engagement mechanisms, and more can be done to make the ARIs discoverable and useable. Overall, the ARIs are a useful tool to illuminate, and begin to connect different parts of the research-policy system.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Evidence from rodents has revealed that the hippocampus processes information in a graded manner along its long-axis, with anterior regions encoding coarse information and posterior regions encoding fine-grained information. During navigation tasks with humans, similar patterns have been shown, with granularity of representation and rate of signal varying along the long-axis. However, the stability of these signals and their relationship to navigational performance remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a 2-week training program where 26 participants (6 M; 20 F) learned to navigate through a novel city environment. We investigated inter-voxel similarity (IVS; a measure of representational granularity) and temporal auto-correlation (a measure of signal change) in the hippocampus. Specifically, we examined how these signals were influenced by navigational ability (stronger vs. weaker spatial learners), training session, and navigational dynamics. Our results suggested that stronger learners tended to exhibit an anterior–posterior distinction in IVS in the right hippocampus, whereas weaker learners showed less pronounced patterns. Additionally, lower general IVS levels in the hippocampus were linked to better early learning. These findings suggest that signal complexity in the hippocampus may play a role in successful navigation and that efficient organization of scales of representation could be beneficial for navigation.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Clot composition may offer insights into the mechanism of ischemic stroke. Radiomics, a noninvasive imaging technique, enables tissue characterization through radiomic features (RFs). We aimed to evaluate clot composition using radiomics on non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In the first phase, we conducted a prospective study comparing RFs with histopathology in thrombi retrieved via mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Thrombi were imaged using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and analyzed histologically. Matched micro-CT and histological slices identified red blood cells (RBCs) and fibrin-rich regions. RFs were extracted, and multivariate logistic regression identified features associated with each component. Spearman's correlation was used to assess associations between RFs and percentage composition. The same clots were localized on pre-MT NCCT, and RFs were extracted. Micro-CT and NCCT RFs were correlated to enable histology-informed interpretation. Receiver operating characteristic analysis evaluated the ability of NCCT RFs to discriminate clot composition. In the second phase, radiomics was applied to a retrospective NCCT dataset from patients with ischemic stroke with varying etiologies.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ten thrombi were analyzed using micro-CT. Total energy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20–1.54, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and large dependence high gray level emphasis (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.07–1.32, <i>p</i> = 0.01) were associated with RBCs and correlated with &gt;70% RBCs composition on NCCT (Rho = 0.752 and Rho = 0.815). Subsequently, 150 NCCT scans were analyzed, including 50 cardioembolic, 50 large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), and 50 cryptogenic strokes. Radiomic analysis indicated RBCs-predominant composition in 72% of cardioembolic, 30% of LAA, and 50% of cryptogenic clots.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Radiomics is a promising, noninvasive technique for characterizing clot composition. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

Clinical, genetic, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (A<i>β</i>1–42, h-Tau, p181-Tau, and neurofilament light chain) were analyzed. Cognition was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Cognitive slopes were estimated using linear mixed models and the minimally detectable slope difference at 3-year follow-up was 1.33 MoCA points enabling sensitivity to clinically meaningful changes. Secondarily, conversion to dementia was analyzed with Kaplan–Meier-analysis once the MoCA was &lt; 21.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There was no significant difference in cognitive decline between PD<sub>GBA1+DBS+</sub> and PD<sub>GBA1+DBS−</sub> (−0.24 MoCA points/year; 95% confidence interval [CI] = –1.11 to 0.70) projecting to −0.72 MoCA points at 3-year-follow-up (<i>p</i> = 0.583). Secondarily, the risk for conversion to dementia did not differ between PD<sub>GBA1+DBS+</sub> and PD<sub>GBA1+DBS−</sub> (HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.23–1.34, <i>p</i> = 0.119) or between PD<sub>GBA1−DBS+</sub> and PD<sub>GBA1−DBS−</sub> (HR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.53–2.83, <i>p</i> = 0.897). Dementia risk was associated with <i>GBA1</i> status (HR = 3.04, 95% CI = 1.05–8.79, <i>p</i> = 0.041), baseline MoCA &lt; 26 (HR = 3.05, 95% CI = 1.29–7.21, <i>p</i> = 0.011), and baseline age &gt; 69 years (HR = 4.42, 95% CI = 1.79–10.89, <i>p</i> = 0.001). In <i>GBA1</i> carriers, a visuospatial/executive domain score &lt; 4/5 predicted dementia (HR = 4.71, 95% CI = 1.25–17.86, <i>p</i> = 0.022).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>GBA1</i> variant carriers meeting general STN-DBS indication criteria did not show accelerated cognitive decline in the presence of STN-DBS. In addition, exploratory predictors of dementia could support counseling of DBS candidates. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                Streptomyces sp. BTA 1-131 was isolated from the marine sponge Melophlus sarasinorum collected in Indonesia. The crude extracts of this strain displayed antibacterial and cytotoxic activity, and therefore, to further investigate the bioactive potential of the strain, whole genome sequencing was performed in this study. The whole genome sequencing of Streptomyces sp. BTA 1-131 was conducted using both Illumina NextSeq and Oxford Nanopore platforms with a de novo hybrid assembly approach. The high-quality genome obtained is 10.23 Mbp with a GC content of 71.57%. It is organised into a single chromosomal contig, two linear plasmids, and one circular plasmid. Interestingly, a long-terminal inverted repeat (L-TIR) sequence of 1.5 Mbp has been confirmed in the strain genome. Phylogenomic analysis suggested that the strain BTA 1-131 likely represents a new species within the genus Streptomyces. To the best of our knowledge, the genome data described here would be the first report on the hybrid genome sequence of Streptomyces associated with the rarely reported sponge Melophlus sarasinorum from Indonesia, with a unique feature of L-TIR. The complete genome data generated here will provide compelling information for further analysis of the biosynthetic potential of the strain BTA 1-131 to produce new bioactive compounds.

                In cases where vaginal delivery is not feasible and the mother’s or the child’s health is in danger, a Caesarean section (CS) is medically warranted. The World Health Organization (WHO) projects that between 10% and 15% of all births will have medically justifiable CS rates. Globally, WHO estimates that 6.2 million CSs are performed each year without medical justification. The determination to proceed with or forgo a CS can be understood as the result of weighing three key categories of influence: demand-side factors, supply-side factors, and clinical factors. Each of these categories contributes uniquely to the ultimate decision of whether to perform a CS, highlighting the multifaceted nature of this healthcare challenge. Within each input, there is also, often, a complex interplay. For example, there is a local narrative of mothers seeking an elective CS being “too posh to push”, inextricably linking household socioeconomic factors and maternal preferences. On the supply side there are issues of the policy within the healthcare facility (private hospitals prefer CSs) and an interplay with time management and maximizing the efficiency of the facility. Bangladesh’s CS has been on the rise; according to the most recent survey, it was 45%, far higher than the WHO recommendation. The private sector interacts with the high rates of CS in Bangladesh; MOH Bangladesh has little control over this sector. To optimize the CS rate, the nation must first recognize that needless CS is an issue and take all necessary action to address it.

                Background This study investigates the mediating role of comfort (CMT), convenience (CNV), and aesthetics (AST) in the relationship between the enablers of an age-friendly built environment for walkability and outcomes such as increased physical activity level (IPL), increased socialization (ISL), and improved quality of life (IQL) in older adults. The research emphasizes the importance of creating age-friendly environments to support the well-being and quality of life of older adults, with implications for urban planners and policymakers to promote sustainable and inclusive design. Methods The research follows a positivist paradigm using a quantitative approach and survey strategy with a cross-sectional design. A sample of 333 older adults was selected using the convenience sampling technique, and data were gathered through a self-administered questionnaire. Results Findings from hypothesis testing indicate that, among the enablers, age-friendly urban design policies are the most significant construct, positively impacting all three mediating variables. Aesthetics was found to have a significant positive effect on increased physical activity level and increased socialization, while comfort and convenience significantly influenced increased physical activity level and improved quality of life, respectively. Conclusion These results suggest implications for urban planners and policymakers to enhance the contribution of built environment for walkability toward increased physical activity level, increased socialization, and improved quality of life for older adults. The research offers valuable insights for academics and practitioners, emphasizing the importance of sustainable design while ensuring inclusivity to promote the well-being and quality of life of older adults.

                In a district of the Lambayeque province, considerable levels of political disaffection are evident, manifesting not only in the alienation from power but also in a significant gap between citizens and government institutions. Although efforts have been made to continue the participatory trend in democratic institutions, innovative proposals for social intervention in political processes and decision-making are still needed. The study aimed to propose a model of conventional participation to mitigate political disaffection in Lambayeque, Peru. The research was quantitative, with a non-experimental, descriptive-propositional design. It employed a survey technique applied to a randomly selected sample of 506 citizens from a total universe of 19,342 voters. The results indicate that the implementation of a conventional participatory practice, tailored to the sociocultural peculiarities of the district, positively impacts the political perception of the population. The findings reveal that a large portion of the Lambayeque population has disconnected from politics in everyday life, registering a general malaise that may reflect in future elections, as interest that does not translate into action is meaningless. General distrust in institutions, particularly the sentiment of corruption, has fostered this detachment; moreover, the results reflect a rejection of the political system. Despite many being informed about politics, the feeling of participation remains impotent.

                Background Cardiac hydatid cysts are uncommon presentation of heart disease that most often affects the left ventricle of the heart. The clinical picture may be quite different and may include arrhythmias and myocarditis up to a potentially life-threatening embolism of the cystic contents in cases of rupture into a cardiac chamber. Early and proper diagnosis is very important to avoid serious complications, such as infection and rupture of cysts. Even though medical treatment can bring certain control, surgery is the preferred type of treatment, which has good results and a low possibility of recurrence in cases where it is performed early. Methodology This retrospective case-series study examined five patients diagnosed with cardiac hydatid cysts between January 2018 and July 2024. All cases were handled by a qualified cardiac surgeon at Al-Anbar Governorate in Iraq. The effectiveness and safety of surgical management were evaluated based on clinical information, radiographic findings, surgical procedures, and post-operative experiences. Results All five patients successfully underwent successful excision of the cardiac hydatid cysts. In all cases, the post-operative course was uneventful, except for one patient who developed significant post-operatve bleeding requiring re-exploration. There were no deaths, and high-quality clinical recovery was achieved. No incidence of cyst rupture, secondary infection, or cyst reccurrence was reported during the follow-up period. Conclusions Although uncommon, cardiac hydatid cysts should be included in the diagnosis of cardiac masses, particularly in endemic areas. Echocardiography and high-tech imaging should be used to diagnose heart disease early to prevent severe complications. Surgery has been the pillar of treatment as it offers high success rates with low risk in case it is performed in a timely and careful manner. The positive results in this series prove the necessity of timely surgical referral and multidisciplinary treatment.

                Background The anabolic-androgenic steroid boldenone is widely abused and is strongly linked to nephrotoxicity, primarily mediated through oxidative stress and inflammation. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol, is renowned for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but its protective role against boldenone-induced renal injury is not fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the potential nephroprotective effects of curcumin against boldenone-induced kidney damage in a rat model, focusing on biochemical parameters, oxidative stress markers, inflammatory response, and histological changes. Methods Thirty-two male Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n=8): control, curcumin-only (300 mg/kg/day), boldenone-only (5 mg/kg/week), and boldenone + curcumin. Over the experimental period, body weight, kidney weight, food/water intake, and serum renal function markers (urea, creatinine, electrolytes) were monitored. Renal tissue was analyzed for oxidative stress markers (MDA, GSH, CAT, SOD), the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, and histological alterations. Results Boldenone administration significantly increased body and kidney weights, serum urea, creatinine, potassium, and chloride, while decreasing sodium and calcium. It induced marked oxidative stress (elevated MDA, depleted GSH, CAT, SOD) and inflammation (elevated TNF-α), resulting in significant tubular necrosis and hypertrophy. Co-treatment with curcumin substantially mitigated these abnormalities, normalizing serum markers, restoring antioxidant defenses and electrolyte balance, reducing TNF-α expression, and ameliorating histological damage. Conclusion Curcumin exerts significant nephroprotection against boldenone-induced toxicity through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective mechanisms. These findings justify its exploration as a potential adjunct therapy to prevent steroid-associated kidney injury. Future studies should focus on elucidating the precise molecular signaling pathways involved and validating these effects in clinical scenarios of AAS abuse.

                Introduction Tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) is the second most frequent manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB), predominantly characterised by mononuclear (MN) cells in pleural fluid. However, approximately 6.7% of cases show polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell predominance in pleural fluid, often causing delayed diagnosis and treatment, as these cases may not be initially recognised as tuberculosis. This study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics of PMN- and MN-predominant TPE. Methods This cross-sectional analytical study included 60 patients with bacteriologically confirmed TB with pleural effusion at Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital, Makassar, Indonesia. Primary data were collected from patient interviews, physical examinations, and pleural fluid analysis of thoracentesis samples. The diagnosis of pleural effusion was confirmed by radiological imaging and thoracentesis. Patients were classified as PMN-predominant (≥50% PMN) or MN-predominant (≥50% MN) based on pleural fluid cell counts. Results Among the patients, 24 (40%) had PMN-predominant and 36 (60%) had MN-predominant pleural effusion. Significant differences were found between cell predominance and clinical features, including weight loss (p < 0.001), symptom duration (p = 0.034), clinical severity (p = 0.033), pleural fluid leukocyte and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (p < 0.001). PMN predominance was associated with severe clinical presentation and higher pleural leukocyte and LDH levels in pleural fluid than MN predominance. Conclusions PMN-predominant TPE reflects an early, more severe inflammatory phase characterised by severe clinical manifestations and elevated leukocyte and LDH levels. While MN predominance suggests a more chronic disease phase with longer symptoms and mild to moderate clinical

                Background The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of physical activity (PA) intervention as an adjuvant strategy to pharmacological treatment in people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and non-remitted depression (NRD). Methods A search strategy was conducted from five databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Oxford’s Evidence Levels were used to classify the quality appraisal. Results Of the 10777 records, 11 randomized controlled studies met the inclusion criteria. The main outcome for this analysis was the effect of physical activity (PA) or exercise on depressive symptoms in people with TRD and NRD diagnosis. According to the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) principle, there was some variability in the PA intervention. However, except for one article, all were classified as excellent in terms of quality description. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of PA intervention as an adjuvant program to improve various traits in TRD and NRD. The remission of depression seems to be higher after PA intervention, showing improvements in quality of life, sleep quality, executive function, and vitality.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-62/v1?src=rss">Why Kyphoplasty for Osteoporotic Vertebral Fractures? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) are frequent reasons behind painful, spinal deformity, and low-quality of life among the aged. Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (KP) is a minimally invasive procedure aimed at stabilizing fractured vertebrae, regaining vertebral height, and correcting kyphotic deformity. The purpose of this study was to compare the radiological and functional outcome of unilateral percutaneous kyphoplasty in patients with OVCFs that are not responding to conservative therapy. Methods This retrospective case study was conducted on 32 adult patients with vertebral compression fracture as a result of osteoporosis who received percutaneous kyphoplasty in the Department of Neurosurgery, Hatay Mustafa Kemal University, Turkey, between 2022 and 2024. Radiological evaluation was conducted before surgery, in the 24 hours after surgery and 1 month after surgery. The heights of anterior, middle, and posterior vertebral bodies and kyphosis angles were measured on the lateral radiographs using Cobb method. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of pain was used as a measure of functional outcomes. Paired statistical tests were conducted to statistically compare pre and postoperative values and the significance was set at p < 0.05. Results The sample population was a group of 24 females (75% of the total population) and 8 males (25% of the total population) with the mean age of the sample population equal to 63.09 years. The number of kyphoplasties carried out was 36. The mean VAS pain scores reduced significantly by the 8.56 at preoperative stage to 5.83 in the early postoperative stage and further to 0.63 at 1 month postoperative, which is a 92.64% pain reduction. Anterior and middle height of vertebral bodies was significantly better after operation and there was no significant change of the height of the posterior walls. Mean kyphosis angle dropped to 10.73 owing to surgery as compared to 18.44 owing to surgery, and was maintained at 1 month. No significant complications such as cement leakage, pulmonary embolism or neurological deficit were observed. Conclusions Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty is safe and effective, minimally invasive therapy of osteoporotic compression fracture of the vertebra. The surgery offers quick and lasting analgesia, considerable recovery of vertebral stature, and lasting remedy of kyphotic deformity at a low complication rate. These results justify using kyphoplasty as a useful treatment measure to patients with symptomatic OVCFs.

                Jia et al. show that the antiseizure effects of Bacteroides fragilis are mediated by enhanced cholinergic signaling along the gut-vagus-brain axis and reinforced by the gut colonization of Lactobacillus. These findings reveal a microbiota-neural circuit interaction with translational implications for pediatric refractory epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107671">Targeted computational design of an interleukin-7 superkine with enhanced folding efficiency and immunotherapeutic efficacy</a></h4>

              
                Interleukin-7 (IL-7) plays a central role in maintaining T cell development and immune homeostasis, and enhancing the cytokine’s immune-stimulatory functionality has broad therapeutic implications against various oncological malignancies. Herein, we show a computationally designed IL7 superkine, Neo-7, which exhibits enhanced folding efficiency and superior binding affinity to its cognate receptors. To streamline the protein candidate prediction and validation process, the loop region of IL7 was strategically targeted for redesign while most of the receptor-interacting regions were preserved. Leveraging advanced computational tools such as AlphaFold2, we show loop remodeling to rectify structural irregularities that allow for iterative stabilization of protein backbone and lead to identification of beneficial mutations conducive to receptor engagement. Neo-7 superkine shows improved thermostability and production yield, and it exhibits heightened immune-stimulatory and anticancer effect in C57BL/6 J mice. Neo-7 addresses intrinsic developability limitations of IL-7, including inefficient folding, aggregation propensity, and suboptimal receptor engagement, while in vivo pharmacokinetic limitations of wild-type IL-7 were addressed separately through Fc fusion. These findings underscore the utility of a targeted computational approach for de novo cytokine development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96032">Stratification of viral shedding patterns in saliva of COVID-19 patients</a></h4>

              
                Living with COVID-19 requires continued vigilance against the spread and emergence of variants of concern (VOCs). Rapid and accurate saliva diagnostic testing, alongside basic public health responses, is a viable option contributing to effective transmission control. Nevertheless, our knowledge regarding the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in saliva is not as advanced as our understanding of the respiratory tract. Here, we analyzed longitudinal viral load data of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples from 144 patients with mild COVID-19 (a combination of our collected data and published data). Using a mathematical model, we quantified individual-level viral dynamics and stratified them into three groups using a clustering approach. Notably, the three groups exhibited distinct differences in viral RNA detection durations: 11.5 days (95% CI: 10.6–12.4), 17.4 days (16.6–18.2), and 30.0 days (28.1–31.8), respectively. Surprisingly, this stratified grouping remained unexplained despite our analysis of 47 types of clinical data, including basic demographic information, clinical symptoms, results of blood tests, and vital signs. Additionally, we quantified the expression levels of 92 micro-RNAs in a subset of saliva samples, but these also failed to explain the observed stratification, although the mir-1846 level may have been weakly correlated with peak viral load. Our study provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in saliva, highlighting the challenges in predicting the duration of viral RNA detection without indicators that directly reflect an individual’s immune response, such as antibody induction. Given the significant individual heterogeneity in the kinetics of saliva viral shedding, identifying biomarker(s) for viral shedding patterns will be crucial for improving public health interventions in the era of living with COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106665">Glial betaPix is essential for blood vessel development in the zebrafish brain</a></h4>

              
                The formation of blood–brain barrier and vascular integrity depends on the coordinated development of different cell types in the brain. Previous studies have shown that zebrafish <i>bubblehead</i> (<i>bbh</i>) mutant, which has mutation in the <i>betaPix</i> locus, develops spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage during early development. However, it remains unclear in which brain cells <i>betaPix</i> may function. Here, we established a highly efficient conditional knockout method in zebrafish by using homology-directed repair-mediated knockin and knockout technology and generated <i>betaPix</i> conditional trap (<i>betaPix<sup>ct</sup></i>) allele in zebrafish. We found that <i>betaPix</i> in glia, but neither neurons, endothelial cells, nor pericytes was critical for glial and vascular development and integrity, thus contributing to the formation of blood–brain barrier. Single-cell transcriptome profiling revealed that microtubule aggregation signaling stathmins and pro-angiogenic transcription factors <i>Zfhx3/4</i> were downregulated in glial and neuronal progenitors, and further genetic analysis suggested that betaPix may act upstream on the PAK1-Stathmin and Zfhx3/4-Vegfaa signaling to regulate glia migration and angiogenesis. Therefore, this work reveals that glial <i>betaPix</i> plays an important role in brain vascular development in zebrafish embryos and possibly human cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106827">Biologically informed cortical models predict optogenetic perturbations</a></h4>

              
                A recurrent neural network fitted to large electrophysiological datasets may help us understand the chain of cortical information transmission. In particular, successful network reconstruction methods should enable a model to predict the response to optogenetic perturbations. We test recurrent neural networks (RNNs) fitted to electrophysiological datasets on unseen optogenetic interventions and measure that generic RNNs used predominantly in the field generalize poorly on these perturbations. Our alternative RNN model adds biologically informed inductive biases like structured connectivity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and spiking neuron dynamics. We measure that some biological inductive biases improve the model prediction on perturbed trials in a simulated dataset and a dataset recorded in mice in vivo. Furthermore, we show in theory and simulations that gradients of the fitted RNN can be used to target micro-perturbations in the recorded circuits and discuss the potential utility to bias an animal’s behavior and study cortical circuit mechanisms.

">A Preoptic Neurocircuit That Modulates Metabolic Flexibility</a></h4>

              
                Precise, dynamic control of metabolic fuel usage in response to environmental challenges such as altered food availability or temperature change is essential for animal survival. In mammals, metabolic flexibility -- the capacity to shift cellular metabolism between carbohydrate and fatty acid oxidation -- is understood to be largely regulated by circulating hormones such as insulin and glucagon. However, the role of the central nervous system in coordinating fuel selection and tissue metabolic tuning remains underexplored. Here, we investigated the mechanisms that mediate metabolic reprogramming following the acute activation of torpor-associated glutamatergic Adcyap1+ torpor-regulating neurons in the anteroventral preoptic area (avPOAVglut2/PACAP). The activation of these neurons rapidly shifts whole-body fuel use from glucose to fatty acids, irrespective of fuel/food availability. This shift is associated with reduced glucose utilization stemming from the transient induction of selective insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. We find that this reduction in skeletal muscle glucose metabolism does not require direct muscle innervation but is rather mediated via adrenal hormones. In contrast to their activation, avPOAVglut2/PACAP neuronal silencing results in improved glucose tolerance, demonstrating powerful bidirectional control of tissue-specific glucose metabolism, whole-body glucose levels, and fuel usage. Together, our findings uncover a novel POA-adrenal-skeletal muscle pathway that dynamically controls glucose utilization and metabolic flexibility.

">Reliability and validity of multi-band multi-echo fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Precision mapping of individual differences in human brain spontaneous activity is critical for characterizing brain function and guiding clinical translation. Multi-echo resting-state functional MRI (ME-rfMRI) has the potential to provide more reliable mapping of inter-individual differences in intrinsic brain function than conventional single-echo rfMRI (SE-rfMRI). However, the psychometric benefits of ME-rfMRI for mapping individual differences in spontaneous brain activity (SBA) have not been systematically investigated, which is fundamental for understanding the human brain in health and disease. To quantify the psychometric performance of ME-rfMRI in precisely mapping inter-individual variations in SBA, we employed a psychometric design. We scanned 27 healthy adults with both ME-rfMRI and SE-rfMRI to assess short-term (minutes) test-retest reliability, as well as validity across eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) resting states. Our results demonstrate that ME-rfMRI improves reliability relative to SE-rfMRI by 10.8% for amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), 4.4% for regional homogeneity (ReHo), and 8.0% for voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) in cortical regions, and by 12.5% for ALFF, 8.3% for ReHo, and 4.0% for VMHC in subcortical regions. This enhancement is achieved by increasing inter-individual variability while reducing intra-individual variability. Notably, ME-rfMRI accentuates inter-individual variability in the unimodal cortex and clearly delineates two parallel systems with distinct variability patterns within the motor cortex. Concurrently, ME-rfMRI increases effect sizes (4%-8%) for detecting individual differences between EO and EC resting states. Interestingly, ME-rfMRI reveals differential effects of eye closure on two intertwined systems in the primary motor and sensory cortices, extending previous findings. Computational simulations indicate that, compared to SE-rfMRI, ME-rfMRI facilitates experimental designs with reduced costs (i.e., 4%-11% smaller sample sizes) for precise mapping of individual differences. These findings establish, for the first time, the psychometric performance of ME-rfMRI measurements, supporting its potential utility in personalized neuroscience applications, including neurodevelopment and brain disorders.

">THIK-1 channel mediates microglial glucose sensing and modulates AgRP neurons</a></h4>

              
                Microglia play essential roles in maintaining energy homeostasis, and their dysfunction contributes to metabolic disease. Although high-fat diet (HFD) exposure induces microglial activation, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized role for THIK-1 channel in mediating glucose sensing of microglia in arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH), during HFD-induced obesity. Pharmacological inhibition of THIK-1 channel with tetrapentylammonium (TPA) suppresses feeding and attenuates body-weight gain in diet induced obese mice. Mechanistically, inhibition of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons is indispensable for TPA-induced hypophagia. Moreover, THIK-1 inhibition promotes microglial phagocytosis of perineuronal nets (PNNs), leading to reduced AgRP neuronal activity and feeding suppression. Together, these findings establish THIK-1 as a critical glucose sensor in hypothalamic microglia and uncover a microglia-dependent pathway through which overnutrition modulates AgRP neuronal activity via PNN remodeling to regulate energy balance, highlighting THIK-1 as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of diet-induced obesity.

">Respiratory suppression enhances voluntary control of human action</a></h4>

              
                Athletes often regulate their breathing to optimize motor performance, suggesting a close link between respiration and movement control. Previous studies have shown that respiration modulates neuronal oscillations and influences behavior. However, how respiratory control directly affects motor behavior remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that breath holding during the preparatory period facilitates voluntary movement. We examined respiratory patterns while participants performed two types of eye movement tasks: pro-saccade and anti-saccade tasks. In the anti-saccade task, participants were required to suppress a reflexive saccade toward a visual target and instead generate a voluntary saccade in the opposite direction. To assess whether motivation modulates respiratory control, the tasks were conducted under two motivational conditions. Most participants suppressed their breath during the anticipatory period preceding saccade initiation, regardless of task type, and this tendency was more pronounced under high motivation. In the anti-saccade task, stronger respiratory adjustments were associated with shorter reaction times, whereas no such relationship was observed in the pro-saccade task. Moreover, intentional breath holding during the preparatory period selectively reduced reaction times in the anti-saccade task. These findings indicate that individuals spontaneously hold their breath to facilitate voluntary actions in highly motivated situations, and that this effect can be reproduced through intentional breath holding. We propose that anticipatory breath holding may play a functional role in proactively modulating neural processes underlying voluntary movement control.

">A sensorimotor brain circuit for transforming aversive experiences into emotional states</a></h4>

              
                Innately aversive experiences produce emotional states which control behavior as well as long term associative memories1-3. Brainstem regions engage innate defensive reactions1,3-7, but it is unclear how the nervous system transduces external aversive experiences into higher order, emotional representations in the forebrain to instruct learning and modulate behavior. The prevailing view is that the sensory properties of aversive experiences activate forebrain emotional processing1,3,8-10, but classical theories proposed that internal bodily reactions to unpleasant events produce feeling states11,12. Here we identify a brainstem cuneiform (CnF) circuit which conveys information about both the external sensory causes and internal motor reactions related to aversive events to the lateral/basal nuclei of the amygdala (LA/B), a brain region which stores emotional memories, to enhance ongoing defensive behaviors and regulate associative memory formation. Glutamatergic CnF neurons project directly to LA/B and receive afferent inputs from aversive-sensory and aversive-motor brain regions. Notably, LA/B neurons encode a sensorimotor state in response to noxious stimuli, with both sensory and motor features transmitted through the CnF-to-LA/B pathway. Finally, optogenetic perturbation experiments showed that during aversive experiences, the CnF-LA/B circuit instructs emotional memory formation and enhances the intensity of ongoing defensive behaviors. These findings reveal how the nervous system constructs an aversive sensorimotor state in the amygdala used for regulating the strength of emotional behaviors and producing memory formation. This demonstrates a clinically relevant brain mechanism for the regulation of emotional processing by both external traumatic events and the accompanying bodily reactions.

">A generalized scaling law to characterize coordinated brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Complex ecological systems obey universal scaling laws such as the Taylor law, which links population variance to the sample mean. A natural question is whether other complex systems with integrated and segregated functional networks, such as the human brain, follow analogous scaling laws, and how these laws behave under synchronized activity. Addressing this is challenging because neural signals at all measurement scales contain both positive and negative values, whereas the Taylor law was developed for non-negative ecological data. To overcome this limitation, we replace the sample mean with the root mean square (RMS) of detrended neural activity and formulate a generalized spatial scaling law applicable to signed data. This framework extends spatial scaling obeying the Taylor law to neural systems and other complex systems across disciplines and allows examination of how coordinated, synchronized activity shapes these laws. Synchrony is quantified using a dedicated metric of functional coordination. Analytical derivations and numerical simulations using multivariate Poisson, binomial, uniform, and gamma distributions demonstrate that the scaling exponent is inversely related to synchrony. Applying this framework to human fMRI data from three large lifespan cohorts (N=840, ages 18 to 88) reveals distinct age-associated trajectories of the scaling exponent. Healthy aging is characterized by a substantial synchrony-induced reduction in the exponent. The synchrony and scaling relationship is stable during resting-state activity but progressively shifts during naturalistic tasks across the lifespan. Limbic, subcortical, and cerebellar regions show particularly strong synchrony and scaling coupling, indicating preservation at subnetwork levels. Finally, individuals with ADHD exhibit disrupted synchrony and scaling relationships, underscoring the potential clinical utility of this novel metric.

">Simultaneous Real-time Imaging of Neurofluid and Neurovascular Dynamics Using Ultrafast Flow-weighted Echo-Planar Imaging</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation is tightly coupled to cerebral blood flow under the fixed-volume constraint of the cranial vault, with cardiac pulsations and respiration acting as dominant physiological drivers. Disruption of these flow dynamics has been implicated in various neurological disorders, motivating the need for imaging methods that capture CSF and vascular flow simultaneously and in real time. Conventional phase contrast MRI (PC-MRI) provides quantitative CSF velocity measurements but relies on cardiac gating and velocity encoding, which limit temporal resolution, dynamic range, and sensitivity to non-cardiac fluctuations. Here, we introduce self-gated ultrafast real-time flow-weighted echo-planar imaging (SURF-EPI), an inflow-weighted approach in which signal intensity reflects the replacement of saturated spins by freshly inflowing, unsaturated water molecules, yielding higher signal with higher flow. This allows simultaneous assessment of arterial inflow, venous outflow, and CSF motion at high temporal resolution. SURF-EPI was acquired at the C2-C3 spinal level, enabling real-time imaging of CSF flow dynamics in the cervical spinal canal alongside arterial and venous blood flow in major cervical vessels (frame-rate: 21.7 Hz). In addition to frequency-domain analyses, we leveraged intrinsic arterial signal fluctuations as a timing reference to reconstruct cardiac-resolved CSF dynamics for individual cardiac cycles without external physiological recordings. Frequency-domain analysis revealed distinct spectral signatures in CSF flow compared with neurovascular flow, including broadened cardiac peaks and enhanced respiratory modulation, particularly within the ventral spinal canal. In contrast, dorsal CSF showed increased power within the cardiac frequency band, higher coherence with cervical vasculature at the cardiac frequency, and reduced non-cardiac contributions. Time-domain analysis showed strong correlation between CSF flow waveforms derived from SURF-EPI and PC-MRI. Beyond ensemble-averaged waveforms, SURF-EPI enabled beat-to-beat analysis, revealing substantial cycle-to-cycle variability in CSF flow that is not captured by time-averaged gated approaches. Together, these findings establish SURF-EPI as a rapid, complementary framework to PC-MRI, enabling real-time neurofluid imaging with integrated time- and frequency-domain characterization of CSF and neurovascular flow dynamics.

">Differential TDP-43 interactomes between the cortex and cerebellum in the mouse</a></h4>

              
                TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is the core pathogenic protein across a spectrum of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases, but its pathological deposition shows regional selectivity, with abundant TDP-43 positive aggregates in the frontal cortex and spinal cord, and a much lower burden in the cerebellum. In health, TDP-43 expression in the cerebellum is higher than in cortex, hence what underpins this differential vulnerability to TDP-43 aggregation is unclear. Here we demonstrate that in healthy C57Bl/6J mice not only is TDP-43 expression higher in the cerebellum than the cortex, but that this expression difference is driven primarily by differences in cytoplasmic load. Mass spectrometry analysis of TDP-43 pull downs from the cortex and cerebellum of healthy mice identified TDP-43 interactors across a number of core functional pathways, with numerous differences between the two brain regions. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD062532. Notably, there were more interactors identified in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions within the cortex than the cerebellum. Putative interactions with four core paraspeckle proteins; SFPQ, NONO, FUS and PSPC1 were confirmed using immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis. Follow up validation using proximity ligation assay showed abundant perinuclear cytoplasmic interactions between TDP-43 and all four paraspeckle proteins in both large motor cortex neurons and purkinje cells, with significantly reduced nuclear interactions detected in the motor cortex for SFPQ, FUS and PSPC1. These findings suggest that TDP-43-protein interactions markedly differ between the TDP-43 pathogenesis vulnerable cortex and relatively resistant cerebellum and exploring these differences may yield new insight into disease mechanisms within ALS/FTD.

">Direction-dependent bias in the perceived approach speed and its implications for robot motion design</a></h4>

              
                Humans frequently interact with robots that approach from different directions; however, how the approach direction systematically biases the perceived speed remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate a robust direction-dependent bias in the perceived approach speed, whereby objects approaching from behind are consistently perceived as moving faster than those approaching from the front are. Across five experiments using both physical robots and immersive virtual reality, this bias manifests as a systematic shift in the point of subjective equality without corresponding changes in discrimination sensitivity, indicating a perceptual bias rather than altered precision. We further show that this effect can be explained by body-induced differences in interocular velocity that arise when observers orient themselves toward stimuli approaching from behind. This bias persists in virtual environments and for nonrobotic objects, suggesting that it is driven primarily by visual factors rather than multisensory cues or robot-specific appearance. Together, these findings provide a perceptual foundation for incorporating approach direction into the design and evaluation of the motion behavior of robots in human-centered environments.

">Efferent projections of topographically distinct relaxin family peptide receptor-3 (RXFP3) lateral hypothalamus/zona incerta cells</a></h4>

              
                Relaxin family peptide receptor-3 (RXFP3) is a ligand-activated G-protein coupled receptor and the cognate receptor for the conserved neuropeptide relaxin-3. We recently demonstrated that chemogenetically activating an RXFP3-expressing population in the lateral hypothalamus and zona incerta (LH/ZIRXFP3) induced escape-like jumping behaviour following fear conditioning, but only in a subset of mice. Given the diverse hodology of the LH and ZI, we hypothesised that LH/ZIRXFP3 cells may consist of discrete subpopulations with unique connectivity patterns that govern different aspects of defensive behaviour. To explore this possibility, we unilaterally injected small volumes of a Cre-dependent anterograde viral tracer into four distinct sites of the LH/ZI in RXFP3-Cre mice and analysed their brain-wide efferent connectivity patterns. Each injection site group produced unique projection patterns, particularly to nuclei involved in threat and defensive behaviour. Of note were strong projections from the rostral ZI and anterior LH to the lateral habenula, and projections from the intermediate and caudal ZI to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. By combining retrograde tracing and RNAscope fluorescent in situ hybridisation, we identified that most LH/ZIRXFP3 projections to the lateral habenula arose from a subset of vGlut2-expressing lateral hypothalamus neurons, while most projections to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray arose from a subset of GAD1-expressing zona incerta neurons. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that LH/ZIRXFP3 cells exhibit distinct efferent projection patterns throughout the brain depending on their topographical location within these nuclei, likely reflecting the functional diversity of these neurons.

">Small RNA sequencing of human sural nerves identifies widespread microRNA dysregulation and Schwann cell-localized miR-21-5p in diabetic peripheral neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication of diabetes with no disease modifying treatments. Despite the prevalence, the molecular mechanisms of DPN are not fully characterized. Among the various molecular regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) control protein synthesis and are essential for normal development and homeostasis, with dysregulation implicated in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we performed small RNA-sequencing to profile the miRNA landscape of human sural nerves from individuals with and without DPN. Our analysis revealed that nearly 10% of all miRNAs detected are dysregulated and among those 74% are significantly downregulated in DPN. Target gene enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed miRNAs yielded pathways significantly associated with nerve regeneration, metabolic dysfunction, and immune cell activity. In particular, miR-21-5p is significantly upregulated in DPN, showed a positive association with axonal loss severity, and localizes to Schwann cells, consistent with its broader role as an injury- and inflammation-responsive miRNA that shifts from early pro-regenerative functions to maladaptive, inflammation-amplifying effects that impair Schwann cell mediated nerve repair. These results suggest that miRNAs may contribute to peripheral nerve degeneration by promoting inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and impaired nerve regeneration, while also opening potential avenues for biomarker discovery and therapeutic intervention.

">Systematic fMRI signal differences across cohorts alter lifespan connectome trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale lifespan neuroimaging studies increasingly integrate data across distinct cohorts to characterize trajectories of brain development and aging. However, systematic differences in acquisition protocols and hardware across cohorts can alter signal characteristics in ways that bias downstream analyses. Here we examine three cohorts from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), spanning development (HCP-D), young adulthood (HCP-YA) and aging samples (HCP-A), to illustrate this issue and evaluate existing strategies to mitigate it. HCP has set standards for open, deeply phenotyped, high-resolution human neuroimaging, which are frequently used as high-quality reference datasets in tool validation, replication studies, and cross-cohort meta-analyses. Because of HCP's widespread usage, even modest protocol differences between cohorts-and their downstream effects-can have outsized impacts on the field of neuroscience research. Our analysis reveals that the HCP-YA cohort exhibits systematically weaker temporal signal-to-noise-ratio (tSNR) relative to HCP-D/A. These signal quality discrepancies propagate to downstream analyses, leading to differences in overall resting-state functional correlations, and whole-brain and node-level measures of resting-state network organization (e.g., system segregation, modularity, participation coefficient). Consistent with protocol-driven signal differences, resting-state network measures derived from HCP-YA depart from expected lifespan trajectories, as confirmed by examination of two other lifespan datasets. Harmonization approaches accounting for protocol and scanner-model differences alleviate some of the artifactual differences in brain network measurement. Our findings underscore that signal differences do not merely introduce noise, but can qualitatively alter estimated lifespan trajectories of functional network organization, including partially inverting expected lifespan patterns. Without appropriate harmonization, analyses that combine HCP cohorts can therefore result in biologically misleading inferences about development and aging. We demonstrate how small acquisition differences bias resting-state-derived network metrics, and how these effects can be mitigated. This work advances best practices for valid inferences in multi-cohort lifespan neuroscience research.

">Reproductive history differentially shapes the neural response of middle-aged females to estradiol therapy after a metabolic challenge</a></h4>

              
                Background: Advancing age, the APOEe4 allele, and female sex are the top nonmodifiable risk factors for Alzheimers disease (AD). Female-specific experiences, such as parity and hormone therapy (HT) affect aging biomarkers such as metabolism and immune signaling and may even affect AD risk. Estradiol (E2), a common component of many HTs, affects cognition and brain health in aging females although this may vary depending on parity, genotype, and metabolic status. We hypothesized that prior parity influences brain and metabolic health, including response to E2, depending on APOE genotype. Methods: Middle-aged female (10 month) wildtype (WT) or humanized (h) APOEe3 or e4 expressing rats, with different reproductive experience (nulliparous or primiparous) were fed a Western (WD) or standard diet (SD) for 2 months. In the second month, rats were given E2 or vehicle (oil) injections daily. Fear associative learning, plasma metabolic hormones, hippocampal inflammatory signalling, and neuroplasticity (neurogenesis, synaptic protein) were assessed. Results: Females fed a WD gained weight and displayed metabolic dysregulation, regardless of genotype. E2 treatment reduced WD-induced weight gain and reduced metabolic hormones, with stronger effects in WT rats. E2 treatment increased dorsal hippocampal inflammatory signalling selectively in primiparous hAPOEe4 females fed a WD. Previous parity increased neurogenesis and reduced certain cytokines in the hippocampus of middle-aged WT rats under a SD. Both E2 treatment and previous parity decreased dorsal neurogenesis in hippocampus of hAPOEe4 rats. In hAPOEe4 females, higher weight was associated with reduced contextual fear memory, an effect driven by primiparous females. In the cued fear conditioning task, hAPOEe4 females displayed better cued fear memory than WT, however, WD exposure reduced cued fear memory in this group. Together, this indicates that diet and weight gain may be more detrimental to associative memory in hAPOEe4 females and that E2 treatment has more favourable outcomes in WT rats. Conclusions: Previous parity alters how females respond to E2 and metabolic stress in midlife. Primiparous hAPOEe4 females were especially vulnerable to the effects of WD and E2, exhibiting more inflammation, impaired memory, and reduced weight-loss. These findings highlight the importance of considering parity and genotype when evaluating midlife metabolic and cognitive risk.

">Aerobic Exercise Preserves Capillary Oxygen Homeostasis and Neurovascular Function in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Age-related cerebrovascular dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a critical contributor to cognitive decline and Alzheimers disease (AD) progression, yet the extent to which lifestyle interventions preserve microvascular oxygen delivery remains poorly defined. Physical activity (PA) improves vascular health and cognition in humans, but its impact on capillary-level oxygenation and functional hyperemia during aging and amyloid pathology is unknown. Here, we longitudinally quantified microvascular oxygen tension and stimulus-evoked oxygen dynamics in awake APP/PS1 mice and wild-type littermates using two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy. Chronic aerobic PA initiated in early adulthood preserved basal arteriolar, capillary, and venular oxygenation, prevented age-dependent increases in microvascular heterogeneity, and mitigated excessive oxygen extraction in preclinical AD mice. While amyloid pathology impaired stimulus-evoked oxygen responses across vascular compartments, PA selectively enhanced capillary dilation and accelerated hyperemic kinetics without altering vascular density or architecture. Notably, sedentary AD mice developed widespread capillary hypoxia and bimodal oxygen distributions, hallmarks of malignant microvascular dysfunction, which were largely absent in physically active animals. These findings demonstrate that routine aerobic PA preserves microvascular oxygen homeostasis and functional responsiveness during aging and amyloid accumulation, supporting a capillary-centric mechanism through which exercise confers neurovascular resilience in preclinical AD.

">Joint Pupillometry and Heart Rate Monitoring Identify Zone-Like High Performance in Esports</a></h4>

              
                Zone-like states, defined as high objective performance with low subjective workload, are sought in esports and other demanding digital activities, yet subjective flow does not consistently index efficient performance. We hypothesized that zone-like high performance is supported by regulated arousal dynamics rather than strongly elevated arousal responses, and that such episodes can be detected from the combined dynamics of heart rate and pupil diameter. Fourteen healthy young adult men completed repeated sessions of a one-versus-one fighting game under three contexts: passive watching, play against a computer-controlled opponent, and competition against a human opponent. Heart rate and pupil diameter were recorded continuously, and subjective flow (Sports Flow Scale), subjective workload (NASA Task Load Index), and in-game performance metrics were assessed. Two-dimensional k-means clustering of heart rate and pupil changes relative to the watching condition revealed three arousal-reactivity profiles. Sessions with larger physiological deviations showed higher flow and higher workload but poorer performance. Sessions with smaller deviations showed higher performance with lower workload despite only moderate flow. Nonlinear analyses indicated inverted-U relationships between physiological deviations and performance, with peak performance occurring when heart rate and pupil responses remained close to the watching baseline during active play. These findings indicate that combined heart rate and pupillometry measures provide a useful multimodal physiological marker for identifying efficient high-performance states and for informing strategies to support performance while managing workload in cognitively demanding digital activities.

">Temporal Patterns of Brain Network Plasticity During the Onset and Maintenance of Neuropathic Pain in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain arises from complex peripheral and central mechanisms and induces long-lasting maladaptive changes in the brain. To investigate the temporal dynamics of these changes, we examined resting-state functional connectivity (FC) in a mouse model of neuropathic pain across its initiation and maintenance phases. Using functional ultrasound imaging to capture whole-brain FC over disease progression, we conducted two complementary studies: a longitudinal assessment in anesthetized animals and an analysis of awake cohorts at distinct disease stages. Both exploratory and literature-guided analyses revealed that FC across most large-scale networks remained remarkably stable during pain maintenance. In contrast, pain onset was marked by enhanced FC between key regions involved in sensory, emotional, and motivational processing, including the motor cortex and nucleus accumbens, the prelimbic and insular cortices, and the infralimbic cortex and hypothalamus. As pain persisted, we observed reduced FC within the somatomotor network, reflecting functional disconnection. Additionally, postsurgical pain alone produced enduring FC changes within the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and insula, indicating long-term central plasticity independent of neuropathic injury. Together, these findings reveal dynamic, network-specific adaptations that distinguish the onset and maintenance phases of neuropathic pain and surgery-related plasticity.

">Neuronal cell line expressing full-length mutant huntingtin exhibits alterations in proteolysis</a></h4>

              
                Polyglutamine diseases are incurable genetic neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of mutant proteins with extended polyglutamine fragments, which are prone to the formation of poorly soluble aggregates. The establishment of adequate cellular models is crucial in uncovering the pathological mechanisms responsible for neurotoxicity in HD, screening for therapeutic molecules and elucidation of the molecular mechanisms impacted by particular compound. In the present study, genetic constructs based on the Sleeping Beauty system were created for the stable inducible expression of full-length normal and mutant huntingtin in eukaryotic cells. These constructs were then employed to develop model neuronal cells using Neuro-2a cell line. The expression of huntingtin as well as the accumulation of Htt-immunopositive intracellular aggregates (most characteristic features of HD) was demonstrated, and these aggregates mostly colocalized with the proteasome. The activation of the proteasome, as well as changes in the expression of proteasome regulators, components of the autophagy system, and the protease cathepsin D, reflect the versatility of cellular responses to the destructive mutant Htt pathological forms.

">Microglial epigenetic memory is associated with accelerated resolution of inflammatory pain induced by prophylactic macrophage-derived small extracellular vesicles</a></h4>

              
                Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) including exosomes play an important role in intercellular communication and can exert immunomodulatory effects in recipient cells. We have shown that a single prophylactic intrathecal injection of sEVs from RAW 264.7 macrophages two weeks prior, promotes faster resolution of mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) mouse model of inflammatory pain. How this long-term memory develops, and how sEVs regulate immune responses are unknown. Recent studies have shown that priming microglia with inflammatory stimuli can enhance or suppress responses to a delayed secondary insult via epigenetic modifications. We hypothesized that prophylactic intrathecal administration of macrophage-derived sEVs confers accelerated resolution of inflammatory pain by reprogramming epigenetic memory in spinal microglia in recipient CFA model mice. To determine whether prophylactic sEVs could attenuate pain in the absence of microglia when administering sEVs, we ablated microglia using a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, PLX5622. sEV-induced pain prophylaxis was completely abolished in PLX5622-fed mice, indicating that microglia are required to be present during sEV administration to confer early resolution of inflammatory pain hypersensitivity. ChIP-seq analysis in spinal microglia 14 days after sEV administration (prior to CFA) revealed an increased number of gene loci enriched for H3K4me1, a hallmark of innate immune memory. Furthermore, inhibiting the H3K4 mono-methyltransferase SETD7 abolished sEV-induced pain attenuation. Our findings indicate that both microglia and its epigenetic reprogramming contribute to pain prophylaxis induced by macrophage-derived sEVs, providing novel insights into the development of non-addictive preventive analgesia.

">A Cell-Based Assay to Categorize Variants of Human Succinate Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Many genes are implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a result of sequencing the genomes of individuals with ASD, however in most cases it remains unclear which genes are playing causative roles. ALDH5A1, which encodes the enzyme succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH), an important regulator of GABA metabolism, is causative in the syndrome SSADH deficiency and is also implicated in ASD. However, it is unknown how variants found in ASD affect SSADH function. We developed a yeast growth assay that models SSADH deficiency to quantify the functional impact of seven ALDH5A1 variants found in ASD. In this assay, expression of human ALDH5A1 partially complemented the growth defect caused by deletion of the ALDH5A1 ortholog UGA2. Using growth rate measurements, we calculated functional scores for 27 variants divided into calibration and ASD test variant groups. Functional scores for benign and pathogenic calibration variants segregated accordingly, validating the assay, while ASD variants displayed a range of activities from complete loss to normal function. Comparisons with published enzymatic assays and computational predictions showed broad agreement, while also identifying some limitations of these approaches.

">Guessing reveals internal models of perceptual precision</a></h4>

              
                When observers lack sufficient information to support a confident response, they often guess. Guessing plays a pervasive role in visual cognition and working memory, yet the mechanisms that govern how observers generate guesses remain poorly understood. Standard models traditionally assume that responses produced in the absence of information are either uniformly distributed over feature space or are perhaps weighted towards prevailing environmental statistics. In contrast, here we consider an intriguing alternative: that guesses incorporate observers' knowledge of their own perceptual capacities. We empirically measured guessing by eliciting responses under extreme target uncertainty (Experiment 1) as well as a novel '0ms presentation' approach in which no stimulus appeared but subjects believed one had (Experiment 2). We evaluated three accounts of guesses under these conditions: unsystematic (lapse) responding, biases toward environmental statistics, and a self-representational account in which guesses reflect observers' knowledge of their own feature-dependent precision (e.g., preferring to guess feature values they believe they would be likely to miss). Guess responses were non-uniform and systematically biased toward feature values typically encoded with the least precision (e.g., oblique orientations) - a counterintuitive bias away from high-frequency, high-fidelity feature values (e.g., cardinal orientations). This complementary relationship between guessing and perceptual fidelity held within individuals and across paradigms, and was recoverable via an empirical-guess mixture model that replaced the standard uniform assumption with empirically measured guess distributions. Our findings challenge prevailing views that guesses reflect random noise, and suggest instead that guessing behavior reflects metacognitive knowledge of internal precision. Rather than defaulting to environmental priors, observers appear to model their own sensory limitations and leverage these representations to inform decisions in the absence of evidence. These results reframe guessing as a theoretically informative behavior that expresses observers' own beliefs about their perceptual capacities.

">The influence of force on the encoding and perception of affective touch</a></h4>

              
                Stroking touch has been shown to be most pleasant at intermediate velocities of 1-10 cm.s-1, which relates well to activity of C-low threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs), also called C-tactile afferents in humans, that have been implicated in encoding positive affective touch. This well-established finding has been demonstrated at gentle stroking forces (typically 0.4 N peak normal force), yet few studies have investigated the effect of force on the perception of stroking touch or on the activity of C-LTMRs. Presently, we investigated the perceptual pleasantness and intensity of stroking touch (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 cm.s-1) at different forces (0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0 N) on hairy forearm skin and compared this to responses from C-LTMRs during stroking touch at the same velocities, but over fewer forces (0.05, 0.4, 1.5 N). We found significant effects of stroking velocity and force for both tactile pleasantness and intensity ratings. Pleasantness showed the typical inverted-U shaped relationship over stroking velocities, but this was modified by force: higher forces significantly decreased pleasantness at faster velocities. Conversely, tactile intensity increased linearly with both increasing velocity and force. Recordings from five C-LTMRs showed that their firing frequency changed with stroking velocity, but that they were strongly modulated by force. Overall, we demonstrate the profound effect that force has on the perception of stroking touch, where tactile pleasantness and intensity appear to be a multi-faceted construct that are related to C-LTMR and A{beta}-LTMR activity, respectively, but that the firing in individual mechanoreceptor populations cannot fully account for percepts.

">CASK hypomorph mice display cone photoreceptor dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Variants in the X-linked gene CASK are associated with neurodevelopmental defects. Animal model studies have demonstrated that conditions such as cerebellar hypoplasia, microcephaly, and optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) are related to loss-of-function (LOF) in the CASK gene. CASK variants are associated with multiple ocular conditions spanning both anterior and posterior segments of the eye including retinopathies. Both Cask heterozygous knockout (+/-) mice and Cask knock-in (KI) mice with reduced Cask expression have been shown to display ONH. Cask (+/-) mice displayed no defects in retinal structure or function. Here, we have systematically examined the Cask (KI) mice. Our results demonstrate that the anterior segment of the eye in Cask (KI) mice does not display any obvious phenotype. Cask (KI) mice however show a reduced visual acuity in optomotor response. The retina of Cask (KI) mice does not exhibit any major changes in their structure, vasculature, or gene expression pattern. We, however, uncovered a specific dysfunction of the cone receptor in Cask (KI) mice using electroretinogram (ERG). Mechanistically this dysfunction arises due to lowered levels of cone-specific opsin (opsin1mw) in Cask (KI) mice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of retinal dysfunction in an animal model with CASK gene suppression. We infer that like ONH and cerebellar hypoplasia, retinopathy also may represent CASK LOF.

                <p>The nigrostriatal and mesoaccumbal dopamine systems are thought to contribute to changes in behavior and learning during adolescence, yet it is unclear how the rise in gonadal hormones at puberty impacts the function of these systems. We studied the impact of prepubertal gonadectomy (GDX) on later evoked dopamine release in male <I>Mus spicilegus</I>, a mouse whose adolescent life history has been carefully characterized in the wild and laboratory. To examine how puberty impacts dopamine neuron function in <I>M. spicilegus</I> males, we removed the gonads prepubertally at postnatal day (P)25 and then examined evoked dopamine release in the dorsomedial, dorsolateral (DLS), and nucleus accumbens core regions of striatal slices at P60&ndash;70 (late adolescence/early adulthood). To measure dopamine release, we used near-infrared catecholamine nanosensors which enable study of spatial distribution of dopamine release. We found that prepubertal GDX led to a significantly reduced density of dopamine release sites and reduced dopamine release at each site in the DLS nigrostriatal system compared with sham controls. In contrast, mesoaccumbal dopamine release was comparable between sham and gonadectomized groups. Our data suggest that during adolescence, the development of the nigrostriatal dopamine system is significantly affected by the rise in gonadal hormones in males, while the mesoaccumbal system shows no detectable sensitivity at this time point. These data are consistent with molecular studies in rodents that suggest nigrostriatal neurons are sensitive to androgens at puberty and extend our understanding of how gonadal hormones could impact the spatial distribution and release potential of dopamine terminals in the striatum.</p>

                Abstract* The global environmental crisis exposes the flaws of current approaches and highlights the importance of spiritual and locally based ecological ethics. This research examines how Islamic values and Javanese traditional culture are incorporated into environmental rituals at the community level in Selorejo, Malang, Indonesia, as a local response to environmental issues. The primary aim is to illustrate how the incorporation of Islamic values and Javanese traditions constitutes dynamic ecological rituals that foster environmental conservation from both global and local points of view. Using a qualitative ethnographic method, data were collected through three primary techniques: participant observation of community ecological rituals, in-depth interviews with traditional leaders, local community, and local residents involved in conservation efforts. Thematic analysis was applied, utilizing frameworks of acculturation and ecophy. Results reveal that Selorejo’s ecological rituals include six rites: Merti Wono (Selametan Alas), Selametan Sumber, Jogo Wono Performing Arts (Wong Ireng), Jagong Alas, Boundary Marking and Reforestation, and Eco-friendly Agriculture. The rites of Selametan Alas and Sumber demonstrate the fusion of Islamic principles with Javanese traditions, viewing nature as a sacred reflection of God. This combination enhances ecological awareness and establishes a spiritual model of conservation rooted in ecosophy. Such a model presents a relevant global ecological citizenship alternative and supports the achievement of SDGs. This study confirms that spiritually based local ecological rituals can contribute to global ecological citizenship and provide an alternative approach to environmental crises.

                In orofacial inflammatory pain, mitochondrial transfer from glial cells to neurons was poorly understood. Li et al. demonstrate that glia-to-neuron mitochondrial transfer attenuates inflammatory hyperexcitability and pain by restoring mitophagy and calcium homeostasis through an ATL1-dependent mechanism, revealing promising therapeutic targets.

In contrast, callosal projecting neurons do not receive projections from the opposite hemisphere and are primarily monocular. Furthermore, they show that binocularity and excitability scale with callosal input.
