	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline and neuropathology including amyloid beta (A&amp;amp;beta;) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (tau). Factors initiating or driving these pathologies remain unclear, though microbes have been increasingly implicated. Our data and others&amp;amp;rsquo; findings indicate that microbes may be common constituents of the brain. It is notable that A&amp;amp;beta; and tau have antimicrobial properties, suggesting a response to microbes in the brain. We used 16S rRNA sequencing to compare major bacterial phyla in post-mortem tissues from individuals exhibiting a range of neuropathology and cognitive status in two brain regions variably affected in AD. Our data indicate that strong regional differences exist, driven in part by the varied presence of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. We confirmed our data using ELISA of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid in the same brain tissue. We identified a potential association between the composition of phyla and the presence of neuropathology but not cognitive status. Declining cognition and increasing pathology correlated closely with serum LPS, but not brain levels of LPS, although brain LPS showed a strong negative correlation with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Collectively, our data suggest a region-specific heterogeneity of microbial populations in brain tissue potentially associated with neurodegenerative pathology.</p>

	<p>This study aims to understand the cognitive profiles of cerebellar infarction patients and compare them to those with supratentorial infarctions, particularly frontal infarctions. This current study also aims to find reliable assessment tools for detecting cognitive impairment in cerebellar infarction patients. A total of fifty cerebellar infarction patients, sixty supratentorial infarction patients, and thirty-nine healthy controls were recruited. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Addenbrooke&amp;amp;rsquo;s Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III), and Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome scale (CCAS-s) were used to assess global cognitive function. An extensive neuropsychological assessment battery was also tested to evaluate the characteristics of each cognitive domain. To assess the features of cognitive function, a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation tool was also utilized. The cerebral infarction patients demonstrated cognitive impairment comparable to those with frontal infarcts, notably characterized by disturbance in attention and executive function. However, the degree of cognitive impairment was comparatively milder in cerebellar infarction patients. Furthermore, the patients in the cerebellar group had worse scores in the ACE-III and CCAS-s compared to healthy controls. The two assessments also demonstrated a significant area under the curve values, indicating their effectiveness in distinguishing cognitive impairment in cerebellar infarctions. In conclusion, cognitive impairment in a cerebellar infarction resembles frontal lobe dysfunction but is generally mild. It can be accurately assessed using the ACE-III and CCAS-s scales.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-731/v1?src=rss">Differential physical interactions of wild-type and S59L mutant CHCHD10 with mitochondrial proteases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background CHCHD10 is a small mitochondrial protein with a C-terminal coiled-coil-helix–coiled-coil-helix domain. The N-terminal region of CHCHD10 is mostly intrinsically disordered. Therefore, CHCHD10 has no catalytic activity other than protein-protein interactions through the CHCH domain or intrinsically disordered region. The S59L mutation in CHCHD10 has been identified as a genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. However, the disease-causing mechanisms of CHCHD10S59L are not yet fully understood. Our previous study showed that CHCHD10S59L induces PINK1 and Parkin accumulation. PINK1 stabilization in the mitochondria is dependent on proteolytic processing by mitochondrial proteases. It has also been reported that mutant CHCHD10 disrupts protein homeostasis within mitochondria. Therefore, we hypothesized that CHCHD10S59L physically interacts with mitochondrial proteases during the disease pathogenesis. Methods To test this hypothesis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation using transiently transfected wild-type and mutant S59L CHCHD10 in HeLa cells. We employed a dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) cross-linker to detect transient physical interactions. Results We expected that CHCHD10S59L may activate mitochondrial protease processing or expression and that it interacts with more diverse mitochondrial proteases than the wild type. In general, however, there was no difference in the expression and processing levels of mitochondrial proteases and the proteases that interact with wild-type and CHCHD10S59L. LonP1 degrading unfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix was the major proteases that can bind to wild-type CHCHD10 and CHCHD10S59L. LonP1 and HtrA2 were significantly less strongly bound to CHCHD10S59L. Conclusions This result can be interpreted in many different ways, including the regulatory role of CHCHD10 in mitochondrial proteases. However, more precise biochemical and cell biological investigations are required to determine the role of CHCHD10 in the activity of mitochondrial proteases, mechanism of PINK1 stabilization, and disruption of mitochondrial proteostasis.

                Background Community chemists now provide more professional and public health care, which is beneficial to the community, in addition to traditional medication distribution. While community pharmacists play a vital role in maintaining and promoting health, further research is required to accurately evaluate their knowledge, attitude, and practice toward oral health care among Jordanian pharmacists in northern Jordan. Methods A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted using an anonymous self-administered questionnaire in Arabic language, targeting 250 community pharmacists in four cities (Irbid, Jerash, Ajloun, and Al-Mafraq) in northern Jordan. The questionnaire comprised four domains: socio-demographic, knowledge, attitudes and practice concerning oral health care. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 22.0 was used to analyze the collected data, and the significance level was set at P ≤ 0.05. Results A total of 198 respondents returned the survey form, returning a response rate of 79.2%. Community pharmacists showed a good knowledge score of 58.2%. Only 40.9% said periodontal disease was the most frequent cause of tooth loss. The majority lacked knowledge of the optimal fluoride levels in toothpaste. The average attitude score was 71.05%. The most common oral health issues raised by patients were gingivitis and toothache (43.4% and 38.9%), respectively. Conclusion Community pharmacists have the general knowledge and attitude needed to play a significant role in providing dental care counselling to patients dental care. Nonetheless, community pharmacists stated they needed education and training to improve their practice. Continuing education courses related to oral health are recommended to reduce the risk of oral diseases and improve quality of life.

                Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) commonly affects individuals within the working age group, often resulting in unemployment, particularly in low- to middle-income countries. The purpose of the study was to determine the return to work (RTW) rate of individuals with CVD after cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and the impact of impairment and socio-demographics on the individual’s ability to (RTW). Methods A cross-sectional survey, namely the Work Rehabilitation Questionnaire (WORQ) was used to gather the information. The IBM SPSS software (version 25) was used to manage the statistical analysis. Individuals who completed a CR program between the ages of 18 and 64 years made up a sample of 63 research participants. Results The RTW rate reported that only 30 (47.6%) of the participants successfully RTW after CR and 33 (52.4%) of participants did not RTW. The results also indicated that the older the individual and the higher the degree of impairment experienced, the less likely RTW would occur. Conclusion Factors such as the age and level of functional impairment of the individual with CVD must be addressed more aggressively in CR programs, particularly if the goal of the individual with CVD is to RTW.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-729/v1?src=rss">Women’s representation in higher leadership positions in Ethiopia in the last three decades since 1991 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Gender equality in decision-making positions is crucial to achieving the goals of good governance, peace, democracy, and inclusive/sustainable development. The major aim of this research article is to investigate the representation trend of women in higher decision-making positions over the last thirty years, since 1991. The federal three organs of government (law formulating, law enforcing, and law interpreting bodies) were the focus of this research. This research is a mixed type of research that inculcates both qualitative and quantitative data types. Secondary data sources from relevant government institutions were mostly used. The data was analyzed through content analysis of documents and presented via descriptive data presenting techniques. The research findings reveal that although women’s representation in positions of decision-making has advanced considerably in recent years, the empirical data throughout the previous thirty years demonstrated the underrepresentation of women in higher leadership positions within the Ethiopian federal government. Furthermore, Women never held certain higher-level government leadership positions, such as the Prime Minister position, which seems to be forbidden for women. Women made up 23%, 19%, 19%, and 24% of the House of Peoples Representatives (HPR), the House of Federation (HoF), ministerial posts, and judicial bodies, respectively over the last three decades. Women are visibly underrepresented in the executive positions as compared to others. Thus, substantial policy and practical initiatives are needed to remove institutional, social, and economic barriers to boost women’s advanced visibility in senior leadership roles.

                <p>by Paul Schmidt-Barbo, Gabriel Kalweit, Mehdi Naouar, Lisa Paschold, Edith Willscher, Christoph Schultheiß, Bruno Märkl, Stefan Dirnhofer, Alexandar Tzankov, Mascha Binder, Maria Kalweit</p>

The classification of B cell lymphomas—mainly based on light microscopy evaluation by a pathologist—requires many years of training. Since the B cell receptor (BCR) of the lymphoma clonotype and the microenvironmental immune architecture are important features discriminating different lymphoma subsets, we asked whether BCR repertoire next-generation sequencing (NGS) of lymphoma-infiltrated tissues in conjunction with machine learning algorithms could have diagnostic utility in the subclassification of these cancers. We trained a random forest and a linear classifier via logistic regression based on patterns of clonal distribution, VDJ gene usage and physico-chemical properties of the top-n most frequently represented clonotypes in the BCR repertoires of 620 paradigmatic lymphoma samples—nodular lymphocyte predominant B cell lymphoma (NLPBL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)—alongside with 291 control samples. With regard to DLBCL and CLL, the models demonstrated optimal performance when utilizing only the most prevalent clonotype for classification, while in NLPBL—that has a dominant background of non-malignant bystander cells—a broader array of clonotypes enhanced model accuracy. Surprisingly, the straightforward logistic regression model performed best in this seemingly complex classification problem, suggesting linear separability in our chosen dimensions. It achieved a weighted F1-score of 0.84 on a test cohort including 125 samples from all three lymphoma entities and 58 samples from healthy individuals. Together, we provide proof-of-concept that at least the 3 studied lymphoma entities can be differentiated from each other using BCR repertoire NGS on lymphoma-infiltrated tissues by a trained machine learning model.

                <p>by Zhenxing Liu, Chongyu Liao, Luming Zou, Minghui Jin, Yinxue Shan, Yudong Quan, Hui Yao, Lei Zhang, Peng Wang, Zhuangzhuang Liu, Na Wang, Anjing Li, Kaiyu Liu, Bruce E. Tabashnik, David G. Heckel, Kongming Wu, Yutao Xiao</p>

The vegetative insecticidal protein Vip3Aa from <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) has been produced by transgenic crops to counter pest resistance to the widely used crystalline (Cry) insecticidal proteins from Bt. To proactively manage pest resistance, there is an urgent need to better understand the genetic basis of resistance to Vip3Aa, which has been largely unknown. We discovered that retrotransposon-mediated alternative splicing of a midgut-specific chitin synthase gene was associated with 5,560-fold resistance to Vip3Aa in a laboratory-selected strain of the fall armyworm, a globally important crop pest. The same mutation in this gene was also detected in a field population. Knockout of this gene via CRISPR/Cas9 caused high levels of resistance to Vip3Aa in fall armyworm and 2 other lepidopteran pests. The insights provided by these results could help to advance monitoring and management of pest resistance to Vip3Aa.

The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has become a major threat to public health, requiring swift initiatives for discovering new strategies to control bacterial infections. Hence, antibiotic stewardship and rapid diagnostics, but also the development, and prudent use, of novel effective antimicrobial agents are paramount. Ideally, these agents should be less likely to select for resistance in pathogens than currently available conventional antimicrobials. The usage of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), key components of the innate immune response, and combination therapies, have been proposed as strategies to diminish the emergence of resistance. Herein, we investigated whether newly developed random antimicrobial peptide mixtures (RPMs) can significantly reduce the risk of resistance evolution in vitro to that of single sequence AMPs, using the ESKAPE pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>) as a model gram-negative bacterium. Infections of this pathogen are difficult to treat due the inherent resistance to many drug classes, enhanced by the capacity to form biofilms. <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> was experimentally evolved in the presence of AMPs or RPMs, subsequentially assessing the extent of resistance evolution and cross-resistance/collateral sensitivity between treatments. Furthermore, the fitness costs of resistance on bacterial growth were studied and whole-genome sequencing used to investigate which mutations could be candidates for causing resistant phenotypes. Lastly, changes in the pharmacodynamics of the evolved bacterial strains were examined. Our findings suggest that using RPMs bears a much lower risk of resistance evolution compared to AMPs and mostly prevents cross-resistance development to other treatments, while maintaining (or even improving) drug sensitivity. This strengthens the case for using random cocktails of AMPs in favour of single AMPs, against which resistance evolved in vitro, providing an alternative to classic antibiotics worth pursuing.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>We investigated whether patients with large infarct and the presence or absence of perfusion mismatch are associated with endovascular treatment benefit.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a post-hoc analysis of the Endovascular Therapy in Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion with a Large Infarct (ANGEL-ASPECT) randomized trial, which enrolled patients within 24 hours of onset with ASPECTS 3 to 5 or ASPECTS 0 to 2 with an infarct core 70 to 100 ml. Mismatch ratio was defined as time-to-maximum (T<sub>max</sub>) &gt;6 s cerebral volume/ischemic core volume, and mismatch volume was defined as T<sub>max</sub> &gt;6 s volume minus ischemic core volume. We divided patients into mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml, and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml groups. The primary outcome was the 90-day modified Rankin Scale score ordinal distribution. Safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and 90-day mortality.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were 425 patients included. In both the mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml (mismatch+, <i>n</i> = 395; mismatch−, <i>n</i> = 31) and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml groups (mismatch+, <i>n</i> = 346; mismatch−, <i>n</i> = 80), better 90-day modified Rankin Scale outcomes were found in the endovascular treatment group compared with the MM group (4 [2–5] vs 4 [3–5], common odds ratio [cOR], 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.001; 4 [2–5] vs 4 [3–5], cOR, 1.9, 95% CI 1.3–2.8, <i>p</i> = 0.001, respectively), but not in patients without mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml (5 [3–6] vs 5 [4–6], cOR, 1.2, 95% CI 0.3–4.1, <i>p</i> = 0.83), and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml (4 [3–6] vs 5 [3–6], cOR, 1.2, 95% CI 0.6–2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.60). However, no interaction effect was found in both subgroups (<i>p</i> interaction &gt;0.10).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Endovascular treatment was more efficacious than MM in patients with mismatch profiles, but no treatment effect or interaction was noted in the no mismatch profile patients. However, the small sample size of patients with no mismatch may have underpowered our analysis. A pooled analysis of large core trials stratified by mismatch is warranted.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a condition that occurs commonly in children from infancy through adolescence and is a global health concern. Pediatric TBI presents with a bimodal age distribution, with very young children (0–4 years) and adolescents (15–19 years) more commonly injured. Because children's brains are still developing, there is increased vulnerability to the effects of head trauma, which results in entirely different patterns of injury than in adults. Pediatric TBI has a profound and lasting impact on a child's development and quality of life, resulting in long-lasting consequences to physical, cognitive, and emotional development. Chronic issues like learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and emotional disturbances can develop. Early intervention and ongoing support are critical for minimizing these long-term deficits. Many animal models of TBI exist, and each varies significantly, displaying different characteristics of clinical TBI. The neurodevelopment differs in the rodent from the human in timing and effect, so TBI outcomes in the juvenile rodent can thus vary from the human child. The current review compares findings from preclinical TBI work in juvenile and adult rodents to clinical TBI research in pediatric and adult humans. We focus on the four brain regions most affected by TBI: the prefrontal cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. Each has its unique developmental projections and thus is impacted by TBI differently. This review aims to compare the healthy neurodevelopment of these four brain regions in humans to the developmental processes in rodents.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.25366?af=R">Gray matter alterations in Huntington's disease: A meta‐analysis of VBM neuroimaging studies</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increasing neuroimaging studies have attempted to identify biomarkers of Huntington's disease (HD) progression. Here, we conducted voxel-based meta-analyses of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies on HD to investigate the evolution of gray matter volume (GMV) alterations and explore the effects of genetic and clinical features on GMV changes. A systematic review was performed to identify the relevant studies. Meta-analyses of whole-brain VBM studies were performed to assess the regional GMV changes in all HD mutation carriers, in presymptomatic HD (pre-HD), and in symptomatic HD (sym-HD). A quantitative comparison was performed between pre-HD and sym-HD. Meta-regression analyses were used to explore the effects of genetic and clinical features on GMV changes. Twenty-eight studies were included, comparing a total of 1811 HD mutation carriers [including 1150 pre-HD and 560 sym-HD] and 969 healthy controls (HCs). Pre-HD showed decreased GMV in the bilateral caudate nuclei, putamen, insula, anterior cingulate/paracingulate gyri, middle temporal gyri, and left dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus compared with HCs. Compared with pre-HD, GMV decrease in sym-HD extended to the bilateral median cingulate/paracingulate gyri, Rolandic operculum and middle occipital gyri, left amygdala, and superior temporal gyrus. Meta-regression analyses found that age, mean lengths of CAG repeats, and disease burden were negatively associated with GMV atrophy of the bilateral caudate and right insula in all HD mutation carriers. This meta-analysis revealed the pattern of GMV changes from pre-HD to sym-HD, prompting the understanding of HD progression. The pattern of GMV changes may be biomarkers for disease progression in HD.</p>

                Solid pseudo-papillary tumors (SPT) of the pancreas are rare neoplasms accounting for less than 2% of all pancreatic tumors and primarily affecting young women. They are generally characterized by a clinical and radiological polymorphism. In most cases, complete surgical resection is curative. We report a case of a young woman presenting with a pancreatic tumor revealed through a vague non-specific abdominal pain. The diagnosis was based on the histological examination of the surgically-removed piece.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92543">Systemic pharmacological suppression of neural activity reverses learning impairment in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome</a></h4>

              
                The enhancement of associative synaptic plasticity often results in impaired rather than enhanced learning. Previously, we proposed that such learning impairments can result from saturation of the plasticity mechanism (Nguyen-Vu et al., 2017), or, more generally, from a history-dependent change in the threshold for plasticity. This hypothesis was based on experimental results from mice lacking two class I major histocompatibility molecules, MHCI H2-K<sup>b</sup> and H2-D<sup>b</sup> (MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup>), which have enhanced associative long-term depression at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses in the cerebellum (PF-Purkinje cell LTD). Here, we extend this work by testing predictions of the threshold metaplasticity hypothesis in a second mouse line with enhanced PF-Purkinje cell LTD, the <i>Fmr1</i> knockout mouse model of Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Mice lacking <i>Fmr1</i> gene expression in cerebellar Purkinje cells (L7-<i>Fmr1</i> KO) were selectively impaired on two oculomotor learning tasks in which PF-Purkinje cell LTD has been implicated, with no impairment on LTD-independent oculomotor learning tasks. Consistent with the threshold metaplasticity hypothesis, behavioral pre-training designed to reverse LTD at the PF-Purkinje cell synapses eliminated the oculomotor learning deficit in the L7-<i>Fmr1</i> KO mice, as previously reported in MHCI K<sup>b</sup>D<sup>b−/−</sup>mice. In addition, diazepam treatment to suppress neural activity and thereby limit the induction of associative LTD during the pre-training period also eliminated the learning deficits in L7-<i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. These results support the hypothesis that cerebellar LTD-dependent learning is governed by an experience-dependent sliding threshold for plasticity. An increased threshold for LTD in response to elevated neural activity would tend to oppose firing rate stability, but could serve to stabilize synaptic weights and recently acquired memories. The metaplasticity perspective could inform the development of new clinical approaches for addressing learning impairments in autism and other disorders of the nervous system.

                While the involvement of actin polymerization in cell migration is well-established, much less is known about the role of transmembrane water flow in cell motility. Here, we investigate the role of water influx in a prototypical migrating cell, the neutrophil, which undergoes rapid, directed movement to sites of injury, and infection. Chemoattractant exposure both increases cell volume and potentiates migration, but the causal link between these processes are not known. We combine single-cell volume measurements and a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify the regulators of chemoattractant-induced neutrophil swelling, including NHE1, AE2, PI3K-gamma, and CA2. Through NHE1 inhibition in primary human neutrophils, we show that cell swelling is both necessary and sufficient for the potentiation of migration following chemoattractant stimulation. Our data demonstrate that chemoattractant-driven cell swelling complements cytoskeletal rearrangements to enhance migration speed.

                We studied lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> in inflammasome. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + palmitic acid (PA) decreased lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub>) and increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> through mitochondrial ROS, which was suppressed in <i>Trpm2</i>-KO macrophages. Inflammasome activation and metabolic inflammation in adipose tissue of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice were ameliorated by <i>Trpm2</i> KO. ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling occurred after lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release whose blockade attenuated LPS + PA-induced inflammasome. Subsequently, store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup>entry (SOCE) was activated whose inhibition suppressed inflammasome. SOCE was coupled with K<sup>+</sup> efflux whose inhibition reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>) and impaired [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> recovery. LPS + PA activated KCa3.1 channel, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel. Inhibitors of KCa3.1 channel or <i>Kcnn4</i> KO reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>, attenuated increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> or inflammasome activation by LPS + PA, and ameliorated HFD-induced inflammasome or metabolic inflammation. Lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release induced delayed JNK and ASC phosphorylation through CAMKII-ASK1. These results suggest a novel role of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release sustained by ER<b>→</b>lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling and K<sup>+</sup> efflux through KCa3.1 channel in inflammasome activation and metabolic inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90313">Atypical local and global biological motion perception in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a></h4>

              
                Perceiving biological motion (BM) is crucial for human survival and social interaction. Many studies have reported impaired BM perception in autism spectrum disorder, which is characterised by deficits in social interaction. Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often exhibit similar difficulties in social interaction. However, few studies have investigated BM perception in children with ADHD. Here, we compared differences in the ability to process local kinematic and global configurational cues, two fundamental abilities of BM perception, between typically developing and ADHD children. We further investigated the relationship between BM perception and social interaction skills measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale and examined the contributions of latent factors (e.g. sex, age, attention, and intelligence) to BM perception. The results revealed that children with ADHD exhibited atypical BM perception. Local and global BM processing showed distinct features. Local BM processing ability was related to social interaction skills, whereas global BM processing ability significantly improved with age. Critically, general BM perception (i.e. both local and global BM processing) may be affected by sustained attentional ability in children with ADHD. This relationship was primarily mediated by reasoning intelligence. These findings elucidate atypical BM perception in ADHD and the latent factors related to BM perception. Moreover, this study provides new evidence that BM perception is a hallmark of social cognition and advances our understanding of the potential roles of local and global processing in BM perception and social cognitive disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89483">Hippocampus and striatum show distinct contributions to longitudinal changes in value-based learning in middle childhood</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampal-dependent memory system and striatal-dependent memory system modulate reinforcement learning depending on feedback timing in adults, but their contributions during development remain unclear. In a 2-year longitudinal study, 6-to-7-year-old children performed a reinforcement learning task in which they received feedback immediately or with a short delay following their response. Children’s learning was found to be sensitive to feedback timing modulations in their reaction time and inverse temperature parameter, which quantifies value-guided decision-making. They showed longitudinal improvements towards more optimal value-based learning, and their hippocampal volume showed protracted maturation. Better delayed model-derived learning covaried with larger hippocampal volume longitudinally, in line with the adult literature. In contrast, a larger striatal volume in children was associated with both better immediate and delayed model-derived learning longitudinally. These findings show, for the first time, an early hippocampal contribution to the dynamic development of reinforcement learning in middle childhood, with neurally less differentiated and more cooperative memory systems than in adults.

">Self-organizing recruitment of compensatory areas maximizes residual motor performance post-stroke</a></h4>

              
                Whereas the orderly recruitment of compensatory motor cortical areas after stroke depends on the size of the motor cortex lesion affecting arm and hand movements, the mechanisms underlying this reorganization are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that the recruitment of compensatory areas results from the motor system's goal to optimize performance given the anatomical constraints before and after the lesion. This optimization is achieved through two complementary plastic processes: a homeostatic regulation process, which maximizes information transfer in sensory-motor networks, and a reinforcement learning process, which minimizes movement error and effort. To test this hypothesis, we developed a neuro-musculoskeletal model that controls a 7-muscle planar arm via a cortical network that includes a primary motor cortex and a premotor cortex that directly project to spinal motor neurons, and a contra-lesional primary motor cortex that projects to spinal motor neurons via the reticular formation. Synapses in the cortical areas are updated via reinforcement learning and the activity of spinal motor neurons is adjusted through homeostatic regulation. The model replicated neural, muscular, and behavioral outcomes in both non-lesioned and lesioned brains. With increasing lesion sizes, the model demonstrated systematic recruitment of the remaining primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, and contra-lesional cortex. The premotor cortex acted as a reserve area for fine motor control recovery, while the contra-lesional cortex helped avoid paralysis at the cost of poor joint control. Plasticity in spinal motor neurons enabled force generation after large cortical lesions despite weak corticospinal inputs. Compensatory activity in the premotor and contra-lesional motor cortex was more prominent in the early recovery period, gradually decreasing as the network minimized effort. Thus, the orderly recruitment of compensatory areas following strokes of varying sizes results from biologically plausible local plastic processes that maximize performance, whether the brain is intact or lesioned.

">Myelin-informed forward models for M/EEG source reconstruction</a></h4>

              
                Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) provide direct electrophysiological measures at an excellent temporal resolution, but the spatial resolution of source-reconstructed current activity is limited to several millimetres. Here we show, using simulations of MEG signals and Bayesian model comparison, that non-invasive myelin estimates from high-resolution quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can enhance MEG/EEG source reconstruction. Our approach assumes that MEG/EEG signals primarily arise from the synchronised activity of pyramidal cells, and since most of the myelin in the cortical sheet originates from these cells, myelin density can predict the strength of cortical sources measured by MEG/EEG. Leveraging recent advances in quantitative MRI, we exploit this structure-function relationship and scale the leadfields of the forward model according to the local myelin density estimates from in vivo quantitative MRI to inform MEG/EEG source reconstruction. Using Bayesian model comparison and dipole localisation errors (DLEs), we demonstrate that adapting local forward fields to reflect increased local myelination at the site of a simulated source explains the simulated data better than models without such leadfield scaling. Our model comparison framework proves sensitive to myelin changes in simulations with exact coregistration and moderate-to-high sensor-level signal-to-noise ratios ([&ge;]10 dB) for the multiple sparse priors (MSP) and empirical Bayesian beamformer (EBB) approaches. Furthermore, we sought to infer the microstructure giving rise to specific functional activation patterns by comparing the myelin-informed model which was used to generate the activation with a set of test forward models incorporating different myelination patterns. We found that the direction of myelin changes, however not their magnitude, can be inferred by Bayesian model comparison. Finally, we apply myelin-informed forward models to MEG data from a visuo-motor experiment. We demonstrate improved source reconstruction accuracy using myelin estimates from a quantitative longitudinal relaxation (R1) map and discuss the limitations of our approach.

">Responses to visual motion of neurons in the extrastriate visual cortex of macaque monkeys with experimental amblyopia</a></h4>

              
                Amblyopia is a developmental disorder that results from abnormal visual experience in early life. Amblyopia typically reduces visual performance in one eye. We studied the representation of visual motion information in area MT and nearby extrastriate visual areas in two monkeys made amblyopic by creating an artificial strabismus in early life, and in a single age-matched control monkey. Tested monocularly, cortical responses to moving dot patterns, gratings, and plaids were qualitatively normal in awake, fixating amblyopic monkeys, with primarily subtle differences between the eyes. However, the number of binocularly driven neurons was substantially lower than normal; of the neurons driven predominantly by one eye, the great majority responded only to stimuli presented to the fellow eye. The small population driven by the amblyopic eye showed reduced coherence sensitivity and a preference for faster speeds in much the same way as behavioral deficits. We conclude that, while we do find important differences between neurons driven by the two eyes, amblyopia does not lead to a large scale reorganization of visual receptive fields in the dorsal stream when tested through the amblyopic eye, but rather creates a substantial shift in eye preference toward the fellow eye.

">Critical roles of ERK and Akt signaling in metabolically dependent memory formation in Drosophila larvae.</a></h4>

              
                In the fruit fly Drosophila, memory formation is intricately linked to metabolic state. Our previous findings showed that the preferential support of memory under increased energy levels is mediated by the insulin receptor in the mushroom body (MB), a key memory center in the insect brain. This study analyzed the role of the insulin receptor's downstream pathways, Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K/Akt, in metabolically dependent memory formation. We evaluated their impact on memory processes by employing RNA interference-mediated downregulation of key components, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase B (Akt), in the MB of Drosophila larvae. To enhance energy levels, larvae were fed sugar for 60 minutes prior to aversive olfactory conditioning. Our findings revealed that genetically downregulating ERK and Akt in the MB significantly impaired metabolically dependent memory formation, without affecting naive sensory perception or olfactory learning. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the presence of active forms of ERK and Akt in the MB, underscoring their roles in modulating memory processes under elevated energy levels. The pivotal roles of these kinases suggest a broader implication of insulin signaling in memory formation under different metabolic conditions, and illuminate the connections between metabolic regulation and memory dynamics in the MB.

">Anatomical and functional analysis of the corticospinal tract in an FRDA mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is one of the most common hereditary ataxias. It is caused by a GAA repeat in the first intron of the FXN gene, which encodes an essential mitochondrial protein. Patients suffer from progressive motor dysfunction due to the degeneration of mechanoreceptive and proprioceptive neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and cerebellar dentate nucleus neurons, especially at early disease stages. Postmortem analyses of FRDA patients also indicate pathological changes in motor cortex including in the projection neurons that give rise to the cortical spinal tract (CST). Yet, it remains poorly understood how early in the disease cortical spinal neurons (CSNs) show these alterations, or whether CSN/CST pathology resembles the abnormalities observed in other tissues affected by FXN loss. To address these questions, we examined CSN driven motor behaviors and pathology in the YG8JR FRDA mouse model. We find that FRDA mice show impaired motor skills, exhibit significant reductions in CSN functional output, and, among other pathological changes, show abnormal mitochondrial distributions in CSN neurons and CST axonal tracts. Moreover, some of these alterations were observed as early as two months of age, suggesting that CSN/CST pathology may be an earlier event in FRDA disease than previously appreciated. These studies warrant a detailed mechanistic understanding of how FXN loss impacts CSN health and functionality.

">Towards a simplified model of primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been shown to predict neural responses in primary visual cortex (V1) better than classical models. However, this performance comes at the expense of simplicity because the ANN models typically have many hidden layers with many feature maps in each layer. Here we show that ANN models of V1 can be substantially simplified while retaining high predictive power. To demonstrate this, we first recorded a new dataset of over 29,000 neurons responding to up to 65,000 natural image presentations in mouse V1. We found that ANN models required only two convolutional layers for good performance, with a relatively small first layer. We further found that we could make the second layer small without loss of performance, by fitting a separate "minimodel" to each neuron. Similar simplifications applied for models of monkey V1 neurons. We show that these relatively simple models can nonetheless be useful for tasks such as object and visual texture recognition and we use the models to gain insight into how texture invariance arises in biological neurons.

">Rod-shaped microglia interact with neuronal dendrites to regulate cortical excitability in TDP-43 related neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Motor cortical hyperexcitability is well-documented in the presymptomatic stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the mechanisms underlying this early dysregulation are not fully understood. Microglia, as the principal immune cells of the central nervous system, have emerged as important players in sensing and regulating neuronal activity. Here we investigated the role of microglia in the motor cortical circuits in a mouse model of TDP-43 neurodegeneration (rNLS8). Utilizing multichannel probe recording and longitudinal in vivo calcium imaging in awake mice, we observed neuronal hyperactivity at the initial stage of disease progression. Spatial and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that microglia are the primary responders to motor cortical hyperactivity. We further identified a unique subpopulation of microglia, rod-shaped microglia, which are characterized by a distinct morphology and transcriptional profile. Notably, rod-shaped microglia predominantly interact with neuronal dendrites and excitatory synaptic inputs to attenuate motor cortical hyperactivity. The elimination of rod-shaped microglia through TREM2 deficiency increased neuronal hyperactivity, exacerbated motor deficits, and further decreased survival rates of rNLS8 mice. Together, our results suggest that rod-shaped microglia play a neuroprotective role by attenuating cortical hyperexcitability in the mouse model of TDP-43 related neurodegeneration.

">Cerebral Microvascular Density, Permeability of the Blood-Brain Barrier, and Neuroinflammatory Responses Indicate Early Aging Characteristics in a Marfan Syndrome Mouse Model</a></h4>

              
                Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder due to mutations in fibrillin-1 (Fbn1 ), where a Fbn1 missense mutation (Fbn1C1039G/+) can result in systemic increases in the bioavailability and signaling of transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta}). In a well-established mouse model of MFS (Fbn1C1041G/+), pre-mature aging of the aortic wall and the progression of aortic root aneurysm are observed by 6-months-of-age. TGF-{beta} signaling has been implicated in cerebrovascular dysfunction, loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and age-related neuroinflammation. We have reported that pre-mature vascular aging in MFS mice could extend to cerebrovasculature, where peak blood flow velocity in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) of 6-month-old (6M) MFS mice was reduced, similarly to 12-month-old (12M) control mice. Case studies of MFS patients have documented neurovascular manifestations, including intracranial aneurysms, stroke, arterial tortuosity, as well as headaches and migraines, with reported incidence of pain and chronic fatigue. Despite these significant clinical observations, investigation into cerebrovascular dysfunction and neuropathology in MFS remains limited. Using 6M-control (C57BL/6) and 6M-MFS (Fbn1C1041G/+) and healthy 12M-control male and female mice, we test the hypothesis that abnormal Fbn1 protein expression is associated with altered cerebral microvascular density, BBB permeability, and neuroinflammation in the PCA-perfused hippocampus, all indicative of a pre-mature aging brain phenotype. Using Glut1 staining, 6M-MFS mice and 12M-CTRL similarly present decreased microvascular density in the dentate gyrus (DG), cornu ammonis 1 (CA1), and cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) regions of the hippocampus. 6M-MFS mice exhibit increased BBB permeability in the DG, CA1, and CA3 as evident by Immunoglobulin G (IgG) staining, which was more comparable to 12M-CTRL mice. 6M-MFS mice show a higher number of microglia in the hippocampus compared to age-matched control mice, a pattern resembling that of 12M-CTRL mice. This study represents the first known investigation into neuropathology in a mouse model of MFS and indicates that the pathophysiology underlying MFS leads to a systemic pre-mature aging phenotype. This study is crucial for identifying and understanding MFS-associated neurovascular and neurological abnormalities, underscoring the need for research aimed at improving the quality of life and managing pre-mature aging symptoms in MFS and related connective tissue disorders.

                Tau pathology is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related diseases, called tauopathies. While Tau is normally enriched in axons, somatodendritic missorting of the microtubule-associated protein is a key event in early disease development. Tau missorting promotes synaptic loss and neuronal dysfunction but the mechanisms underlying both normal axonal sorting and pathological missorting remain unclear. Interestingly, the disease-associated Tau brain isoforms show different axodendritic distribution, but the distinct role of these isoforms in health and disease largely unknown. Here, we aimed to identify domains or motifs of Tau and cellular binding partners that are required for efficient axonal Tau sorting, and we studied the differences of the isoform-specific Tau interactome. By using human MAPT-KO induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived glutamatergic neurons, we analyzed the sorting behavior of more than 20 truncated or phosphorylation-mutant Tau constructs, and we used TurboID-based proximity labelling and proteomics to identify sorting- and isoform-specific Tau interactors. We found that efficient axonal Tau sorting was independent of the N-terminal tail, the C-terminal repeat domains, and the general microtubule affinity of Tau. In contrast, the presence of the proline-rich region 2 (PRR2) was necessary for successful sorting. Our interactome data revealed peroxisomal accumulation of the Tau N-terminal half, while axonal Tau interacted with the PP2A activator HSP110. When we compared the interactome of 0N3R- and 0N4R-Tau, we observed specific interactions of 0N4R-Tau with regulators of presynaptic exocytosis and postsynaptic plasticity, which are partially associated with AD pathogenesis, such as members of the CDC42 pathway and the RAB11 proteins, while 0N3R-Tau bound to MAP4 and other cytoskeletal elements. In sum, our study postulates that axonal Tau sorting relies on the PRR2 domain but not on microtubule affinity, and unravels a potential isoform-specific role in synaptic function and AD-related dysfunction.

">Mixed recurrent connectivity architecture in primate prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The functional properties of a network depend on its connectivity, which includes the strength of its inputs and the strength of the connections between its units, or recurrent connectivity. Because we lack a detailed description of the recurrent connectivity in the lateral prefrontal cortex of primates, we developed an indirect method to estimate it. This method leverages the elevated noise correlation of mutually-connected units. To estimate the connectivity of prefrontal regions, we trained recurrent neural network models with varying percentages of bump attractor architecture and noise levels to match the noise correlation properties observed in two specific prefrontal regions: the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the frontal eye field. We found that models initialized with approximately 20% and 7.5% bump attractor architecture closely matched the noise correlation properties of the frontal eye field and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, respectively. These findings suggest that the different percentages of bump attractor architecture may reflect distinct functional roles of these brain regions. Specifically, lower percentages of bump attractor units, associated with higher-dimensional representations, likely support more abstract neural representations in more anterior regions.

">Assessing data quality on fetal brain MRI reconstruction: a multi-site and multi-rater study</a></h4>

              
                Quality assessment (QA) has long been considered essential to guarantee the reliability of neuroimaging studies. It is particularly important for fetal brain MRI, where unpredictable fetal motion can lead to substantial artifacts in the acquired images. Multiple images are then combined into a single volume through super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) pipelines, a step that can also introduce additional artifacts. While multiple studies designed automated quality control pipelines, no work evaluated the reproducibility of the manual quality ratings used to train these pipelines. In this work, our objective is twofold. First, we assess the inter- and intra-rater variability of the quality scoring performed by three experts on over 100 SRR images reconstructed using three different SRR pipelines. The raters were asked to assess the quality of images following 8 specific criteria like blurring or tissue contrast, providing a multi-dimensional view on image quality. We show that, using a protocol and training sessions, artifacts like bias field and blur level still have a low agreement (ICC below 0.5), while global quality scores show very high agreement (ICC = 0.9) across raters. We also observe that the SRR methods are influenced differently by factors like gestational age, input data quality and number of stacks used by reconstruction. Finally, our quality scores allow us to unveil systematic weaknesses of the different pipelines, indicating how further development could lead to more robust, well rounded SRR methods.

">The Surgical Method of Craniectomy Differentially Affects Acute Seizures, Brain Deformation and Behavior in a TBI Animal Model</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Multiple injury models have been developed to study this neurological disorder. One such model is the lateral fluid-percussion injury (LFPI) rodent model. The LFPI model can be generated with different surgical procedures that could affect the injury and be reflected in neurobehavioral dysfunction and acute EEG changes. A craniectomy was performed either with a trephine hand drill or with a trephine electric drill that was centered over the left hemisphere of adult, male Sprague Dawley rats. Sham craniectomy groups were assessed by hand-drilled (ShamHMRI) and electric-drilled (ShamEMRI) to evaluate by MRI. Then, TBI was induced in separate groups (TBIH) and (TBIE) using a fluid-percussion device. Sham-injured rats (ShamH/ShamE) underwent the same surgical procedures as the TBI rats. During the same surgery session, rats were implanted with screw and microwire electrodes positioned in the neocortex and hippocampus and the EEG activity was recorded 24 hours for the first 7 days after TBI for assessing the acute EEG seizure and Gamma Event Coupling (GEC). The electric drilling craniectomy induced greater tissue damage and sensorimotor deficits compared to the hand drill. Analysis of the EEG revealed acute seizures in at least one animal from each group after the procedure. Both TBI and Sham rats from the electric drill groups had a significant greater total number of seizures than the animals that were craniectomized manually (p<0.05). Similarly, EEG functional connectivity was lower in ShamE compared to ShamH rats. These results suggest that electrical versus hand drilling craniectomies produce cortical injury in addition to the LFPI which increases the likelihood for acute post-traumatic seizures. Differences in the surgical approach could be one reason for the variability in the injury that makes it difficult to replicate results between preclinical TBI studies.

">Layer-specific reorganization of mnemonic representations in primate retrosplenial cortex during learning</a></h4>

              
                Rapid learning of associations between co-occurring stimuli is essential for episodic memory formation. The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is strongly interconnected with the hippocampus, and in rodents, the RSC has been shown to support spatial navigation and fear conditioning. Although lesion and neuroimaging studies in humans and macaques have further implicated the RSC in episodic memory, it is unclear how memory representations form and evolve in the RSC. Here we show that representations of memorized contexts in primate RSC form within minutes. These initial representations reorganize as the memory matures, with a shift in the weight of neuronal contributions from superficial to deep RSC layers across an hour and increased local connectivity between deep layer neurons. Because RSC superficial and deep layers represent input and output layers respectively, it suggests that hippocampal inputs provide context information to superficial layers during early learning, and this context information consolidates in deep RSC layers.

">Modular organization of synapses within a neuromere for distinct axial locomotion in Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                The ability to generate diverse patterns of behavior is advantageous for animal survival. However, it is still unclear how interneurons in a single nervous system are organized to exhibit distinct motions by coordinating the same set of motor neurons. In this study, we analyze the populational dynamics of synaptic activity when fly larvae exhibit two distinct fictive locomotion, forward and backward waves. Based on neurotransmitter phenotypes, the hemi-neuromere is demarcated into ten domains. Calcium imaging analysis shows that one pair of the domains exhibits a consistent recruitment order in synaptic activity in forward and backward waves, while most other domains show the opposite orders in the distinct fictive locomotion. Connectomics-based mapping indicates that these two domains contain pre- and post-synaptic terminals of interneurons involved in motor control. These results suggest that the identified domains serve as a convergence region of forward and backward crawling programs.

">Frontal-posterior loop integrating captured attention into visual consciousness in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                The emergence of subjective consciousness in the brain remains a profound puzzle, with attention at its core. Despite enduring debates on whether consciousness requires attention, the mechanisms by which attention becomes integrated into consciousness have been insufficiently explored. Here we show it is the bottom-up captured attention rather than top-down supplied attention that contributes to conscious experience, and revealed landmark neural dynamics underlying this process. Combining psychophysics with intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data from 21 epilepsy patients, we examined consciousness-related neural activity (visible versus invisible) under conditions of both poor and sufficient integration of attention into consciousness. In scenarios where attention was poorly integrated, we observed sustained and homogeneous neural representations in the posterior brain, despite its functional disconnection from the frontal brain. This observation supports the proposal of a preconscious buffer state situated between unconscious and conscious states. Conversely, in scenarios where attention was sufficiently integrated into consciousness, even before frontal-posterior coupling was established (thus still in a preconscious state), supplied attention primed the entire brain for subsequent attentional integration. This priming involved selecting signals-to-be-perceived by the posterior brain and stabilizing attentional supply by the frontal brain. Subsequently, the functional coupling between the frontal and posterior brain formed a closed loop. Notably, within this loop, what continuously broadcasted were coarse-grained binary signals of consciousness emergence, opposing views attributing consciousness to the global broadcasting of fine-grained contents. These findings show what and how attention gets integrated into visual consciousness, and the resulting outcomes call for a significant revision of current theories of consciousness. In response, we propose an attentional integration model of consciousness (AIM) aimed at reconciling the sharp discrepancies in this field.

">Nucleus accumbens sub-regions experience distinct dopamine release responses following acute and chronic morphine exposure</a></h4>

              
                It is well established that dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play a critical role in reward and aversion as well as pathologies including drug dependence and addiction. The distinct effects of acute and chronic opioid exposure have been previously characterized at VTA synapses. Recent work suggests that distinct VTA projections that target the medial and lateral shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), may play opposing roles in modulating behavior. It is possible that these two anatomically and functionally distinct pathways also have disparate roles in opioid reward, tolerance, and withdrawal in the brain. In this study we monitored dopamine release in the medial or lateral shell of the NAc of male mice during a week-long morphine treatment paradigm. We measured dopamine release in response to an intravenous morphine injection both acutely and following a week of repeated morphine. We also measured dopamine in response to a naloxone injection both prior to and following repeated morphine treatment. Morphine induced a transient increase in dopamine in the medial NAc shell that was much larger than the slower rise observed in the lateral shell. Surprisingly, chronic morphine treatment induced a sensitization of the medial dopamine response to morphine that opposed a diminished response observed in the saline-treated control group. This study expands on our current understanding of the medial NAc shell as hub of opioid-induced dopamine fluctuation. It also highlights the need for future opioid studies to appreciate the heterogeneity of dopamine neurons.

">A high-throughput approach for the efficient prediction of perceived similarity of natural objects</a></h4>

              
                Perceived similarity offers a window into the mental representations underlying our ability to make sense of our visual world, yet, the collection of similarity judgments quickly becomes infeasible for larger datasets, limiting their generality. To address this challenge, here we introduce a computational approach that predicts perceived similarity from neural network activations through a set of 49 interpretable dimensions learned on 1.46 million triplet odd-one-out judgments. The approach allowed us to predict separate, independently-sampled similarity scores with an accuracy of up to 0.898. Combining this approach with human ratings of the same dimensions led only to small improvements, indicating that the neural network captured much of human knowledge in this task. Predicting the similarity of highly homogenous image classes revealed that performance critically depends on the granularity of the training data. Our approach allowed us to improve the brain-behavior correspondence in a large-scale neuroimaging dataset and visualize candidate image features humans use for making similarity judgments, thus highlighting which image parts carry behaviorally-relevant information. Together, our results demonstrate that neural networks can carry information sufficient for capturing broadly-sampled similarity scores, offering a pathway towards the automated collection of human similarity judgments for natural images.

">NREM sleep brain networks modulate cognitive recovery from sleep deprivation</a></h4>

              
                Decrease in cognitive performance after sleep deprivation followed by recovery after sleep suggests its key role, and especially non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, in the maintenance of cognition. It remains unknown whether brain network reorganization in NREM sleep stages N2 and N3 can uniquely be mapped onto individual differences in cognitive performance after a recovery nap following sleep deprivation. Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we quantified the integration and segregation of brain networks during NREM sleep stages N2 and N3 while participants took a 1-hour nap following 24-hour sleep deprivation, compared to well-rested wakefulness. Here, we advance a new analytic framework called the hierarchical segregation index (HSI) to quantify network segregation across spatial scales, from whole-brain to the voxel level, by identifying spatio-temporally overlapping large-scale networks and the corresponding voxel-to-region hierarchy. Our results show that network segregation increased in the default mode, dorsal attention and somatomotor networks during NREM sleep compared to wakefulness. Segregation within the visual, limbic, and executive control networks exhibited N2 versus N3 sleep-specific voxel-level patterns. More segregation during N3 was associated with worse recovery of working memory, executive attention, and psychomotor vigilance after the nap. The level of spatial resolution of network segregation varied among brain regions and was associated with the recovery of performance in distinct cognitive tasks. We demonstrated the sensitivity and reliability of voxel-level HSI to provide key insights into within-region variation, suggesting a mechanistic understanding of how NREM sleep replenishes cognition after sleep deprivation.

">The RNA binding ubiquitination ligase MEX3B regulates bFGF-dependent neuronal proliferation.</a></h4>

              
                E3 ubiquitin ligases, integral components of the proteasomal degradation cascade, are critical for regulating the cellular proteome via canonical proteasome-mediated protein degradation; however, the non-canonical functions of these ligases in neuronal development are poorly understood. Our study focuses on a special class of E3 ubiquitin ligases known as RNA Binding Ubiquitin Ligases (RBUL) that harbour RNA-binding domains; allowing them to acquire all the properties of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and regulate transcriptional or post-transcriptional changes associated with the control of gene expression in cellular phenotypes. We aim to identify one such RUBL in the context of the highly dynamic yet stringently controlled process of neural proliferation and neural fate determination. MEX3B protein is a member of the MEX3 family and a part of the RBUL class of E3 ligases. It is differentially expressed in Neural Progenitor Cells (NPCs) upon differentiation. Mex3b RNA and protein were found to have temporally opposing expression patterns in presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), a key signalling protein involved in neuronal proliferation. MEX3B is required for maintenance of the proliferative state of NPCs, whereas, its knockdown promotes transition from proliferative to differentiation state even in presence of bFGF that restricts differentiation. Furthermore, the knockdown of MEX3B protein results in the appearance of morphological hallmarks associated with early stages of neuronal differentiation including increase in neurite length and complexity. MEX3B interacts with the pro-proliferative transcription activator REST and the long non-coding RNA, HOTAIR. The study suggests the existence of a bFGF-dependent, combinatorial axis involving Mex3b, REST and HOTAIR, for the maintenance of NPC proliferative states. MEX3B, containing RNA binding motifs, is a unique E3 ligase that is necessary for bFGF-dependent proliferation. Mex3b protein invokes its non-canonical function of an RNA binding protein to form a tripartite complex with the transcription activator REST and HOTAIR lncRNA to define the proliferative state of NPCs. The study highlights a unique feature of special E3 ligases in neuronal proliferation during brain development that was previously overlooked.

">Neural Stem Cell Relay from B1 to B2 cells in the adult mouse Ventricular-Subventricular Zone</a></h4>

              
                Neurogenesis and gliogenesis continue in the Ventricular-Subventricular Zone (V-SVZ) of the adult rodent brain. B1 cells are astroglial cells derived from radial glia that function as primary progenitor neural stem cells (NSCs)in the V-SVZ. B1 cells, which have a small apical contact with the ventricle, decline in numbers during early postnatal life, yet neurogenesis continues into adulthood. Here we found that a second population of V-SVZ astroglial cells (B2 cells), that do not contact the ventricle, function as NSCs in the adult brain. B2 cell numbers increase postnatally, remain constant in 12-month-old mice and decrease by 18 months. Transcriptomic analysis of ventricular-contacting and non-contacting B cells revealed key molecular differences to distinguish B1 from B2 cells. Transplantation and lineage tracing of B2 cells demonstrate their function as primary progenitors for adult neurogenesis. This study reveals how NSC function is relayed from B1 to B2 progenitors to maintain adult neurogenesis.

">Neuronal networks quantified as vector fields</a></h4>

              
                Brain function is defined by the interactions between the neurons of the brain. But these neurons exist in tremendous numbers, are continuously active and densely interconnected. Thereby they form one of the most complex dynamical systems known and there is a lack of approaches to characterize the functional properties of such biological neuronal networks. Here we introduce an approach to describe these functional properties by using its constituents, the weights of the synaptic connections and the current activity of its neurons. We show how a high-dimensional vector field, which describes how the activity of each individual neuron is impacted at each instant of time, naturally emerges from these constituents. We show the factors that impact the structural richness of that vector field, including how rapid changes in neuron activity continually reshapes its structure. We argue that this structural richness is the foundation of the functional diversity and thereby the adaptability that characterizes biological behavior.

">Maternal dietary deficiencies in folic acid and choline change metabolites levels in offspring after ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                Ischemic stroke is a debilitating disease, with nutrition being a modifiable risk factor. Changes in levels of metabolites can be used to measure the alterations in the gut, a significant marker for the etiology of diseases. This study utilized untargeted metabolomics to investigate changes in fecal samples of offspring in response to maternal dietary deficiencies and ischemic stroke. Female mice were placed on control (CD), folic acid- (FADD), or choline-deficient (ChDD) diets prior to, during pregnancy, and lactation. Offspring were weaned on to CD and at 2 months of age an ischemic stroke was induced. Fecal samples were collected prior to ischemic stroke, and at 1- and 4-weeks post-stroke for analysis. Sex and maternal dietary differences in metabolites were observed at both the 1- and 4-week post-stroke timepoints. At the 1-week post-stroke, female FADD offspring had more changes in metabolites than males. Comparatively, at the 4-week post-stroke timepoint, female offspring on either FADD or ChDD demonstrated metabolite changes. This study demonstrates a long-lasting impact of maternal dietary deficiencies on central nervous system and gut microbiome function after ischemic stroke.

">The aging musician: Evidence of a downward trend in song tempo as a function of artist age</a></h4>

              
                Correspondences between the timing of motor behaviour and that of musical performance are well-established. Motor behaviour, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behaviour impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analysed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalised Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalised by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists' thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasises the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behaviour and timing of musical performance.

">Scene context and attention independently facilitate MEG decoding of object category</a></h4>

              
                Many of the objects we encounter in our everyday environments would be hard to recognize without any expectations about these objects. For example, a distant silhouette may be perceived as a car because we expect objects of that size, positioned on a road, to be cars. Accordingly, neuroimaging studies have shown that when objects are poorly visible, expectations derived from scene context facilitate the representations of these objects in visual cortex from around 300 ms after scene onset. The current magnetoencephalography (MEG) decoding study tested whether this facilitation occurs independently of attention and task relevance. Participants viewed degraded objects alone or within their original scene context while they either attended the scenes (attended condition) or the fixation cross (unattended condition), temporally directing attention away from the scenes. Results showed that at 300 ms after stimulus onset, multivariate classifiers trained to distinguish clearly visible animate vs inanimate objects generalized to distinguish degraded objects in scenes better than degraded objects alone, despite the added clutter of the scene background. Attention also modulated object representations at this latency, with better category decoding in the attended than the unattended condition. The modulatory effects of context and attention were independent of each other. Finally, data from the current study and a previous study were combined (N=51) to provide a more detailed temporal characterization of contextual facilitation. These results extend previous work by showing that facilitatory scene-object interactions are independent of the specific task performed on the visual input.

">Sensorimotor awareness requires intention: Evidence from minuscule eye movements.</a></h4>

              
                Microsaccades are tiny eye movements that are thought to occur spontaneously and without awareness but can also be intentionally controlled with high precision. We used these tiny visual actions to investigate how intention modulates sensorimotor awareness by directly comparing intended, unintended, and spontaneous microsaccades. In addition, we dissociated the effects of action intention and the actions' visual consequences on awareness. In 80% of all trials, we presented a stimulus at high temporal frequency rendering it invisible during stable fixation. Critically, the stimulus became visible when a microsaccade in the same direction caused it to slow down on the retina (generated microsaccade condition; 40% of trials) or when the microsaccades' visual consequence was replayed (replayed microsaccade condition; 40% of trials). Participants reported whether they perceived the stimulus (visual sensitivity), whether they believed they had made a microsaccade (microsaccade sensitivity), and their level of confidence that their eye movement behavior was linked to their perception (causality assignment). Visual sensitivity was high for both, generated and replayed microsaccades and comparable for intended, unintended, and spontaneous eye movements. Microsaccade sensitivity, however, was low for spontaneous microsaccades, but heightened for both intended and unintended eye movements, showing that the intention to saccade or fixate enhances awareness of otherwise undetected eye movements. Visual consequences failed to aid eye movement awareness, and confidence ratings revealed a poor understanding of a causal relationship between eye movement and sensory consequence. These findings highlight the functional relevance of intention in sensorimotor awareness at the smallest scale of visual actions.

">Ultradian rhythms of CRHPVN neuron activity, behaviour and stress hormone secretion</a></h4>

              
                The stress axis is always active, even in the absence of any threat. This manifests as hourly pulses of corticosteroid stress hormone secretion over the day. Corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (CRHPVN) control both the neuroendocrine stress axis as well as stress-associated behaviours. However, it is currently unclear how the resting activity of these neurons is coordinated with both spontaneous behaviour and ultradian pulses of corticosteroid secretion. To investigate this, we performed fiber photometry recordings of CRHPVN neuron activity in Crh-Ires-Cre mice and a newly generated line of Crh-Ires-Cre rats. In both mice and rats, CRHPVN neurons displayed an ultradian rhythm of activity with reoccurring upstates of activity approximately once per hour over the 24-hour day. Upstates in activity were coordinated with increases in animal activity/arousal. Chemogenetic activation of CRHPVN neurons was also sufficient to induce behavioural arousal. In rats, increases in CRH neural activity preceded some pulses of corticosteroid secretion but not others. Thus, while CRHPVN neurons display an ultradian rhythm of activity over the 24-hour day that is coordinated with behavioural arousal, the relationship between CRHPVN activity and pulses of corticosteroid secretion is not one-to-one.

">Functional ultrasound neuroimaging reveals mesoscopic organization of saccades in the lateral intraparietal area of posterior parietal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) located within the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is an important area for the transformation of spatial information into accurate saccadic eye movements. Despite extensive research, we do not fully understand the functional anatomy of intended movement directions within LIP. This is in part due to technical challenges. Electrophysiology recordings can only record from small regions of the PPC, while fMRI and other whole-brain techniques lack sufficient spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we use functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI), an emerging technique with high sensitivity, large spatial coverage, and good spatial resolution, to determine how movement direction is encoded across PPC. We used fUSI to record local changes in cerebral blood volume in PPC as two monkeys performed memory-guided saccades to targets throughout their visual field. We then analyzed the distribution of preferred directional response fields within each coronal plane of PPC. Many subregions within LIP demonstrated strong directional tuning that was consistent across several months to years. These mesoscopic maps revealed a highly heterogenous organization within LIP with many small patches of neighboring cortex encoding different directions. LIP had a rough topography where anterior LIP represented more contralateral upward movements and posterior LIP represented more contralateral downward movements. These results address two fundamental gaps in our understanding of LIP's functional organization: the neighborhood organization of patches and the broader organization across LIP. These findings were achieved by tracking the same LIP populations across many months to years and developing mesoscopic maps of direction specificity previously unattainable with fMRI or electrophysiology methods.

">Activity-dependent lateral inhibition enables ensemble synchronization of odor-activated neurons in the olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                Information in the brain is represented by the activity of neuronal ensembles. These ensembles are adaptive and dynamic, formed and truncated based on the animal's experience. One mechanism by which spatially distributed neurons form an ensemble is synchronizing their spiking activity in response to a sensory event. In the olfactory bulb, odor stimulation evokes rhythmic gamma activity in spatially distributed mitral and tufted cells (MTCs). This rhythmic activity is thought to enhance the relay of odor information to the downstream olfactory targets. However, how only the odor-activated MTCs are synchronized to form an ensemble is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that light activating one set of MTCs can gamma-entrain the spiking activity of another set. This lateral synchronization is particularly effective when both MTCs fired at the gamma rhythm, facilitating the synchronization of only the odor-activated MTCs. Furthermore, we show that lateral synchronization does not depend on the distance between the MTCs and is mediated by Granule cells. In contrast, lateral inhibition between MTCs that reduced their firing rates was spatially restricted to adjacent MTCs and was not mediated by Granule cells. Our findings reveal a simple yet robust mechanism by which spatially distributed neurons entrain each other's spiking activity to form an ensemble.

">Glutathione Oxidation in Cerebrospinal Fluid as a Biomarker of Oxidative Stress in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Oxidative stress is a key feature of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Identification of reliable biomarkers of oxidative stress would be beneficial for drug-target engagement studies. Methods: We performed unbiased quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis to measure changes in protein abundance and oxidation in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a cohort of ALS patients and healthy controls at two time points (approximately four months apart) to capture disease progression. In addition, we developed a sensitive and targeted quantitative MS method to measure glutathione oxidation state in the same sets of CSF samples. Results: Proteomic analysis of CSF revealed statistically significant changes in the abundance of several proteins, including CHIT1, CHI3L1, CHI3L2 and COL18A1 in ALS patients compared to healthy controls at both time points. Several sites of protein oxidation were significantly altered in ALS compared to healthy controls, and total levels of reversible protein oxidation were elevated in ALS patients. Given that glutathione oxidation could be a useful biomarker of oxidative stress, we also measured glutathione and its oxidation state in CSF in the same cohorts of samples. Total GSH (tGSH), GSSG levels and the GSSG/GSH ratio were significantly higher in the ALS than in the healthy control group for both time points. For the first visit, fold changes of tGSH, GSSG, and GSSG/GSH ratio in ALS compared to HC were 1.33 (p = 0.0215), 1.54 (p = 0.0041) and 1.80 (p = 0.0454), respectively. For the second visit, these values were 1.50 (p = 0.0143), 2.00 (p = 0.0018) and 2.14 (p = 0.0120), respectively. Furthermore, we found positive correlations between disease duration until the first visit and total glutathione (tGSH), GSSG and GSSG/GSH ratio. Finally, there was a strong positive correlation between the total intensity of reversibly oxidised proteins and the ratio of GSSG/GSH in ALS patients at both visits. Conclusion: We propose that measuring levels of glutathione oxidation in CSF could act as a stratification biomarker to select ALS patients for antioxidant therapy and an approach to monitor the treatment response to therapeutic agents targeting oxidative stress.

">Fast 3D imaging in the auditory cortex of awake mice reveals that astrocytes control neurovascular coupling responses locally at arteriole-capillary junctions.</a></h4>

              
                During neuronal activity, cerebral blood flow increases to ensure adequate glucose and oxygen supply, a crucial mechanism known as the neurovascular coupling response. Blood is drawn from the brain surface through penetrating arterioles (PA) and locally redistributed via branching capillaries in the cerebral cortex. All blood vessels, regardless of cortical layer or size, are covered by astrocytic end-feet, suggesting a potential regulatory role. Though the regulatory machinery is known to be present in astrocyte end-feet, its role in this blood recruitment is still controversial. A likely explanation for the controversy is that studies so far have been done without considering the structural basis for blood flow regulation and the heterogeneity in blood vessel dilation patterns. We performed our experiments in awake mice, using a 3D+t two-photon imaging approach by which we could image regions at the branching point between PA and capillary bed at high speed. This led us to detect rapid, localized astrocytic Ca2+ signals in the end-feet surrounding the sphincter connecting the two vascular compartments. Mice often moved during experiments, and we noticed that in these cases, most of the natural vessel dilations in our imaged region were multicompartmental, extending from the PA to the 1st order capillary across the pre-capillary sphincter or vice versa. In contrast, when the mouse was at rest, dilations were more spatially restricted, with at least half of them remaining confined to one of the two compartments. The local Ca2+ rises in the end-feet encircling the pre-capillary sphincters preceded dilations spread and were notably correlated with multicompartment dilations. These Ca2+ signals were attenuated in IP3R2KO mice, lacking a major source of astrocyte Ca2+ rises, and the number of dilations crossing the sphincter was significantly reduced or slowed down compared to wild-type mice. When we induced dilations by auditory stimulation, we found that they had patterns and dependency on local astrocyte Ca2+ activity analogous to those of naturally occurring dilations. In conclusion, we discovered that pre-capillary sphincters play a pivotal role in the bidirectional dilation spread between vascular compartments and that local astrocyte Ca2+ signaling controls this function. This mechanism, described here for the first time, allows astrocytes to control the dilation transition across the sphincters and contribute to laminar blood flow regulation during neurovascular coupling responses.

	<p>Epilepsy affects over 65 million people worldwide. One-third of people with epilepsy do not respond to medication and may benefit from surgery. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is the first neuromodulation therapy for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. This method is used in combination with anti-seizure medications in adults and in the pediatric population. VNS has also been demonstrated to have benefits for some epilepsy comorbidities, such as depression, and can be used in combination with other neuromodulation therapies in epilepsy. The authors present an overview of VNS physiology, patient selection, surgery and risks, neuromodulation therapy, and application to epilepsy comorbidities.</p>

	<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its downstream tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling pathway play pivotal roles in the resilience and action of antidepressant drugs, making them prominent targets in psychiatric research. Oxidative stress (OS) contributes to various neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, and mental illnesses, and exacerbates the aging process. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant responsive element (ARE) serves as the primary cellular defense mechanism against OS-induced brain damage. Thus, Nrf2 activation may confer endogenous neuroprotection against OS-related cellular damage; notably, the TrkB/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, stimulated by BDNF-dependent TrkB signaling, activates Nrf2 and promotes its nuclear translocation. However, insufficient neurotrophin support often leads to the downregulation of the TrkB signaling pathway in brain diseases. Thus, targeting TrkB activation and the Nrf2-ARE system is a promising therapeutic strategy for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Phytochemicals, including indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and its metabolite, diindolylmethane (DIM), exhibit neuroprotective effects through BDNF&amp;amp;rsquo;s mimetic activity; Akt phosphorylation is induced, and the antioxidant defense mechanism is activated by blocking the Nrf2-kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) complex. This review emphasizes the therapeutic potential of I3C and its derivatives for concurrently activating neuronal defense mechanisms in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                Background Indonesia currently could not make it to the top ten global halal due to some external and internal factors, although it is the largest Muslim country. In the external sector, the competition map is getting tougher, while internally, there are handicaps in the form of weak public awareness of competition. As a country with the largest Muslim population in the world, Indonesia can become one of the largest markets in the world. As indicated in the Global Islamic Economic Report (GIER), Indonesia is one of the top ten countries that control the Islamic economic market, yet it fails to dominate its Islamic market. Accordingly, the government needs to play a stronger role through regulatory policies to encourage the development of the Islamic economic ecosystem in Indonesia (halal value chain). The purpose of this study is to find out and analyze the existence of Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia in the world’s market for Halal products and Services. Methods The researchers have conducted a form of normative juridical research with the analytical descriptive method, namely by collecting, describing, analyzing, and presenting what is (das sein) and what ought to be (das sollen). Results Support from the government and stakeholders has not been optimal in improving welfare - capital access, management, and halal certification, so the existence of the global halal ecosystem has not yet impacted MSMEs’ ability to compete competitively. Conclusions The conclusion of this study shows that the quadruple helix innovation system is capable of guaranteeing the development of MSMEs in a manner to achieves a high level of competitiveness - efficiency, and effectiveness of the products and services produced.

                Objectives To investigate the impact of electroacupuncture on cognitive function, quality of life (QoL), and depression severity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods This double-blinded randomized controlled trial included 60 participants aged 18-55 with cognitive symptoms related to MDD at Thammasat University Hospital. Participants were divided into two groups: the electroacupuncture group combined with standard antidepressant treatment (EG; n=30) and the control group receiving standard care with placebo acupuncture (CG; n=30). The study assessed 1) executive functions using the Trail making test- B and Stroop Color and Word Test, 2) delayed recall, and 3) subjective cognitive complaint and Quality of life (QoL) using WHODAS 2.0. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Thai version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Baseline and post-intervention assessments were conducted over 10 weeks. Mann-Whitney U test analyzed treatment effects by comparing median differences between groups. Results Both groups exhibited similar demographics and cognitive traits. Cognitive improvement was observed in both groups at the endpoint. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significantly higher median scores for subjective cognitive complaints in the EG compared to the CG (EG: Median = 5.5, CG: Median = 0.0, p=0.049). No serious side effects were identified from either electroacupuncture or placebo acupuncture. Conclusions Electroacupuncture improved subjective complaints in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, but did not show effects on specific cognitive functions, QoL, or depressive symptoms. This study provides initial evidence supporting the potential of electroacupuncture in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, suggesting opportunities for further research.

                <p>We must often decide whether the effort required for a task is worth the reward. Past rodent work suggests that willingness to deploy cognitive effort can be driven by individual differences in perceived reward value, depression, or chronic stress. However, many factors driving cognitive effort deployment&mdash;such as short-term memory ability&mdash;cannot easily be captured in rodents. Furthermore, we do not fully understand how individual differences in short-term memory ability, depression, chronic stress, and reward anticipation impact cognitive effort deployment for reward. Here, we examined whether these factors predict cognitive effort deployment for higher reward in an online visual short-term memory task. Undergraduate participants were grouped into high and low effort groups (<I>n</I><SUB>HighEffort</SUB> = 348, <I>n</I><SUB>LowEffort</SUB> = 81; <I>n</I><SUB>Female</SUB> = 332, <I>n</I><SUB>Male</SUB> = 92, <I>M</I><SUB>Age</SUB> = 20.37, <I>Range</I><SUB>Age</SUB> = 16&ndash;42) based on decisions in this task. After completing a monetary incentive task to measure reward anticipation, participants completed short-term memory task trials where they could choose to encode either fewer (low effort/reward) or more (high effort/reward) squares before reporting whether or not the color of a target square matched the square previously in that location. We found that only greater short-term memory ability predicted whether participants chose a much higher proportion of high versus low effort trials. Drift diffusion modeling showed that high effort group participants were more biased than low effort group participants toward selecting high effort trials. Our findings highlight the role of individual differences in cognitive effort ability in explaining cognitive effort deployment choices.</p>

                Background Coronavirus disease 2019 can spread rapidly. Surgery in the oral cavity poses a high risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The American Dental Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the use of mouthwash containing 1.5% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or 0.2% povidone iodine (PI) to reduce the viral load in the upper respiratory tract and decrease the risk of transmission. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of mouth rinsing and gargling with mouthwash containing 1% PI, 0.5% PI, 3% H2O2, or 1.5% H2O2 and water on the cycle threshold (CT) value obtained by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods This study is a randomized single blind controlled clinical trial which has been registered in the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry on the 3rd February 2022 (Registration number: ISRCTN18356379). In total, 69 subjects recruited from Persahabatan General Hospital who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups or the control group. The subjects were instructed to gargle with 15 mL of mouthwash for 30 s in the oral cavity followed by 30 s in the back of the throat, three times per day for 5 days. CT values were collected on postprocedural days 1, 3, and 5. Results The results of the Friedman test significantly differed among the groups (n=15). The CT values increased from baseline (day 0) to postprocedural days 1, 3, and 5. Conclusions Mouth rinsing and gargling with mouthwash containing 1% PI, 0.5% PI, 3% H2O2, or 1.5% H2O2 and water increased the CT value.

                Background and aim During the past decade, the frequency of extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis (TB) has increased. These forms are often miss-diagnosed. This statement of the TB epidemiological profile modification, conduct us to reflect about the utility of the Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) in active TB detection. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy performance of the TST for active tuberculosis detection. Methods This was a case-control, multicenter study conducted in 11 anti-TB centers in Tunisia (June-November2014). The cases were adults aged between 18 and 55 years with newly diagnosed and confirmed tuberculosis. Controls were free from tuberculosis. A data collection sheet was filled out and a TST was performed for each participant. Diagnostic accuracy measures of TST were estimated using Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) curve and Area Under Curve (AUC) to estimate sensitivity and specificity of a determined cut-off point. Results Overall, 1050 patients were enrolled, composed of 336 cases and 714 controls. The mean age was 38.3±11.8 years for cases and 33.6±11 years for controls. The mean diameter of the TST induration was significantly higher among cases than controls (13.7mm vs.6.2mm; p=10-6). AUC was 0.789 [95% CI: 0.758-0.819; p=0.01], corresponding to a moderate discriminating performance for this test. The most discriminative cut-off value of the TST, which was associated with the best sensitivity (73.7%) and specificity (76.6%) couple was   ≥ 11 mm with a Youden index of 0.503. Positive and Negative predictive values were 3.11% and 99.52%, respectively. Conclusions TST could be a useful tool used for active tuberculosis detection, with a moderate global performance and accepted sensitivity and specificity at the cut-off point of 11 mm. However, it cannot be considered as a gold standard test due to its multiple disadvantages.

                Abstract* A 20’s primiparous woman, following spontaneous expulsion of intrauterine death of the fetus at 30 weeks of gestation, presented on post-partum day 8 with acute onset flaccid quadriparesis and breathing difficulty, which had rapidly progressed to involve the legs on day 3 up to her upper limbs on post-partum day 5. Following examination, Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) with ascending diaphragmatic involvement was diagnosed, and plasma exchange was initiated. She developed raised blood pressure, headache, sudden onset visual loss with 2 episodes of generalized seizures on post-partum day 14. Brain MRI and clinical suspicion helped diagnose Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). The patient was treated with anticonvulsants and antihypertensive agents. She regained her vision over the next two days, completed the treatment for GBS, and made a good recovery with independence for advanced activities of daily living on follow-up.

                Endometriosis is a benign, estrogen-dependent, persistent chronic inflammatory heterogeneous condition that features adhesions caused by estrogen-dependent periodic bleeding. It is characterised by a widely spread fibrotic interstitium that comprising of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, collagen fibres, extracellular proteins, inflammatory cells, and active angiogenesis found outside the uterus. Thus, fibrosis is recognized as a critical component because of which current treatments, such as hormonal therapy and surgical excision of lesions are largely ineffective with severe side effects, high recurrence rates, and significant morbidity. The symptoms include dysmenorrhea (cyclic or non-cyclic), dyspareunia, abdominal discomfort, and infertility. The significant lack of knowledge regarding the underlying root cause, etiology, and complex pathogenesis of this debilitating condition, makes it challenging to diagnose early and to implement therapeutic approaches with minimal side effects presenting substantial hurdles in endometriosis management. Research on understanding the pathogenesis of endometriosis is still ongoing to find biomarkers and develop non-hormonal therapeutic approaches. Current clinical research indicates a close relationship between endometriosis and fibrosis, which is thought to be tightly linked to pain, a major factor for the decline in the patient’s quality of life but little is known about the underlying pathophysiological cellular and molecular signaling pathways that lead to endometriosis-related fibrosis. The available experimental disease models have tremendous challenges in reproducing the human characteristics of the disease to assess treatment effectiveness. Future translational research on the topic has been hindered by the lack of an adequate fibrotic model of endometriosis emphasizing the necessity of etiological exploration. This review article’s goal is to examine recent developments in the field and pinpoint knowledge gaps that exist with a focus on the development of novel fibrotic mouse models for the early diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis and how this knowledge aids in the development of novel anti-fibrotic treatments which opens fresh avenues for a thorough investigation and extended research in the field of endometriosis.

                Background Sleep hygiene education (SHE) and lavender essential oil (LEO) inhalation are two effective strategies aimed at enhancing sleep quality and mood states. This study investigated the effects of a single SHE session combined with nightly LEO inhalation for 7 days of late-evening resistance training sessions on sleep quality and mood states in trained athletes. Methods Forty-two athletes were randomly assigned to four groups: a control group (CG), a SHE group (SHEG), a LEO group (LEOG), and a SHE + LEO group (CSLG). CG and LEOG maintained their sleep habits during the intervention, while SHEG and CSLG followed SHE recommendations. Additionally, LEOG and CSLG inhaled LEO nightly before sleep. Sleep patterns were recorded via actigraphy. The Brunel Mood Scale and the Hooper questionnaires were completed before and after the intervention. Results Sleep latency was lower in SHEG (p=0.001) and CSLG (p=0.012) compared to the CG. The subjective sleep score improved in SHEG, LEOG, and CSLG (p < 0.001), with greater improvement observed in SHEG (p = 0.002) and CSLG (p < 0.001) compared to CG at post-intervention. Additionally, significant improvements were observed in the Hooper index in the SHEG (p=0.048) and CSLG (p=0.027), with CSLG demonstrating higher scores compared to CG at the post-intervention assessment (p=0.026). Furthermore, the subjective fatigue score significantly decreased in the CSLG (p=0.009). Conclusions Combining SHE and LEO inhalation could be an effective strategy to enhance sleep latency, subjective sleep quality, and overall wellness, and reduce feelings of fatigue in trained athletes following late-evening resistance training sessions.

                Objective Tuberculosis is a global health challenge with one-third of the world’s population infected by it. Although ocular side effects of Anti-tubercular drugs are well known, the patients generally report late in the course which can result in irreversible vision loss. The purpose of this study was to study the visual field changes during the time course of anti-tubercular therapy (ATT). Methods A total of 48 patients were studied in this prospective type of study. All patients newly diagnosed with TB and started on treatment were included in the study. Baseline examination which included visual acuity, color vision, anterior segment, IOP, Amsler grid, fundus, and visual field test were performed before starting ATT and at 6-month follow-up. Results The mean age of the study population was 35.90 ± 10.2 years. 35 (72.9%) were males and 13 (27.1%) females. 32(66.6%) had pulmonary TB and the rest 16 (33.3%) had extrapulmonary TB. MDR TB was diagnosed in 27 (56.3%) of the patients with the rest 21 (43.8%) being drug sensitive. The baseline examination was normal in all 48 patients. 3(6.3%) out of 45 patients presented with visual complaints after the treatment initiation. Altogether 7 patients out of 48, had visual field defects at the 6-month follow-up. The incidence of visual field defects in our study was 14.6% with the value being significant (0.016). 8.3% had peripheral constriction of visual fields, 2.1% with Severe generalized depression of visual fields and 2.1% with central scotoma. Out of the 45 patients with no visual complaints at 6-month follow-up, 4 (8.33%) showed peripheral field constriction. Conclusion Visual field defects caused by ATT can precede clinical symptoms. Visual field evaluation can be an important tool for the early detection of optic neuropathy in patients receiving ATT in clinical settings where Visual evoked potential testing and RNFL-OCT are not available.

Methods Conceptual research model is suggested based on review of the past literature. The study further purposes a quantitative method Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to operationalize the identified model by assigning weights to the criteria. Finally, the research demonstrates how the weighted model can be applied to rank cities under AMRUT scheme by using Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Results Conceptual model to assess the effectiveness of AMRUT scheme has been arrived at by reviewing past literature. The model is found to be exhaustive and applicable for the research problem being investigated. The study further identifies the method for assigning the criteria weights and then eventually how to apply it to rank cities covered under AMRUT scheme on those weights. Conclusion The study contributes to the academic literature in the context of urban management by evaluating AMRUT scheme. The research proposes that impact of AMRUT can be studied by selecting a comprehensive evaluation model based on academic literature review, identifying an assessment method to assign criteria to the parameters of the selected evaluation model, and finally proposing a method to apply the weighted model to rank the cities covered under AMRUT scheme.

                <p>by Chrysovalantou Kalaitzidou, Georgios Grekas, Andreas Zilian, Charalambos Makridakis, Phoebus Rosakis</p>

We present a new model and extensive computations that explain the dramatic remodelling undergone by a fibrous collagen extracellular matrix (ECM), when subjected to contractile mechanical forces from embedded cells or cell clusters. This remodelling creates complex patterns, comprising multiple narrow localised bands of severe densification and fiber alignment, extending far into the ECM, often joining distant cells or cell clusters (such as tumours). Most previous models cannot capture this behaviour, as they assume stable mechanical fiber response with stress an increasing function of fiber stretch, and a restriction to small displacements. Our fully nonlinear network model distinguishes between two types of single-fiber nonlinearity: fibers that undergo stable (supercritical) buckling (as in previous work) versus fibers that suffer unstable (subcritical) buckling collapse. The model allows unrestricted, arbitrarily large displacements (geometric nonlinearity). Our assumptions on single-fiber instability are supported by recent simulations and experiments on buckling of individual beams with a hierarchical microstructure, such as collagen fibers. We use simple scenarios to illustrate, for the first time, two distinct compressive-instability mechanisms at work in our model: unstable buckling collapse of single fibers, and snap-through of multiple-fiber groups. The latter is possible even when single fibers are stable. Through simulations of large fiber networks, we show how these instabilities lead to spatially extended patterns of densification, fiber alignment and ECM remodelling induced by cell contraction. Our model is simple, but describes a very complex, multi-stable energy landscape, using sophisticated numerical optimisation methods that overcome the difficulties caused by instabilities in large systems. Our work opens up new ways of understanding the unique biomechanics of fibrous-network ECM, by fully accounting for nonlinearity and associated loss of stability in fiber networks. Our results provide new insights on tumour invasion and metastasis.

                <p>by Mahshid Fardadi, J. C. Leiter, Daniel C. Lu, Tetsuya Iwasaki</p>
Aim <p>After spinal cord injuries (SCIs), patients may develop either detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) or urinary incontinence, depending on the level of the spinal injury. DSD and incontinence reflect the loss of coordinated neural control among the detrusor muscle, which increases bladder pressure to facilitate urination, and urethral sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, which control the bladder outlet to restrict or permit bladder emptying. Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to the spinal cord after SCI reduced DSD and incontinence. We defined, within a mathematical model, the minimum neuronal elements necessary to replicate neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder after a SCI and incorporated into this model the minimum additional neurophysiological features sufficient to replicate the improvements in bladder function associated with lumbar TMS of the spine in patients with SCI.</p> Methods <p>We created a computational model of the neural circuit of micturition based on Hodgkin-Huxley equations that replicated normal bladder function. We added interneurons and increased network complexity to reproduce dysfunctional micturition after SCI, and we increased the density and complexity of interactions of both inhibitory and excitatory lumbar spinal interneurons responsive to TMS to provide a more diverse set of spinal responses to intrinsic and extrinsic activation of spinal interneurons that remains after SCI.</p> Results <p>The model reproduced the re-emergence of a spinal voiding reflex after SCI. When we investigated the effect of monophasic and biphasic TMS at two frequencies applied at or below T10, the model replicated the improved coordination between detrusor and external urethral sphincter activity that has been observed clinically: low-frequency TMS (1 Hz) within the model normalized control of voiding after SCI, whereas high-frequency TMS (30 Hz) enhanced urine storage.</p> Conclusion <p>Neuroplasticity and increased complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons, beyond what is necessary to simulate normal bladder function, must be present in order to replicate the effects of SCI on control of micturition, and both neuronal and network modifications of lumbar interneurons are essential to understand the mechanisms whereby TMS reduced bladder dysfunction after SCI.</p>

                <p>by Xiaoyu Yang, Giancarlo La Camera</p>

Evidence for metastable dynamics and its role in brain function is emerging at a fast pace and is changing our understanding of neural coding by putting an emphasis on hidden states of transient activity. Clustered networks of spiking neurons have enhanced synaptic connections among groups of neurons forming structures called cell assemblies; such networks are capable of producing metastable dynamics that is in agreement with many experimental results. However, it is unclear how a clustered network structure producing metastable dynamics may emerge from a fully local plasticity rule, i.e., a plasticity rule where each synapse has only access to the activity of the neurons it connects (as opposed to the activity of other neurons or other synapses). Here, we propose a local plasticity rule producing ongoing metastable dynamics in a deterministic, recurrent network of spiking neurons. The metastable dynamics co-exists with ongoing plasticity and is the consequence of a self-tuning mechanism that keeps the synaptic weights close to the instability line where memories are spontaneously reactivated. In turn, the synaptic structure is stable to ongoing dynamics and random perturbations, yet it remains sufficiently plastic to remap sensory representations to encode new sets of stimuli. Both the plasticity rule and the metastable dynamics scale well with network size, with synaptic stability increasing with the number of neurons. Overall, our results show that it is possible to generate metastable dynamics over meaningful hidden states using a simple but biologically plausible plasticity rule which co-exists with ongoing neural dynamics.

                <p>by Magdalena Miranda, Azul Silva, Juan Facundo Morici, Marcos Antonio Coletti, Mariano Belluscio, Pedro Bekinschtein</p>

Episodic memory is essential to navigate in a changing environment by recalling past events, creating new memories, and updating stored information from experience. Although the mechanisms for acquisition and consolidation have been profoundly studied, much less is known about memory retrieval. Hippocampal spatial representations are key for retrieval of contextually guided episodic memories. Indeed, hippocampal place cells exhibit stable location-specific activity which is thought to support contextual memory, but can also undergo remapping in response to environmental changes. It is unclear if remapping is directly related to the expression of different episodic memories. Here, using an incidental memory recognition task in rats, we showed that retrieval of a contextually guided memory is reflected by the levels of CA3 remapping, demonstrating a clear link between external cues, hippocampal remapping, and episodic memory retrieval that guides behavior. Furthermore, we describe NMDARs as key players in regulating the balance between retrieval and memory differentiation processes by controlling the reactivation of specific memory traces. While an increase in CA3 NMDAR activity boosts memory retrieval, dentate gyrus NMDAR activity enhances memory differentiation. Our results contribute to understanding how the hippocampal circuit sustains a flexible balance between memory formation and retrieval depending on the environmental cues and the internal representations of the individual. They also provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the contributions of hippocampal subregions to generate this balance.

                <p>by Emeline Dubois, Stéphanie Boisnard, Henri-Marc Bourbon, Kenza Yefsah, Karine Budin, Robert Debuchy, Liangran Zhang, Nancy Kleckner, Denise Zickler, Eric Espagne</p>

We show here that in the fungus <i>Sordaria macrospora</i>, the meiosis-specific HORMA-domain protein Hop1 is not essential for the basic early events of chromosome axis development, recombination initiation, or recombination-mediated homolog coalignment/pairing. In striking contrast, Hop1 plays a critical role at the leptotene/zygotene transition which is defined by transition from pairing to synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. During this transition, Hop1 is required for maintenance of normal axis structure, formation of SC from telomere to telomere, and development of recombination foci. These <i>hop1Δ</i> mutant defects are DSB dependent and require Sme4/Zip1-mediated progression of the interhomolog interaction program, potentially via a pre-SC role. The same phenotype occurs not only in <i>hop1Δ</i> but also in absence of the cohesin Rec8 and in <i>spo76-1</i>, a non-null mutant of cohesin-associated Spo76/Pds5. Thus, Hop1 and cohesins collaborate at this crucial step of meiotic prophase. In addition, analysis of 4 non-null mutants that lack this transition defect reveals that Hop1 also plays important roles in modulation of axis length, homolog-axis juxtaposition, interlock resolution, and spreading of the crossover interference signal. Finally, unexpected variations in crossover density point to the existence of effects that both enhance and limit crossover formation. Links to previously described roles of the protein in other organisms are discussed.

The fitness effects of new mutations determine key properties of evolutionary processes. Beneficial mutations drive evolution, yet selection is also shaped by the frequency of small-effect deleterious mutations, whose combined effect can burden otherwise adaptive lineages and alter evolutionary trajectories and outcomes in clonally evolving organisms such as viruses, microbes, and tumors. The small effect sizes of these important mutations have made accurate measurements of their rates difficult. In microbes, assessing the effect of mutations on growth can be especially instructive, as this complex phenotype is closely linked to fitness in clonally evolving organisms. Here, we perform high-throughput time-lapse microscopy on cells from mutation-accumulation strains to precisely infer the distribution of mutational effects on growth rate in the budding yeast, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. We show that mutational effects on growth rate are overwhelmingly negative, highly skewed towards very small effect sizes, and frequent enough to suggest that deleterious hitchhikers may impose a significant burden on evolving lineages. By using lines that accumulated mutations in either wild-type or slippage repair-defective backgrounds, we further disentangle the effects of 2 common types of mutations, single-nucleotide substitutions and simple sequence repeat indels, and show that they have distinct effects on yeast growth rate. Although the average effect of a simple sequence repeat mutation is very small (approximately 0.3%), many do alter growth rate, implying that this class of frequent mutations has an important evolutionary impact.

                <p>by Noga Preminger, Maya Schuldiner</p>

Mitochondrial shape and network formation have been primarily associated with the well-established processes of fission and fusion. However, recent research has unveiled an intricate and multifaceted landscape of mitochondrial morphology that extends far beyond the conventional fission–fusion paradigm. These less-explored dimensions harbor numerous unresolved mysteries. This review navigates through diverse processes influencing mitochondrial shape and network formation, highlighting the intriguing complexities and gaps in our understanding of mitochondrial architecture. The exploration encompasses various scales, from biophysical principles governing membrane dynamics to molecular machineries shaping mitochondria, presenting a roadmap for future research in this evolving field.

                Background The relationship dynamics between postdoctoral researchers and their managers – typically Principal Investigators (PIs) - can directly and indirectly impact the professional development activities that postdocs participate in. Although career and development (C&D) conversations can be a platform through which both parties communicate about the postdoc’s development needs and career aspirations, it is unclear how frequently postdocs are having these types of conversations. Evidence from across the UK indicates that this group receive little feedback on their performance. Methods To explore interventions that could empower postdocs to initiate C&D conversations, we conducted a pilot study at the University of Cambridge where current postdocs were offered workshops utilizing two widely available professional development tools. Both workshops included 360-degree feedback interventions, and we hypothesized that the feedback gathered through these tools could give postdocs both a launching pad for facilitating a conversation with their PI and address the aforementioned feedback shortfall. Results Although most of the participant sample reported already having C&D conversations, those who did not report as such demonstrated mixed feelings about whether facilitating these types of discussions is even part of the PI role. Insights from participants’ engagement with the 360-degree feedback tools also show that participants were mindful of time constraints when seeking feedback, indicating that the usefulness of such interventions may be inhibited by wider cultural issues in the sector. Conclusions Through the development of what we call ‘the researcher development framework, this study highlights the shortcomings of using professional development interventions to address cultural issues.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) profoundly affects human perception of size and scale, particularly regarding one's own body and the environment. Its neuroanatomical basis has remained elusive, partly because brain lesions causing AIWS can occur in different brain regions. Here, we aimed to determine if brain lesions causing AIWS map to a distributed brain network.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A retrospective case–control study analyzing 37 cases of lesion-induced AIWS identified through systematic literature review was conducted. Using resting-state functional connectome data from 1,000 healthy individuals, the whole-brain connections of each lesion were estimated and contrasted with those from a control dataset comprising 1,073 lesions associated with 25 other neuropsychiatric syndromes. Additionally, connectivity findings from lesion-induced AIWS cases were compared with functional neuroimaging results from 5 non-lesional AIWS cases.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AIWS-associated lesions were located in various brain regions with minimal overlap (≤33%). However, the majority of lesions (≥85%) demonstrated shared connectivity to the right extrastriate body area, known to be selectively activated by viewing body part images, and the inferior parietal cortex, involved in size and scale judgements. This pattern was uniquely characteristic of AIWS when compared with other neuropsychiatric disorders (family-wise error-corrected <i>p &lt;</i> 0.05) and consistent with functional neuroimaging observations in AIWS due to nonlesional causes (median correlation <i>r =</i> 0.56, interquartile range 0.24).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>AIWS-related perceptual distortions map to one common brain network, encompassing regions critical for body representation and size-scale processing. These findings lend insight into the neuroanatomical localization of higher-order perceptual functions, and may inform future therapeutic strategies for perceptual disorders.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Olfactory oscillations may enhance cognitive processing through coupling with beta (β, 15–30 Hz) and gamma (γ, 30–160 Hz) activity in the hippocampus (HPC). We hypothesize that coupling between olfactory bulb (OB) and HPC oscillations is increased by cholinergic activation in control rats and is reduced in kainic-acid-treated epileptic rats, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. OB γ2 (63–100 Hz) power was higher during walking and immobility-awake (IMM) compared to sleep, while γ1 (30–57 Hz) power was higher during grooming than other behavioral states. Muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine (25 mg/kg ip) with peripheral muscarinic blockade increased OB power and OB-HPC coherence at β and γ1 frequency bands. A similar effect was found after physostigmine (0.5 mg/kg ip) but not scopolamine (10 mg/kg ip). Pilocarpine increased bicoherence and cross-frequency coherence (CFC) between OB slow waves (SW, 1–5 Hz) and hippocampal β, γ1 and γ2 waves, with stronger coherence at CA1 alveus and CA3c than CA1 stratum radiatum. Bicoherence further revealed a nonlinear interaction of β waves in OB with β waves at the CA1-alveus. Beta and γ1 waves in OB or HPC were segregated at one phase of the OB-SW, opposite to the phase of γ2 and γ3 (100–160 Hz) waves, suggesting independent temporal processing of β/γ1 versus γ2/γ3 waves. At CA1 radiatum, kainic-acid-treated epileptic rats compared to control rats showed decreased theta power, theta-β and theta-γ2 CFC during baseline walking, decreased CFC of HPC SW with γ2 and γ3 waves during baseline IMM, and decreased coupling of OB SW with β and γ2 waves at CA1 alveus after pilocarpine. It is concluded that β and γ waves in the OB and HPC are modulated by a slow respiratory rhythm, in a cholinergic and behavior-dependent manner, and OB-HPC functional connectivity at β and γ frequencies may enhance cognitive functions.</p>

                Background The study investigates the influence of antecedents of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and personality traits on entrepreneurial intention and behaviour among engineering students in an emerging economy. It employs the extension of the TPB model by focusing on the intention-behaviour gap, an under-researched area in research. Furthermore, it investigates the moderating effect of entrepreneurial motivation on the relationship between intention and behaviour to improve conceptual model predictability. Methods A structured questionnaire was used to gather data from 1,564 engineering students, and the data were analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM) with Amos software. Results The results revealed that subjective norms were the strongest predictor of entrepreneurial intention and behaviour, followed by entrepreneurial alertness, perceived behavioural control, attitude towards entrepreneurship, need for achievement, and risk tolerance. Moreover, the moderation analysis showed that entrepreneurial motivation was crucial in moderating the relationship between intention and behaviour. Conclusions The present conceptual model contributes to the existing TPB model by improving predictive power to understand the intention-behaviour relationship. The results of the study will assist policymakers, academicians of higher education institutions, and universities in developing policies, strategies, and curricula to engage more students in entrepreneurial activities.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94583">Editing of endogenous tubulins reveals varying effects of tubulin posttranslational modifications on axonal growth and regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Tubulin posttranslational modifications (PTMs) modulate the dynamic properties of microtubules and their interactions with other proteins. However, the effects of tubulin PTMs were often revealed indirectly through the deletion of modifying enzymes or the overexpression of tubulin mutants. In this study, we directly edited the endogenous tubulin loci to install PTM-mimicking or -disabling mutations and studied their effects on microtubule stability, neurite outgrowth, axonal regeneration, cargo transport, and sensory functions in the touch receptor neurons of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We found that the status of β-tubulin S172 phosphorylation and K252 acetylation strongly affected microtubule dynamics, neurite growth, and regeneration, whereas α-tubulin K40 acetylation had little influence. Polyglutamylation and detyrosination in the tubulin C-terminal tail had more subtle effects on microtubule stability likely by modulating the interaction with kinesin-13. Overall, our study systematically assessed and compared several tubulin PTMs for their impacts on neuronal differentiation and regeneration and established an in vivo platform to test the function of tubulin PTMs in neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93871">Heparan sulfate-dependent phase separation of CCL5 and its chemotactic activity</a></h4>

              
                Secreted chemokines form concentration gradients in target tissues to control migratory directions and patterns of immune cells in response to inflammatory stimulation; however, how the gradients are formed is much debated. Heparan sulfate (HS) binds to chemokines and modulates their activities. In this study, we investigated the roles of HS in the gradient formation and chemoattractant activity of CCL5 that is known to bind to HS. CCL5 and heparin underwent liquid–liquid phase separation and formed gradient, which was confirmed using CCL5 immobilized on heparin-beads. The biological implication of HS in CCL5 gradient formation was established in CHO-K1 (wild-type) and CHO-677 (lacking HS) cells by Transwell assay. The effect of HS on CCL5 chemoattractant activity was further proved by Transwell assay of human peripheral blood cells. Finally, peritoneal injection of the chemokines into mice showed reduced recruitment of inflammatory cells either by mutant CCL5 (lacking heparin-binding sequence) or by addition of heparin to wild-type CCL5. Our experimental data propose that co-phase separation of CCL5 with HS establishes a specific chemokine concentration gradient to trigger directional cell migration. The results warrant further investigation on other heparin-binding chemokines and allows for a more elaborate insight into disease process and new treatment strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92457">Human disturbance increases spatiotemporal associations among mountain forest terrestrial mammal species</a></h4>

              
                Spatial and temporal associations between sympatric species underpin biotic interactions, structure ecological assemblages, and sustain ecosystem functioning and stability. However, the resilience of interspecific spatiotemporal associations to human activity remains poorly understood, particularly in mountain forests where anthropogenic impacts are often pervasive. Here, we applied context-dependent Joint Species Distribution Models to a systematic camera-trap survey dataset from a global biodiversity hotspot in eastern Himalayas to understand how prominent human activities in mountain forests influence species associations within terrestrial mammal communities. We obtained 10,388 independent detections of 17 focal species (12 carnivores and five ungulates) from 322 stations over 43,163 camera days of effort. We identified a higher incidence of positive associations in habitats with higher levels of human modification (87%) and human presence (83%) compared to those located in habitats with lower human modification (64%) and human presence (65%) levels. We also detected a significant reduction of pairwise encounter time at increasing levels of human disturbance, corresponding to more frequent encounters between pairs of species. Our findings indicate that human activities can push mammals together into more frequent encounters and associations, which likely influences the coexistence and persistence of wildlife, with potential far-ranging ecological consequences.

	<p>This prospective crossover study aimed to investigate the effect of binaural beat therapy music on soccer player performance. Between July 2023 and December 2023, 45 athletes (31 females/14 males, mean age = 20.47 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.99) wore Bluetooth earphones through which one of the following was given during initial 20 min warm-up exercises before undergoing repeated sprint ability tests: no music/fast-tempo music/fast-tempo music with background binaural beat therapy music. Heart rate change after warm-up exercises/repeated sprint ability (RSA) tests and the time to finish RSA tests were recorded. Despite no significant difference in heart rate increase after warm-up between the two genders regardless of intervention, larger increases after RSA tests were found in males following any of the three interventions (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) with the most notable difference observed after fast-tempo music (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). A significant effect size (r = 0.2) correlated with fast-tempo music during warm-up in either gender. Binaural beat therapy music during warm-up reached a significant effect size only when all participants were considered, suggesting limited benefits.</p>

	<p>We conducted a multicenter, prospective study (EMBRACE) evaluating the real-life effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of eptinezumab (100 mg/300 mg)&amp;amp;mdash;a monoclonal antibody targeting the calcitonin-gene-related peptide (anti-CGRP mAb)&amp;amp;mdash;in high-frequency episodic migraine (HFEM) or chronic migraine (CM). The primary endpoint was the change in monthly migraine days (MMD) for HFEM or monthly headache days (MHD) for CM at weeks 9&amp;amp;ndash;12 compared to baseline. The secondary endpoints included changes in monthly analgesic intake (MAI), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS), Migraine Interictal Burden Scale (MIBS-4), and responder rates. The safety analysis involved 44 subjects; the effectiveness analysis included 26 individuals. Eptinezumab was well-tolerated. In CM patients, eptinezumab significantly reduced MHD (&amp;amp;minus;16.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.9, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), MAI, NRS, HIT-6, MIDAS, and MIBS-4. In HFEM patients, it significantly reduced NRS, HIT-6, MIDAS, and MIBS-4, though reductions in MMD (&amp;amp;minus;3.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.5) and MAI were not statistically significant. Overall, &amp;amp;ge;50% and &amp;amp;ge;75% response rates were 61.5% and 30.8%, respectively (60% and 30% in non-responders to subcutaneous anti-CGRP mAbs). The clinical change was rated as much or very much improved by 61.0% of the patients. Eptinezumab demonstrated high effectiveness, safety, and tolerability in real-life among hard-to-treat migraine patients with multiple treatment failures, including anti-CGRP mAbs.</p>

	<p>The exploration of functional resting-state brain developmental parameters and measures can help to improve scientific, psychological, and medical applications. The present work focussed on both traditional approaches, such as topographical power analyses at the signal space level, and advanced approaches, such as the exploration of age-related dynamics of source space data. The results confirmed the expectation that the third life decade would show a kind of stability in oscillatory signal and source-space-related parameters. However, from a source dynamics perspective, different frequency ranges appear to develop quite differently, as reflected in age-related sequential network communication profiles. Among other discoveries, the left anterior cingulate source location could be shown to reduce bi-directional network communication in the lower alpha band, whereas it differentiated its uni- and bidirectional communication dynamics to sub-cortical and posterior brain locations. Higher alpha oscillations enhanced communication dynamics between the thalamus and particularly frontal areas. In conclusion, resting-state data appear to be, at least in part, functionally reorganized in the default mode network, while quantitative measures, such as topographical power and regional source activity, did not correlate with age in the third life decade. In line with other authors, we suggest the further development of a multi-perspective approach in biosignal analyses.</p>

<p>Lognormal-like skewed spine size distribution is maintained in tumor necrosis factor deficiency and receptor loss. Dendritic spines sizes are distributed lognormally with a high percentage of the population consisting of small spines and a small percentage of the population consisting of large spines. The logarithm of the data shows a normal distribution. In mice exhibiting TNF deficiency, the lognormal distribution is maintained, albeit with a differences in its width, with the TNF deficient mice having more small and large sized spines and less medium sized spines. This finding was also observed in mice lacking TNF-receptor 1 and partially in mice lacking TNF-receptor 2. In mice lacking both TNF-receptor 1 and receptor 2 the lognormal distribution of spine head sizes was maintained, however, the distribution was shifted to the left, indicating a globalised reduction in spine head sizes of all spines. Spines maintain a lognormal distribution in multiple different conditions including homo- and heterosynaptic plasticity, blockage of presynaptic transmitter release and genetic disruption of TNF or its receptors, strenghtening the concept of redistribution of spine head sizes as a crucial functional adaptation within the neuron.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Dendritic spines are sites of synaptic plasticity and their head size correlates with the strength of the corresponding synapse. We recently showed that the distribution of spine head sizes follows a lognormal-like distribution even after blockage of activity or plasticity induction. As the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) influences synaptic transmission and constitutive TNF and receptor (TNF-R)-deficiencies cause changes in spine head size distributions, we tested whether these genetic alterations disrupt the lognormality of spine head sizes. Furthermore, we distinguished between spines containing the actin-modulating protein synaptopodin (SP-positive), which is present in large, strong and stable spines and those lacking it (SP-negative). Our analysis revealed that neither TNF-deficiency nor the absence of TNF-R1, TNF-R2 or TNF-R 1 and 2 (TNF-R1/R2) degrades the general lognormal-like, skewed distribution of spine head sizes (all spines, SP-positive spines, SP-negative spines). However, TNF, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2-deficiency affected the width of the lognormal distribution, and TNF-R1/2-deficiency shifted the distribution to the left. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of the lognormal-like, skewed distribution, which is maintained even in the face of genetic manipulations that alter the distribution of spine head sizes. Our observations are in line with homeostatic adaptation mechanisms of neurons regulating the distribution of spines and their head sizes.</p>

                The brain’s choroid plexus (CP), which operates as an anatomical and functional ‘checkpoint’, regulates the communication between brain and periphery and contributes to the maintenance of healthy brain homeostasis throughout life. Evidence from mouse models and humans reveals a link between loss of CP checkpoint properties and dysregulation of the CP immune milieu as a conserved feature across diverse neurological conditions. In particular, we suggest that an imbalance between different immune signals at the CP, including CD4+ T cell-derived cytokines, type-I interferon, and complement components, can perpetuate brain inflammation and cognitive deterioration in aging and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we highlight the role of CP metabolism in controlling CP inflammation, and propose that targeting molecules that regulate CP metabolism could be effective in safeguarding brain function.

	<p>Dysautonomic disorders are an increasingly studied group of conditions, either as isolated diseases or associated with other neurological disorders. There is growing interest in understanding how dysautonomia affects people with epilepsy, who may report autonomic symptoms before, during and after seizures. Furthermore, autonomic abnormalities appear to play a role in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, likely contributing to the increased mortality rate described in epilepsy. To better understand the association between epilepsy and dysautonomia, we explored electrochemical skin conductance in a group of 18 children and young adults with epilepsy compared to 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls by the SudoscanTM test. We found a significant difference in terms of electrochemical skin conductance, suggesting that people with epilepsy suffer significantly reduced conductance in small nerve fibers. Within patients, values were significantly different according to the type of epilepsy and to neuroimaging results, with lower conductance values in epilepsies of unknown origin and in patients with morphological abnormalities of the brain. Using a non-invasive test, we identified altered conductance of small sympathetic nerve fibers in children and young adults with epilepsy, suggesting underlying dysautonomia. Further studies are needed to investigate this association and to clarify its neurobiological substrates.</p>

	<p>Deficits in memory performance have been linked to a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. While many studies have assessed the memory impacts of individual conditions, this study considers a broader perspective by evaluating how memory recall is differentially associated with nine common neuropsychiatric conditions using data drawn from 55 international studies, aggregating 15,883 unique participants aged 15&amp;amp;ndash;90. The effects of dementia, mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder on immediate, short-, and long-delay verbal learning and memory (VLM) scores were estimated relative to matched healthy individuals. Random forest models identified age, years of education, and site as important VLM covariates. A Bayesian harmonization approach was used to isolate and remove site effects. Regression estimated the adjusted association of each clinical group with VLM scores. Memory deficits were strongly associated with dementia and schizophrenia (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), while neither depression nor ADHD showed consistent associations with VLM scores (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Differences associated with clinical conditions were larger for longer delayed recall duration items. By comparing VLM across clinical conditions, this study provides a foundation for enhanced diagnostic precision and offers new insights into disease management of comorbid disorders.</p>

	<p>Gi-coupled receptors, particularly cannabinoid receptors (CBRs), are considered perspective targets for treating brain pathologies, including epilepsy. However, the precise mechanism of the anticonvulsant effect of the CBR agonists remains unknown. We have found that WIN 55,212-2 (a CBR agonist) suppresses the synchronous oscillations of the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ions (epileptiform activity) induced in the neurons of rat hippocampal neuron-glial cultures by bicuculline or NH4Cl. As we have demonstrated, the WIN 55,212-2 effect is mediated by CB1R receptors. The agonist suppresses Ca2+ inflow mediated by the voltage-gated calcium channels but does not alter the inflow mediated by NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors. We have also found that phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC), and G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRK channels) are involved in the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory action of CB1R activation against epileptiform activity. Thus, our results demonstrate that the antiepileptic action of CB1R agonists is mediated by different intracellular signaling cascades, including non-canonical PLC/PKC-associated pathways.</p>

	<p>Delayed therapy escape (DTE) is frequent after thalamic deep brain stimulation for essential tremor, leading to reduced quality of life, often with ataxic symptoms, and early recognition is challenging. Our goal was to examine whether a low-frequency rebound tremor of the left hand after switching off stimulation is useful as a diagnostic marker for DTE. In this cross-sectional study with additional retrospective analysis, we examined 31 patients with bilateral thalamic DBS &amp;amp;ge; 12 months for essential tremor, using quantitative assessments including video-based motion capture, Fahn&amp;amp;ndash;Tolosa&amp;amp;ndash;Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS), and scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA). If available, preoperative (preOP) and 12-month postoperative assessments were included in the analysis. Evaluations occurred with DBS activated (ON) and deactivated (OFF). A higher ratio FTMTRS nowON/preOP indicated DTE. Preoperative FTMTRS scores were available for 16 patients, including 5 patients with DTE. The receiver operating characteristic analysis found an area under the curve of 0.86 (p = 0.024) for identification of DTE by low-frequency rebound tremor (i.e., OFF) on the left. In conclusion, it could serve as a potential diagnostic marker.</p>

	<p>BACKGROUND: Clinical dynamic posturography concentrates on the pitch and roll but not on the yaw plane instability measures. This emphasis may not represent the axis instability observed in clinical stance and gait tasks for patients with balance deficits in comparison to healthy control (HC) subjects, nor the expected instability based on correlations with vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) deficits. To examine the axis stability changes with vestibular loss, we measured trunk sway in all three directions (pitch, roll, and yaw) during the stance and gait tasks of patients with acute unilateral vestibular neuritis (aUVN) and compared the results with those of HC. Concurrent changes in VORs were also examined and correlated with trunk balance deficits. METHODS: The results of 11 patients (mean age of 61 years) recorded within 6 days of aUVN onset were compared within those of 8 age-matched healthy controls (HCs). All subjects performed a two-legged stance task&amp;amp;mdash;standing with eyes closed on foam (s2ecf), a semi-gait task&amp;amp;mdash;walking eight tandem steps (tan8), and four gait tasks&amp;amp;mdash;walking 3 m with head rotating laterally, pitching, or eyes closed (w3hr, w3hp, w3ec), and walking over four barriers 24 cm high, spaced 1 m apart (barr). The tasks&amp;amp;rsquo; peak-to-peak yaw, pitch and roll angles, and angular velocities were measured with a gyroscope system (SwayStarTM) mounted at L1-3 and combined into three, axis-specific, balance control indexes (BCI), using angles (a) for the tandem gait and barriers task, and angular velocities (v) for all other tasks, as follows: axis BCI = (2 &amp;amp;times; 2ecf)v + 1.5 &amp;amp;times; (w3hr + w3hp + w3ec)v + (tan8 + 12 &amp;amp;times; barr)a. RESULTS: Yaw and pitch BCIs were significantly (p &amp;amp;le; 0.004) greater (88 and 30%, respectively) than roll BCIs for aUVN patients. For HCs, only yaw but not pitch BCIs were greater (p = 0.002) than those of roll (72%). The order of BCI aUVN vs. HC differences was pitch, yaw, and roll at 55, 44, and 31%, respectively (p &amp;amp;le; 0.002). This difference with respect to roll corresponded to the known greater yaw plane than roll plane asymmetry (40 vs. 22%) following aUVN based on VOR responses. However, the lower pitch plane asymmetry (3.5%) in VOR responses did not correspond with the pitch plane instability observed in the balance control tests. The increases in pitch plane instability in UVL subjects were, however, highly correlated with those of roll and yaw. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that greater yaw than pitch and roll trunk motion during clinical balance tasks is common for aUVN patients and HCs. However, aUVN leads to a larger increase in pitch than yaw plane instability and a smaller increase in roll plane instability. This difference with respect to roll corresponds to the known greater yaw plane than roll plane asymmetry (40 vs. 22%) following aUVN observed in VOR responses. However, the lower pitch plane asymmetry (3.5%) in VOR responses does not correspond with the enhanced movements in the pitch plane, observed in balance control tasks. Whether asymmetries in vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (Vemps) are better correlated with the deficits in pitch plane balance control remains to be investigated. The current results provide a strong rationale for the clinical testing of directional specific balance responses, especially yaw and pitch, and the linking of balance results for yaw and roll to VOR asymmetries.</p>

	<p>Chemsex is the interplay of substance use by men who have sex with men (MSM) in sexual contexts. The minority stress model and the identity process theory are explanatory models. In this study, we investigated whether (i) differences in certain psychosocial aspects (i.e., shame, aspects of queer identity, and sexual self-concepts) exist between chemsex users and non-users, and (ii) which factors influence an awareness of negative impacts in chemsex users. We conducted an anonymous, cross-sectional, online survey, including sociodemography, sexual history, history of substance use, validated scales for shame-proneness, aspects of queer identity, and sexual self-concepts. Our analysis comprised descriptive statistics, t-tests, Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlations, and a multiple linear regression model. We recorded a total of 3257 datasets with 107 chemsex users. Chemsex users showed higher rates for risky sexual behavior. Values for shame proneness, more negative aspects of queer identity, and sexual self-concepts were elevated in chemsex users with an awareness of negative impacts. Sexual anxiety, intravenous substance use, and having had a difficult process coming out were significant predictors of feeling negative impacts. Aspects of shame, queer identity aspects, and sexual self-concepts play an important role in the field of chemsex. Different explanatory models seem to be relevant for different subgroups of chemsex users. Chemsex users with an awareness of a problem were particularly vulnerable and distressed but had the highest motivation for change. Prevention, counseling, and care might profit from the inclusion of these aspects. Further anti-stigma campaigns and a specialization of the healthcare system are needed.

	<p>Anomia, characterized by difficulty in word retrieval, particularly action verbs, poses a significant challenge in post-stroke aphasia. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has gained attention for language processing investigations and interventions. This systematic review explores the potential of rTMS as a modality to address action-verb deficits in post-stroke aphasia. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL via Ebsco and Web of Science in February 2024 for English articles (1996&amp;amp;ndash;2024). Eligible studies involved post-stroke aphasia action naming rehabilitation with rTMS. In some of these studies, rTMS was combined with speech-language therapy. In total, 10 studies were included in this systematic review. These articles highlight the potential of rTMS in improving verb retrieval deficits. While significant improvements may not be evident, notable progress both before and after intervention is observed in this review. However, it also underscores the need for further research to enhance language recovery for individuals with post-stroke aphasia.</p>

	<p>Increasing evidence shows that virtual reality (VR) training is highly effective in cognitive and motor rehabilitation. Another modern form of training is cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor dual-task training (CMDT), which has been demonstrated to rapidly improve physical and cognitive functions in real environments. This study aims to test whether a VR-based CMDT protocol can be used for motor and cognitive skill enhancement in young, healthy subjects. For this aim, 24 university students participated in a randomized control trial. The experimental group participated in a 5-week virtual reality reaction training (VRRT), performing 30 min sessions once a week. The control group did not receive any training but was tested twice with the same measures and temporal distance as the experimental group. Before and after the intervention, motor, cognitive, and electrophysiological measures were assessed. The results showed that following VRRT, the response time for both physical and cognitive tests was improved by about 14% and 12%, respectively, while the control group did not show significant changes. Moreover, electrophysiological data revealed a significant increase in anticipatory motor readiness in premotor brain areas in the experimental group only; however, cognitive top&amp;amp;ndash;down control tended to be increased in prefrontal areas after VRRT. This training protocol in a VR modality seems to be as effective as other CMDT methodologies carried out in a real modality. Still, it has the advantages of being more flexible and more user-friendly compared to standard training. The VRRT&amp;amp;rsquo;s efficacy on physical and cognitive functions indicates that virtual reality applications can be used by the young population, not only for entertainment purposes but also in the form of cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor training.</p>

	<p>A body of experimental research has aimed to investigate processes underlying dream formation by examining the effects of a range of pre-sleep stimuli and events on subsequent dream content. Given its ever-growing presence and salience in people&amp;amp;rsquo;s everyday lives, pre-sleep media consumption stands out as a key variable that could influence people&amp;amp;rsquo;s dreams. We conducted a scoping review to evaluate the experimental evidence of the effects of pre-sleep exposure to visual media on dream content. A systematic search on PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science using terms related to moving visual media and dreams yielded 29 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Overall, we found modest yet varied effects of pre-sleep exposure to visual media on dream content, with rates of stimulus-related incorporation ranging from 3% to 43% for REM dream reports, 4% to 30% for NREM sleep mentation reports, and between 11% and 35% for home dream reports. Our review highlights the large methodological heterogeneity and gaps across studies, the general difficulty in influencing dream content using pre-sleep exposure to visual media, and suggests promising venues for future research to advance our understanding of how and why digital media may impact people&amp;amp;rsquo;s dreams.</p>

                Background A neural network is a machine learning algorithm that can learn and make predictions by adjusting the strength of the connections between nodes. The sigmoid function is commonly used as an activation function in these nodes. This study explores the potential applicability of biological materials in the development of alternative activation functions. Methods Inspired by the fact that acetylcholine induces intestinal contractions that follow a sigmoid function, we used pharmacological data obtained from guinea pig ilea in a layered neural network for image classification tasks. Results and Conclusions We found that the intestinal data-based neural network with the same structure as a conventional three-layer perceptron achieved an impressive classification accuracy of 85.7% ± 0.6% based on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset (chance = 10%). Additionally, the neural network was trained to determine whether objects in photographs collected from the internet were digestible, achieving an accuracy of 88.5% ± 0.9% (chance = 50%). Our approach highlights the potential applicability of intestine data in neural computations based on pharmacological mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-301/v2?src=rss">Proposal of a domain model for 3D representation of buildings in Ecuador. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                The accelerated urban sprawl of cities around the world presents major challenges for urban planning and land resource management. In this context, it is crucial to have a detailed 3D representation of buildings enriched with accurate alphanumeric information. A distinctive aspect of this proposal is its specific focus on the spatial unit corresponding to buildings. In order to propose a domain model for the 3D representation of buildings, the national standard of Ecuador and the international standard (ISO 19152:2012 LADM) were considered. The proposal includes a detailed specification of attributes, both for the general subclass of buildings and for their infrastructure. The application of the domain model proposal was crucial in a study area located in the Riobamba canton, due to the characteristics of the buildings in that area. For this purpose, a geodatabase was created in pgAdmin4 with official information, taking into account the structure of the proposed model and linking it with geospatial data for an adequate management and 3D representation of the buildings in an open-source Geographic Information System. This application improves cadastral management in the study region and has wider implications. This model is intended to serve as a benchmark for other countries facing similar challenges in cadastral management and 3D representation of buildings, promote efficient urban development and contribute to global sustainable development.

                Background Cesarean section is the most common obstetric procedure performed. This can lead to maternal anxiety, which is a significant contributor to postpartum depression. This can adversely affect pregnant women both mentally and emotionally, negatively impacting their well-being and family bonding. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of an informative cesarean section operative steps video on the maternal anxiety score compared with standard pre-cesarean section care. Methods This randomized controlled trial was conducted at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand, between April and September 2023. Pregnant women who underwent their first cesarean section were allocated to two groups: intervention and control groups. Participants in the intervention group were required to watch a 5-minute informative video that elaborately described the process from pre-operative steps until post-operative care on the day scheduled for cesarean delivery. All participants received the same routine pre-operative and post-operative care. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure both populations on two occasions: the day of scheduled cesarean delivery and postpartum day 1. Results A total of 178 women were recruited. The demographic and obstetric characteristics were similar between the two groups. The pre-operative STAI scores of the intervention and control groups were 42.9 and 44.1 points, respectively, with no significant difference. However, the post-operative anxiety score showed a significant decline in the intervention group compared to that in the control group (p = 0.002). Moreover, most of the participants in the intervention group showed a low level of anxiety after the operation, while half of the control group remained at a moderate to high level score. Conclusions The provision of an informative educational video before cesarean delivery is a powerful tool that significantly reduces cesarean operative anxiety and improves health outcomes.

                <p>by Jaejoong Kim, Sarah M. Tashjian, Dean Mobbs</p>

Comparative research suggests that the hypothalamus is critical in switching between survival behaviors, yet it is unclear if this is the case in humans. Here, we investigate the role of the human hypothalamus in survival switching by introducing a paradigm where volunteers switch between hunting and escape in response to encounters with a virtual predator or prey. Given the small size and low tissue contrast of the hypothalamus, we used deep learning-based segmentation to identify the individual-specific hypothalamus and its subnuclei as well as an imaging sequence optimized for hypothalamic signal acquisition. Across 2 experiments, we employed computational models with identical structures to explain internal movement generation processes associated with hunting and escaping. Despite the shared structure, the models exhibited significantly different parameter values where escaping or hunting were accurately decodable just by computing the parameters of internal movement generation processes. In experiment 2, multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPA) showed that the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and periaqueductal gray encode switching of survival behaviors while not encoding simple motor switching outside of the survival context. Furthermore, multi-voxel connectivity analyses revealed a network including the hypothalamus as encoding survival switching and how the hypothalamus is connected to other regions in this network. Finally, model-based fMRI analyses showed that a strong hypothalamic multi-voxel pattern of switching is predictive of optimal behavioral coordination after switching, especially when this signal was synchronized with the multi-voxel pattern of switching in the amygdala. Our study is the first to identify the role of the human hypothalamus in switching between survival behaviors and action organization after switching.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-222/v2?src=rss">Case Report: Urethral Diverticulum after Tubularised Incised Plate Repair of Distal Hypospadias: An Uncommon Complication. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction A urethral diverticulum can be defined as a pocket that forms from the lining of the urethra and protrudes into the surrounding tissue, a condition which causes voiding dysfunction and may result as a rare complication of hypospadias repair surgery. Case report We report the case of a 2-year-old child who presented to us in 2019 complaining of a thin forceful stream, ballooning of the ventral aspect of the penis while voiding, and post-void dribbling. He has a history of undergoing a tubularised incised plate urethroplasty for distal penile hypospadias at 18-months-old. Ultrasound showed increased post-void residual volume and cystourethroscopy confirmed a urethral diverticulum extending from the subcorona to the base of the penis. The patient underwent partial excision of diverticulum, urethroplasty, and meatoplasty. He was followed-up 3 months later with complete resolution of his symptoms and a normal urinary stream with no urethral ballooning or dribbling. Conclusion Urethral diverticulum may present as a complication post hypospadias repair. Although it is rare, we believe that it is important for the patient’s parents to understand the possibility and know of the signs and symptoms in addition to attending regular outpatient clinic appointments in order to facilitate early management if needed. Furthermore, it is highly important for physicians to assess newborns for hypospadias before carrying out circumcision as it is a contraindication for the procedure.

                Abstract* Pleomorphic adenomas (PA) are the most prevalent benign salivary gland neoplasms. They may occur at any age, with a peak incidence between 40 and 60 years of age. They are more commonly observed in females (60%). These tumors can arise in both the major and minor salivary glands. Approximately 80% of these tumors are diagnosed in the parotid gland, whereas 10% arise in the minor salivary glands, mainly affecting the palates, followed by the lips and cheeks. This report describes two cases of unusual lesions that were diagnosed as (PA) in the minor salivary glands in our department via a review of the relevant literature. The first case involved an 83-year-old man who presented with a slow-growing swelling on the right side of the upper lip, and the second case involved a 45-year-old woman who presented with a slow-growing lesion on the palate. The presence of PA was confirmed histopathologically after surgical resection. Although relatively rare, PA is a benign lesion, the diagnosis of which must be known for appropriate therapeutic management.

                Background Coronavirus (COVID-19) is the causative agent of the most recent pandemic that hit the globe and has been the cause of a vast range of symptoms, including neurological symptoms. Bell’s palsy is an acute peripheral facial paralysis commonly associated with viral infections. Case presentation This case report describes a patient with incidental COVID-19 infection that led to acute unilateral peripheral facial paralysis, Bell’s palsy. Our patient is a 35-year-old male with no known comorbidities who was presenting with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and was found to be positive for COVID-19. Soon after the onset of symptoms, he also developed right-sided facial weakness in association with his symptoms. A thorough examination revealed a peripheral neurological lesion. The diagnosis of Bell’s palsy secondary to COVID-19 virus infection was through the exclusion of other possible causes. Conclusions This case report suggests a potential link between Bell’s palsy and COVID-19, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive understanding of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19. Further research is essential to determine the significance of neuropathies in COVID-19 and enhance treatment strategies.

                Background Recall of medical instructions is associated with improved adherence to treatment. The recall of the Body Mass Index (BMI) is important for the improvement of adherence to treatments related to obesity. The burden of obesity all over the world has increased, including in many sub-Saharan African countries. This study measured the recall of BMI, shared decision-making (SDM), and patients’ demographics to determine if they were associated. Methods The study was conducted at a rural hospital outpatient clinic in South Western Uganda. Data were collected using a questionnaire and collaboRate-5 tool for measuring shared decision-making. Data were analysed using SPSS version 20. The chi-square test and Pearson coefficient test were done. Results Out of the 92 participants in this study, the median age was 36 years, in an age range of 18 to 87 years, the majority were male 54 (58.7%), most had a background of attending formal education 75 (81.5%), 79 (85.9%) were not able to recall their BMI; 13 (14.1%) were able to recall their BMI. Only gender among demographic factors studied was associated with recall of BMI (p = 0.027). Shared decision-making was associated with the recall of BMI (P < 0.001). Conclusions The proportion of patients who were not able to recall their BMI after the outpatient clinic visit was high. Gender and the use of SDM were associated with recall of BMI. Measured items describing the use of SDM were only reported among 21(22.8%) participants. SDM was underutilized during the study period at the outpatient clinic. There is a need to have continuous medical education on SDM.

                Background Expert consensus methods are regularly used in natural, social, and life sciences. This article explores the potential of applying these methods more frequently in humanities research. Methods The authors reviewed literature and applied the philosophical methods of conceptual analysis and conceptual engineering. Results This article identifies and describes six main elements of expert consensus methods. It also provides an overview of the different types of expert consensus methods regularly used in the natural, social, and life sciences: Delphi studies, nominal groups, consensus conferences, and Glaser’s state of the art method. Subsequently, each of these types is illustrated by an example from the sciences. The article also presents the potential of and objections to the application of expert consensus methods there. It gives four examples of expert consensus methods that were applied in humanities research, also presented in line with the six elements. Conclusions The comparisons and categorization show that, as in the natural, social, and life sciences, expert consensus methods in the humanities can in some instances potentially accelerate the epistemic process and enhance transparency, replicability, diversity, and fair processes. Nevertheless, expert consensus methods need to be fine-tuned to do justice to the unique nature and approaches of the humanities and therefore further research is needed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1067/v3?src=rss">Paravertebral vs. Epidural Analgesia for Liver Surgery (PEALS): Protocol for a randomized controlled pilot study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Perioperative thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is commonly used in hepatectomy patients since it is opioid-sparing. However, TEA has a high failure rate and is associated with potentially devastating complications (spinal haematoma) and the risk is increased with hepatectomy. Thus, some centres favour systemic opioid-based modalities which, in turn, are associated with inferior analgesia and well-known risks/side-effects. Hence, alternative analgesic methods are desirable. Paravertebral block (PVB) has been used in liver resection with advantages including haemodynamic stability, low failure rates, and low risk of spinal haematoma. The purpose of this pilot RCT is to compare continuous TEA (traditional standard of care is local anesthetic (LA) + opioids) with PVB (traditional standard of care is with LA without opioid) for patients undergoing hepatectomy. We hypothesise that pain outcomes will be comparable between groups, but PVB patients will require fewer perioperative vasopressors/blood products, have fewer opioid-related side effects and a shorter hospital length of stay. Methods With ethics approval, this non-inferiority, pilot RCT with a convenience sample of 50 hepatectomy patients will examine whether PVB imparts analgesia comparable to TEA but with fewer adverse effects. Primary outcomes are surrogates of analgesia for 72 h postoperatively (i.e., opioid consumption, time to first analgesic request and pain scores at rest and with coughing); Secondary outcomes are blood products/fluids administered; side effects/complications until 72 h postoperatively; length of hospital stay. The results will be used to plan a large multicentre trial comparing TEA vs. PVB in hepatectomy patients. This study has a high potential to positively impact the quality/safety of patient care.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94836">Modulation of biophysical properties of nucleocapsid protein in the mutant spectrum of SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                Genetic diversity is a hallmark of RNA viruses and the basis for their evolutionary success. Taking advantage of the uniquely large genomic database of SARS-CoV-2, we examine the impact of mutations across the spectrum of viable amino acid sequences on the biophysical phenotypes of the highly expressed and multifunctional nucleocapsid protein. We find variation in the physicochemical parameters of its extended intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) sufficient to allow local plasticity, but also observe functional constraints that similarly occur in related coronaviruses. In biophysical experiments with several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants, we find that point mutations in the IDRs can have nonlocal impact and modulate thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, protein oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid phase separation. In the Omicron variant, distant mutations in different IDRs have compensatory effects in shifting a delicate balance of interactions controlling protein assembly properties, and include the creation of a new protein-protein interaction interface in the N-terminal IDR through the defining P13L mutation. A picture emerges where genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in biophysical characteristics of functional N-protein species, in particular in the IDRs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87753">GABAergic synaptic scaling is triggered by changes in spiking activity rather than AMPA receptor activation</a></h4>

              
                Homeostatic plasticity represents a set of mechanisms that are thought to recover some aspect of neural function. One such mechanism called AMPAergic scaling was thought to be a likely candidate to homeostatically control spiking activity. However, recent findings have forced us to reconsider this idea as several studies suggest AMPAergic scaling is not directly triggered by changes in spiking. Moreover, studies examining homeostatic perturbations <i>in vivo</i> have suggested that GABAergic synapses may be more critical in terms of spiking homeostasis. Here, we show results that GABAergic scaling can act to homeostatically control spiking levels. We found that perturbations which increased or decreased spiking in cortical cultures triggered multiplicative GABAergic upscaling and downscaling, respectively. In contrast, we found that changes in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) or GABAR transmission only influence GABAergic scaling through their indirect effect on spiking. We propose that GABAergic scaling represents a stronger candidate for spike rate homeostat than AMPAergic scaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94056">Self-inhibiting percolation and viral spreading in epithelial tissue</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 induces delayed type-I/III interferon production, allowing it to escape the early innate immune response. The delay has been attributed to a deﬁciency in the ability of cells to sense viral replication upon infection, which in turn hampers activation of the antiviral state in bystander cells. Here, we introduce a cellular automaton model to investigate the spatiotemporal spreading of viral infection as a function of virus and host-dependent parameters. The model suggests that the considerable person-to-person heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 infections is a consequence of high sensitivity to slight variations in biological parameters near a critical threshold. It further suggests that within-host viral proliferation can be curtailed by the presence of remarkably few cells that are primed for IFN production. Thus, the observed heterogeneity in defense readiness of cells reﬂects a remarkably cost-eﬃcient strategy for protection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90278">Serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in the dorsal raphe are differentially altered in a mouse model for parkinsonism</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by motor impairments caused by degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In addition to these symptoms, PD patients often suffer from non-motor comorbidities including sleep and psychiatric disturbances, which are thought to depend on concomitant alterations of serotonergic and noradrenergic transmission. A primary locus of serotonergic neurons is the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), providing brain-wide serotonergic input. Here, we identified electrophysiological and morphological parameters to classify serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in the murine DRN under control conditions and in a PD model, following striatal injection of the catecholamine toxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Electrical and morphological properties of both neuronal populations were altered by 6-OHDA. In serotonergic neurons, most changes were reversed when 6-OHDA was injected in combination with desipramine, a noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor, protecting the noradrenergic terminals. Our results show that the depletion of both NA and dopamine in the 6-OHDA mouse model causes changes in the DRN neural circuitry.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92938">Neural interactions in the human frontal cortex dissociate reward and punishment learning</a></h4>

              
                How human prefrontal and insular regions interact while maximizing rewards and minimizing punishments is unknown. Capitalizing on human intracranial recordings, we demonstrate that the functional specificity toward reward or punishment learning is better disentangled by interactions compared to local representations. Prefrontal and insular cortices display non-selective neural populations to rewards and punishments. Non-selective responses, however, give rise to context-specific interareal interactions. We identify a reward subsystem with redundant interactions between the orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, with a driving role of the latter. In addition, we find a punishment subsystem with redundant interactions between the insular and dorsolateral cortices, with a driving role of the insula. Finally, switching between reward and punishment learning is mediated by synergistic interactions between the two subsystems. These results provide a unifying explanation of distributed cortical representations and interactions supporting reward and punishment learning.

	<p>Respiratory dysfunction is an important hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Elevation of creatine kinase (CK) has been reported in 23&amp;amp;ndash;75% of ALS patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This work aims to enlighten the role of CK as a prognostic factor of respiratory dysfunction in ALS. A retrospective analysis of demographic and clinical variables, CK, functional decline per month (&amp;amp;Delta;FS), forced vital capacity (%FVC), and mean amplitude of the phrenic nerve compound motor action potential (pCMAP) in 319 ALS patients was conducted. These measurements were evaluated at study entry, and patients were followed from the moment of first observation until death or last follow-up visit. High CK values were defined as above the 90th percentile (CK &amp;amp;ge; P90) adjusted to sex. We analyzed survival and time to non-invasive ventilation (NIV) as proxies for respiratory impairment. Linear regression analysis revealed that high CK was associated with male sex (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), spinal onset (p = 0.018), and FVC &amp;amp;ge; 80% (p = 0.038). CK was 23.4% higher in spinal-onset ALS patients (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). High CK levels were not linked with an increased risk of death (p = 0.334) in Cox multivariate regression analysis. CK &amp;amp;ge; P90 (HR = 1.001, p = 0.038), shorter disease duration (HR = 0.937, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), lower pCMAP (HR = 0.082, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and higher &amp;amp;Delta;FS (HR = 1.968, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) were risk factors for respiratory failure. The association between high CK levels and poorer respiratory outcomes could derive from cellular metabolic stress or a specific phenotype associated with faster respiratory decline. Our study suggests that CK measurement at diagnosis should be more extensively investigated as a possible marker of poor respiratory outcome in future studies, including a larger population of patients.</p>

	<p>Depression is clinically diagnosed when a defined constellation of symptoms manifests over a specific duration with notable severity. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by the presence of five or more symptoms persisting for at least two weeks. As a profound mental health condition affecting millions globally, depression presents a considerable challenge for researchers and clinicians alike. In pediatric and adolescent populations, depression can precipitate adverse outcomes, including substance abuse, academic difficulties, risky sexual behaviors, physical health problems, impaired social relationships, and a markedly elevated risk of suicide&amp;amp;mdash;up to thirty times higher than the general population. This paper details a study that evaluated the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) alone vs. CBT combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in a treatment program. The study cohort comprised sixteen (16) children and adolescents diagnosed with depression (eight males and eight females) and sixteen (16) typically developing peers (eight males and eight females) aged from 9 to 15 years (Mean age = 11.94, standard deviation = 2.02). Initial assessments employed Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), the Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s Depression Inventory (CDI), and reaction time measurements. The results reveal that participants with depression exhibit cognitive deficits in attention and memory, as evidenced by prolonged P300 latencies. Following intervention with either CBT alone or CBT combined with medication, the depressed participants demonstrated significant improvements, evidenced by lower CDI scores, reduced P300 latencies, and faster reaction times, both compared to their pre-treatment status and relative to the control group.</p>

	<p>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a side effect of cancer treatment, often linked with pain complaints. Patients report mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity that may emerge during chemotherapy treatment and may persist after cancer remission. Whereas the latter situation disturbs the quality of life, life itself may be endangered by the appearance of CIPN during cancer treatment. The causes of CIPN have almost entirely been ascribed to the neurotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs in the peripheral nervous system. However, the central consequences of peripheral neuropathy are starting to be unraveled, namely in the supraspinal pain modulatory system. Based on our interests and experience in the field, we undertook a review of the brain-centered alterations that may underpin pain in CIPN. The changes in the descending pain modulation in CIPN models along with the functional and connectivity abnormalities in the brain of CIPN patients are analyzed. A translational analysis of preclinical findings about descending pain regulation during CIPN is reviewed considering the main neurochemical systems (serotoninergic and noradrenergic) targeted in CIPN management in patients, namely by antidepressants. In conclusion, this review highlights the importance of studying supraspinal areas involved in descending pain modulation to understand the pathophysiology of CIPN, which will probably allow a more personalized and effective CIPN treatment in the future.</p>

	<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), major depressive disorder (MDD) is the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide and the second most common disease after cardiovascular events. Approximately 280 million people live with MDD, with incidence varying by age and gender (female to male ratio of approximately 2:1). Although a variety of antidepressants are available for the different forms of MDD, there is still a high degree of individual variability in response and tolerability. Given the complexity and clinical heterogeneity of these disorders, a shift from &amp;amp;ldquo;canonical treatment&amp;amp;rdquo; to personalized medicine with improved patient stratification is needed. OPADE is a non-profit study that researches biomarkers in MDD to tailor personalized drug treatments, integrating genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, immune response, and clinical data for analysis. A total of 350 patients between 14 and 50 years will be recruited in 6 Countries (Italy, Colombia, Spain, The Netherlands, Turkey) for 24 months. Real-time electroencephalogram (EEG) and patient cognitive assessment will be correlated with biological sample analysis. A patient empowerment tool will be deployed to ensure patient commitment and to translate patient stories into data. The resulting data will be used to train the artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) predictive tool.</p>

	<p>Menopause may increase the risk of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) dementia. This study aimed to use young plasma therapy (YPT) to improve dementia caused by AD in aged ovariectomized rats. Female Wistar rats were used in the following groups: (a) young (CY) (180&amp;amp;ndash;200 g, 2&amp;amp;ndash;3 months, n = 10) and (b) old groups (250&amp;amp;ndash;350 g, 22&amp;amp;ndash;24 months, n = 60). The old rats were randomly assigned to six sub-groups: (1) control, (2) sham, (3) ovariectomized group (OVX), (4) OVX + Alzheimer disease (OVX + AD), (5) OVX + AD+ 17&amp;amp;beta;-Estradiol (OVX + AD + E), and (6) OVX + AD + young plasma (OVX + AD + YP). Cognitive behaviors were evaluated using NOR, MWM, and PAL tests. MiR-134a, SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF expressions were measured using real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. Oxidative stress in hippocampal tissue was assayed using ELISA kits. OVX and AD caused significant cognitive impairment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), up-regulated miR-134a (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), down-regulated SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF protein expression (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and decreased antioxidant marker levels (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) compared to the sham group. YPT significantly restored miR-134a (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), SIRT-1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), CREB (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and BDNF (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) protein expression in OVX + AD rats. YPT, as much as or more than estrogen therapy (ERT), significantly improved oxidative stress and down-regulated miR-134a expression and the up-regulation of SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF proteins in OVX + AD rats (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). YPT significantly improved histological alteration compared to the OVX + AD group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). As a non-pharmacological treatment, YPT can improve the expression of miR-134a and SIRT-1, CREB, and BDNF proteins as much as or more than estrogen therapy, ameliorating AD-induced dementia in aged OVX rats.</p>

	<p>This study examined the impact of personalizing muscle vibration parameters on trunk control. We assessed how altered trunk extensor muscle (TEM) proprioception affects seated trunk control in healthy controls (HCs). To explore the link between altered TEM proprioception and impaired trunk control in chronic low back pain (cLBP), we performed equivalence testing between HCs undergoing TEM vibration and cLBP without vibration. Twenty HCs performed active joint reposition error (AJRE) testing to determine personalized vibration parameters. Each participant maintained balance on an unstable chair with eyes open and closed, with and without TEM vibration. We compared trunk control between HCs and twenty age- and sex-matched cLBP participants, using mean velocity and 95% confidence ellipse area of center-of-pressure changes to quantify trunk postural control. Equivalence was examined by comparing mean difference scores to minimal detectable change values and calculating between-group effect sizes. Personalized vibration parameters led to larger lumbopelvic repositioning errors (d = 0.89) than any single vibration frequency (d = 0.31&amp;amp;ndash;0.36). In healthy adults with no back pain, vision had large effects on postural control (&amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.604&amp;amp;ndash;0.842), but TEM vibration had no significant effects (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.105) or interactions with vision (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.423). Between-group effect sizes (d = 0.32&amp;amp;ndash;0.51) exceeded our threshold for performance equivalence (d &amp;amp;lt; 0.2). Muscle vibration altered position sense during AJRE testing, and personalizing parameters amplified this effect. However, TEM vibration had minimal impact on seated trunk postural control in adults with no back pain and did not lead to performance degradation comparable to that in cLBP.</p>

                Introduction and aim Periodontal disease, initiated by dental biofilm and influenced by various local and systemic factors, includes stress as a potential contributor to its progression. Despite associations with severe forms like acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, a comprehensive large-sample study linking stress to periodontal disease is lacking. This study aims to investigate the relationship between mental health and periodontal disease. Materials and Methods Leveraging data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), relevant information was extracted. Mental health was the exposure variable, and periodontal disease, assessed through indices following Eke et al.'s definition, served as the outcome. Covariates impacting periodontal disease were considered, and demographic and disease status analyses employed the Rao-Scott chi-squared test. A logistic regression model assessed mental health's impact on periodontal disease. Results Logistic regression indicated higher odds of periodontal disease among individuals feeling bad about themselves for more than half of the day (OR 1.170, 95% CI 0.533-2.474), though statistical significance was not reached. Periodontitis prevalence significantly varied based on marital status, with 6.6% of married and 10.8% of unmarried subjects affected. Notably, a statistically significant difference in periodontitis prevalence existed between subjects with health insurance (8.3%) and those without (16.5%). Conclusion Within study limitations, it is concluded that no significant difference exists in periodontal status between individuals with compromised mental health and those without. The findings underscore potential associations between mental health, marital status, and access to health insurance with periodontal disease.

                Background The goal of the Fifth Annual Baylor College of Medicine & DNAnexus Structural Variation Hackathon was to push forward the research on structural variants (SVs) by rapidly developing and deploying open-source software. The event took place in-person and virtually in August 2023, when 49 scientists from 14 countries and 8 U.S. states collaboratively worked on projects to address critical gaps in the field of genomics. The hackathon projects concentrated on developing bioinformatic workflows for the following challenges: RNA transcriptome comparison, simulation of mosaic variations, metagenomics, Mendelian variation, SVs in plant genomics, and assembly vs. mapping SV calling comparisons. Methods As a starting point we used publicly available data from state-of-the-art long- and short-read sequencing technologies. The workflows developed during the hackathon incorporated open-source software, as well as scripts written using Bash and Python. Moreover, we leveraged the advantages of Docker and Snakemake for workflow automation. Results The results of the hackathon consists of six prototype bioinformatic workflows that use open-source software for SV research. We made the workflows scalable and modular for usability and reproducibility. Furthermore, we tested the workflows on example public data to show that the workflows can work. The code and the data produced during the event have been made publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/collaborativebioinformatics) to reproduce and built upon in the future. Conclusions The following sections describe the motivation, lessons learned, and software produced by teams during the hackathon. Here, we describe in detail the objectives, value propositions, implementation, and use cases for our workflows. In summary, the article reports the advancements in the development of software for SV detection made during the hackathon.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-707/v1?src=rss">Roles and Current Challenges of Peer Educators in delivering HIV/AIDS-related services: a case study in VietNam [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Increasing the participation of peer educators (PEs) to deliver HIV/AIDS services in a limited income context remains challenging, despite their profound effectiveness, and this has become more evident since the COVID-19 outbreak. This study examines the roles of PEs and the current challenges in delivering HIV/AIDS services in Vietnam. Methods A mixed-method approach was employed. The study was conducted in seven large provinces in Vietnam from December 2021 to March 2022. An online cross-sectional survey was administered to 63 health staff and 147 PEs to collect quantitative data on PEs’ roles. Qualitative interviews included seven focus-group discussions with 39 PEs and in-depth interviews with 25 key informants, including seven leaders and 14 health staff from district health centers and provincial centers for disease control (CDCs), one national-level HIV/AIDS program manager, one non-government organization representative, and two senior experts. Results Results show the diversified roles of PEs in delivering HIV/AIDS activities in Vietnam. The roles could be categorized into two main groups, including community-based activities and facilities-based activities. Prominent roles are identifying and referring customers to HIV testing services, conducting communication and education activities, and referring patients to treatment services. The study shows a decrease in the roles of PEs in delivering HIV/AIDS services in Vietnam despite the high demand for their participation from healthcare providers. Critical challenges in employing PEs in HIV/AIDS services are related to lack of funding, inadequate training, lack of recognition, and stigma. Conclusion To keep the right path to the goal of ending the HIV pandemic by 2030, it is important to maintain and increase the roles of PEs in delivering HIV/AIDS services. Raising better acknowledgment from stakeholders of PEs’ roles could help overcome the remaining challenges and expand their participation toward this goal.

                <p>by Youcheng Li, Leann Lac, Qian Liu, Pingzhao Hu</p>

Spatial transcriptomics has gained popularity over the past decade due to its ability to evaluate transcriptome data while preserving spatial information. Cell segmentation is a crucial step in spatial transcriptomic analysis, as it enables the avoidance of unpredictable tissue disentanglement steps. Although high-quality cell segmentation algorithms can aid in the extraction of valuable data, traditional methods are frequently non-spatial, do not account for spatial information efficiently, and perform poorly when confronted with the problem of spatial transcriptome cell segmentation with varying shapes. In this study, we propose ST-CellSeg, an image-based machine learning method for spatial transcriptomics that uses manifold for cell segmentation and is novel in its consideration of multi-scale information. We first construct a fully connected graph which acts as a spatial transcriptomic manifold. Using multi-scale data, we then determine the low-dimensional spatial probability distribution representation for cell segmentation. Using the adjusted Rand index (ARI), normalized mutual information (NMI), and Silhouette coefficient (SC) as model performance measures, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline models in selected datasets and is efficient in computational complexity.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012195">Prioritizing drug targets by perturbing biological network response functions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthew C. Perrone, Michael G. Lerner, Matthew Dunworth, Andrew J. Ewald, Joel S. Bader</p>

Therapeutic interventions are designed to perturb the function of a biological system. However, there are many types of proteins that cannot be targeted with conventional small molecule drugs. Accordingly, many identified gene-regulatory drivers and downstream effectors are currently undruggable. Drivers and effectors are often connected by druggable signaling and regulatory intermediates. Methods to identify druggable intermediates therefore have general value in expanding the set of targets available for hypothesis-driven validation. Here we identify and prioritize potential druggable intermediates by developing a network perturbation theory, termed NetPert, for response functions of biological networks. Dynamics are defined by a network structure in which vertices represent genes and proteins, and edges represent gene-regulatory interactions and protein-protein interactions. Perturbation theory for network dynamics prioritizes targets that interfere with signaling from driver to response genes. Applications to organoid models for metastatic breast cancer demonstrate the ability of this mathematical framework to identify and prioritize druggable intermediates. While the short-time limit of the perturbation theory resembles betweenness centrality, NetPert is superior in generating target rankings that correlate with previous wet-lab assays and are more robust to incomplete or noisy network data. NetPert also performs better than a related graph diffusion approach. Wet-lab assays demonstrate that drugs for targets identified by NetPert, including targets that are not themselves differentially expressed, are active in suppressing additional metastatic phenotypes.

                <p>by Apolline Louvet, Clément Mantoux, Nathalie Machon</p>

As the spatial arrangement of trees planted along streets in cities makes their bases potential ecological corridors for the flora, urban tree bases may be a key contributor to the overall connectivity of the urban ecosystem. However, these tree bases are also a highly fragmented environment in which extinctions are frequent. The goal of this study was to assess the plant species’ ability to survive and spread through urban tree bases. To do so, we developed a Bayesian framework to assess the extinction risk of a plant metapopulation using presence/absence data, assuming that the occupancy dynamics was described by a Hidden Markov Model. The novelty of our approach is to take into account the combined effect of low-distance dispersal and the potential presence of a seed bank on the extinction risk. We introduced a metric of the extinction risk and examined its performance over a wide range of metapopulation parameters. We applied our framework to yearly floristic inventories carried out in 1324 tree bases in Paris, France. While local extinction risks were generally high, extinction risks at the street scale varied greatly from one species to another. We identified 10 plant species that could survive and spread through urban tree bases, and three plant traits correlated with the extinction risk at the metapopulation scale: the maximal height, and the beginning and end of the flowering period. Our results suggest that some plant species can use urban tree bases as ecological corridors despite high local extinction risks by forming a seed bank. We also identified other plant traits correlated with the ability to survive in tree bases, related to the action of gardeners. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that our Bayesian estimation framework based on percolation theory has the potential to be extended to more general metapopulations.

                <p>by Caleb J. Holt, Kenneth D. Miller, Yashar Ahmadian</p>

When stimulated, neural populations in the visual cortex exhibit fast rhythmic activity with frequencies in the gamma band (30-80 Hz). The gamma rhythm manifests as a broad resonance peak in the power-spectrum of recorded local field potentials, which exhibits various stimulus dependencies. In particular, in macaque primary visual cortex (V1), the gamma peak frequency increases with increasing stimulus contrast. Moreover, this contrast dependence is local: when contrast varies smoothly over visual space, the gamma peak frequency in each cortical column is controlled by the local contrast in that column’s receptive field. No parsimonious mechanistic explanation for these contrast dependencies of V1 gamma oscillations has been proposed. The stabilized supralinear network (SSN) is a mechanistic model of cortical circuits that has accounted for a range of visual cortical response nonlinearities and contextual modulations, as well as their contrast dependence. Here, we begin by showing that a reduced SSN model without retinotopy robustly captures the contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency, and provides a mechanistic explanation for this effect based on the observed non-saturating and supralinear input-output function of V1 neurons. Given this result, the local dependence on contrast can trivially be captured in a retinotopic SSN which however lacks horizontal synaptic connections between its cortical columns. However, long-range horizontal connections in V1 are in fact strong, and underlie contextual modulation effects such as surround suppression. We thus explored whether a retinotopically organized SSN model of V1 with strong excitatory horizontal connections can exhibit both surround suppression and the local contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency. We found that retinotopic SSNs can account for both effects, but only when the horizontal excitatory projections are composed of two components with different patterns of spatial fall-off with distance: a short-range component that only targets the source column, combined with a long-range component that targets columns neighboring the source column. We thus make a specific qualitative prediction for the spatial structure of horizontal connections in macaque V1, consistent with the columnar structure of cortex.

                <p>by Devon J. Boland, Nicola M. Ayres</p>

AlphaFold2 is an Artificial Intelligence-based program developed to predict the 3D structure of proteins given only their amino acid sequence at atomic resolution. Due to the accuracy and efficiency at which AlphaFold2 can generate 3D structure predictions and its widespread adoption into various aspects of biochemical research, the technique of protein structure prediction should be considered for incorporation into the undergraduate biochemistry curriculum. A module for introducing AlphaFold2 into a senior-level biochemistry laboratory classroom was developed. The module’s focus was to have students predict the structures of proteins from the MPOX 22 global outbreak virus isolate genome, which had no structures elucidated at that time. The goal of this study was to both determine the impact the module had on students and to develop a framework for introducing AlphaFold2 into the undergraduate curriculum so that instructors for biochemistry courses, regardless of their background in bioinformatics, could adapt the module into their classrooms.

Throughout history, humans have relied on plants as a source of medication, flavoring, and food. Plants synthesize large chemical libraries and release many of these compounds into the rhizosphere and atmosphere where they affect animal and microbe behavior. To survive, nematodes must have evolved the sensory capacity to distinguish plant-made small molecules (SMs) that are harmful and must be avoided from those that are beneficial and should be sought. This ability to classify chemical cues as a function of their value is fundamental to olfaction and represents a capacity shared by many animals, including humans. Here, we present an efficient platform based on multiwell plates, liquid handling instrumentation, inexpensive optical scanners, and bespoke software that can efficiently determine the valence (attraction or repulsion) of single SMs in the model nematode, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Using this integrated hardware-wetware-software platform, we screened 90 plant SMs and identified 37 that attracted or repelled wild-type animals but had no effect on mutants defective in chemosensory transduction. Genetic dissection indicates that for at least 10 of these SMs, response valence emerges from the integration of opposing signals, arguing that olfactory valence is often determined by integrating chemosensory signals over multiple lines of information. This study establishes that <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> is an effective discovery engine for determining chemotaxis valence and for identifying natural products detected by the chemosensory nervous system.

                <p>by Lingchao Ji, Beatriz C. Borges, David T. Martel, Calvin Wu, M. Charles Liberman, Susan E. Shore, Gabriel Corfas</p>

Loss of synapses between spiral ganglion neurons and inner hair cells (IHC synaptopathy) leads to an auditory neuropathy called hidden hearing loss (HHL) characterized by normal auditory thresholds but reduced amplitude of sound-evoked auditory potentials. It has been proposed that synaptopathy and HHL result in poor performance in challenging hearing tasks despite a normal audiogram. However, this has only been tested in animals after exposure to noise or ototoxic drugs, which can cause deficits beyond synaptopathy. Furthermore, the impact of supernumerary synapses on auditory processing has not been evaluated. Here, we studied mice in which IHC synapse counts were increased or decreased by altering neurotrophin 3 (Ntf3) expression in IHC supporting cells. As we previously showed, postnatal Ntf3 knockdown or overexpression reduces or increases, respectively, IHC synapse density and suprathreshold amplitude of sound-evoked auditory potentials without changing cochlear thresholds. We now show that IHC synapse density does not influence the magnitude of the acoustic startle reflex or its prepulse inhibition. In contrast, gap-prepulse inhibition, a behavioral test for auditory temporal processing, is reduced or enhanced according to Ntf3 expression levels. These results indicate that IHC synaptopathy causes temporal processing deficits predicted in HHL. Furthermore, the improvement in temporal acuity achieved by increasing Ntf3 expression and synapse density suggests a therapeutic strategy for improving hearing in noise for individuals with synaptopathy of various etiologies.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27019?af=R">Metabolic Syndrome and Risk of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Insights from a Large‐Scale Prospective Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although metabolic abnormalities are implicated in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, their role in the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains a subject of controversy. We aimed to identify the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the risk of ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study included 395,987 participants from the UK Biobank to investigate the relationship between MetS and ALS. Cox regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR). Stratified analyses were performed based on gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and education level. Mediation analysis was conducted to explore potential mechanisms.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In this study, a total of 539 cases of ALS were recorded after a median follow-up of 13.7 years. Patients with MetS (defined harmonized) had a higher risk of developing ALS after adjusting for confounding factors (HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.19–1.89). Specifically, hypertension and high triglycerides were linked to a higher risk of ALS (HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.19–1.95; HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.06–1.61, respectively). Moreover, the quantity of metabolic abnormalities showed significant results. Stratified analysis revealed that these associations are particularly significant in individuals with a BMI &lt;25. These findings remained stable after sensitivity analysis. Notably, mediation analysis identified potential metabolites and metabolomic mediators, including alkaline phosphatase, cystatin C, γ-glutamyl transferase, saturated fatty acids to total fatty acids percentage, and omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids ratio.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MetS exhibits a robust association with an increased susceptibility to ALS, particularly in individuals with a lower BMI. Furthermore, metabolites and metabolomics, as potential mediators, provide invaluable insights into the intricate biological mechanisms. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27016?af=R">Inflammation‐Triggered Enlargement of Choroid Plexus in Subacute COVID‐19 Patients with Neurological Symptoms</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether choroid plexus volumes in subacute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with neurological symptoms could indicate inflammatory activation or barrier dysfunction and assess their association with clinical data.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Choroid plexus volumes were measured in 28 subacute COVID-19 patients via cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compared with those in infection-triggered non-COVID-19 encephalopathy patients (n = 25), asymptomatic individuals after COVID-19 (n = 21), and healthy controls (n = 21). Associations with inflammatory serum markers (peak counts of leukocytes, C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin 6), an MRI-based marker of barrier dysfunction (CSF volume fraction [V-CSF]), and clinical parameters like olfactory performance and cognitive scores (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) were investigated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>COVID-19 patients showed significantly larger choroid plexus volumes than control groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.172). These volumes correlated significantly with peak leukocyte levels (<i>p</i> = 0.001, Pearson's r = 0.621) and V-CSF (<i>p</i> = 0.009, Spearman's rho = 0.534), but neither with CRP nor interleukin 6. No significant correlations were found with clinical parameters.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with subacute COVID-19, choroid plexus volume is a marker of central nervous system inflammation and barrier dysfunction in the presence of neurologic symptoms. The absence of plexus enlargement in infection-triggered non-COVID-19 encephalopathy suggests a specific severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 effect. This study also documents an increase in choroid plexus volume for the first time as a parainfectious event. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1183/v2?src=rss">The influence of the fourth industrial revolution in teaching and learning: the COVID-19 context [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The aim of this paper was to explore how the Fourth Industrial Revolution shapes teaching and learning during COVID-19 in some of the schools located in the Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces, South Africa. This paper employed qualitative interpretative multiple case study design. Purposive sampling was used to sample our participants. Methods We selected four teachers who separately taught at the early childhood development stage, intermediate phase, senior phase, and further education and training phases. Data was collected telephonically through semi-structured interviews with teachers from Limpopo, Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa. Data was collected from their experiences of COVID-19 from 2019 to 2021. Collected data was analysed using a typology approach whereby themes that derived from the literature reviewed and research questions were used. Results We inferred from the results of the paper that teachers had challenges with teaching and availability of learning resources, such as limited access to internet and socio-economic backgrounds, which hindered the integration of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the teaching and learning process. There were also challenges related to teachers’ background on the usage of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the lack of school management teams support. The paper revealed that the integration of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in teaching and learning was affected negatively by the existence of the above-mentioned challenges, which needs to be addressed. Conclusions Therefore, we recommended that the government and stakeholders within the education sector provide resources such as smart-boards, computers, and network access in schools lacking such facilities, as well as providing professional development interventions and training teachers to have an in-depth understanding of the Fourth Industrial Revolution within the teaching and learning context.

                Fish species are commonly used as experimental models in the laboratory. DNA is routinely collected from these animals to permit identification of their genotype. The current standard procedure to sample DNA is fin clipping, which involves anaesthetising individuals and removing a portion of the caudal fin. While fin clipping reliably generates good quality DNA samples for downstream applications, there is evidence that it can alter health and welfare, and impact the fish’s behaviour. This in turn can result in greater variation in the data collected. In a recent study we adapted a skin swabbing protocol to collect DNA from small-bodied fish, including sticklebacks and zebrafish, without the use of analgesics, anaesthetics or sharp instruments. A rayon-tipped swab was used to collect mucus from the flank of the fish, which was then used for DNA extraction. We subsequently demonstrated that compared to fin clipping, skin swabbing triggered fewer changes in stress axis activation and behaviour. We also found that gene expression and behaviour data collected from swabbed fish were less variable than similar data collected from fish that had been fin clipped. This potentially allows smaller sample sizes in experimental groups to be used after skin swabbing, thereby reducing animal use. Here we provide a detailed protocol explaining how to collect DNA samples from small laboratory fish using skin swabs.

                Background Kimono is being reevaluated for its sustainability aspects, such as having fewer offcuts in the production process due to its structural differences from Western-style clothes and its high reusability due to the adaptability to individuals’ body shapes. On the other hand, once a common attire for daily wear in Japan, kimono has transitioned to being worn only on special events and the kimono-related industry has also shrunk. To stimulate demand for kimono, it is essential to familiarize younger generations with its potential as daily wear. Methods A questionnaire survey on perceptions of kimono was conducted among two groups in Japan: 211 college students and 50 kimono enthusiasts. The questionnaire included demographic questions and psychometric scales, primarily focusing on their kimono experiences, challenges associated with wearing kimono, their perceptions of kimono and Western-style clothes, and their attitudes towards kimono. Results The results revealed that a majority of students had worn kimono before, though they found it difficult to move while wearing it. In contrast, kimono enthusiasts evaluated it as easier to move, hard to become disheveled, and casual. They also rated the ease of wearing Western-style clothes lower compared to students, and this tendency intensified with the length of enthusiast experience. Furthermore, the findings indicated that enthusiasts regarded the kimono more as daily wear compared to students, while still deriving enjoyment from it as formal attire in special events. Conclusions These results suggest that the cognition that Western-style clothes are easy to move and kimono is not may change with experiences. Therefore, providing opportunities for people in Japan to acquire how to wear kimono in comfortable ways possibly impacts their perceptions of kimono.

                Background Various stemness markers (SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG) have been studied in odontogenic cysts and tumors. However, studies on SALL4 having similar properties of stemness has not been documented. Additionally, insight into fascin as a migratory molecule is less explored. In this study, the expression of SALL4 and fascin were evaluated in ameloblastoma, adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT), odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), dentigerous cyst (DC), radicular cyst (RC), and calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC). Methods Semi-quantitative analysis of fascin and SALL4 immuno-positive cells was done in a total of 40 cases of ameloblastoma (11 plexiform, 12 follicular, 12 unicystic, and 5 desmoplastic) variants, 6 cases of AOT, 15 each of OKC, DC, RC and 5 of COC. Chi-square test was applied to evaluate the association between SALL4 and fascin expression in odontogenic cysts and tumors. Results Fascin immunopositivity was observed in peripheral ameloblast-like cells, and the expression was weak or absent in stellate reticulum-like cells. A moderate to weak immune-reactivity to SALL4 was observed in the cytoplasm of ameloblastoma, epithelial cells of dentigerous and radicular cysts, having a marked inflammatory infiltrate, which was an interesting observation. COC and AOT had negative to weak expressions. No recurrence has been reported. Conclusions Expression of fascin in ameloblastomas elucidate their role in motility and localized invasion. Its expression in less aggressive lesions like DC, COC, AOT will incite to explore the other functional properties of fascin. SALL4 expression in the cytoplasm of odontogenic cysts and tumors may represent inactive or mutant forms which requires further validation.

                Background Technology has completely transformed healthcare, starting with X-ray machines and MRIs to telehealth and robotic surgeries to e-health records. The launch of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) serves as a milestone in medical history, offering benefits such as smaller incisions, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery, making it a preferred surgical option. This study mainly explores patients’ willingness to adopt robot-assisted surgery (RAS) technology in a surgical intervention and is assessed in the backdrop of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Methods This research project employs a post-positivist research philosophy and a cross-sectional research design. A structured, pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data from 280 respondents. Results The results revealed that trust had a significant impact on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.099) and Perceived Ease of Use (β = .157), and eHealth literacy had a significant impact on Perceived Ease of Use (β = 0.438) and Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.454). Additionally, Perceived Usefulness partially influenced behavioral intention (β = 0.123), and attitude had a significant influence on behavioral intention (β = 0.612). The analysis revealed an insignificant impact of eHealth literacy on Perceived Usefulness (β = 0.067). The Standard Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) value was <0.8. Mediation analysis also revealed partial mediation between the constructs. The SRMR rating of this model is 0.067, indicating that it fits the data well. Conclusion This study revealed that a patient's intention will be high if he or she believes that RAS is beneficial in treating his or her ailment. In comparison, information related to RAS is clearly known, and it does not directly affect selection intention. eHealth literacy is a significant antecedent to patients’ behavioral intention. Hence, the healthcare industry must devise strategies to promote the acceptance of RAS at all levels.

                Background In Sierra Leone, the National Emergency Medical Services (NEMS) was designed to facilitate maternal and under-five referrals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, health facilities were repurposed and mobility restrictions were introduced, and this might have negatively influenced access to care. Thus, we compared utilization, timeliness and outcomes of referrals between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. Methods This was a cohort study using routinely collected data by the NEMS. There were 65 weeks in the pre-COVID-19 period (week one of January 2019 to week three of March 2020) and 91 weeks in the COVID-19 period (week four of March 2020 to week four of December 2021). We compared weekly referrals and the duration from initiating the NEMS for a referral to the patient reaching the receiving facility (prehospital delay) using the Mann–Whitney U test. Chi-squared tests were used to compare the mode of transportation and referral outcomes. Results Compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, there was significant decrease during the COVID-19 period in the median number of weekly maternal referrals (277 to 205), under-five referrals (177 to 104) and transfers on NEMS ambulances (348 to 269). The prehospital delays increased during the COVID-19 period for both maternal (72 to 86 minutes) and under-five (75 to 90 minutes) referrals (p<0.001). The percentage of NEMS ambulance transfers for maternal referrals was similar in both periods (90%), but for under-five referrals this decreased between the pre-COVID-19 (72%) and COVID-19 (68%) periods. In both periods, maternal (98%) and under-five (96%) referrals were successfully admitted to the receiving facilities. Conclusions The performance of the NEMS system in terms of referrals reaching the receiving health facilities was maintained during the pandemic. However, there is a need to sustain the current performance of the NEMS system while making more efforts to increase utilization and reduce delays during outbreaks/pandemics.

                Richter’s hernia is a rare type of abdominal wall hernia characterized by high morbidity and mortality. It occurs when the anti-mesenteric border of the bowel is partially trapped in a tight hernial ring. The femoral ring is the most common site, with the ileum being the most frequently involved intestinal segment. However, the advent of laparoscopic surgery has introduced another potential site for Richter’s hernia formation. In our region, this pathological entity is exceptionally diagnosed due to limited access to abdominal imaging and delayed management. Additionally, the wide variety of clinical manifestations resulting from incomplete intestinal obstruction makes it particularly difficult to diagnose. Consequently, it is usually identified during surgery. We present here the case of two adult patients (a 33-yeairs-old woman and a 59-year-old man), the first with a history of surgical procedures and the second with a spontaneously reducible painless inguinal swelling. They were transferred to the surgical emergency department for an acute abdomen with abdominal distension and cessation of matter and gas. Clinical and paraclinical examinations (including hydroaeric level on abdominal X-ray) indicated mechanical intestinal obstruction. Emergency laparotomy, necessitated by the unavailability of abdominal computed tomography due to financial constraints, confirmed the diagnosis of Richter's hernia, with the first case located in the right inguinal region and the second in the linea alba. Surgical management involved reduction of the hernia contents and suture repair in both cases. Despite requiring bowel resection in the second patient, the postoperative course was straightforward. These two rare cases highlight that emergency exploratory laparotomy is the cornerstone of Richter hernia management in resource-limited conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-701/v1?src=rss">A systematic review on Artificial Intelligence applied to predictive cardiovascular risk analysis in liver transplantation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Liver transplantation is the ultimate therapeutic option for patients with end-stage liver disease. The clinical management of transplant patients significantly impacts their prognosis, with outcomes influenced by multiple interacting variables. Cardiovascular complications count as a leading cause of both short-term and long-term morbidity and mortality in liver transplant recipients. In this respect, accurate risk assessment and stratification are crucial for optimizing clinical outcomes. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have significant potential for early risk prediction, providing comprehensive risk assessments in both diagnosed cohorts and early clinical phase patients. This systematic review examines the state of the art in AI applications for predicting cardiovascular risks in liver transplantation, identifying current issues, challenges, and future research directions. We reviewed articles from digital repositories such as PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect published between 2000 and 2023, using keywords including artificial intelligence, machine learning, cardiovascular, and liver transplantation. Our analysis revealed a diverse range of machine learning algorithms used in this domain. Despite the potential, only 12 papers met the criteria for adequate topic coverage, highlighting a scarcity of research at this intersection. Key challenges include integrating diverse datasets, isolating cardiovascular effects amid multifaceted influences, ensuring data quality and quantity, and the issues to extrapolate machine learning models to day-to-day clinical practice. Nevertheless, leveraging AI for risk prediction in liver transplantation could significantly enhance patient management and resource optimization, indicating a shift towards more personalized and effective medical practices.

                Background Statistical process control (SPC) is utiled in manufacturing and service applications. It is used to monitor the behavior of the process, also to discover and solve the issues in internal systems. SPC allows immediate corrective actions to prevent defects and maintain process stability. There are two types of control charts are available in the literature: variable control charts and attribute control charts. Methods The use of attribute control charts for two positively skewed distributions such as power function distribution and weighted power function distribution is discussed in this research paper. We compared the behavior of both types of control charts and presented the results in form of tables. Results We conclude that control charts under a weighted power function distribution perform better than control charts using a power function distribution. Furthermore, these results will help in the early detection of errors that enhance the process reliability of the telecommunications and financing industries.

                Background Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Automatic positive airway pressure (APAP) at home might be an alternative choice to identify optimal treatment pressure for OSA patients requiring CPAP treatment. Data on the association of effective treatment pressure between laboratory polysomnography (in-lab PSG) and home APAP has been limited. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation of effective CPAP pressure between in-lab PSG and home APAP. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted. OSA participants aged 18 years or older who required CPAP therapy were included. Patients underwent in-lab PSG with manual CPAP titration to identify an effective treatment pressure. Patients also underwent APAP at home for 2 weeks to identify 95 percentile treatment pressure as an effective pressure. Results Fifty OSA patients (82% male) were included. Mean age was 48.9±14.6 years. Body mass index was 28.7±6.1 kg/m2. Polysomnographic data showed the effective treatment pressure of 10.4±2.9 cmH2O and the apnea-hypopnea index was 55.1±29.0 events/hour. Severe OSA was 76%. Home APAP data showed effective treatment pressure of 10.8±1.8 cmH2O. There was positive correlation of effective pressure between home APAP and in-lab PSG (r=0.472, P=0.001). The equation for predicting an in-lab effective pressure was: predicted pressure (cmH2O) = 2 + (home APAP ⁎ 0.78). Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between them, with a low mean difference of -0.428 cmH2O and 96% within the limit of agreement. Conclusions Home APAP pressure is moderately positively correlated with in-lab PSG effective pressure. The accuracy of home APAP is in agreement with in-lab PSG with manual CPAP titration. This APAP might be able to determine an effective therapeutic pressure in the sleep laboratory for OSA treatment.

                Background Sexual violence is prevalent in higher education institutions in Nigeria and stakeholders have encouraged staff and students to blow the whistle whenever they fall victim to or are aware of any sexual violence case. However, there is lack of data about whether the staff and students of these institutions have the intention to blow the whistle internally (within the institution) or not. There is also a lack of data on the existing reporting mechanisms or preferred whistleblowing mechanisms in these institutions. These have hindered the analysis of stakeholders’ opinions on this topic. Methods This data note presents a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative data set collected from staff and students of three categories of government owned higher education institutions (Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges of Education) in Nigeria. Data collection was between February and December, 2021, during which quantitative data were collected from 21,937 students and 3,108 staff. Qualitatively, 138 students and 111 staff participated in a total of 35 focus group discussion sessions. The study provides unique information on respondents’ attitude, self-efficacy, and subjective norm to sexual violence whistleblowing. It also provides information on self-reported sexual violence experiences, whistleblowing intention, reporting systems in higher institutions and the preferred sexual violence whistleblowing mechanisms. Conclusions In this data note, we provide a detailed account of the variables in the dataset and then highlight the potential of this study to contribute to improved sexual violence reporting in higher education institutions, thereby reducing the occurrence of the social menace.

                Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness characterized by psychosis, apathy, social withdrawal, and cognitive impairment, which results in impaired functioning in work, school, parenting, self-care, independent living, interpersonal relationships, and leisure time. Method A systematic search was conducted using Arksey and O’Malley’s framework with studies published on leisure-based intervention from January 1990 to December 2023. Results The review included 11 articles in the study. In total two studies were pilot interventional study, one randomized controlled study, one case-control, one retrospective study, three were cross sectional, one was cross sectional longitudinal study and two were qualitative in nature. Studies used different types of leisure activities like cooking group, discussions, board games, arts and craft, painting, beading, sewing, clay work, paper craft, etc were used as an intervention. Qualitative studies found that individuals with schizophrenia spent less time in social and leisure activities and more time relaxing and doing nothing. Conclusion The study highlights the need to conduct further research on leisure-based interventions using various study designs like randomized controlled trials and mixed methods to understand its effectiveness among individuals with schizophrenia.

                Background: Ludwig's angina is a potentially life-threatening disease characterized by diffuse bilateral cellulitis with an odontogenic origin. This unique infection is now rare owing to the antibiotic era. Case: This patient presented to the emergency room with trismus, jaw and neck swelling, mild respiratory distress with tachypnea, hyperthermia, and panic. Clinical examination and radiographic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of Ludwig's angina. As it is a quickly spreading infection, the patient was taken up for immediate surgical decompression leading to pus drainage, removal of the offending tooth, bacterial culture and sensitivity, and administration of empirical antibiotics. As we had operated promptly, there was no need for emergency airway intervention, and the patient had immediate relief from airway distress. Conclusions: Early accurate diagnosis with conservative surgical decompression, thereby negating the need for airway intervention, was vital to avoiding mortality which is always possible in such an expeditious infection.

                Background For more than 150 years, dental amalgam (DA) has been popular as a dental restorative material. Many organizations oppose its use due to perceived toxicity and environmental concerns. Hence, this study aimed to explore the continued use of DA from a South Indian dental practitioners’ perspective. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among fifty-two private and public dental practitioners of Udupi district in Southern India. A self‑administered questionnaire was distributed, that involved assessment of their preferences, continuation of use and concerns of using DA as a restorative material. The percentage contribution of each variable was calculated. Preferences for continuation of use of silver amalgam based upon the age, experience and mercury toxicity as a risk factor were analyzed using Students-t test and Fisher’s Exact Test test. Results Most dentists were satisfied (87%) with the results of the DA, found minimal failures (96%) and found DA more economical (89%). More than half (54%) of the participants reported that they would not continue the use of DA owing to mercury toxicity and environmental concerns. Dentists with higher age and longer clinical experience preferred continuation of DA. Conclusions Despite satisfaction with DA for its minimal failure, longevity and affordability, the authors found that most practitioners did not prefer its continued usage. This highlights their concerns over mercury toxicity and soft tissue lesions and accentuates their community social responsibility. There is also an urgent need to educate dentists on mercury hygiene, mercury waste management and disposal.

                Background Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the head and neck pose a challenge in their management due to their local aggressiveness and high recurrence risk. This study aimed to analyze literature on head and neck AVM recurrence post-treatment and identify the most effective strategy with a lower recurrence rate. Objectives To analyse existing literature on the recurrence of head and neck AVMs following treatment. Our goal was to identify the most effective treatment option with a lower recurrence rate. Methods We conducted a thorough literature search using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, from year 2000 to the present. Our analysis focused on key endpoints, specifically the recurrence rates of head and neck AVMs following various treatment approaches. Results Out of the initial pool of 108 screened articles, a total of 83 patients were deemed suitable for inclusion in the literature review. The reviewed articles demonstrated that appropriate diagnostic tests were documented in 95% of the included studies. Among the patients, 37.3% had previously undergone interventions and were currently dealing with regrowth masses. Notably, 56.6% of patients underwent a combined approach involving both endovascular and surgical methods, while 25.3% opted for a surgical-only approach, and only 18.1% pursued an endovascular-only approach. The studies showed a promising curing rate of AVMs, with a success rate of 94%, albeit with a complication rate of 32.5%. The average follow-up duration for all patients was 26 months, with a standard deviation of 20.5 months. Out of the 83 patients, 5 experienced recurrence, with single-modality approach. Interestingly, no patients who received a multi-modality of treatments experienced recurrence or regrowth of the AVM mass within the follow up period. Conclusion The multi-modality approach outperformed single-modality treatments in preventing AVM recurrence. These findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach in the management of these complex vascular anomalies.
