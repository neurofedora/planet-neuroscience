              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08254">Efficient, simulation-free estimators of firing rates with Markovian surrogates</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.08254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are powerful mathematical models that integrate the biological details of neural systems, but their complexity often makes them computationally expensive and analytically untractable. The firing rate of an SNN is a crucial first-order statistic to characterize network activity. However, estimating firing rates analytically from even simplified SNN models is challenging due to 1) the intricate dependence between the nonlinear network dynamics and parameters, and 2) the singularity and irreversibility of spikes. In this Letter, we propose a class of computationally efficient, simulation-free estimators of firing rates. This is based on a hierarchy of Markovian approximations that reduces the complexity of SNN dynamics. We show that while considering firing rates alone is insufficient for accurate estimations of themselves, the information of spiking synchrony dramatically improves the estimator's accuracy. This approach provides a practical tool for brain modelers, directly mapping biological parameters to firing rate.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08429">Visual Image Reconstruction from Brain Activity via Latent Representation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.08429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual image reconstruction, the decoding of perceptual content from brain activity into images, has advanced significantly with the integration of deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative models. This review traces the field's evolution from early classification approaches to sophisticated reconstructions that capture detailed, subjective visual experiences, emphasizing the roles of hierarchical latent representations, compositional strategies, and modular architectures. Despite notable progress, challenges remain, such as achieving true zero-shot generalization for unseen images and accurately modeling the complex, subjective aspects of perception. We discuss the need for diverse datasets, refined evaluation metrics aligned with human perceptual judgments, and compositional representations that strengthen model robustness and generalizability. Ethical issues, including privacy, consent, and potential misuse, are underscored as critical considerations for responsible development. Visual image reconstruction offers promising insights into neural coding and enables new psychological measurements of visual experiences, with applications spanning clinical diagnostics and brain-machine interfaces.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06686">Detection of Moving Objects Using Self-motion Constraints on Optic Flow</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.06686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As we move through the world, the pattern of light projected on our eyes is complex and dynamic, yet we are still able to distinguish between moving and stationary objects. We propose that humans accomplish this by exploiting constraints that self-motion imposes on retinal velocities. When an eye translates and rotates in a stationary 3D scene, the velocity at each retinal location is constrained to a line segment in the 2D space of retinal velocities. The slope and intercept of this segment is determined by the eye's translation and rotation, and the position along the segment is determined by the local scene depth. Since all possible velocities arising from a stationary scene must lie on this segment, velocities that are not must correspond to objects moving within the scene. We hypothesize that humans make use of these constraints by using deviations of local velocity from these constraint lines to detect moving objects. To test this, we used a virtual reality headset to present rich wide-field stimuli, simulating the visual experience of translating forward in several virtual environments with varied precision of depth information. Participants had to determine if a cued object moved relative to the scene. Consistent with the hypothesis, we found that performance depended on the deviation of the object velocity from the constraint segment, rather than a difference between retinal velocities of the object and its local surround. We also found that the endpoints of the constraint segment reflected the precision of depth information available in the different virtual environments.

                arXiv:2505.08514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an implementation of convolutional architecture in a spiking neural network (SNN) used to classify images. As in the traditional neural network, the convolutional layers form informational "features" used as predictors in the SNN-based classifier with CoLaNET architecture. Since weight sharing contradicts the synaptic plasticity locality principle, the convolutional weights are fixed in our approach. We describe a methodology for their determination from a representative set of images from the same domain as the classified ones. We illustrate and test our approach on a classification task from the NEOVISION2 benchmark.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07956">Symbolic Regression with Multimodal Large Language Models and Kolmogorov Arnold Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.07956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to symbolic regression using vision-capable large language models (LLMs) and the ideas behind Google DeepMind's Funsearch. The LLM is given a plot of a univariate function and tasked with proposing an ansatz for that function. The free parameters of the ansatz are fitted using standard numerical optimisers, and a collection of such ans\"atze make up the population of a genetic algorithm. Unlike other symbolic regression techniques, our method does not require the specification of a set of functions to be used in regression, but with appropriate prompt engineering, we can arbitrarily condition the generative step. By using Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), we demonstrate that ``univariate is all you need'' for symbolic regression, and extend this method to multivariate functions by learning the univariate function on each edge of a trained KAN. The combined expression is then simplified by further processing with a language model.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08778">ARC-NCA: Towards Developmental Solutions to the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.08778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), later renamed ARC-AGI, poses a fundamental challenge in artificial general intelligence (AGI), requiring solutions that exhibit robust abstraction and reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks, while only few (with median count of three) correct examples are presented. While ARC-AGI remains very challenging for artificial intelligence systems, it is rather easy for humans. This paper introduces ARC-NCA, a developmental approach leveraging standard Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and NCA enhanced with hidden memories (EngramNCA) to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark. NCAs are employed for their inherent ability to simulate complex dynamics and emergent patterns, mimicking developmental processes observed in biological systems. Developmental solutions may offer a promising avenue for enhancing AI's problem-solving capabilities beyond mere training data extrapolation. ARC-NCA demonstrates how integrating developmental principles into computational models can foster adaptive reasoning and abstraction. We show that our ARC-NCA proof-of-concept results may be comparable to, and sometimes surpass, that of ChatGPT 4.5, at a fraction of the cost.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04165">TS-SNN: Temporal Shift Module for Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.04165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly recognized for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, positioning them as strong alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in neuromorphic computing applications. SNNs inherently process temporal information by leveraging the precise timing of spikes, but balancing temporal feature utilization with low energy consumption remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce Temporal Shift module for Spiking Neural Networks (TS-SNN), which incorporates a novel Temporal Shift (TS) module to integrate past, present, and future spike features within a single timestep via a simple yet effective shift operation. A residual combination method prevents information loss by integrating shifted and original features. The TS module is lightweight, requiring only one additional learnable parameter, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing architectures with minimal additional computational cost. TS-SNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like CIFAR-10 (96.72\%), CIFAR-100 (80.28\%), and ImageNet (70.61\%) with fewer timesteps, while maintaining low energy consumption. This work marks a significant step forward in developing efficient and accurate SNN architectures.

Abstract: A general procedure for introducing parametric, learned, nonlinearity into activation functions is found to enhance the accuracy of representative neural networks without requiring significant additional computational resources. Examples are given based on the standard rectified linear unit (ReLU) as well as several other frequently employed activation functions. The associated accuracy improvement is quantified both in the context of the MNIST digit data set and a convolutional neural network (CNN) benchmark example.

                arXiv:2503.22742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Adaptive Integrated Layered Attention (AILA), a neural network architecture that combines dense skip connections with different mechanisms for adaptive feature reuse across network layers. We evaluate AILA on three challenging tasks: price forecasting for various commodities and indices (S&P 500, Gold, US dollar Futures, Coffee, Wheat), image recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset, and sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset. In all cases, AILA matches strong deep learning baselines (LSTMs, Transformers, and ResNets), achieving it at a fraction of the training and inference time. Notably, we implement and test two versions of the model - AILA-Architecture 1, which uses simple linear layers as the connection mechanism between layers, and AILA-Architecture 2, which implements an attention mechanism to selectively focus on outputs from previous layers. Both architectures are applied in a single-task learning setting, with each model trained separately for individual tasks. Results confirm that AILA's adaptive inter-layer connections yield robust gains by flexibly reusing pertinent features at multiple network depths. The AILA approach thus presents an extension to existing architectures, improving long-range sequence modeling, image recognition with optimised computational speed, and SOTA classification performance in practice.

">Opposing Modulation of EEG Aperiodic Component by Ketamine and Thiopental: Implications for the Noninvasive Assessment of Cortical E/I Balance in Humans</a></h4>

              
                The balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) activity is critical for brain function, and its disruption is implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Electrophysiological signals can be decomposed into periodic (oscillatory) and aperiodic components. In the power spectrum, the periodic component appears as narrowband peaks, while the aperiodic component underlies its characteristic 1/f power-law decay. Computational models predict that shifts in E/I balance alter the exponent in specific directions. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject study, healthy volunteers received subanesthetic doses of ketamine and thiopental during an EEG oddball task. These drugs have opposite effects on E/I balance but comparable sedative profiles. Ketamine reduced the PSD exponent, while thiopental increased it, consistent with computational predictions. Changes in the exponent were associated with subjective and cognitive effects. These findings suggest that the PSD exponent has potential as a noninvasive EEG biomarker sensitive to transient shifts in cortical E/I balance.

">Cerebral plasticity after hypoglosso-facial anastomosis in facial palsy: a magnetoencephalography study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hypoglosso-facial anastomosis (HFA) consists in suturing the proximal part of the hypoglossal nerve with the distal part of the facial nerve in patients with facial palsy. Axonal regrowth through the anastomosis makes it possible to restore facial motor skills, which become spontaneous after physiotherapy. This suggests cerebral plasticity. Objective: We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a pilot study to test this hypothesis. Methods: Twenty-one healthy volunteers (CTRL) and 12 patients after HFA performed 5 motor tasks with MEG and electromyographic recordings: eyelid closure, smile, tongue protraction, mastication and thumb flexion. For each task, we picked the location of the maximum source activity within the precentral gyrus. We calculated the distances between this location and the vertex for each task and a somatotopy index. Results: There was an interaction between the participant group and the task (F(4,124)=4.07, p=0.0039). In CTRL, the maximum source location was statistically different between smile and tongue tasks and between eyelid and tongue tasks (p<0.001). No such difference was observed in HFA (p=1.000). 90.5% of CTRL and 41.7% of HFA showed a normal somatotopy (p=0.0046). Conclusions: In CTRL, the organization of the cortical motor areas was similar to that of Penfield motor Homunculus. In contrast, in HFA, eyelid closure, tongue protraction and smile areas were not significantly distinct. This supports the hypothesis of cerebral plasticity after HFA. The Ethical Committee of Paris Idf VI approved the study (CPP Ouest 6-CPP975-HPS2

                Background Our understanding of the human immune system’s response to viral respiratory tract infections (VRTIs) and vaccines, including the molecular mechanisms and correlates of protection, remains incomplete. Extensive transcriptomic data from inoculation and vaccination studies have been deposited in publicly available databases. However, these studies are often separate and difficult to locate. Methods To bridge this research gap, we have systematically searched and reviewed publicly available datasets from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Archive of Functional Genomics Data (ArrayExpress), Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort), and Google using targeted queries. Inoculation study queries included terms related to humans, blood, PBMCs, nasal, respiratory challenges, and respiratory viral inoculations; while vaccination study queries focused on humans, blood, PBMCs, transcriptomes, and respiratory viral vaccines or vaccinations. Results This collection includes 18 datasets from inoculation of 5 respiratory viruses: H1N1, H3N2, RSV, HRV, and SARS-CoV-2 (14 from blood and 4 from nasal swabs) with 429 participants (ages 18 to 55 years) and 37 datasets from vaccination of influenza and COVID-19 with 2,084 participants (ages 0.5 to over 89 years). The duration and number of post-immunization time points range from 14 days before to 28 days after inoculation (1 to 20 time points) and from 28 days before to 360 days after vaccination (1 to 13 time points). Conclusion We provide a curated compendium of public gene expression data repositories for researchers to reanalyze transcriptomes from human whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and nasal swab samples. This will facilitate studies of transcriptional responses to respiratory viral inoculation or vaccination.

                Background Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorders. While there is a clear link between IBDs and other immune-mediated inflammatory disorders (IMIDs), research into this relationship is limited, particularly in the Middle East. This study sought to determine the predictive factors and prevalence of IMIDs in IBDs patients at King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Saudi Arabia. Methods A single-center retrospective investigation was carried out on adult patients with confirmed IBDs. Between 2017 and 2022, the study was conducted at King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Eligible patients over the age of 18 with verified IBDs diagnosis were found through the hospital's IBDs registry. Data on demographics, type of IBDs, disease duration, medications, extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs), and laboratory investigations were collected. The prevalence of IMIDs was examined, and multiple logistic regression analysis was done to discover predictors. Results A total of 172 patients were randomly selected, with a mean age of 37.33 years; 55.8% were women. Among them, 50.6% had IMIDs. Of the patients with IBDs, 57% had CD and 43% had UC. Patients with IMIDs had a shorter IBDs duration (10.06 years) compared to those without IMIDs (12.23 years, p < 0.05). Male sex was a positive predictor for IMIDs (Odds Ratio [OR]: 2.57), while erythema nodosum (OR: 4.75) and pyoderma gangrenosum (OR: 7.44) were protective. Conclusion The study revealed a significant prevalence of IMIDs among patients with IBDs, highlighting the need to recognize predictors for improved clinical management.

                <p>by Zeyuan Ye, Haoran Li, Liang Tian, Changsong Zhou</p>

Accurate retrieval of the maintained information is crucial for working memory. This process primarily occurs during post-delay epochs, when subjects receive cues and generate responses. However, the computational and neural mechanisms that underlie these post-delay epochs to support robust memory remain poorly understood. To address this, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on a color delayed-response task, where certain colors (referred to as common colors) were more frequently presented for memorization. We found that the trained RNNs reduced memory errors for common colors by decoding a broader range of neural states into these colors through the post-delay epochs. This decoding process was driven by convergent neural dynamics and a non-dynamic, biased readout process during the post-delay epochs. Our findings highlight the importance of post-delay epochs in working memory and suggest that neural systems adapt to environmental statistics by using multiple mechanisms across task epochs.

                <p>by Zahra Vahdat, Oliver Gambrell, Jonas Fisch, Eckhard Friauf, Abhyudai Singh</p>

Quantal parameters of synapses are fundamental for the temporal dynamics of neurotransmitter release, which is the basis of interneuronal communication. We formulate a general class of models that capture the stochastic dynamics of quantal content (QC), defined as the number of SV fusion events triggered by a single action potential (AP). Considering the probabilistic and time-varying nature of SV docking, undocking, and AP-triggered fusion, we derive an <i>exact</i> statistical distribution for the QC over time. Analyzing this distribution at steady-state and its associated autocorrelation function, we show that QC fluctuation statistics can be leveraged for inferring key presynaptic parameters, such as the probability of SV fusion (release probability) and SV replenishment at empty docking sites (refilling probability). Our model predictions are tested with electrophysiological data obtained from 50-Hz stimulation of auditory MNTB-LSO synapses in brainstem slices from juvenile mice. Our results show that while synaptic depression can be explained by low and constant refilling/release probabilities, this scenario is inconsistent with the statistics of the electrophysiological data, which show a low QC Fano factor and almost uncorrelated successive QCs. Our systematic analysis yields a model that couples a high release probability to a time-varying refilling probability to explain both the synaptic depression and its associated statistical fluctuations. In summary, we provide a general approach that exploits stochastic signatures in QCs to infer neurotransmission regulating processes that cannot be distinguished from simple analysis of averaged synaptic responses.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012513">Identifying the DNA methylation preference of transcription factors using ProtBERT and SVM</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yanchao Li, Quan Zou, Qi Dai, Antony Stalin, Ximei Luo</p>

Transcription factors (TFs) can affect gene expression by binding to certain specific DNA sequences. This binding process of TFs may be modulated by DNA methylation. A subset of TFs that serve as methylation readers preferentially binds to certain methylated DNA and is defined as TFPM. The identification of TFPMs enhances our understanding of DNA methylation’s role in gene regulation. However, their experimental identification is resource-demanding. In this study, we propose a novel two-step computational approach to classify TFs and TFPMs. First, we employed a fine-tuned ProtBERT model to differentiate between the classes of TFs and non-TFs. Second, we combined the Reduced Amino Acid Category (RAAC) with K-mer and SVM to predict the potential of TFs to bind to methylated DNA. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform all existing approaches and emphasize the eï¬€iciency of our computational framework in classifying TFs and TFPMs. Cross-species validation on an independent mouse dataset further demonstrates the generalizability of our proposed framework In addition, we conducted predictions on all human transcription factors and found that most of the top 20 proteins belong to the Krueppel C2H2-type Zinc-finger family. So far, some studies have demonstrated a partial correlation between this family and DNA methylation and confirmed the preference of some of its members, thereby showing the robustness of our approach.

Gene promoters are intrinsically hardwired not only to facilitate transcription preinitiation complex formation but also the release of paused RNA polymerase by H2A.Z. A new PLOS Biology study reveals poly (dA) tracts at promoters positively stimulate H2A.Z incorporation by the SWR complex in yeast.

Gene promoter regions are intrinsically hardwired not only to facilitate transcription preinitiation complex formation, but also the release of paused RNA polymerase by H2A.Z.  Ed Luk and colleagues reveal poly (dA) tracks at promoters positively stimulates the incorporation of H2A.Z by the SWR complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

                Sue et al. show that ER stress impairs insulin secretion by misplacement of permissive proteins from the plasma membrane. This results from defects in the retromer and the constitutive secretory pathway. Thus, in type 2 diabetes, ER stress mediates β cell dysfunction, not just loss of β cell mass.

                Ramar et al. demonstrate that gut microbiome transplantation confers asthma predisposition elicited by maternal intra-airway exposure to environmental particles. Radiation sterilization or antibacterials ablated the effect, suggesting that viable bacteria are required. Transplant recipients show DNA methylation alterations in dendritic cells, potentially explaining how microbiome-host crosstalk leads to asthma onset.

                While studies show that hippocampal dorsal CA2 influences social memory and aggression, the characteristics of ventral CA2 are unknown. Boyle et al. show that a molecularly, anatomically, and electrophysiologically defined CA2 extends along the hippocampal septotemporal axis, with similarities and important differences in projection patterns, synaptic actions, and behavioral role.

                Shimizu et al. developed human iPSC-derived hepatic organoids (iHOs), which consist of hepatocyte-like cells but not ductal cells. Bile acid-FXR signaling enhances the hepatic characteristics and proliferation of the iHOs. These iHOs, previously difficult to maintain, now sustain distinctive hepatocyte-like characteristics over the long term, promoting valuable future applications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99474">Maternal behavior influences vocal practice and learning processes in the greater sac-winged bat</a></h4>

              
                Learning, particularly vocal learning, is often a social process. In human infants, it is well-established that social interactions influence speech acquisition and are hypothesized to modulate attentiveness and sensory processes, thereby affecting the speech-learning process. However, our understanding of how social interactions shape vocal ontogenetic processes in non-human mammals, particularly those which vocally learn, remains limited. In the bat <i>Saccopteryx bilineata</i>, pups acquire the adult vocal repertoire through a distinctive babbling behavior that shows interesting similarities to human infant babbling. While babbling encompasses many different syllable types, it is particularly noteworthy that pups learn song syllables by imitating adult singing males. The pups' social environment involves frequent interactions with their mothers, whereas adult males mainly serve as the primary source of acoustic input. We monitored the vocal ontogeny of wild pups, investigating whether their social environment influenced three aspects of babbling: the amount of vocal practice, the pups’ final syllable repertoire size and the production of the syllable types acquired through vocal learning. The results demonstrate that maternal behavioral displays significantly influence the amount of vocal practice, the presence and versatility of song syllable types in babbling and the percentage of mature song syllables. Our findings show that maternal feedback plays a significant role in the vocal ontogeny and learning processes of <i>S. bilineata</i>, thus enhancing our understanding of the relationship between social feedback and vocal development in mammalian vocal learners.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98622">PIM kinase control of CD8 T cell protein synthesis and cell trafficking</a></h4>

              
                Integration of kinase signalling networks co-ordinates the transcriptional, translational, and metabolic changes required for T cell activation and differentiation. This study explores the role of the Serine/Threonine kinases PIM1 and PIM2 in controlling mouse CD8 T lymphocyte antigen receptor-mediated activation and differentiation in response to the cytokines Interleukin-2 (IL-2) or IL-15. We show that the PIM kinases are dispensable for antigen-receptor and IL-15 controlled differentiation programs, but that they play a selective role in IL-2 regulated CD8 T cell fate. One key insight was that PIM kinases controlled the migratory capabilities of effector CD8 T cells, with <i>Pim1</i>/<i>Pim2</i>-deficient CD8 T cells unable to fully switch off the naive T cell chemokine and adhesion receptor program during effector differentiation. PIM kinases were also needed for IL-2 to sustain high expression of the glucose transporters SLC2A1 and SLC2A3 and to maintain activity of the nutrient-sensing kinase mTORc1. Strikingly, PIM kinases did not have a dominant impact on IL-2-driven transcriptional programs but rather selectively modulated protein synthesis to shape cytotoxic T cell proteomes. This study reveals a selective role of PIM kinases in IL-2 control of CD8 T cells and highlights how regulated changes in protein synthesis can impact T cell phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101369">Transcriptional pattern enriched for synaptic signaling is associated with shorter survival of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer</a></h4>

              
                Bulk transcriptomic analyses of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) so far have not uncovered potential drug targets, possibly because subtle, disease-relevant transcriptional patterns are overshadowed by dominant, non-relevant ones. Our aim was to uncover disease-outcome-related patterns in HGSOC transcriptomes that may reveal novel drug targets. Using consensus-independent component analysis, we dissected 678 HGSOC transcriptomes of systemic therapy naïve patients—sourced from public repositories—into statistically independent transcriptional components (TCs). To enhance c-ICA’s robustness, we added 447 transcriptomes from non-serous histotypes, low-grade serous, and non-cancerous ovarian tissues. Cox regression and survival tree analysis were performed to determine the association between TC activity and overall survival (OS). Finally, we determined the activity of the OS-associated TCs in 11 publicly available spatially resolved ovarian cancer transcriptomes. We identified 374 TCs, capturing prominent and subtle transcriptional patterns linked to specific biological processes. Six TCs, age, and tumor stage stratified patients with HGSOC receiving platinum-based chemotherapy into ten distinct OS groups. Three TCs were linked to copy-number alterations affecting expression levels of genes involved in replication, apoptosis, proliferation, immune activity, and replication stress. Notably, the TC identifying patients with the shortest OS captured a novel transcriptional pattern linked to synaptic signaling, which was active in tumor regions within all spatially resolved transcriptomes. The association between a synaptic signaling-related TC and OS supports the emerging role of neurons and their axons as cancer hallmark-inducing constituents of the tumor microenvironment. These constituents might offer a novel drug target for patients with HGSOC.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90327">Dual-color optical activation and suppression of neurons with high temporal precision</a></h4>

              
                A well-known phenomenon in the optogenetic toolbox is that all light-gated ion channels, including red-shifted channelrhodopsins (ChRs), are activated by blue light, whereas blue-shifted ChRs are minimally responsive to longer wavelengths. Here, we took advantage of this feature to create a system which allows high-frequency activation of neurons with pulses of red light, while permitting the suppression of action potentials (APs) with millisecond precision by blue light. We achieved this by pairing an ultrafast red-shifted ChR with a blue light-sensitive anion channel of appropriately matching kinetics. This required screening several anion-selective ChRs, followed by a model-based mutagenesis strategy to optimize their kinetics and light spectra. Slice electrophysiology in the hippocampus as well as behavioral inspection of vibrissa movement demonstrate a minimal excitation from blue light. Of significant potential value, in contrast to existing tools, the system we introduce here allows high-frequency optogenetic excitation of neurons with red light, while blue light suppression of APs is confined within the duration of the light pulse.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96217">Convolutional networks can model the functional modulation of the MEG responses associated with feed-forward processes during visual word recognition</a></h4>

              
                Traditional models of reading lack a realistic simulation of the early visual processing stages, taking input in the form of letter banks and predefined line segments, making them unsuitable for modeling early brain responses. We used variations of the VGG-11 convolutional neural network (CNN) to create models of visual word recognition that starts from the pixel-level and performs the macro-scale computations needed for the detection and segmentation of letter shapes to word-form identification of large vocabulary of 10k Finnish words, regardless of letter size, shape, or rotation. The models were evaluated based on an existing magnetoencephalography (MEG) study where participants viewed regular words, pseudowords, noise-embedded words, symbol strings, and consonant strings. The original images used in the study were presented to the models and the activity in the layers was compared to MEG evoked response amplitudes. Through a few alterations to make the network more biologically plausible, we found an CNN architecture that can correctly simulate the behavior of three prominent responses, namely the type I (early visual response), type II (the ‘letter string’ response), and the N400m. In conclusion, starting a model of reading with convolution-and-pooling steps enables the flexibility and realism crucial for a direct model-to-brain comparison.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/79517">Observation of persister cell histories reveals diverse modes of survival in antibiotic persistence</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial persistence is a phenomenon in which a small fraction of isogenic bacterial cells survives a lethal dose of antibiotics. Although the refractoriness of persistent cell populations has classically been attributed to growth-inactive cells generated before drug exposure, evidence is accumulating that actively growing cell fractions can also generate persister cells. However, single-cell characterization of persister cell history remains limited due to the extremely low frequencies of persisters. Here, we visualize the responses of over one million individual cells of wildtype <i>Escherichia coli</i> to lethal doses of antibiotics, sampling cells from different growth phases and culture media into a microfluidic device. We show that when cells sampled from exponentially growing populations were treated with ampicillin or ciprofloxacin, most persisters were growing before antibiotic treatment. Growing persisters exhibited heterogeneous survival dynamics, including continuous growth and fission with L-form-like morphologies, responsive growth arrest, or post-exposure filamentation. Incubating cells under stationary phase conditions increased both the frequency and the probability of survival of non-growing cells to ampicillin. Under ciprofloxacin, however, all persisters identified were growing before the antibiotic treatment, including samples from post-stationary phase culture. These results reveal diverse persister cell dynamics that depend on antibiotic types and pre-exposure history.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98563">Role of posterior medial thalamus in the modulation of striatal circuitry and choice behavior</a></h4>

              
                The posterior medial (POm) thalamus is heavily interconnected with sensory and motor circuitry and is likely involved in behavioral modulation and sensorimotor integration. POm provides axonal projections to the dorsal striatum, a hotspot of sensorimotor processing, yet the role of POm-striatal projections has remained undetermined. Using optogenetics with mouse brain slice electrophysiology, we found that POm provides robust synaptic input to direct and indirect pathway striatal spiny projection neurons (D1- and D2-SPNs, respectively) and parvalbumin-expressing fast spiking interneurons (PVs). During the performance of a whisker-based tactile discrimination task in head-restrained mice, POm-striatal projections displayed learning-related activation correlating with anticipatory, but not reward-related, pupil dilation. Inhibition of POm-striatal axons across learning caused slower reaction times and an increase in the number of training sessions for expert performance. Our data indicate that POm-striatal inputs provide a behaviorally relevant arousal-related signal, which may prime striatal circuitry for efficient integration of subsequent choice-related inputs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102277">SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 is regulated by host E3 ubiquitin ligases, UBR5 and MARCHF7</a></h4>

              
                Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains a global public health threat with considerable economic consequences. The nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16), in complex with nsp10, facilitates the final viral mRNA capping step through its 2′-<i>O</i>-methylase activity, helping the virus to evade host immunity and prevent mRNA degradation. However, nsp16 regulation by host factors remains poorly understood. While various E3 ubiquitin ligases interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, their roles in targeting nsp16 for degradation remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that nsp16 undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation mediated by the host E3 ligases UBR5 and MARCHF7. UBR5 induces K48-linked ubiquitination, whereas MARCHF7 promotes K27-linked ubiquitination, independently suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell cultures and in mice. Notably, UBR5 and MARCHF7 also degrade nsp16 variants from different viral strains, exhibiting broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Our findings reveal novel antiviral mechanisms of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and highlight their potential therapeutic targets against COVID-19.

">Spontaneous spiking statistics form unique area-specific fingerprints and reflect the hierarchy of cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortex, from sensory to higher cognitive areas, is hierarchically organised Several dynamical and anatomical measures, such as timescales and neurotransmitter receptor expression, have independently been linked to the cortical hierarchy. However, a systematic quantitative link between anatomical markers of the cortical hierarchy and single-neuron dynamics has not yet been established. Here, we hypothesise that the single-neuron spontaneous spiking statistics uniquely characterise each cortical area, and that they quantitatively correlate with the cortical hierarchy. We consider the spontaneous activity of neurons in seven cortical areas (V1, V4, DP, 7A, M1, PMd, PFC) in macaques in the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. First, we show that the firing rate, inter-spike interval variation, and cross-correlation form a unique fingerprint of the cortical areas, but only when considering them in combination. Second, we find that the differences between the spiking statistics strongly correlate with multiple anatomical markers of the cortical hierarchy, especially in the eyes-closed condition. We also observe a correlation between autocorrelation timescales and the anatomical hierarchy, consistent with previous findings. In conclusion, we demonstrate that spontaneous single-neuron spiking activity reflects the hierarchical organisation of the cerebral cortex: distinct spiking statistics for hierarchically distant areas; similar statistics for nearby areas. Our results thus add a new dynamical dimension to the concept of the cortical hierarchy.

">Diverse activity in prefrontal projections promotes temporal control of action</a></h4>

              
                Prefrontal neurons can have diverse activity during cognitive functions like working memory, attention, and timing; however, the importance of this heterogeneity is unclear. Our goal was to better understand the diversity of prefrontal activity through connectivity. We harnessed circuit-specific tools to capture activity within prefrontal projections during interval timing, an elementary cognitive process that requires working memory for temporal rules and attention to the passage of time to estimate a temporal interval of several seconds. We used human electroencephalography and single neuronal recordings in mice to capture prefrontal activity during interval timing, with major patterns characterized by time-dependent ramping (monotonic changes) over a temporal interval. We then leveraged retrograde viruses to interrogate prefrontal cortex (PFC) projections to the mediodorsal thalamus (PFC-MD) and to the dorsomedial striatum (PFC-DMS). We report three novel results. First, circuit-specific calcium fiber photometry revealed that PFC-MD and PFC-DMS activity encoded distinct temporal signals, with PFC-MD projections ramping down and PFC-DMS ramping up to interval timing response times. Second, circuit-specific inactivation revealed that PFC-DMS inactivation disrupted animals internal estimates of time. Third, circuit-specific single-nucleus RNA sequencing of prefrontal projections revealed distinct transcriptomic profiles between PFC-MD and PFC-DMS projections, with enriched genes for cortical layers and neuromodulators, and specific genes such as Cux2, Camk2n1, Htr4, and Foxp2. These data suggest differences in gene expression and connectivity give rise to the diversity of prefrontal activity during interval timing. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of prefrontal function and dysfunction in human disease.

">Alpha power indexes working memory load for durations</a></h4>

              
                Timing, that is estimating, comparing, or remembering how long events last, requires the temporary storage of durations. How durations are stored in working memory is unknown, despite the widely held view of memory systems' central role in timing. Here, we investigated the neural signatures of a sequence of durations (n-item sequence) held in working memory. We recorded human participants using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while they performed an n-item delayed reproduction task, which required to encode a sequence of durations, maintain it, and then reproduce it. The number of items in a sequence (one or three) and the duration of the sequence were orthogonalized. Our results show that during working memory maintenance, the number of durations, not the duration of the sequence, affected recall precision and could be decoded from alpha and beta oscillatory activity. Parieto-occipital alpha power showed a direct link with the precision of temporal reproduction. Our results extend earlier behavioral findings suggesting that durations are itemized in working memory and that their number, not their duration, modulates recall precision (Herbst et al., 2025). Crucially, we establish that alpha power reflects a universal signature of working memory load and mediates recall precision, even for abstract information such as duration.

">Structured experience shapes strategy learning and neural dynamics in the medial entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Animals can solve new, complex tasks by reusing and adapting what they've learned before. This kind of flexibility depends not just on having prior experience, but on how that experience was structured in the first place. The design of early training curriculum is especially important: poorly structured experiences can hinder abstraction and limit generalization, while carefully structured training promotes more flexible and adaptive behavior. Yet, the neural mechanisms supporting this process remain unclear. To investigate how early training shapes learning we first trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on variants of an odor-timing task previously used to study complex timing behavior in mice. We then tested the RNN predictions on how previous experience affects generalization using behavioral and electrophysiological recordings in mice trained on the same task using staged training sequences. RNNs and mice trained without well-structured early experience developed rigid strategies and made repeated errors. In contrast, those given more balanced early training were better able to generalize and showed similar neural activity patterns that reflected the task's underlying temporal structure. Using dynamical systems approaches, we reveal a mechanism for this effect: networks trained with appropriately structured curricula developed distinct dynamical motifs that support the correct abstractions when complexity was increased. Networks that lacked early training or received remedial curricula developed single fixed-point solutions that failed to generalize beyond the training stimuli. Together, these findings demonstrate that it is not just the presence of prior experience, but its structure, that governs how flexible and generalizable knowledge emerges in both biological systems and computational models.

">Neuropeptidergic transmission shapes emergent properties of prefrontal cortical circuits underlying learning</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is essential for top-down control of affect and its dysfunction is implicated in many psychiatric disorders. Inhibitory interneurons expressing somatostatin have been implicated in cognition, affect, and disease. However, somatostatin's function as a neuropeptide transmitter remains unclear. Here, we investigated the contribution of somatostatin neurotransmission in differentiating between salient (rewarding or aversive) and neutral outcomes. Monitoring somatostatin release and somatostatin receptor antagonism revealed time-dependent regulation of outcome-specific associative learning during acquisition. We found that somatostatin transmission enables configural representations incorporating a salient, aversive outcome in prefrontal cortical neurons, and a threat-driven shift in population-level network activity in-vivo. These findings show a novel role for somatostatin, an interneuron 'cellular marker', signaling in shaping learning and emergent network dynamics. Further this framework revealed that reduced somatostatin neuropeptidergic transmission may impair top-down control of affective behaviors observed in mental health disorders, suggesting potential new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

">Acetaminophen attenuates pathological pain through a mechanism that requires CB1 cannabinoid receptors and the enzyme diacylglycerol lipase in mice</a></h4>

              
                Acetaminophen (APAP) is commonly used as a pain and fever reliever, but its mechanisms remain unclear. Conflicting evidence implicates the endocannabinoid system in the effects of APAP. We tested the hypothesis that the analgesic effects of APAP were dependent upon both CB1 cannabinoid receptors and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL), an enzyme which catalyzes formation of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol. We examined the impact of APAP, administered in the presence and absence of DAGL inhibitors, on mechanical hypersensitivity in mice using models of inflammatory (induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA)) and post-surgical (induced by incisional injury) pain. Pharmacological specificity was assessed using global (Rimonabant, AM251) and peripherally restricted (AM6545) CB1 antagonists. APAP produced a dose-dependent attenuation of inflammation-induced mechanical hypersensitivity, but did not alter peripheral edema in the CFA-injected paw. APAP also attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity in mice with incisional injury. The DAGL inhibitors, RHC-80267 or DO34, attenuated the anti-allodynic effects of APAP in both models of pain. CB1 receptor antagonists (Rimonabant and/or AM251) suppressed the antinociceptive effect of APAP in both pain models. The peripherally-restricted CB1 antagonist AM6545 did not alter the anti-allodynic effects of APAP. We also assessed the impact of APAP on tail-flick antinociception, locomotor behavior, and body temperature. APAP produced hypothermia and hypolocomotion at the highest dose, but these effects were not blocked by RHC-80267 or AM251. APAP did not produce tail flick antinociception. Our studies demonstrate that the analgesic effects of APAP observed in mouse models of pathological pain require both DAGL and CB1 activation. Our findings support a potential mechanism of APAP-induced analgesic action involving the enzyme DAGL and CB1 receptors.

">Social Exclusion Amplifies Behavioral Responses to Physical Pain via Insular Neuromodulation</a></h4>

              
                The Pain Overlap Theory proposes that the experience of social pain overlaps with and amplifies the experience of physical pain by sharing parts of the same underlying process- ing systems. In humans, the insular cortex has been implicated in this overlap of physical and social pain, but a mechanistic link has not been made. To determine whether social pain can subsequently impact responses to nociceptive stimuli via convergent electrical signals (spikes) or convergent chemical signals (neuromodulators), we designed a novel Social Exclusion paradigm termed the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) Task which facilitates a mechanistic investigation in mice. We found that socially-excluded mice display more severe responses to physical pain, disrupted valence encoding, and impaired neural representations of nociceptive stimuli. We performed a systematic biosensor panel and found that endocannabinoid and oxytocin signaling in the insular cortex have opposing responses during trials where mice were attending or not attending to the Social Exclusion events respectively, demonstrating distinct neuromodulatory substrates that underpin different states of Social Exclusion. We also found that intra-insular blockade of oxytocin signaling increased the response to physical pain following Social Exclusion. Together these findings suggest Social Exclusion effectively alters physical pain perception using neuromodulatory signaling in the insular cortex.

">A Novel Framework for Quantitative Analysis of Neuronal Primary Cilia in Brain Tissue</a></h4>

              
                Background: Accurate analysis of neuronal primary cilia is essential for understanding developmental processing of neurons. But existing image segmentation methods struggle with staining variability and background noise. To address this, we developed a more robust segmentation and statistical analysis pipeline using an animal model small sample size and with known neuronal microstructure alterations. Methods: Maternal obesity was induced in mice via a high-fat/high-sucrose diet. Hippocampal tissue from 6-month-old offspring of obese and control dams was analyzed. We developed a MATLAB-based pipeline to segment neuronal cilia from z-stack images, applying mathematical transformations and using the Weibull distribution and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to assess group differences Results: The technique segmented cilia despite artifacts, revealing group-specific patterns. Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences, highlighting the method's robustness over traditional tests, especially with small samples. Conclusion: Our method reliably segments neuronal primary cilia in immune-stained sections with thionin-counter staining and offers a sensitive, assumption-free alternative to traditional statistical tests, ideal for small-sample neurobiological studies.

">The role of effort in adaptation to split-belt locomotion</a></h4>

              
                In many motor learning tasks, the process of error reduction is mirrored in a process of effort reduction, where metabolic cost and or muscle co-contraction decrease gradually in tandem with error. Effort reduction may be incidental to the learning process, but high error movements can be more effortful and a drive to minimize effort costs could also play a role in motor learning. In this study, we focused on the effort requirements of the task, asking whether task (background) effort cost affects learning, aftereffects, or relearning in a split-belt walking task. We hypothesized that greater effort costs would amplify the need to reduce effort and accelerate learning. Alternatively, we hypothesized that greater effort requirement could compromise and slow the learning process. Participants in high, low, and control effort groups completed a split-belt walking task while wearing a weighted vest with 15% body mass, 5% body mass, or the vest only, and we assessed step length asymmetry throughout the protocol. Step length asymmetry changed similarly between groups, with similar rates and extent of learning and relearning and similar patterns of aftereffects when the split-belt perturbation was removed. We found no significant effect of task effort on the process of split-belt adaptation, suggesting that the brain s response to gait asymmetry and ability to adapt to novel dynamics is relatively unchanged by background effort requirements of the task.

">The contribution of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system to the coupling between pupil-linked arousal and cortical state</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how pupil-linked arousal couples with cortical state is crucial for uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying brain state-dependent cognitive and sensory processing. Pupil size fluctuations reflect rapid changes of the pupil-linked arousal system, indexing brain states as well as the activity of neuromodulatory systems, including the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system. We investigated the relationship among phasic pupil dilation, cortical state, and neuromodulation by combining optogenetic LC stimulation with EEG recordings and pupillometry in awake mice. A comparison between EEG signals during spontaneous phasic pupil dilation and those during phasic pupil dilation evoked by LC stimulation revealed distinct EEG power spectrums, with LC activation driving strong modulation in the alpha and beta bands. Using machine learning techniques, we trained a convolutional neural network classifier to distinguish between types of pupil dilation based on the power dynamics of individual EEG frequency bands. The results confirmed that EEG features in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands differ markedly between spontaneous phasic arousal and LC stimulation-evoked arousal. Moreover, pharmacological manipulations to either block  or {beta} adrenergic receptors or agonize -2 adrenergic receptors were employed to explore how adrenergic receptors could influence the coupling between phasic pupil dilation and cortical state. With each manipulation uniquely modulating EEG power and pupil size, our results highlight the differentiated role of adrenergic receptors in the maintenance of coupling between pupil-linked arousal and cortical state. This study provides new insights into the complex relationship between pupil-linked arousal and cortical arousal state, underscoring the significant role of the LC-NE system in influencing these arousal states.

">Thermal cycling stimulation via nasal inhalation attenuates Aβ25-35-induced cognitive deficits in C57BL/6 mice</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to pose a significant public health challenge, with current treatments demonstrating limited effectiveness, partly due to the difficulty of delivering therapeutics across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The nose-to-brain (N-2-B) pathway offers a promising alternative, enabling pharmacological agents to circumvent the BBB. However, to date, no drugs have been successfully implemented in clinical settings for the treatment of AD via this route, underscoring the necessity for additional research in this area. Mild stress is thought to activate intrinsic protective mechanisms against neurodegeneration, but traditional methods of inducing stress often lack both specificity and practicality. To address this, we propose inhaling mildly heated air as thermal stimulation, leveraging the N-2-B pathway to elicit mild stress and stimulate the brain. Furthermore, this study employs our thermal cycling hyperthermia (TC-HT) concept, adapted as thermal cycling stimulation via nasal inhalation (TCSNI), which delivers cyclic stimulation to sustain pathway activity while minimizing thermal damage. In this study, we evaluated the health and olfactory effects of TCSNI in C57BL/6 mice, observing no adverse impact. In experimental groups administered with {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}), TCSNI treatment resulted in significant enhancements in cognitive performance as evidenced by Y-Maze and novel object recognition (NOR) assessments, suggesting an improvement in cognitive function. Protein analyses conducted on the hippocampus of the mice indicated a reduction in A{beta} accumulation, alongside increased expression of heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) expression, as well as elevated levels of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt). These results suggest that N-2-B-delivered TCSNI effectively modulates protein expression and enhances cognitive function, highlighting its potential for further exploration in AD treatment.

">A protective role of REM sleep in the pathological basal ganglia-cortical circuit of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Sleep disturbance is involved in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, but the neurophysiological mechanisms remain unclear in humans. We recorded sleep at home using portable polysomnography for multiple nights in patients with Parkinson's disease implanted with sensing DBS, capturing intracranial neural signals from both the basal ganglia and motor cortex. We found that longer duration and shorter latency of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep predicted reduced next-morning neural signatures known to be pathological, including resting beta oscillations and hyper-neural connectivity between basal ganglia and motor cortex. Moreover, within REM sleep, stronger cortical delta activity particularly predicted reduced pathological neural signatures. Computational modeling of the evoked potential response in the basal-cortical circuit revealed that REM delta activity was associated with not only the amplitude of the evoked response, but also its natural oscillatory and decaying properties, suggesting REM sleep-mediated neural plasticity. The anti-relationship between delta activity and morning pathological neural signals was found to be primarily driven by the amplitude of delta waves, and less by their occurrence rate. In addition, as the REM sleep percentage and REM delta power increased in later hours during sleep, their protective effects also increased. Overall, our findings highlight the potential protective roles of REM sleep and its associated slow-wave activity in the neurophysiological health of Parkinson's disease.

">Neuropeptide signalling and perineurial barrier generate a persistent stress-induced internal state in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Although fear conditioning has elucidated cue-evoked acute fear responses, the mechanisms by which stress experiences induce generalized internal states linked to anxiety are poorly understood. Here, we report that robust stress induces a persistent behavioral change characterized by avoidance of a confined space, claustrophobia-like behavior in Drosophila. Unlike aversive memory formation, the development of claustrophobia-like behavior does not require dopamine receptors. Our neuronal screening determined that neuropeptide signalling via Allatostatin-A inactivates the downstream neurons via its receptor AstA-R1, causally inducing claustrophobia-like behavior. Moreover, gene expression profiling of individual fly heads revealed that immune response activation in perineurial barrier is involved in claustrophobia-like behavior. Our data demonstrate that stress-induced persistent behavioral change would not be related to a canonical mechanism of aversive memory formation, rather involves neuropeptidergic signalling and perineurial barrier, providing the mechanism determining internal states which persistently change behavioral modes.

">Changes in slow oscillations and sleep spindles by auditory stimulation positively correlate with memory consolidation in children with epilepsy and controls</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sleep-dependent memory consolidation is supported by sleep spindles during stages 2 and 3 non-rapid eye movement sleep. Sleep spindles and sleep-dependent memory consolidation are both decreased in Rolandic epilepsy (RE). Non-invasive auditory stimulation evokes SOs and SO-spindle complexes in healthy adults but the impact on memory consolidation has been inconsistent. Objective: We investigated the effects of auditory stimulation during sleep on SOs, SO-spindle complexes, and sleep-dependent memory consolidation in children with RE and controls. Methods: A prospective cross-over study was conducted in children with RE and control. Children completed two nap visits with auditory or sham stimulation. SOs and SO-spindle complexes rates were measured offline using validated detectors. Sleep-dependent memory consolidation was assessed using the motor sequence typing task. Results: Auditory stimulation evoked SOs and SO-spindle complexes broadly with maximal effect over frontal electrodes. Compared to sham, stimulation delivered during background activity evoked SOs (29.8% increase, p<0.001) and SO-spindle complexes (16.8% increase, p<0.001) and stimulations delivered near the peak of an ongoing SO upstate maximally evoked SOs (51.3% increase, p<0.001) and SO-spindle complexes (32.3% increase, p<0.001). Changes in frontal SO (1.9% improvement per increase in SO/min; p<0.001) and SO-spindle complexes (9.5% improvement per increase in SO-spindle/min) event rates due to auditory stimulation positively predicted changes in sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Conclusion: Auditory stimulation reliably modulates sleep oscillations when delivered on background activity and during the upstate of SOs. As increased event rates improve memory consolidation, stimulation paradigms to increase SO and SO-spindle complex rates are required to enhance memory.

">Temporal coding carries more stable cortical visual representations than firing rate over time</a></h4>

              
                The brain's ability to stably represent recurring visual scenes is crucial for behavior. Previous studies have used slow dynamic (1-5 seconds) rate code measurements to study visual tuning, revealing varying degrees of gradual activity changes over time or "representational drifts." However, it remains unclear if there is an underlying neural code that maintains the encoding of information stable over time. In this study, we extracted structures in fast (tens of milliseconds) temporal responses and explored the role of such temporal codes in supporting the stability of visual representations. We tracked the spiking activity of the same visual cortical populations in male mice for 15 consecutive days using custom-developed, large-scale, ultraflexible electrode arrays. Across various types of stimuli, we found that neurons exhibited varying degrees of day-to-day stability in their firing rate-based tuning. The across day stability correlated with tuning reliability. Notably, accounting for spiking temporal dynamics increased single neuron tuning stability, especially for less reliable neurons. Temporal coding further improved population representation discriminability and decoding accuracy. The stability of temporal codes was more correlated with network functional connectivity than rate coding. These results show that temporal coding is crucial for stably encoding sensory stimuli, suggesting its significant role in ensuring consistent sensory experiences.

">Individual differences in fear memory expression engage distinct functional brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Fearful stimuli elicit a mix of active (e.g., evasion) and passive (e.g., freezing) behaviors in a wide range of species, including zebrafish (Danio rerio). However, it is not clear if individual differences in fear responses exist and, if so, what parts of the brain may underlie such differences. To probe these questions, we developed a contextual fear conditioning paradigm for zebrafish that uses conspecific alarm substance (CAS) as an unconditioned stimulus where fish associate CAS administration with a specific tank. To identify individual differences, we collected behavioral responses from over 300 fish from four different strains (AB, TU, TL, and WIK) and both sexes. We found that fear memory behavior fell into four distinct groups: non-reactive, evaders, evading freezers, and freezers. We also found that background strain and sex influenced how fish respond to CAS, with males more likely to increase evasive behaviors than females and the TU strain more likely to be non-reactive. Finally, we performed whole-brain activity mapping to identify the brain regions that are associated with different behavioral responses. All groups exposed to the tank had strong engagement of the telencephalon, whereas regions beyond the telencephalon distinguished behavioral groups: animals that have high levels of freezing, but low levels of evasion, uniquely engage the cerebellum, preglomerular nuclei, and pretectal areas, whereas those fish that mix evasion with freezing engage the preoptic and hypothalamic areas. Taken together, these findings reveal that zebrafish exhibit individual differences in fear memory expression that are supported at the neural level by extra-telencephalic regions.

">Longitudinal monitoring of developmental plasticity in the mouse auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                The postnatal brain undergoes substantial plasticity in order to represent features and statistics of the sensory world. To date, for technical reasons it has been difficult to examine experience-dependent changes over the course of postnatal development. Here we perform longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging of hundreds of neurons in the auditory cortex of young mice, from postnatal day (P) 12 into adulthood. Auditory cortical neurons started responding to tonal stimuli by P13-14 with an initial tonotopic organization that expanded over the next few days. We documented the daily variation in tuning curves and best frequency, and while some neurons gradually changed their frequency representation across days, altogether our findings support the functional maturation of a largely stable auditory map at the population level. We then compared the representation of mouse pup ultrasonic vocalizations to pure tone responses. Ultrasonic pure tone tuning developed with a delay, coinciding with emerging responses to ultrasonic vocalizations. Vocalization responses initially were observed in neurons tuned to ultrasonic frequencies, but over later development the vocalization responses became independent from ultrasonic frequency tuning. Our results show how varied sensory representations at the single-cell and population levels in the postnatal auditory cortex emerge and change over the course of early-life development.

">BrainVAE: Exploring the role of white matter BOLD in preclinical Alzheimer disease classification</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Like gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) BOLD functional signals change in preclinical AD. However, the potential of WM BOLD for identifying preclinical AD remains underexplored. METHODS: We developed BrainVAE, a transformer based variational autoencoder with interpretability, to classify preclinical AD and normal controls using resting state fMRI data. We benchmarked BrainVAE against nine alternative models under three input configurations: WM only, GM only, and combined WM+GM. Interpretability analysis was also performed to investigate each brain regions contribution to the classification task. RESULTS: BrainVAE outperformed other models and performed well (accuracy = 83.42%, F1-score = 91.62%, AUC = 64.50%) using the combined input compared to WM-only and GM-only. Specific WM bundles, including corpus callosum, fornix, and corticospinal tract, were among the most influential features contributing to the classification. DISCUSSION: Incorporating WM BOLD signals improves the distinction of preclinical AD from controls, underscoring the potential role of WM BOLD features for detecting early-stage AD.

">Alcohol impacts an fMRI marker of neural inhibition in humans and rodents.</a></h4>

              
                Acute alcohol consumption leads to cognitive and behavioral disinhibition that increase health and social risks, such as traffic fatalities and violence. Although rodent studies have shown that alcohol affects neural inhibition, its relevance to humans remains largely unexplored. Here, we used the Hurst exponent, an fMRI-based marker of neural inhibition, to examine alcohol's effects in both rats and humans. In rats, acute alcohol administration significantly reduced the cortical Hurst exponent, suggesting decrease of neural inhibition. This reduction was strongly correlated with the spatial distribution of GABAA receptor expression, highlighting the key role of these receptors in mediating alcohol's effects. Similarly, in humans, acute alcohol consumption reduced the cortical Hurst exponent, especially in brain regions with high GABAA receptor expression. Our findings provide cross-species in vivo evidence that acute alcohol consumption modulates neural inhibition, offering new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced behavioral modulation.

                Naturalistic stimuli, such as movies, offer a powerful tool for probing functional brain organization across species. Using movie-driven functional magnetic resonance imaging (md-fMRI), we recorded brain activity in humans and awake marmosets exposed to the same dynamic audiovisual stimulus. We applied tensor independent component analysis (tICA) to identify functional networks in each species, hierarchically clustered these components, and examined their within- and between-species temporal correlations to assess functional homologies. We found strong interspecies correspondence in core sensory networks, particularly those involved in visual and auditory processing, suggesting conserved mechanisms for sensory integration. In contrast, networks associated with higher-order cognition, including prefrontal and temporoparietal areas, were observed primarily in humans, highlighting species-specific specializations. These findings demonstrate the value of naturalistic paradigms and data-driven approaches in revealing both shared and divergent brain network architectures. By openly sharing our data and analysis pipelines, we aim to support future comparative studies and advance the marmoset as a model for investigating the evolutionary foundations of brain function.

">Cerebellar tDCS differentially modulates sensory inputs in somatosensory cortex and cerebellum.</a></h4>

              
                Cerebellar transcranial direct-current stimulation (Cb-tDCS) is a promising tool for non-invasive modulation of cerebellar activity and has been proposed for the treatment of cerebellum-related disorders. However, how external currents applied to the cerebellum affect local and distant circuits remains unclear. In this study, we examined the immediate and aftereffects of Cb-tDCS on sensory inputs recorded in the cerebellar Crus I/II and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in response to whisker stimulation. We also assessed changes in the excitation/inhibition balance using vGLUT1 and GAD 65-67 immunoreactivity. Anodal and cathodal Cb-tDCS respectively induced an immediate increase and decrease in the trigeminal component in Crus I/II but no aftereffects were observed 20 minutes post-stimulation. In S1, Cb-tDCS resulted in polarity-dependent modulation of the N1 component during stimulation, which was opposite to the changes induced in Crus I/II and a sustained increase after anodal Cb-tDCS, accompanied by reduced GAD 65-67 immunoreactivity. While power spectrum analysis revealed no changes in Crus I/II, cathodal Cb-tDCS significantly modulated gamma (30-45 Hz) and high-frequency oscillations (255-300 Hz) in S1. These findings indicate that Cb-tDCS can modulate sensory inputs during stimulation and exert delayed effects in distant cortical areas, emphasizing the need to consider both online and remote network modulation in clinical applications.

LgDel bPs express 24/28 contiguous murine 22q11 gene orthologues at diminished levels; in parallel, cell cycle kinetics, modes of division, gene expression levels, and DNA methylation states are aberrant in LgDel bPs but not their apical progenitor precursors. Accordingly, targeted disruption of bP proliferative and transcriptional states selectively alters Layer 2/3 PN identities and frequencies, prefiguring atypical association cortico-cortical connections and behavioral deficits associated with ASD and Scz pathology in a mouse model of 22q11DS.

">Cholinergic blockade reveals role for human hippocampal theta in encoding but not retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Cholinergic dysfunction is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and other memory disorders. Yet, the neurophysiological mechanisms linking cholinergic signaling to memory remain poorly understood. In this study, we administered scopolamine, a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist, to neurosurgical patients with intracranial electrodes as they performed an associative recognition memory task. When scopolamine was present at encoding, we observed disruptions to hippocampal slow theta oscillations (2-4 Hz), with selective impairments to recollection-based memory. However, when scopolamine was present during retrieval alone, we observed disruptions to slow theta without impaired memory performance. These disruptions included dose-dependent reductions in theta power, theta phase reset, and encoding-retrieval pattern reinstatement. Together, our results challenge the notion that theta oscillations are necessary for memory retrieval, and instead suggest that theta universally reflects an encoding-related neural state. These findings motivate updates to current models of acetylcholine's role in memory and may inform future therapies targeting rhythmic biomarkers of memory dysfunction.

">Developmental embedding of parvalbumin interneurons drives local and crosshemispheric prefrontal gamma synchrony</a></h4>

              
                Gamma oscillations are a pivotal trait of cortical cognitive processing. However, the ability to generate gamma oscillations evolves with age and requires cellular adjustments of the underlying neural networks. In the prefrontal cortex, gamma oscillations emerge relatively late compared to other cortical areas, yet the developmental mechanisms leading to the generation of adult-like gamma oscillations are poorly understood. Here, we combine bilateral in vivo electrophysiology and selective optogenetic manipulations of parvalbumin- (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SOM+) interneurons in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex along late development to investigate their role for the age-dependent maturation of gamma oscillations. We show that crosshemispheric gamma synchrony strengthens with age, in line with the previously reported increase in local gamma power. Following a similar timeline, the inhibitory effect of PV+ interneurons emerges which start to functionally operate within the classical gamma frequency range from adolescence onwards. In contrast, SOM+ interneurons show no such age-dependent functional integration and display their beta oscillation modulating inhibitory effect across age. These data identify the SOM+ to PV+ interneuron switch as a mechanism of gamma ontogeny and emergence of crosshemispheric synchrony in the developing prefrontal cortex.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has generated significant impacts on the forestry sector. Employment layoffs have led to an increase in return migration, resulting in additional labor supply and heightened family economic burdens. This research employs the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) framework to examine and predict sustainable forest management practices among families managing customary forests and village forests in Bali. Methods Purposive sampling was used to collect data from 71 managers of customary forests and village forests in Tenganan and Wanagiri. Partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the acquired data. Results The findings demonstrated that TPB can explain the sustainable forest management. The incorporation of an additional construct, Tri Hita Karana (THK), enhanced the model’s predictive power for both managerial intentions and behaviors in sustainable forest management. Specifically, THK influences management intentions through the mediation of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Conclusions This study established that THK, a fundamental value system in Balinese society, serves an antecedent predictor of behavioral intentions toward sustainable forest management. The relationship between THK and sustainable forest management intentions is mediated by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. This research makes significant theoretical and managerial contributions. First, it validates the established TPB framework within the context of COVID-19’s impact in Bali. Additionally, it provides scholars with insights for identifying other potential constructs that may influence forest land managers’ behavior.

                <p>Pain sensation often involves mechanical modalities. Mechanically activated (MA) ion channels on sensory neurons underly responsiveness to mechanical stimuli. MA current properties have mainly been derived from rodent sensory neurons. This study aimed to address gaps in knowledge regarding MA current properties in trigeminal (TG) neurons of a higher-order species, common marmoset nonhuman primates (NHP). MA currents triggered by a piezoactuator were recorded in patch-clamp configuration. MA responses were associated with action potential (AP) properties, such as width, dV/dt on the falling phase, and presence/absence of AP firing in NHP TG neurons. According to responsiveness to mechanical stimuli and AP properties, marmoset TG neurons were clustered into four S-type and five M-type groups. S-type TG neurons had broader AP with two dV/dt peaks on the AP falling phase. Only one S-type group of NHP TG neurons produced small MA currents. M-type TG neurons had narrow AP without two dV/dt peaks on the AP falling phase. M-type NHP TG neurons, except for one group, showed MA currents. We additionally used immunohistochemistry to confirm the presence of known sensory neuronal types such as unmyelinated peptidergic CGRP<sup>+</sup>/trpV1<sup>+</sup>, unmyelinated nonpeptidergic MrgprD<sup>+</sup> and CGRP<sup>&ndash;</sup>/trpV1<sup>+</sup>, and myelinated peptidergic CGRP<sup>+</sup>/trpV1<sup>&ndash;</sup> and nonpeptidergic CGRP<sup>&ndash;</sup> and PV<sup>+</sup> NHP TG neurons. Overall, marmoset TG neurons and associated MA currents have many similarities compared with reported data from mouse sensory neurons. However, there are notable differences such as lower percentage of small NHP TG neurons responding to mechanical stimuli and absence of fast inactivating MA currents.</p>

                <p>Activation of hypothalamic paraventricular oxytocin (OXT<sup>PVN</sup>) neurons by social or stress stimuli triggers OXT release to promote social investigation and buffer adverse effects of stress, respectively. Astrocytes, a type of glial cells, can bidirectionally interact with hypothalamic neurons to participate in local activity regulation within the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). It remains unknown whether contextual factors related to stimuli, as well as biological factors such as sex, influence OXT<sup>PVN</sup> neuronal or astrocyte activity and/or their interactions. To address this question, we performed dual-color fiber photometry in freely behaving male and female mice to simultaneously record Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in OXT<sup>PVN</sup> neurons and astrocytes during acute social (i.e., interactions with familiar vs. unfamiliar conspecifics) and stress (i.e., looming shadow) stimuli. During social stimuli, we observed the most pronounced Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in OXT<sup>PVN</sup> neurons in females, revealing sex and familiarity context specificity. No astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes were detected in either sex regardless of conspecific familiarity. In contrast, looming shadow stress increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> in both OXT<sup>PVN</sup> neurons and astrocytes in both sexes during an active escape ("run") strategy. Ca<sup>2+</sup> level changes in OXT<sup>PVN</sup> neurons and astrocytes were significantly correlated during social investigations in both sexes regardless of conspecific familiarity. During looming shadow, this functional coupling was only observed in females during active escape. Together, our results suggest that sex, context, and behavioral strategy serve as major factors that shape the activity of OXT<sup>PVN</sup> neurons and astrocytes, as well as their functional coupling, to potentially aid the adaptive response to social or stress stimuli.</p>

                Background The application of disinfectants on dental instruments is one way to prevent cross-infection. Cross infection can occur due to microorganisms found in blood, saliva and dental plaque which can contaminate the instruments used by dental health workers. Thus, indirect contact transmission of pathogenic microorganisms occurs from instruments that have been contaminated by dental health workers. 4.8% chloroxylenol are disinfecting agents used to disinfect medical instruments. Research on ozone water as a disinfectant is still limited and no research has been found on the use of ozone water on tooth extraction instruments. However, ozone has antibacterial properties so researchers are interested in studying the effectiveness of ozone water as a disinfectant when compared to the commonly used 4.8% chloroxylenol. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of disinfection of ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol in reducing the number of bacterial colonies on dental extraction instruments at the University of South Sumatera (USU) Dental and Oral Hospital. Methods The samples used were mandibular molar forceps that have been used in tooth extraction procedures. This study was experimental and used 30 sample with three sample groups, where each group consisted of 10 tooth extraction instruments. The treatment group used ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol and the negative control group was cleaned with distilled water. After use, each of the 10 mandibular molar tooth extraction forceps was disinfected. The ozone water group was produced with an ozone generator with a concentration of 15 mg/L for 20 minutes. Then the active side of the mandibular molar tooth extraction forceps was soaked for 30 minutes. In the 4.8% chloroxylenol (dettol®) group, the active side of the mandibular molar tooth extraction forceps was soaked in 250 mL of 4.8% chloroxylenol solution for 60 minutes. In the control group, the mandibular molar tooth extraction forceps were rinsed with distilled water without using soap or antiseptic solution at all. Then the forceps were removed from the disinfection container using tool tongs and dried with sterile gauze. After that, the sample was obtained by dipping the active side of the tooth extraction forceps into a container containing 50 ml of saline solution, then covered with aluminum foil and left for 5 minutes. The forceps are removed from the sample container and the container is closed again with plastic wrap, labeled, placed in a sterile container and then taken to the USU pharmaceutical laboratory to be counted the bacterial colonies using a bactery colony counter. The test effectiveness in this study used bacteria colony counter using the scatter cup method. Data were analyzed using the Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-tests. Results The results of the data analysis showed a p-value ≤0.001, which means that there was a significant difference in the disinfection using ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol on the number of bacterial colonies on dental extraction instruments. The results of this study show that the average number of bacterial colonies formed in the ozone water treatment group was 4.00 ± 4.32, in the 4.8% chloroxylenol treatment group, and 217.50 ± 39.24 in the negative control group (Aquadest). Conclusions From this study it can be said that ozone water is more effective in disinfecting dental extraction instruments than 4.8% chloroxylenol.

                <p>by Alberto Portela, Julio R. Banga, Marcos Matabuena</p>

Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is the process of systematically determining and characterizing the degree of confidence in computational model predictions. In systems biology, and particularly with dynamic models, UQ is critical due to the nonlinearities and parameter sensitivities that influence the behavior of complex biological systems. Addressing these issues through robust UQ enables a deeper understanding of system dynamics and more reliable extrapolation beyond observed conditions. Many state-of-the-art UQ approaches in this field are grounded in Bayesian statistical methods. While these frameworks naturally incorporate uncertainty quantification, they often require the specification of parameter distributions as priors and may impose parametric assumptions that do not always reflect biological reality. Additionally, Bayesian methods can be computationally expensive, posing significant challenges when dealing with large-scale models and seeking rapid, reliable uncertainty calibration. As an alternative, we propose using conformal predictions methods and introduce two novel algorithms designed for dynamic biological systems. These approaches can provide non-asymptotic guarantees, improving robustness and scalability across various applications, even when the predictive models are misspecified. Through several illustrative scenarios, we demonstrate that these conformal algorithms can serve as powerful complements—or even alternatives—to conventional Bayesian methods, delivering effective uncertainty quantification for predictive tasks in systems biology.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an essential role in embryonic development, wound healing, and tumor progression. Partial EMT states have been linked to metastatic dissemination and drug resistance. Several interconnected feedback loops at the RNA and protein levels control the transition between different cellular states. Using a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental analyses in the TGFβ-responsive breast epithelial MCF10A cell model, we identify a central role for the tumor suppressor protein Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 (DLC1) during EMT. By extending a previous model of EMT comprising key transcription factors and microRNAs, our work shows that DLC1 acts as a positive regulator of TGFβ-driven EMT, mainly by promoting SNAIL1 expression. Our model predictions indicate that DLC1 loss impairs EMT progression. Experimental analyses confirm this prediction and reveal the acquisition of a partial EMT phenotype in DLC1-depleted cells. Furthermore, our model results indicate a possible EMT reversion to partial or epithelial states upon DLC1 loss in MCF10A cells induced toward mesenchymal phenotypes. The increased EMT plasticity of cells lacking DLC1 may explain its importance as a tumor suppressor.

                <p>by Arpit C. Swain, José A. M. Borghans, Rob J. de Boer</p>

Estimating production and loss rates of cell populations is essential but difficult. The current state-of-the-art method to estimate these rates involves mathematical modelling of deuterium labelling experiments. Current models typically assume that the labelling in the precursors of the population of interest (POI) is proportional to the deuterium enrichment in body water/glucose. This assumption is not always true and it is known that this can have a significant effect on the rates estimated from labelling experiments. Here we quantify the effect that different turnover (replacement) rates of the precursors can have on the estimated proliferation and loss rates of a POI by explicitly modelling the dynamics of the precursors. We first confirm earlier results that the labelling curve of the POI only reflects its own turnover rate if either the turnover rate of the precursors is sufficiently fast, or the contribution from the precursors is sufficiently small. Next, we describe three realistic scenarios with a slowly turning over precursor population, and show how this changes the interpretation of the different parameter estimates. Our analyses underpin that uniquely identifying the turnover rate of a POI requires measurements (or knowledge) on the turnover of its immediate precursors.

Traditional methodologies, which predominantly rely on homogeneous graph encoding, are limited by their inability to integrate external knowledge and represent molecular structures across different levels of granularity. To address these limitations, we propose a paradigm shift by encoding molecular graphs into heterogeneous structures, introducing a novel framework: Knowledge-aware Contrastive Heterogeneous Molecular Graph Learning. This approach leverages contrastive learning to enrich molecular representations with embedded external knowledge. KCHML conceptualizes molecules through three distinct graph views—molecular, elemental, and pharmacological—enhanced by heterogeneous molecular graphs and a dual message-passing mechanism. This design offers a comprehensive representation for property prediction, as well as for downstream tasks such as drug-drug interaction prediction. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates KCHML’s superiority over state-of-the-art molecular property prediction models, underscoring its ability to capture intricate molecular features.

Malaria is one of the deadliest infectious diseases globally, claiming hundreds of thousands of lives each year. The disease presents substantial heterogeneity among the population, with approximately two-thirds of fatalities occurring in children under five years old. Immunity to malaria develops through repeated exposure and plays a crucial role in disease dynamics. Seasonal environmental fluctuations, such as changes in temperature and rainfall, lead to temporal heterogeneity and further complicate transmission dynamics and the utility of intervention strategies. We employ an age-structured partial differential equation model to characterize seasonal malaria transmission and assess vaccination strategies that vary by timing and duration. Our model integrates vector-host epidemiological dynamics across different age groups and nonlinear feedback between transmission and immunity. We calibrate the model to year-round and seasonal malaria settings and conduct extensive sensitivity analyses for both scenarios to systematically assess which assumptions lead to the most uncertainty. We use time-varying sensitivity indices to identify critical disease parameters during low and high transmission seasons. We further investigate the impact of vaccination and its implementation in the seasonal malaria settings. When implementing a three-dose primary vaccination series, seasonally targeted campaigns can prevent significantly more cases per vaccination than constant year-long programs in regions with strong seasonal variation in transmission. In such scenarios, the optimal vaccination interval aligns with the peak in infected mosquito abundance and precedes the peak in malaria transmission. In contrast, seasonal booster programs may provide limited advantages over year-long vaccination. Additionally, while increasing annual vaccination counts can reduce overall disease incidence, it yields marginal improvements in cases prevented per vaccination.

Living organisms rely on internal models of the world to act adaptively. These models, because of resource limitations, cannot encode every detail and hence need to compress information. From a cognitive standpoint, information compression can manifest as a distortion of latent representations, resulting in the emergence of representations that may not accurately reflect the external world or its geometry. Rate-distortion theory formalizes the optimal way to compress information while minimizing such distortions, by considering factors such as capacity limitations, the frequency and the utility of stimuli. However, while this theory explains why the above factors distort latent representations, it does not specify which specific distortions they produce. To address this question, here we investigate how rate-distortion trade-offs shape the latent representations of images in generative models, specifically Beta Variational Autoencoders (β-VAEs), under varying constraints of model capacity, data distributions, and task objectives. By systematically exploring these factors, we identify three primary distortions in latent representations: prototypization, specialization, and orthogonalization. These distortions emerge as signatures of information compression, reflecting the model’s adaptation to capacity limitations, data imbalances, and task demands. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that these distortions can coexist, giving rise to a rich landscape of latent spaces, whose geometry could differ significantly across generative models subject to different constraints. Our findings contribute to explain how the normative constraints of rate-distortion theory shape the geometry of latent representations of generative models of artificial systems and living organisms.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012572">Capturing the emergent dynamical structure in biophysical neural models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Borjan Milinkovic, Lionel Barnett, Olivia Carter, Anil K. Seth, Thomas Andrillon</p>

Complex neural systems can display structured emergent dynamics. Capturing this structure remains a significant scientific challenge. Using information theory, we apply <i>Dynamical Independence</i> (DI) to uncover the emergent dynamical structure in a minimal 5-node biophysical neural model, shaped by the interplay of two key aspects of brain organisation: integration and segregation. In our study, functional integration within the biophysical neural model is modulated by a global coupling parameter, while functional segregation is influenced by adding dynamical noise, which counteracts global coupling. Leveraging transfer entropy, DI defines a dimensionally-reduced <i>macroscopic variable</i> (e.g., a coarse-graining) as emergent to the extent that it behaves as an independent dynamical process, distinct from the micro-level dynamics. Dynamical dependence (a departure from dynamical independence) is measured by minimising the transfer entropy from microlevel variables to macroscopic variables across spatial scales. Our results indicate that the degree of emergence of macroscopic variables is relatively minimised at balanced points of integration and segregation and maximised at the extremes. Additionally, our method identifies to which degree the macroscopic dynamics are localised across microlevel nodes, thereby elucidating the emergent dynamical structure through the relationship between microscopic and macroscopic processes. We find that deviation from a balanced point between integration and segregation results in a less localised, more distributed emergent dynamical structure as identified by DI. This finding suggests that a balance of functional integration and segregation is associated with lower levels of emergence (higher dynamical dependence), which may be crucial for sustaining coherent, localised emergent macroscopic dynamical structures. This work also provides a complete computational implementation for the identification of emergent neural dynamics that could be applied both in silico and in vivo.

The circadian rhythm is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism with translational regulation increasingly recognized as pivotal in its modulation. In this study, we found that upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are enriched in <i>Drosophila</i> circadian rhythm genes, with particularly conserved uORFs present in core circadian clock genes. We demonstrate evidence that the uORFs of the core clock gene, <i>Clock</i> (<i>Clk</i>), rhythmically and substantially attenuate CLK protein translation in <i>Drosophila</i>, with pronounced suppression occurring during daylight hours. Eliminating <i>Clk</i> uORFs leads to increased CLK protein levels during the day and results in a shortened circadian cycle, along with a broad shift in clock gene expression rhythms. Notably, <i>Clk</i> uORF deletion also augments morning sleep by reducing dopaminergic activity. Beyond daily circadian adjustments, <i>Clk</i> uORFs play a role in modulating sleep patterns in response to seasonal daylight variations. Furthermore, the <i>Clk</i> uORFs act as an important regulator to shape the rhythmic expression of a vast array of genes and influence multifaceted physiological outcomes. Collectively, our research sheds light on the intricate ways uORFs dynamically adjust downstream coding sequences to acclimate to environmental shifts.

Sex chromosomes can determine male and female phenotypes, and the resulting sex differences may have significant impacts on ecology and life history. One manifestation of this link is that ZW/ZZ sex-determination systems are associated with more male-skewed adult sex ratio (ASR, proportion of males in the adult population) than XX/XY systems across tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals). Here, we investigate four demographic processes: male and female offspring production, sex differences in juvenile and adult mortalities and in timing of maturation that can contribute to ASR variation between XX/XY and ZW/ZZ systems, using phylogenetic analyses of a large dataset collected from tetrapod species in the wild. We show that sex differences in adult mortality reliably predict ASR that is also more male-biased in XX/XY species than in ZW/ZZ species. Sex differences in juvenile mortality and in maturation time also contribute to ASR skews, but do not differ consistently between XX/XY and ZW/ZZ systems. Phylogenetic path analyses confirm an influence of sex-determination system on ASR through sex-biased adult mortalities. Together these results infer that sex chromosomes can impact, via demographic pathways, frequency-dependent selection emerging from the relative number of males and females. We call for follow-up studies to uncover the potentially complex web of associations between sex determination, population dynamics, and social behavior.

The variant histone H2A.Z is deposited into nucleosomes immediately downstream of promoters, where it plays a critical role in transcription. The site-specific deposition of H2A.Z is catalyzed by the SWR complex, a conserved chromatin remodeler with affinity for promoter-proximal nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) and histone acetylation. By comparing the genomic distribution of H2A.Z in wild-type and SWR-deficient cells, we found that SWR is also responsible for depositing H2A.Z at thousands of non-canonical sites not directly linked to NDRs or histone acetylation. To understand the targeting mechanism of H2A.Z, we presented SWR to a library of canonical nucleosomes isolated from yeast and analyzed the preferred substrates. Our results revealed that SWR preferentially deposited H2A.Z into a subset of endogenous H2A.Z sites, which are overrepresented by polyadenine tracts on the top strands of the DNA duplex at the nucleosomal entry-exit sites. Insertion of polyadenine sequences into recombinant nucleosomes near the outgoing H2A-H2B dimer enhanced SWR’s affinity for the nucleosomal substrate and increased its H2A.Z insertion activity. These findings suggest that the genome encodes sequence-based information that facilitates remodeler-mediated targeting of H2A.Z.

     alt="Modulation of GABAergic System in a Chicken Retinal Ischemic Model: The Role of Chloride Cotransporters"/>
<p>Oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) promotes GABA release and increases NKCC1 levels, which change the electrochemical chloride gradient. In these circumstances, activation of ionotropic GABA receptors would lead to cell depolarization. Thus, in the early stages of ischemia, GABA intensifies glutamate excitotoxicity by an alteration in chloride transporters, worsening cell death.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Retinal ischemia is a significant pathological condition that contributes to visual impairment and neuronal cell death in various retinopathies. Evidence suggests that GABA release during ischemic events may exhibit neuroprotective properties, but conflicting findings highlight a potential shift in its effects due to altered chloride ion homeostasis. This study aimed to investigate the role of the GABAergic system in retinal ischemia, focusing on the temporal dynamics of GABA release and its impact on retinal damage. We hypothesized that ischemia-induced changes in GABA transport and chloride ion equilibrium contribute to neuronal damage, which can be mitigated by modulating GABAergic activity. Using an ex vivo chick retina model subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), during different times, we assessed morphological changes, cell death, GABA levels, transporter activity, and the levels of chloride cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2. Pharmacological interventions, including picrotoxin and bumetanide, were used to evaluate neuroprotective effects. Our results revealed that OGD-induced significant morphological changes and cell death in the retina. GABA levels were reduced in a GAT-1-dependent manner, while picrotoxin and bumetanide demonstrated neuroprotective effects by mitigating retinal swelling and modulating the GABAergic system. Notably, OGD increased NKCC1 content, but not KCC2 levels, indicating a disruption in chloride homeostasis. These findings suggest that ischemia-induced alterations in GABAergic activity and chloride transport contribute to retinal damage. Targeting these pathways with pharmacological agents, such as bumetanide, may offer therapeutic strategies for mitigating ischemic retinal injury. Further research is recommended to explore the clinical applicability of these findings in the ischemic retina.</p>

                Background Cystocele, a form of anterior vaginal wall prolapse, remains one of the most prevalent types of pelvic organ prolapse in women, often associated with a high risk of recurrence following surgical repair. Despite advancements in surgical techniques, the failure rate remains significant, prompting the need for adjunct therapies to enhance healing. Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), an autologous blood derivative rich in growth factors, has emerged as a promising regenerative therapy known to accelerate wound healing and tissue regeneration. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of intra-fascial PRP injection during cystocele repair on systemic Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) expression, anatomical improvement based on Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) values, symptom severity assessed by the Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI) score, and recurrence risk. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 44 women aged 44 to 72 years diagnosed with stage III–IV cystocele. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: 21 underwent standard cystocele repair (control group), and 23 received the same procedure with a single 10 ml autologous PRP injection into the pubocervical fascia (PRP group). The study was conducted at RSUD Arifin Achmad Pekanbaru from March to October 2024. Blinding was applied to patients, caregivers, and assessors. PDGF levels were measured on days 0, 3, 28, and 90 postoperatively. POP-Q values and UDI scores were assessed at the same intervals. Results PRP administration significantly increased PDGF levels and improved UDI scores on days 28 and 90. Anatomical improvement was also greater in the PRP group. While recurrence rates did not differ significantly, the PRP group had fewer recurrences. Conclusions Intra-fascial PRP injection during cystocele repair improves PDGF expression, healing response, and patient-reported outcomes. Though recurrence risk was not significantly reduced, findings support further trials to assess PRP’s long-term benefits in pelvic reconstructive surgery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-294/v2?src=rss">Head and neck dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: Case series of extensive resections and reconstructions with literature review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare, locally aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma. Head and neck involvement accounts for only 10–15% of cases. Achieving clear margins in this region is challenging owing to anatomical constraints. Such cases often require extensive resection and complex reconstructions. This study presents a case series of extensive dermatofibrosarcoma resections in the head and neck, focusing on the surgical margins, reconstruction strategies, recurrence rates, and adjuvant therapy. We report four cases of head and neck dermatofibrosarcoma involving the cheek and scalp. Surgery included wide local excision with margins of 3–5 cm, which was confirmed intraoperatively by frozen section analysis. Reconstruction involved free flaps, local flaps, and healing with secondary intention. The choice depends on the defect size and location. Adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to selected cases. All patients achieved negative margins. One patient developed flap necrosis that required revision surgery. No local recurrence was observed during the follow-up (1–7 years). Head and neck dermatofibrosarcoma justifies aggressive surgical resection to achieve clear margins, which is the key to reducing the risk of recurrence. Free flaps and local reconstruction techniques ensure good functional and aesthetic outcomes. Adjuvant radiotherapy is indicated in patients with close margins or deep invasion. Long-term follow-up is essential owing to its high recurrence potential.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-488/v1?src=rss">Efficacy of auditory-visual attentional training in adults with chronic tinnitus: A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Chronic tinnitus, a phantom auditory perception affecting a significant proportion of adults worldwide, is associated with attentional deficits and maladaptive neuroplasticity. While existing rehabilitation strategies often neglect multi-sensory attentional processing, this study will evaluate a novel auditory-visual attentional training protocol designed to modulate tinnitus-related neural and cognitive dysfunction. Methods Forty-five adults with chronic tinnitus will be randomly assigned to visual-only attentional training, auditory-only training, or combined auditory-visual training. Participants will complete daily 30-minute sessions via a mobile platform over three weeks. Primary outcomes included tinnitus severity, measured by the Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire (THQ), and attention performance across three domains: visual attention (Stroop test accuracy), auditory attention (Test of Attention in Listening metrics), and global attention (Attention Network Test scores). Neurophysiological assessments will comprise resting-state quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) spectral power analysis and modality-specific evoked potentials (auditory and visual P300). Data will be analyzed using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) for neural source localization and mixed-effects models for behavioral outcomes. Conclusion This trial will systematically evaluate multi-sensory attentional training by integrating behavioral and neurophysiological assessments, including resting-state qEEG dynamics and modality-specific P300 responses. Findings provide insights into the interplay between attentional plasticity, neural oscillatory patterns, and tinnitus symptom modulation, informing future targeted rehabilitation strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-487/v1?src=rss">Health policy at your fingertips? Mapping and evaluation of existing digital health policy repositories. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Digital repositories and databases facilitate faster dissemination, transparency, and stakeholder collaboration. This review aimed to map and evaluate such digital infrastructures, focusing on their scope, content, functionality, adherence to FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reuse) principles, and user interface and experiences (UI/UX). Methods A review of global digital health policy repositories was conducted across multiple search engines and databases. The review targeted digital repositories that systematically collate health policy documents at a global level. Two country-specific repositories with a bearing on global health policies were also included. Results The study identified 59 global health policy repositories, with 15 matching our inclusion criteria evaluated in detail. These repositories contain vast amounts of data and are generally freely accessible, rendering them immensely rich sources for health policy documents, though with significant variability in content and coverage. The majority have a health focus, including HIV/AIDS, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH); about a third are more broad and emerging health threats are often neglected. Accessibility and usability are limited, with basic user interface features such as search and filtering tools are present for almost all repositories and a notable lack of advanced analytics or artificial intelligence capabilities. Furthermore, many repositories struggle to adhere to FAIR principles, reducing their utility and potential for integration. Sustainability is also a concern, as funding often relies on short-term projects or philanthropic support, undermining long-term viability. Conclusion These issues collectively hinder the ability of digital health policy repositories to support comprehensive and timely global health policy development. To unlock the full potential of existing or new repositories for health policy, identified challenges should be tackled systematically. We provide specific recommendations aimed at driving the development of equitable, inclusive, high-functioning repositories and strengthening evidence-driven global health policy systems.

                Background Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) are a critical measure of financial health, affecting bank profitability, stability, and investor trust. This systematic review synthesizes existing research on the causes, effects, and innovative approaches to managing NPLs in the banking sector. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a thorough search of peer-reviewed journals, conference papers, and institutional reports published between 2014 and 2024. Databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate were used. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts for eligibility. Data were extracted and synthesized to identify trends and gaps in the literature. Results The review included 50 studies from various regions. Key drivers of NPLs included economic downturns, inflation, and poor credit risk management. NPLs negatively impacted bank profitability metrics such as Return on Assets (ROA) and Net Interest Margin (NIM). FinTech solutions, particularly AI-driven credit scoring, showed potential in reducing NPLs, though adoption barriers exist in underdeveloped regions. Conclusions The findings emphasize the need to combine traditional risk management practices with innovative financial technologies and policy reforms to strengthen banking sector resilience. Policymakers and financial institutions should focus on improving regulatory frameworks and investing in technological advancements to address NPL-related risks.

                Nguyen et al. used expressed lentiviral-based cellular barcoding coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing to track single-cell-derived cancer clones from patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) models of human breast cancer. Cancer clones demonstrating propagating activity are extremely rare but exhibit remarkable transcriptional plasticity and highly conserved PDTX-model-specific differentiation programs.

                Gen et al. demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 potently blocks translation in Rhinolophus lepidus bat cells and several other mammalian cell lines, concurring with the broad species tropism of SARS-CoV-2. A cryo-EM structure reveals nsp1 obstructing the mRNA entry channel in a manner conserved with that of the human 40S ribosomal subunit.

                Rag GTPases mediate amino acid signals to control TORC1. Nicastro et al. show that yeast Tco89 tethers TORC1 to Rag GTPases to enable it to control vacuolar effectors. TORC1 phosphorylates and stabilizes Tco89, reinforcing this interaction and preventing TORC1 from relocating to endosomes and being separated from these effectors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90848">Seasonally migratory songbirds have different historic population size characteristics than resident relatives</a></h4>

              
                Modern genomic methods enable estimation of a lineage’s long-term effective population sizes back to its origins. This ability allows unprecedented opportunities to determine how the adoption of a major life-history trait affects lineages’ populations relative to those without the trait. We used this novel approach to study the population effects of the life-history trait of seasonal migration across evolutionary time. Seasonal migration is a common life-history strategy, but its effects on long-term population sizes relative to lineages that don’t migrate are largely unknown. Using whole-genome data, we estimated effective population sizes over millions of years in closely related seasonally migratory and resident lineages in a group of songbirds. Our main predictions were borne out: Seasonal migration is associated with larger effective population sizes (<i>N<sub>e</sub></i>), greater long-term variation in <i>N<sub>e</sub></i>, and a greater degree of initial population growth than among resident lineages. Initial growth periods were remarkably long (0.63–4.29 Myr), paralleling the expansion and adaptation phases of taxon cycles, a framework of lineage expansion and eventual contraction over time encompassing biogeography and evolutionary ecology. Heterogeneity among lineages is noteworthy, despite geographic proximity (including overlap) and close relatedness. Seasonal migration imbues these lineages with fundamentally different population size attributes through evolutionary time compared to closely related resident lineages.

                Rtf1 is generally considered to be a subunit of the Paf1 complex (Paf1C), which is a multifunctional protein complex involved in histone modification and RNA biosynthesis at multiple stages. Rtf1 is stably associated with the Paf1C in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, but not in other species including humans. Little is known about its function in human fungal pathogens. Here, we show that Rtf1 is required for facilitating H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1), and regulates fungal morphogenesis and pathogenicity in the meningitis-causing fungal pathogen <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>. Rtf1 is not tightly associated with the Paf1C, and its histone modification domain (HMD) is sufficient to promote H2Bub1 and the expression of genes related to fungal mating and filamentation. Moreover, Rtf1 HMD fully restores fungal morphogenesis and pathogenicity; however, it fails to restore defects of thermal tolerance and melanin production in the <i>rtf1</i>Δ strain background. The present study establishes a role for cryptococcal Rtf1 as a Paf1C-independent regulator in regulating fungal morphogenesis and pathogenicity, and highlights the function of HMD in facilitating global H2Bub1 in <i>C. neoformans</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101035">Molecular and spatial transcriptomic classification of midbrain dopamine neurons and their alterations in a LRRK2G2019S model of Parkinson’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Several studies have revealed that midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, even within a single neuroanatomical area, display heterogeneous properties. In parallel, studies using singlecell profiling techniques have begun to cluster DA neurons into subtypes based on their molecular signatures. Recent work has shown that molecularly defined DA subtypes within the substantia nigra (SNc) display distinctive anatomic and functional properties, and differential vulnerability in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Based on these provocative results, a granular understanding of these putative subtypes and their alterations in PD models, is imperative. We developed an optimized pipeline for single-nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and generated a high-resolution hierarchically organized map revealing 20 molecularly distinct DA neuron subtypes belonging to three main families. We integrated this data with spatial MERFISH technology to map, with high definition, the location of these subtypes in the mouse midbrain, revealing heterogeneity even within neuroanatomical sub-structures. Finally, we demonstrate that in the preclinical LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup> knock-in mouse model of PD, subtype organization and proportions are preserved. Transcriptional alterations occur in many subtypes including those localized to the ventral tier SNc, where differential expression is observed in synaptic pathways, which might account for previously described DA release deficits in this model. Our work provides an advancement of current taxonomic schemes of the mouse midbrain DA neuron subtypes, a high-resolution view of their spatial locations, and their alterations in a prodromal mouse model of PD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100840">Reproducibility of in vivo electrophysiological measurements in mice</a></h4>

              
                Understanding brain function relies on the collective work of many labs generating reproducible results. However, reproducibility has not been systematically assessed within the context of electrophysiological recordings during cognitive behaviors. To address this, we formed a multi-lab collaboration using a shared, open-source behavioral task and experimental apparatus. Experimenters in 10 laboratories repeatedly targeted Neuropixels probes to the same location (spanning secondary visual areas, hippocampus, and thalamus) in mice making decisions; this generated a total of 121 experimental replicates, a unique dataset for evaluating reproducibility of electrophysiology experiments. Despite standardizing both behavioral and electrophysiological procedures, some experimental outcomes were highly variable. A closer analysis uncovered that variability in electrode targeting hindered reproducibility, as did the limited statistical power of some routinely used electrophysiological analyses, such as single-neuron tests of modulation by individual task parameters. Reproducibility was enhanced by histological and electrophysiological quality-control criteria. Our observations suggest that data from systems neuroscience is vulnerable to a lack of reproducibility, but that across-lab standardization, including metrics we propose, can serve to mitigate this.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103235">Selective attention and sensitivity to auditory disturbances in a virtually real classroom</a></h4>

              
                Many people, and particularly individuals with attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder (AD(H)D), find it difficult to maintain attention during classroom learning. However, traditional paradigms used to evaluate attention do not capture the complexity and dynamic nature of real-life classrooms. Using a novel virtual reality platform, coupled with measurement of neural activity, eye-gaze, and skin conductance, here we studied the neurophysiological manifestations of attention and distractibility, under realistic learning conditions. Individuals with AD(H)D exhibited higher neural responses to irrelevant sounds and reduced speech tracking of the teacher, relative to controls. Additional neurophysiological measures, such the power of alpha-oscillations and frequency of gaze-shifts away from the teacher, contributed to explaining variance in self-reported AD(H)D symptoms across the sample. These ecologically valid findings provide critical insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying individual differences in the capacity for sustained attention and the proneness to distraction and mind-wandering, experienced in real-life situations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89485">Effects of blood meal source and seasonality on reproductive traits of Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae)</a></h4>

              
                Host selection by mosquitoes is a keystone in understanding viral circulation and predicting future infection outbreaks. <i>Culex</i> mosquitoes frequently feed on birds during spring and early summer, shifting into mammals towards late summer and autumn. This host switch may be due to changes in mosquito fitness. The aim of this study was to assess if the interaction effect of blood meal source and seasonality may influence reproductive traits of <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i> mosquitoes. For this purpose, <i>Cx. quinquefasciatus</i> mosquitoes were reared in simulated summer and autumn conditions and fed on two different hosts, chickens and mice, in a factorial design. Fecundity, fertility, and hatchability during two consecutive gonotrophic cycles were estimated. We found greater fecundity and fertility for mosquitoes fed upon birds than mammals. Fecundity and fertility did not vary between seasons for chicken-fed mosquitoes, whereas in autumn they decreased for mouse-fed mosquitoes. These traits decreased in the second gonotrophic cycle for mouse-fed mosquitoes, whereas they did not vary between cycles for chicken-fed mosquitoes. There was no statistically significant effect of blood meal source, seasonality or their interaction on hatchability, hence this variable was similar among treatments. Overall, these results indicate a statistically significant interaction effect of blood meal source and seasonality on fecundity and fertility. However, the pattern was opposite in relation to our hypothesis, suggesting that further studies are needed to confirm and expand our knowledge about mosquito biology and its relationship with seasonal host use shifting.

                Somatosensory neurons (SSNs) that detect and transduce mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli densely innervate an animal’s skin. However, although epidermal cells provide the first point of contact for sensory stimuli, our understanding of roles that epidermal cells play in SSN function, particularly nociception, remains limited. Here, we show that stimulating <i>Drosophila</i> epidermal cells elicits activation of SSNs including nociceptors and triggers a variety of behavior outputs, including avoidance and escape. Further, we find that epidermal cells are intrinsically mechanosensitive and that epidermal mechanically evoked calcium responses require the store-operated calcium channel Orai. Epidermal cell stimulation augments larval responses to acute nociceptive stimuli and promotes prolonged hypersensitivity to subsequent mechanical stimuli. Hence, epidermal cells are key determinants of nociceptive sensitivity and sensitization, acting as primary sensors of noxious stimuli that tune nociceptor output and drive protective behaviors.

">Non-invasive mapping of the temporal processing hierarchy in the human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Vision is not instantaneous but evolves over time. However, simultaneously capturing the fine spatial details and the rapid temporal dynamics of visual processing remains a major challenge, resulting in a gap in our understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics. Here, we introduce a forward modeling technique that bridges high-spatial resolution fMRI with high-temporal resolution MEG, enabling us to non-invasively measure different levels of the visual hierarchy in humans and their involvement in visual processing with millisecond precision. Using fMRI, levels of the visual hierarchy were identified by measuring individuals population receptive fields and determining visual field maps. We predicted how much the activity patterns in each visual field map would contribute to brain responses measured with MEG. By comparing these predicted responses with the measured MEG responses, we assessed how much a given visual field map contributed to the measured MEG response, and, most importantly, when. We combined information from all MEG sensors and revealed a cortical processing hierarchy across visual field maps. We validated the method using cross-validations and demonstrated that the model generalized across MEG sensor types, stimulus shapes, and was robust to the number of visual field maps included in the model. We found that the primary visual cortex captured most of the variance in the MEG sensors and did so earlier in time than extrastriate regions. We also report a processing hierarchy across extra-striate visual field maps and clusters. We effectively combined the advantages of two very different neuroimaging techniques, opening avenues for answering research questions that require recordings with high spatiotemporal detail. By bridging traditionally separate areas of research, our approach helps close longstanding gaps in our understanding of brain function.

">An intercellular signaling pathway in the mouse retina connects Kv2.1, GLT-1, and nitric oxide synthase 1 to optic nerve regeneration</a></h4>

              
                We report here that a multicellular signaling pathway in the mouse retina targeting glutamate homeostasis and nitric oxide production is activated upon optic nerve injury and modulates retinal ganglion cells' (RGCs') ability to mount a robust regenerative response. A novel highly sensitive and specific NO sensor (FL2) revealed that optic nerve injury leads to a rapid, prolonged NO elevation in the inner retina. Amacrine cell-specific genetic deletion of the neuron-specific isoform of nitric oxide synthase (NOS1, nNOS) or the NOS1 inhibitor N(w)-propyl-L-arginine (L-NPA) suppressed optic nerve regeneration. Steps leading to NOS1 activation are shown to include Kv2.1 phosphorylation and activation, reversal of glutamate uptake by the glutamate transporter GLT-1 (EAAT2), and subsequent NMDA receptor activation. Conditional knockout of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 in bipolar cells, intraocular injection of the GLT-1 blockers dihydrokainate (DHK) or WAY213613, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (D-AP5), or the Kv2.1 blockers RY796 or stromatoxin all suppressed NO generation and strongly diminished RGCs' ability to respond to Pten deletion and other factors. Thus, optic nerve injury activates a sequence of pathophysiological changes in retinal interneurons that gates RGCs' ability to regenerate injured axons.

">CaMK2rep: A Highly Sensitive Genetically Encoded Biosensor for Monitoring CaMKII Activity in Mammalian Cells</a></h4>

              
                Accurately monitoring calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity in cells remains a significant challenge due to the limited sensitivity and narrow dynamic range of existing genetically encoded sensors. Here, we introduce CaMK2rep, a novel phosphorylation-based biosensor that enables robust, specific, and high-sensitivity detection of CaMKII activity. CaMK2rep is designed with two tandem CaMKII consensus sites embedded within the native sequence context of synapsin, and its phosphorylation is detected via a phospho-specific antibody, allowing both biochemical and morphological analyses. We validated CaMK2rep in HeLa cells and cultured hippocampal neurons, demonstrating a near-linear response to CaMKII expression levels and stimulation intensity, and no detectable cytotoxicity. To complement CaMK2rep measurements, we employed the live-cell CaMKAR1 reporter to monitor CaMKII activity dynamics. Using both tools, we investigated the role of neurogranin (Ng), a major postsynaptic calmodulin (CaM) binding protein, and obtained consistent evidence supporting a CaM-buffering model in which Ng limits basal CaMKII activation by sequestering CaM. These findings establish CaMK2rep as a sensitive, specific, and versatile biosensor for CaMKII signaling, particularly well-suited for immunoblot-based population analyses. They also illustrate the value of combining orthogonal genetically encoded tools to interrogate complex signaling mechanisms in both physiological and pathological contexts.

">Statistical learning drives anticipatory micro-saccades toward suppressed distractor locations</a></h4>

              
                Statistical learning enables individuals to suppress distracting but salient information, yet the mechanisms underlying this suppression remain unclear. While some suggest that suppression is proactive, occurring without first attending to distractor locations, others argue that it is reactive, requiring covert attention toward the distractor location before suppression can occur. To address this fierce debate, the current study recorded micro-saccades--an index of covert attention--during the pre-stimulus interval, alongside electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected during a visual search task. Participants were instructed to ignore a salient distractor that appeared more frequently at one specific location than at others. Learning high-probability distractor locations reduced attentional capture by salient distractors, coinciding with increased micro-saccade rates and decodable representations of these locations in alpha power (8-14 Hz) before stimulus onset. Strikingly, these anticipatory micro-saccades were more frequently directed toward high-probability distractor locations than away from them, supporting a reactive suppression mechanism. Overall, these findings highlight a crucial role for the oculomotor system in encoding and responding to learned spatial regularities.

It has been shown that structural changes occur in the brain due to late-onset blindness, including cortical thinning in visual cortical regions. Following vision restoration, it is not yet known whether visual regions are reinvigorated and regain a normal cortical thickness or retain the diminished thickness from blindness.We evaluated the cortical thicknesses of 10 Argus II participants, 10 blind participants, and 13 sighted participants. The Argus II patients on average had a thicker left cuneus cortex and lateral occipital cortex relative to the blind patients. The duration of the Argus II use significantly partially correlated with thicker visual cortical regions in the left hemisphere. Furthermore, in the 2 case studies (scanned before and after implantation), the patient with longer device use (44.5 months) had an increase in the cortical thickness of visual regions, whereas the shorter-using patient did not (6.5 months).Overall, the Argus II participants’ cortical thickness was on average significantly rejuvenated in 2 higher visual regions, and participants using the implant for a longer duration had thicker visual regions. This research raises the possibility of structural plasticity reversing visual cortical atrophy in vision restoration participants.</span>

Age-related differences in these neurometabolites could potentially explain lower cognitive ability in older age. Working memory—the capacity to hold a limited amount of information online for a short period—has a central role in cognition, and this ability is also impaired in older individuals. Here, we investigated the relationship between gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA<sup>+</sup>) levels and a composite measure of glutamate/glutamine (Glx) in the hippocampus and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and how these neurochemical markers relate to working memory in younger and older adults. Across age groups, we found a significant positive association between working memory accuracy and Glx in the IFG, as well as a significant negative association between GABA<sup>+</sup> in this region and proactive interference. Age-stratified analyses demonstrated significant positive associations between components of working memory and hippocampal/IFG Glx, as well as a significant negative association between IFG GABA<sup>+</sup> and proactive interference in older adults only. These results provide novel evidence for a specific involvement of excitatory Glx and working memory accuracy as well as inhibitory GABA<sup>+</sup> for control of proactive interference in working memory, and how these effects are differentially affected by age.</span>

The hypothesis is that if one category of semantic representations is being processed for several seconds, then a slow short-term memory trace associative biologically plausible learning rule will enable all the components during that time to be associated together in a semantic attractor network. This benefits from the binding of components provided by the hippocampal episodic memory system.

We measured bidirectional pairwise effective connectivity with functional magnetic resonance imaging between 360 cortical regions while 956 Human Connectome Project participants viewed scenes, faces, tools, or body parts. We developed a method using deterministic dynamical graphs to define whole cortical networks and the flow in both directions between their cortical regions over timesteps after signal is applied to V1. We revealed that a ventromedial cortical visual “Where” network from V1 via the retrosplenial and medial parahippocampal scene areas reaches the hippocampus when scenes are viewed. A ventrolateral “What” visual cortical network reaches the hippocampus from V1 via V2–V4, the fusiform face cortex, and lateral parahippocampal region TF when faces/objects are viewed. There are major implications for understanding the computations of the human vs rodent hippocampus in memory and navigation: primates with their fovea and highly developed cortical visual processing networks process information about the location of faces, objects, and landmarks in viewed scenes, whereas in rodents the representations in the hippocampal system are mainly about the place where the individual is located and self-motion between places.</span>

                Background This study investigates the connection between aggregate markups and income inequality, exploring how market power affects inequality in developed, emerging, and developing economies. The analysis aims to reveal how institutional differences and economic systems shape this relationship. Method The study examines data from 12 countries from 1997 to 2016 using a panel data approach. The analysis focuses on key variables such as the Gini index (measuring inequality), lagged markups, trade openness, GDP per capita, tax revenue, poverty, and R&D expenditure. A two-way fixed-effects model is applied to account for country and year-specific differences, while robust standard errors ensure reliability. Results The results show that higher markups are closely linked to greater income inequality, with the impact being particularly pronounced in emerging and developing economies. Integrating tax policies, trade openness, and GDP growth into the analysis indicates the limitations of relying solely on economic growth to achieve equity. The research highlights taxation and trade as effective levers for mitigating inequality and raises important questions about the role of innovation in this dynamic. Conclusion This study shows the interaction between market power and inequality across diverse economic systems. We examine how factors like market concentration and institutional quality drive inequality provides practical insights and policy recommendations for effectively addressing income disparities.

                Background Shaken Baby Syndrome describes serious cranial trauma inflicted upon infants and young children, potentially leading to significant injury or death. This study aims to evaluate parents' knowledge and attitudes regarding Shaken Baby Syndrome in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Al-Ahsa, focusing on all reachable parents of young children by using convenience sampling from June 2024 to August 2024, and data was collected using a pre-structured questionnaire. Results A total of 572 eligible parents participated, with ages ranging from 20 to over 40 years. The predominant gender of responders was female, comprising 433 (75.7%). A significant proportion of participants 432 (75.5%) displayed poor overall knowledge of Shaken Baby Syndrome, whereas 140 (24.5%) indicated competent knowledge and awareness. Female gender and parents with multiple children had a significant correlation with parents' understanding of Shaken Baby Syndrome (P< 0.05). Conclusion The study indicated that only around one-quarter of parents demonstrated a competent comprehension of Shaken Baby Syndrome, with mothers exhibiting more awareness. Consequently, health authorities must increase efforts to enhance public awareness of Shaken Baby Syndrome.

                The WWC1 (KIBRA) gene has been repeatedly implicated in cognitive performance, with carriers of the favorable allele showing enhanced episodic memory, spatial ability, and achievements in chess and STEM fields. However, gene-level associations do not reveal the underlying biological mechanisms. Here, we applied a modern proteomic assay coupled with an AI-based protein complex quantification method to elucidate the protein interaction phenotype involving WWC1 in a Scottish cohort (Viking Genes; N = 200). Although the bulk plasma level of WWC1 was not significantly associated with cognitive g factor, several WWC1-containing protein complexes, including the DDR1-WWC1 and the DDR1-PRKCZ-WWC1 complex scores, demonstrated significant associations with cognitive performance. In particular, one standard deviation increase in the normalized DDR1-WWC1 complex score corresponded to about 14% decrease in cognitive g factor (P = 0.024), even with educational attainment adjusted. These findings validate previous genetic studies and highlight the importance of protein-protein interactions in mediating the cognitive effects of WWC1.

                <p>by Jan Babič, Tjasa Kunavar, Erhan Oztop, Mitsuo Kawato</p>

Our study explores how ecological aspects of motor learning enhance survival by improving movement efficiency and mitigating injury risks during task failures. Traditional motor control theories mainly address isolated body movements and often overlook these ecological factors. We introduce a novel computational motor control approach, incorporating ecological fitness and a strategy that alternates between success-driven movement efficiency and failure-driven safety, akin to win-stay/lose-shift tactics. In our experiments, participants performed squat-to-stand movements under novel force perturbations. They adapted effectively through various adaptive motor control mechanisms to avoid falls, reducing failure rates rapidly. The results indicate a high-level ecological controller in human motor learning that switches objectives between safety and movement efficiency, depending on failure or success. This approach is supported by policy learning, internal model adaptation, and adaptive feedback control. Our findings offer a comprehensive perspective on human motor control, integrating risk management in a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for real-world environments.

                <p>by Debby D. Wang, Yuting Huang</p>

With a burgeoning number of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in various fields, biomolecular science has also given a big welcome to advanced AI techniques in recent years. In this broad field, scoring a protein-ligand binding structure to output the binding strength is a crucial problem that heavily relates to computational drug discovery. Aiming at this problem, we have proposed an efficient scoring framework using deep learning techniques. This framework describes a binding structure by a high-resolution atomic graph, places a focus on the inter-molecular interactions and learns the graph in a rational way. For a protein-ligand binding complex, the generated atomic graph reserves key information of the atoms (as graph nodes), and focuses on inter-molecular interactions (as graph edges) that can be identified by introducing multiple distance ranges to the atom pairs within the binding area. To provide more confidence in the predicted binding strengths, we have interpreted the deep learning model from the model level and in a post-hoc analysis. The proposed learning framework has been demonstrated to have competitive performances in scoring and screening tasks, which will prospectively promote the development of related fields further.

                <p>by Xiaoxiao Cheng, Shixian Shen, Ekaterina Ivanova, Gerolamo Carboni, Atsushi Takagi, Etienne Burdet</p>

Humans activate muscles to shape the mechanical interaction with their environment, but can they harness this control mechanism to best sense the environment? We investigated how participants adapt their muscle activation to visual and haptic information when tracking a randomly moving target with a robotic interface. The results exhibit a differentiated effect of these sensory modalities, where participants’ muscle coactivation increases with the haptic noise and decreases with the visual noise, in apparent contradiction to previous results. These results can be explained when considering muscle spring-like mechanics, where stiffness increases with coactivation to regulate motion guidance. Increasing coactivation to more closely follow the motion plan favors accurate visual over haptic information, while decreasing it filters visual noise and relies more on accurate haptic information. We formulated this active sensing mechanism as the optimization of visuo-haptic information and effort. This optimal information and effort (OIE) model can explain the adaptation of muscle activity to unimodal and multimodal sensory information when interacting with fixed or dynamic environments, or with another human, and can be used to optimize human-robot interaction.

Molecular docking is a useful method for predicting the binding affinity and conformation of small chemical entities to support lead optimisation. It is also used to virtually screen a large chemical database to find new chemical entities. There are several docking programs available with different algorithms and varying preparation steps. We identify ten quick tips that apply to molecular docking irrespective of the program one might choose. Our objective is to provide the beginners with important things to keep in mind while using molecular docking for their research. We aim to ensure that experts and beginners can perform molecular docking to yield biologically relevant and reproducible results.

                <p>by Yuru Song, Marcus K. Benna</p>

Cortical neurons often establish multiple synaptic contacts with the same postsynaptic neuron. To avoid functional redundancy of these parallel synapses, it is crucial that each synapse exhibits distinct computational properties. Here we model the current to the soma contributed by each synapse as a sigmoidal transmission function of its presynaptic input, with learnable parameters such as amplitude, slope, and threshold. We evaluate the classification capacity of a neuron equipped with such nonlinear parallel synapses, and show that with a small number of parallel synapses per axon, it substantially exceeds that of the Perceptron. Furthermore, the number of correctly classified data points can increase superlinearly as the number of presynaptic axons grows.
When training with an unrestricted number of parallel synapses, our model neuron can effectively implement an arbitrary aggregate transmission function for each axon, constrained only by monotonicity. Nevertheless, successful learning in the model neuron often requires only a small number of parallel synapses.
We also apply these parallel synapses in a feedforward neural network trained to classify MNIST images, and show that they can increase the test accuracy. This demonstrates that multiple nonlinear synapses per input axon can substantially enhance a neuron’s computational power.

A new study by Suchak et al. describes a sudden, recent explosion in papers analyzing the NHANES health dataset, where similar manuscripts have been described as overwhelming processes at some journals. In this accompanying Primer article, we summarize the study's findings and recommendations. We outline practical steps that publishers, journals, peer reviewers and readers can take to better recognize similarly formulaic, low-value submissions and publications to reduce their research impacts.

                Ongoing digitalization and data-driven developments in materials science and engineering (MSE) emphasize the growing importance of reusing research data and enabling machine accessibility, which requires robust data management and consistent semantic data representation. Ontologies have emerged as powerful tools for establishing interoperable and reusable data structures from inconsistent data structures. Despite advancements in semantic data representation for specific applications, integrating application ontologies with primary data repositories, such as electronic lab notebooks (ELNs), to feed world data remains an open task. As a use case in the MSE domain, this work presents a system based on semantic technologies from the point of view of engineers, developed with the help of information scientists, and unraveled on a small scale. The development of an application ontology (AO) was elaborated for flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) processes with the implementation of a data pipeline. The proposed FSP application ontology emerges from experimental in-house best-practice procedures and is adapted to the mid-level Project Material Digital core ontology (PMDco) to allow interoperability within the MSE domain. The pipeline retrieves manually acquired experimental data from an ELN, translates it into a machine-actionable format, and converts it into a Resource Description Framework (RDF) format to support semantic interoperability. The latter was stored in a triple store with a SPARQL interface, enabling findable and accessible datasets that are searchable and traceable. By creating semantically linked data structures in line with FAIR principles, this approach allows traceable and findable experimental results between stakeholders through both human-readable and machine-actionable formats. Seamless integration of the modular microservices of the data pipeline within established lab practices minimizes disruption while maintaining the software framework. The present work demonstrates the practical implementation of a FAIR data pipeline within a laboratory setting, paving the way for future data-centric science.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-482/v1?src=rss">The perceived barriers to data sharing in health and life sciences: a survey at the University of Bristol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Sharing research data is critical for study validation and reuse, yet challenges persist across disciplines, such as psychology1 and biomedical science2. While global initiatives promote open science, understanding localized barriers in specific academic contexts is vital to implementing effective solutions. Objective To investigate the main perceived barriers and reasons preventing data sharing within the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences (FHLS) at the University of Bristol, a research-intensive university in the UK. Methods We distributed a comprehensive survey to FHLS researchers, addressing logistical, technical, and cultural challenges. A total of 143 participants provided insights into their experiences with data sharing. Results The primary obstacles identified were time constraints and the complexity of the preparation process, with 34% reporting they “usually” or “always” lack sufficient time to adequately prepare their data for sharing. Additional barriers included not having the rights to share (27%), insufficient technical support (15%), and limited incentives within research teams. Moreover, qualitative responses highlighted a lack of confidence in data sharing infrastructure and guidance. Conclusions These findings highlight the importance of targeted interventions to enhance data-sharing practices. Solutions should prioritize data preparation processes, clarify data ownership policies, and offer tailored training programs. Integrating data-sharing requirements into research workflows from the outset could significantly alleviate these challenges. Our study provides actionable recommendations to inform the development of resources and infrastructure that support a culture of open science within the FHLS at the University of Bristol.
