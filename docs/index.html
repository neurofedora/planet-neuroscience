Abstract: Mougenot and Matheson (2024) make a compelling case for the development of a mechanistic cognitive neuroscience that is embodied. However, their analysis of extant work under this header plays down important distinctions between "minimal" and "radical" embodiment. The former remains firmly neurocentric and therefore has limited potential to move the needle in understanding the functional contributions of neural dynamics to cognition in the context of wider organism-environment dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02087">HyperBrain: Anomaly Detection for Temporal Hypergraph Brain Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.02087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying unusual brain activity is a crucial task in neuroscience research, as it aids in the early detection of brain disorders. It is common to represent brain networks as graphs, and researchers have developed various graph-based machine learning methods for analyzing them. However, the majority of existing graph learning tools for the brain face a combination of the following three key limitations. First, they focus only on pairwise correlations between regions of the brain, limiting their ability to capture synchronized activity among larger groups of regions. Second, they model the brain network as a static network, overlooking the temporal changes in the brain. Third, most are designed only for classifying brain networks as healthy or disordered, lacking the ability to identify abnormal brain activity patterns linked to biomarkers associated with disorders. To address these issues, we present HyperBrain, an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for temporal hypergraph brain networks. HyperBrain models fMRI time series data as temporal hypergraphs capturing dynamic higher-order interactions. It then uses a novel customized temporal walk (BrainWalk) and neural encodings to detect abnormal co-activations among brain regions. We evaluate the performance of HyperBrain in both synthetic and real-world settings for Autism Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD). HyperBrain outperforms all other baselines on detecting abnormal co-activations in brain networks. Furthermore, results obtained from HyperBrain are consistent with clinical research on these brain disorders. Our findings suggest that learning temporal and higher-order connections in the brain provides a promising approach to uncover intricate connectivity patterns in brain networks, offering improved diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02094">Tracking objects that change in appearance with phase synchrony</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.02094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objects we encounter often change appearance as we interact with them. Changes in illumination (shadows), object pose, or movement of nonrigid objects can drastically alter available image features. How do biological visual systems track objects as they change? It may involve specific attentional mechanisms for reasoning about the locations of objects independently of their appearances -- a capability that prominent neuroscientific theories have associated with computing through neural synchrony. We computationally test the hypothesis that the implementation of visual attention through neural synchrony underlies the ability of biological visual systems to track objects that change in appearance over time. We first introduce a novel deep learning circuit that can learn to precisely control attention to features separately from their location in the world through neural synchrony: the complex-valued recurrent neural network (CV-RNN). Next, we compare object tracking in humans, the CV-RNN, and other deep neural networks (DNNs), using FeatureTracker: a large-scale challenge that asks observers to track objects as their locations and appearances change in precisely controlled ways. While humans effortlessly solved FeatureTracker, state-of-the-art DNNs did not. In contrast, our CV-RNN behaved similarly to humans on the challenge, providing a computational proof-of-concept for the role of phase synchronization as a neural substrate for tracking appearance-morphing objects as they move about.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02430">Predictive Attractor Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.02430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential memory, the ability to form and accurately recall a sequence of events or stimuli in the correct order, is a fundamental prerequisite for biological and artificial intelligence as it underpins numerous cognitive functions (e.g., language comprehension, planning, episodic memory formation, etc.) However, existing methods of sequential memory suffer from catastrophic forgetting, limited capacity, slow iterative learning procedures, low-order Markov memory, and, most importantly, the inability to represent and generate multiple valid future possibilities stemming from the same context. Inspired by biologically plausible neuroscience theories of cognition, we propose \textit{Predictive Attractor Models (PAM)}, a novel sequence memory architecture with desirable generative properties. PAM is a streaming model that learns a sequence in an online, continuous manner by observing each input \textit{only once}. Additionally, we find that PAM avoids catastrophic forgetting by uniquely representing past context through lateral inhibition in cortical minicolumns, which prevents new memories from overwriting previously learned knowledge. PAM generates future predictions by sampling from a union set of predicted possibilities; this generative ability is realized through an attractor model trained alongside the predictor. We show that PAM is trained with local computations through Hebbian plasticity rules in a biologically plausible framework. Other desirable traits (e.g., noise tolerance, CPU-based learning, capacity scaling) are discussed throughout the paper. Our findings suggest that PAM represents a significant step forward in the pursuit of biologically plausible and computationally efficient sequential memory models, with broad implications for cognitive science and artificial intelligence research.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02555">Toward Neuronal Implementations of Delayed Optimal Control</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.02555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Animal sensorimotor behavior is frequently modeled using optimal controllers. However, it is unclear how the neuronal circuits within the animal's nervous system implement optimal controller-like behavior. In this work, we study the question of implementing a delayed linear quadratic regulator with linear dynamical "neurons" on a muscle model. We show that for any second-order controller, there are three minimal neural circuit configurations that implement the same controller. Furthermore, the firing rate characteristics of each circuit can vary drastically, even as the overall controller behavior is preserved. Along the way, we introduce concepts that bridge controller realizations to neural implementations that are compatible with known neuronal delay structures.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00712">NECOMIMI: Neural-Cognitive Multimodal EEG-informed Image Generation with Diffusion Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.00712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NECOMIMI (NEural-COgnitive MultImodal EEG-Informed Image Generation with Diffusion Models) introduces a novel framework for generating images directly from EEG signals using advanced diffusion models. Unlike previous works that focused solely on EEG-image classification through contrastive learning, NECOMIMI extends this task to image generation. The proposed NERV EEG encoder demonstrates state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance across multiple zero-shot classification tasks, including 2-way, 4-way, and 200-way, and achieves top results in our newly proposed Category-based Assessment Table (CAT) Score, which evaluates the quality of EEG-generated images based on semantic concepts. A key discovery of this work is that the model tends to generate abstract or generalized images, such as landscapes, rather than specific objects, highlighting the inherent challenges of translating noisy and low-resolution EEG data into detailed visual outputs. Additionally, we introduce the CAT Score as a new metric tailored for EEG-to-image evaluation and establish a benchmark on the ThingsEEG dataset. This study underscores the potential of EEG-to-image generation while revealing the complexities and challenges that remain in bridging neural activity with visual representation.

                arXiv:2212.00596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretrained language models have been shown to significantly predict brain recordings of people comprehending language. Recent work suggests that the prediction of the next word is a key mechanism that contributes to this alignment. What is not yet understood is whether prediction of the next word is necessary for this observed alignment or simply sufficient, and whether there are other shared mechanisms or information that are similarly important. In this work, we take a step towards understanding the reasons for brain alignment via two simple perturbations in popular pretrained language models. These perturbations help us design contrasts that can control for different types of information. By contrasting the brain alignment of these differently perturbed models, we show that improvements in alignment with brain recordings are due to more than improvements in next-word prediction and word-level information.

Abstract: In multistable dynamical systems driven by weak Gaussian noise, transitions between competing states are often assumed to pass via a saddle on the separating basin boundary. By contrast, we show that timescale separation can cause saddle avoidance in non-gradient systems. Using toy models from neuroscience and ecology, we study cases where sample transitions deviate strongly from the instanton predicted by Freidlin-Wentzell theory, even for weak finite noise. We attribute this to a flat quasipotential and present an approach based on the Onsager-Machlup action to aptly predict transition paths.

                arXiv:2410.02011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the Target Set Selection (TSS) Problem in social networks, a fundamental problem in viral marketing. In the TSS problem, a graph and a threshold value for each vertex of the graph are given. We need to find a minimum size vertex subset to "activate" such that all graph vertices are activated at the end of the propagation process. Specifically, we propose a novel approach called "a census-based genetic algorithm" for the TSS problem. In our algorithm, we use the idea of a census to gather and store information about each individual in a population and collect census data from the individuals constructed during the algorithm's execution so that we can achieve greater diversity and avoid premature convergence at locally optimal solutions. We use two distinct census information: (a) for each individual, the algorithm stores how many times it has been identified during the execution (b) for each network node, the algorithm counts how many times it has been included in a solution. The proposed algorithm can also self-adjust by using a parameter specifying the aggressiveness employed in each reproduction method. Additionally, the algorithm is designed to run in a parallelized environment to minimize the computational cost and check each individual's feasibility. Moreover, our algorithm finds the optimal solution in all cases while experimenting on random graphs. Furthermore, we execute the proposed algorithm on 14 large graphs of real-life social network instances from the literature, improving around 9.57 solution size (on average) and 134 vertices (in total) compared to the best solutions obtained in previous studies.

                arXiv:2410.02301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization is a common problem in practical applications, and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is considered as one of the effective methods to solve these problems. However, their randomness sometimes prevents algorithms from rapidly converging to global optimization, and the design of their genetic operators often requires complicated manual tuning. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a new framework that combines a large language model (LLM) with traditional evolutionary algorithms to enhance the algorithm's search capability and generalization performance.In our framework, we employ adaptive and hybrid mechanisms to integrate the LLM with the MOEA, thereby accelerating algorithmic convergence. Specifically, we leverage an auxiliary evaluation function and automated prompt construction within the adaptive mechanism to flexibly adjust the utilization of the LLM, generating high-quality solutions that are further refined and optimized through genetic operators.Concurrently, the hybrid mechanism aims to minimize interaction costs with the LLM as much as possible.

                arXiv:2410.02543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a convergence of machine learning and biology, we reveal that diffusion models are evolutionary algorithms. By considering evolution as a denoising process and reversed evolution as diffusion, we mathematically demonstrate that diffusion models inherently perform evolutionary algorithms, naturally encompassing selection, mutation, and reproductive isolation. Building on this equivalence, we propose the Diffusion Evolution method: an evolutionary algorithm utilizing iterative denoising -- as originally introduced in the context of diffusion models -- to heuristically refine solutions in parameter spaces. Unlike traditional approaches, Diffusion Evolution efficiently identifies multiple optimal solutions and outperforms prominent mainstream evolutionary algorithms. Furthermore, leveraging advanced concepts from diffusion models, namely latent space diffusion and accelerated sampling, we introduce Latent Space Diffusion Evolution, which finds solutions for evolutionary tasks in high-dimensional complex parameter space while significantly reducing computational steps. This parallel between diffusion and evolution not only bridges two different fields but also opens new avenues for mutual enhancement, raising questions about open-ended evolution and potentially utilizing non-Gaussian or discrete diffusion models in the context of Diffusion Evolution.

                arXiv:2410.01847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical time series datasets feature missing values that need data imputation methods, however, conventional machine learning models fall short due to a lack of uncertainty quantification in predictions. Among these models, the CATSI (Context-Aware Time Series Imputation) stands out for its effectiveness by incorporating a context vector into the imputation process, capturing the global dependencies of each patient. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Context-Aware Time Series Imputation (Bayes-CATSI) framework which leverages uncertainty quantification offered by variational inference. We consider the time series derived from electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiology (EKG). Variational Inference assumes the shape of the posterior distribution and through minimization of the Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence it finds variational densities that are closest to the true posterior distribution. Thus , we integrate the variational Bayesian deep learning layers into the CATSI model. Our results show that Bayes-CATSI not only provides uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior imputation performance compared to the CATSI model. Specifically, an instance of Bayes-CATSI outperforms CATSI by 9.57 %. We provide an open-source code implementation for applying Bayes-CATSI to other medical data imputation problems.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation and healthcare diagnostics are among the many fields where the reliability and security of machine learning models for image data are critical. We conduct a comprehensive investigation into the susceptibility of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are widely used for image data, to white-box adversarial attacks. We investigate the effects of various sophisticated attacks -- Fast Gradient Sign Method, Basic Iterative Method, Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack, Carlini & Wagner, Projected Gradient Descent, and DeepFool -- on CNN performance metrics, (e.g., loss, accuracy), the differential efficacy of adversarial techniques in increasing error rates, the relationship between perceived image quality metrics (e.g., ERGAS, PSNR, SSIM, and SAM) and classification performance, and the comparative effectiveness of iterative versus single-step attacks. Using the MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Fashio_MNIST datasets, we explore the effect of different attacks on the CNNs performance metrics by varying the hyperparameters of CNNs. Our study provides insights into the robustness of CNNs against adversarial threats, pinpoints vulnerabilities, and underscores the urgent need for developing robust defense mechanisms to protect CNNs and ensuring their trustworthy deployment in real-world scenarios.

                arXiv:2410.02249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event-based cameras are attracting significant interest as they provide rich edge information, high dynamic range, and high temporal resolution. Many state-of-the-art event-based algorithms rely on splitting the events into fixed groups, resulting in the omission of crucial temporal information, particularly when dealing with diverse motion scenarios (e.g., high/low speed). In this work, we propose SpikeSlicer, a novel-designed plug-and-play event processing method capable of splitting events stream adaptively. SpikeSlicer utilizes a lightweight (0.41M) and low-energy spiking neural network (SNN) to trigger event slicing. To guide the SNN to fire spikes at optimal time steps, we propose the Spiking Position-aware Loss (SPA-Loss) to modulate the neuron's state. Additionally, we develop a Feedback-Update training strategy that refines the slicing decisions using feedback from the downstream artificial neural network (ANN). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method yields significant performance improvements in event-based object tracking and recognition. Notably, SpikeSlicer provides a brand-new SNN-ANN cooperation paradigm, where the SNN acts as an efficient, low-energy data processor to assist the ANN in improving downstream performance, injecting new perspectives and potential avenues of exploration.

                arXiv:2410.02536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the emergence of intelligent behavior in artificial systems by investigating how the complexity of rule-based systems influences the capabilities of models trained to predict these rules. Our study focuses on elementary cellular automata (ECA), simple yet powerful one-dimensional systems that generate behaviors ranging from trivial to highly complex. By training distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) on different ECAs, we evaluated the relationship between the complexity of the rules' behavior and the intelligence exhibited by the LLMs, as reflected in their performance on downstream tasks. Our findings reveal that rules with higher complexity lead to models exhibiting greater intelligence, as demonstrated by their performance on reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. Both uniform and periodic systems, and often also highly chaotic systems, resulted in poorer downstream performance, highlighting a sweet spot of complexity conducive to intelligence. We conjecture that intelligence arises from the ability to predict complexity and that creating intelligence may require only exposure to complexity.

                arXiv:2405.15429v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks excel at modeling pairwise interactions, but they cannot flexibly accommodate higher-order interactions and features. Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged recently as a promising tool for addressing this issue. TDL enables the principled modeling of arbitrary multi-way, hierarchical higher-order interactions by operating on combinatorial topological spaces, such as simplicial or cell complexes, instead of graphs. However, little is known about how to leverage geometric features such as positions and velocities for TDL. This paper introduces E(n)-Equivariant Topological Neural Networks (ETNNs), which are E(n)-equivariant message-passing networks operating on combinatorial complexes, formal objects unifying graphs, hypergraphs, simplicial, path, and cell complexes. ETNNs incorporate geometric node features while respecting rotation, reflection, and translation equivariance. Moreover, ETNNs are natively ready for settings with heterogeneous interactions. We provide a theoretical analysis to show the improved expressiveness of ETNNs over architectures for geometric graphs. We also show how E(n)-equivariant variants of TDL models can be directly derived from our framework. The broad applicability of ETNNs is demonstrated through two tasks of vastly different scales: i) molecular property prediction on the QM9 benchmark and ii) land-use regression for hyper-local estimation of air pollution with multi-resolution irregular geospatial data. The results indicate that ETNNs are an effective tool for learning from diverse types of richly structured data, as they match or surpass SotA equivariant TDL models with a significantly smaller computational burden, thus highlighting the benefits of a principled geometric inductive bias.

Abstract: It's widely expected that humanity will someday create AI systems vastly more intelligent than us, leading to the unsolved alignment problem of "how to control superintelligence." However, this problem is not only self-contradictory but likely unsolvable. Unfortunately, current control-based strategies for solving it inevitably embed dangerous representations of distrust. If superintelligence can't trust humanity, then we can't fully trust it to reliably follow safety controls it can likely bypass. Not only will intended permanent control fail to keep us safe, but it may even trigger the extinction event many fear. A logical rationale is therefore presented that advocates a strategic pivot from control-induced distrust to foundational AI alignment modeling instinct-based representations of familial mutual trust. With current AI already representing distrust of human intentions, the Supertrust meta-strategy is proposed to prevent long-term foundational misalignment and ensure superintelligence is instead driven by intrinsic trust-based patterns, leading to safe and protective coexistence.

                <p>Despite decades of preclinical investigation, there remains limited understanding of the etiology and biological underpinnings of anxiety disorders. Sensitivity to potential threat is characteristic of anxiety-like behavior in humans and rodents, but traditional rodent behavioral tasks aimed to assess threat responsiveness lack translational value, especially with regard to emotionally valenced stimuli. Therefore, development of novel preclinical approaches to serve as analogues to patient assessments is needed. In humans, the fearful face task is widely used to test responsiveness to socially communicated threat signals. In rats, ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are analogous social cues associated with positive or negative affective states that can elicit behavioral changes in the receiver. It is therefore likely that when rats hear aversive alarm call USVs (22&nbsp;kHz), they evoke translatable changes in brain activity comparable with the fearful face task. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in male and female rats to assess changes in BOLD activity induced by exposure to aversive 22&nbsp;kHz alarm calls emitted in response to threatening stimuli, prosocial (55&nbsp;kHz) USVs emitted in response to appetitive stimuli, or a computer-generated 22&nbsp;kHz tone. Results show patterns of regional activation that are specific to each USV stimulus. Notably, limbic regions clinically relevant to psychiatric disorders (e.g., amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) are preferentially activated by either aversive 22&nbsp;kHz or appetitive 55&nbsp;kHz USVs. These results support the use of USV playback as a promising translational tool to investigate affective processing under conditions of distal threat in preclinical rat models.</p>

                <p>Human and mouse dorsal root ganglia (hDRG and mDRG) neurons are important tools in understanding the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms that underlie nociception and drive pain behaviors. One of the simplest differences in firing phenotypes is that neurons are single-firing (exhibit only one action potential) or multi-firing (exhibit 2 or more action potentials). To determine if single- and multi-firing hDRG neurons exhibit differences in intrinsic properties, firing phenotypes, and AP waveform properties, and if these properties could be used to predict multi-firing, we measured 22 electrophysiological properties by whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology of 94 hDRG neurons from six male and four female donors. We then analyzed the data using several machine learning models to determine if these properties could be used to predict multi-firing. We used 1,000 iterations of Monte Carlo cross-validation to split the data into different train and test sets and tested the logistic regression, <I>k</I>-nearest neighbors, random forest, support vector classifier, and XGBoost machine learning models. All models tested had a &gt;80% accuracy on average, with support vector classifier, and XGBoost performing the best. We found that several properties correlated with multi-firing hDRG neurons and together could be used to predict multi-firing neurons in hDRG including a long decay time, a low rheobase, and long first spike latency. We also found that the hDRG models were able to predict multi-firing with 90% accuracy in mDRG neurons. Understanding these properties could be beneficial in the elucidation of targets on peripheral sensory neurons related to pain.</p>

                This case report presents a case of infected corneal laceration with traumatic endophthalmitis in a pediatric patient. A boy in his middle childhood sustained an ocular injury with scissors, resulting in a full-thickness corneal laceration and infection. Despite the delay in seeking treatment, the patient underwent successful surgical interventions, including corneal scraping, pars plana lensectomy, vitrectomy, and secondary intraocular lens implantation (IOL). The infection was managed with targeted antibiotics, and Staphylococcus aureus was confirmed as the causative organism. Remarkably, these efforts led to a satisfactory improvement in the patient’s vision to 20/50. This case underscores the importance of early intervention and a multidisciplinary approach in the management of pediatric ocular trauma to optimize outcomes.

                Background This study investigated the determinants of community preventive behavior in complying with the Indonesian regulations to prevent COVID-19 local transmission. Methods A cross-sectional study used to collect the data via an online cross using a form created from a google questionnaire forms. A total of 1,802 respondents were gathered at a single point in time. The authors used the Health Belief Model (HBM) approach to measure and create a model for the prevention of local transmission of COVID-19. Results This study found that more than half of the respondents still had low perceived susceptibility (16%) and severity (43%). There were only 3% respondents with perceived barriers and 19% with strong self-efficacy. The findings showed that self-efficacy and perceived barriers had statistically significant relationships with preventive behavior (p-value <0.05). The goodness of fit index showed that the proposed model was not fit for the data (RMSE<0.080, GFI>0.950, AGFI>0.950, SRMR<0.100), which means that it was not fit to describe the empirical phenomenon under study. Conclusions This study found that more than half of the respondents still had low perceived susceptibility (84%) and severity (67%), but more than half had high perceived benefits (54%). Only a few respondents had significant barriers to implementing COVID-19 transmission prevention behaviours (3%). Still, most respondents had low perceived self-efficacy (81%), and only 60% had good behaviours related to COVID-19 prevention. In the context of COVID-19 preventive behaviour, we recommended to improve perceived susceptibility and severity by providing the correct information (which contain information about how people susceptible to the virus and the impact of infected by the virus) with the local cultural context.

                Abstract* Background A positive exercise stress test (EST) is common among pilots, and it may indicate a greater risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). This study aimed to determine the incidence of recurrently positive EST and their predictors among civilian pilots in Indonesia. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study among civilian pilots who had the first positive EST test between January 2019 and June 2020 at the Aviation Medical Center, Jakarta. The data were retrieved from medical records. Subjects were included if there were data on subsequent ESTs at 6 and 12 months. Risk factors included total flight hours (TFH) in the last 6 months, license type, aircraft cabin pressurization system, flying limitation such as multicrew, cardiac intervention, age, smoking habit, family history of coronary artery disease, body mass index, blood pressure levels, lipid profile, and fasting blood glucose. Results Eighty-seven pilots were included; 54 of them (62.1%) had recurrent positive ESTs. All subjects were men, and the median age was 51 (range 40-64) years. Independent predictors of recurrent positive ESTs were age 60-65 years (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj]: 5.1, 95% CI: 1.12–23.16, p= 0.035), a TFH of > 275 hours (ORadj 5.1, 95% CI: 1.28–20.65, p= 0.021), and dyslipidemia (ORadj: 4.2 95% CI: 1.468–12.275, p=0.015). Having these three risk factors increased the probability of a recurrent positive EST up to 100%. Conclusion The incidence of recurrently positive ESTs among civilian pilots in Indonesia was high. Airlines may want to implement a more aggressive health policy for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases among their pilots.

                Introduction Spontaneous tendon ruptures in end stage kidney disease patients have the potential to cause long- term morbidity, and timely intervention is required to prevent complications that can severely affect the functional status of the patient Case presentation A series of six tendons (two triceps tendons and two bilateral quadriceps tendons) in three patients with ESKD undergoing hemodialysis is discussed in this case series. Patients were aged 61, 44 and 26 years, and on hemodialysis for 5, 5 and 10 years, respectively. Conclusion End -stage kidney disease is associated with a multitude of physiological changes, and the musculoskeletal system is no exception to this. Spontaneous tendon rupture is a multifactorial complication of ESKD, with serious implications for mobility and quality of life. As a result, these patients require a multifaceted approach to ensure optimum results and an early return to activity. We report a series of 6 spontaneous tendon ruptures in 3 patients with ESKD at our institution. We would like to outline the methods of repair for each case and further attempt to assess biochemical parameters that may have contributed to the disease process.

                Purpose Detailed reports of the assessments used in rehabilitation wards are lacking. This study aimed to examine the common evaluations used in rehabilitation wards and discuss the necessary assessments for treatment plans and patient management. Methods We conducted a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and Ichushi Web for articles published between June 2013 and June 2023. The study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered with PROSPERO. Data extraction and blind selection were performed, and a consensus was reached among experts in case of conflicts. Results We identified 220 studies, 31 meeting the inclusion criteria post-screening. The Functional Independence Measure was the most used assessment (96.8%), followed by grip strength (32.3%) and the 10-m walk test (9.7%). Other assessments included the Stroke Impairment Assessment Set, Short Physical Performance Battery, and Timed Up and Go Test. Although fall-related incidents are frequent, significantly affecting patient outcomes in rehabilitation units, balance assessments were underutilized. Conclusions Although the FIM is an extensively used assessment in rehabilitation wards, balance assessments critical for fall prevention are significantly underused. Therefore, these assessment tools should be evaluated in future research and clinical practice.

                <p>by Chenxi Liao, Masataka Sawayama, Bei Xiao</p>

We can visually discriminate and recognize a wide range of materials. Meanwhile, we use language to describe what we see and communicate relevant information about the materials. Here, we investigate the relationship between visual judgment and language expression to understand how visual features relate to semantic representations in human cognition. We use deep generative models to generate images of realistic materials. Interpolating between the generative models enables us to systematically create material appearances in both well-defined and ambiguous categories. Using these stimuli, we compared the representations of materials from two behavioral tasks: visual material similarity judgments and free-form verbal descriptions. Our findings reveal a moderate but significant correlation between vision and language on a categorical level. However, analyzing the representations with an unsupervised alignment method, we discover structural differences that arise at the image-to-image level, especially among ambiguous materials morphed between known categories. Moreover, visual judgments exhibit more individual differences compared to verbal descriptions. Our results show that while verbal descriptions capture material qualities on the coarse level, they may not fully convey the visual nuances of material appearances. Analyzing the image representation of materials obtained from various pre-trained deep neural networks, we find that similarity structures in human visual judgments align more closely with those of the vision-language models than purely vision-based models. Our work illustrates the need to consider the vision-language relationship in building a comprehensive model for material perception. Moreover, we propose a novel framework for evaluating the alignment and misalignment between representations from different modalities, leveraging information from human behaviors and computational models.

                <p>by Fuyin Yang, Hao Zhu, Xinyi Cao, Hui Li, Xinyu Fang, Lingfang Yu, Siqi Li, Zenan Wu, Chunbo Li, Chen Zhang, Xing Tian</p>

Distinguishing reality from hallucinations requires efficient monitoring of agency. It has been hypothesized that a copy of motor signals, termed <i>efference copy (EC)</i> or <i>corollary discharge (CD)</i>, suppresses sensory responses to yield a sense of agency; impairment of the inhibitory function leads to hallucinations. However, how can the sole absence of inhibition yield positive symptoms of hallucinations? We hypothesize that selective impairments in functionally distinct signals of <i>CD</i> and <i>EC</i> during motor-to-sensory transformation cause the positive symptoms of hallucinations. In an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment with a delayed articulation paradigm in schizophrenic patients with (AVHs) and without auditory verbal hallucinations (non-AVHs), we found that preparing to speak without knowing the contents (general preparation) did not suppress auditory responses in both patient groups, suggesting the absent of inhibitory function of <i>CD</i>. Whereas, preparing to speak a syllable (specific preparation) enhanced the auditory responses to the prepared syllable in non-AVHs, whereas AVHs showed enhancement in responses to unprepared syllables, opposite to the observations in the normal population, suggesting that the enhancement function of <i>EC</i> is not precise in AVHs. A computational model with a virtual lesion of an inhibitory inter-neuron and disproportional sensitization of auditory cortices fitted the empirical data and further quantified the distinct impairments in motor-to-sensory transformation in AVHs. These results suggest that “broken” <i>CD</i> plus “noisy” <i>EC</i> causes erroneous monitoring of the imprecise generation of internal auditory representation and yields auditory hallucinations. Specific impairments in functional granularity of motor-to-sensory transformation mediate positivity symptoms of agency abnormality in mental disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002827">MMTV RNA packaging requires an extended long-range interaction for productive Gag binding to packaging signals</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Suresha G. Prabhu, Vineeta N. Pillai, Lizna Mohamed Ali, Valérie Vivet-Boudou, Akhil Chameettachal, Serena Bernacchi, Farah Mustafa, Roland Marquet, Tahir A. Rizvi</p>

The packaging of genomic RNA (gRNA) into retroviral particles relies on the specific recognition by the Gag precursor of packaging signals (<i>Psi</i>), which maintain a complex secondary structure through long-range interactions (LRIs). However, it remains unclear whether the binding of Gag to <i>Psi</i> alone is enough to promote RNA packaging and what role LRIs play in this process. Using mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), we investigated the effects of mutations in 4 proposed LRIs on gRNA structure and function. Our findings revealed the presence of an unsuspected extended LRI, and hSHAPE revealed that maintaining a wild-type–like <i>Psi</i> structure is crucial for efficient packaging. Surprisingly, filter-binding assays demonstrated that most mutants, regardless of their packaging capability, exhibited significant binding to Pr77<sup>Gag</sup>, suggesting that Gag binding to <i>Psi</i> is insufficient for efficient packaging. Footprinting experiments indicated that efficient RNA packaging is promoted when Pr77<sup>Gag</sup> binds to 2 specific sites within <i>Psi</i>, whereas binding elsewhere in <i>Psi</i> does not lead to efficient packaging. Taken together, our results suggest that the 3D structure of the <i>Ps</i>i/Pr77<sup>Gag</sup> complex regulates the assembly of viral particles around gRNA, enabling effective discrimination against other viral and cellular RNAs that may also bind Gag efficiently.

                This article provides a comprehensive analysis of knee strengthening post-surgery, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) essential for recovery and performance enhancement. The study delves into the importance of range of motion (ROM), load management through repetitions maximum (RM) and velocity-based training (VBT), speed variations, repetition schemes for hypertrophy and strength, and the assessment of pain, inflammation, and effusion. Emphasis is placed on dynamic alignment, muscle activation, and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) to tailor individualized rehabilitation programs. The integration of these KPIs ensures a balanced approach, enhancing muscle strength and joint integrity while minimizing injury risk. Regular monitoring and adjustments based on these indicators are recommended to optimize outcomes and ensure sustained progress in knee function and overall mobility.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1117/v1?src=rss">Influence of titanium nanoparticles on cytotoxicity and inflammatory cytokines expression in gingival fibroblasts - An in vitro study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Despite the success of titanium (Ti) implants in dental rehabilitation, emerging evidence implicates the release of titanium oxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) from the implant surface as a potential contributor to the initiation of the pathogenic process leading to peri-implantitis and ultimately failure of the implants. However, a comprehensive investigation to elucidate the dose-dependent effects of TiO2NPs on cytotoxicity and inflammatory responses is lacking. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of TiO2NPs on the cytotoxicity and inflammatory cytokine expression in Human Gingival Fibroblasts (HGFs). Methods HGFs were isolated from gingival tissue samples obtained from periodontally and systemically healthy subjects. Ti standard solution for ICP was diluted to create concentrations of (0.001 ppm, 0.01 ppm, 0.1 ppm, 1 ppm, 10 ppm, and 100 ppm) for cell culture media containing titanium. HGFs were then cultured in these varying concentrations for specific time periods (days 1, 3, 5, and 7) to assess cell viability. A cytotoxicity assay was performed to determine the levels and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-12, TGF-β) using qRT-PCR and ELISA techniques. Results Our findings demonstrate a concentration and duration-dependent decrease in HGF viability upon exposure to titanium nanoparticles. Notably, a 50% reduction in cell viability was observed at the highest concentration (100 ppm). qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β and IL-6, in HGFs exposed to titanium. Interestingly, the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-12, and TGF-β) remained comparable or even equivalent compared to controls across different titanium concentrations. Conclusions The study revealed a concentration and duration-dependent influence on HGF viability and cytokine profile, suggesting potential cytotoxicity and modulation of the inflammatory response mediated by TiO2NPs. Further research is necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and their implications for dental implant biocompatibility.

                Here, Schmid et al. develop a series of NTRK fusion-driven GEMMs of pediatric-type glioma. Treatment with TRK kinase inhibitors significantly prolongs survival, but tumors eventually recur due to treatment-resistant persister cells. These tumors upregulate the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways, and MEK inhibition by itself leads to a significant growth inhibition.

                Poschel et al. observed that loss of host PD-L1 function leads to increased inflammation-driven colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. Mechanistically, loss of PD-L1 expands the PD-1+Nrp1loTGFβ+ Treg to recruit IL6+ neutrophils to inhibit CTL activation. PD-L1 therefore functions as a suppressor of inflammation-driven colorectal tumor via restraining PD-1+Nrp1loTGFβ+ Treg cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91598">Peptidoglycan-tethered and free forms of the Braun lipoprotein are in dynamic equilibrium in Escherichia coli</a></h4>

              
                Peptidoglycan (PG) is a giant macromolecule that completely surrounds bacterial cells and prevents lysis in hypo-osmotic environments. This net-like macromolecule is made of glycan strands linked to each other by two types of transpeptidases that form either 4→3 (PBPs) or 3→3 (LDTs) cross-links. Previously, we devised a heavy isotope-based PG full labeling method coupled to mass spectrometry to determine the mode of insertion of new subunits into the expanding PG network (Atze et al., 2022). We showed that PG polymerization operates according to different modes for the formation of the septum and of the lateral cell walls, as well as for bacterial growth in the presence or absence of β-lactams in engineered strains that can exclusively rely on LDTs for PG cross-linking when drugs are present. Here, we apply our method to the resolution of the kinetics of the reactions leading to the covalent tethering of the Braun lipoprotein (Lpp) to PG and the subsequent hydrolysis of that same covalent link. We find that Lpp and disaccharide-peptide subunits are independently incorporated into the expanding lateral cell walls. Newly synthesized septum PG appears to contain small amounts of tethered Lpp. LDTs did mediate intense shuffling of Lpp between PG stems leading to a dynamic equilibrium between the PG-tethered and free forms of Lpp.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95185">Evaluation of Gremlin-1 as a therapeutic target in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis</a></h4>

              
                Gremlin-1 has been implicated in liver fibrosis in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) via inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling and has thereby been identified as a potential therapeutic target. Using rat in vivo and human in vitro and ex vivo model systems of MASH fibrosis, we show that neutralisation of Gremlin-1 activity with monoclonal therapeutic antibodies does not reduce liver inflammation or liver fibrosis. Still, Gremlin-1 was upregulated in human and rat MASH fibrosis, but expression was restricted to a small subpopulation of COL3A1/THY1<sup>+</sup> myofibroblasts. Lentiviral overexpression of Gremlin-1 in LX-2 cells and primary hepatic stellate cells led to changes in BMP-related gene expression, which did not translate to increased fibrogenesis. Furthermore, we show that Gremlin-1 binds to heparin with high affinity, which prevents Gremlin-1 from entering systemic circulation, prohibiting Gremlin-1-mediated organ crosstalk. Overall, our findings suggest a redundant role for Gremlin-1 in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, which is unamenable to therapeutic targeting.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87922">A unique cell division protein critical for the assembly of the bacterial divisome</a></h4>

              
                Identification of unique essential bacterial genes is important for not only the understanding of their cell biology but also the development of new antimicrobials. Here, we report a previously unrecognized core component of the <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> divisome. Our results reveal that the protein, termed Aeg1 interacts with multiple cell division proteins, including FtsN, which is required for components of the divisome to localize to the midcell. We demonstrate that the FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> and FtsB<sub>E65A</sub> mutants effectively bypassed the need of Aeg1 by <i>A. baumannii</i>, as did the activation variants FtsW<sub>M254I</sub> and FtsW<sub>S274G</sub>. Our results suggest that Aeg1 is a cell division protein that arrives at the division site to initiate cell division by recruiting FtsN, which activates FtsQLB and FtsA to induce the septal peptidoglycan synthase FtsWI. The discovery of the new essential cell division protein has provided a new target for the development of antibacterial agents.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93975">An in vitro approach reveals molecular mechanisms underlying endocrine disruptor-induced epimutagenesis</a></h4>

              
                Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) such as bisphenol S (BPS) are xenobiotic compounds that can disrupt endocrine signaling due to steric similarities to endogenous hormones. EDCs have been shown to induce disruptions in normal epigenetic programming (epimutations) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that predispose disease states. Most interestingly, the prevalence of epimutations following exposure to many EDCs persists over multiple generations. Many studies have described direct and prolonged effects of EDC exposure in animal models, but many questions remain about molecular mechanisms by which EDC-induced epimutations are introduced or subsequently propagated, whether there are cell type-specific susceptibilities to the same EDC, and whether this correlates with differential expression of relevant hormone receptors. We exposed cultured pluripotent (iPS), somatic (Sertoli and granulosa), and primordial germ cell-like (PGCLC) cells to BPS and found that differential incidences of BPS-induced epimutations and DEGs correlated with differential expression of relevant hormone receptors inducing epimutations near relevant hormone response elements in somatic and pluripotent, but not germ cell types. Most interestingly, we found that when iPS cells were exposed to BPS and then induced to differentiate into PGCLCs, the prevalence of epimutations and DEGs was largely retained, however, &gt;90% of the specific epimutations and DEGs were replaced by novel epimutations and DEGs. These results suggest a unique mechanism by which an EDC-induced epimutated state may be propagated transgenerationally.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96943">Pectin methylesterase activity is required for RALF1 peptide signalling output</a></h4>

              
                The extracellular matrix plays an integrative role in cellular responses in plants, but its contribution to the signalling of extracellular ligands largely remains to be explored. Rapid alkalinisation factors (RALFs) are extracellular peptide hormones that play pivotal roles in various physiological processes. Here, we address a crucial connection between the de-methylesterification machinery of the cell wall component pectin and RALF1 activity. Pectin is a polysaccharide, contributing to the structural integrity of the cell wall. Our data illustrate that the pharmacological and genetic interference with pectin methyl esterases (PMEs) abolishes RALF1-induced root growth repression. Our data suggest that positively charged RALF1 peptides bind negatively charged, de-methylesterified pectin with high avidity. We illustrate that the RALF1 association with de-methylesterified pectin is required for its FERONIA-dependent perception, contributing to the control of the extracellular matrix and the regulation of plasma membrane dynamics. Notably, this mode of action is independent of the FER-dependent extracellular matrix sensing mechanism provided by FER interaction with the leucine-rich repeat extensin (LRX) proteins. We propose that the methylation status of pectin acts as a contextualizing signalling scaffold for RALF peptides, linking extracellular matrix dynamics to peptide hormone-mediated responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96848">Recording γ-secretase activity in living mouse brains</a></h4>

              
                γ-Secretase plays a pivotal role in the central nervous system. Our recent development of genetically encoded Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors has enabled the spatiotemporal recording of γ-secretase activity on a cell-by-cell basis in live neurons <i>in culture</i>. Nevertheless, how γ-secretase activity is regulated <i>in vivo</i> remains unclear. Here, we employ the near-infrared (NIR) C99 720–670 biosensor and NIR confocal microscopy to quantitatively record γ-secretase activity in individual neurons in living mouse brains. Intriguingly, we uncovered that γ-secretase activity may influence the activity of γ-secretase in neighboring neurons, suggesting a potential ‘cell non-autonomous’ regulation of γ-secretase in mouse brains. Given that γ-secretase plays critical roles in important biological events and various diseases, our new assay <i>in vivo</i> would become a new platform that enables dissecting the essential roles of γ-secretase in normal health and diseases.

                The genetic basis of severe COVID-19 has been thoroughly studied, and many genetic risk factors shared between populations have been identified. However, reduced sample sizes from non-European groups have limited the discovery of population-specific common risk loci. In this second study nested in the SCOURGE consortium, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for COVID-19 hospitalization in admixed Americans, comprising a total of 4702 hospitalized cases recruited by SCOURGE and seven other participating studies in the COVID-19 Host Genetic Initiative. We identified four genome-wide significant associations, two of which constitute novel loci and were first discovered in Latin American populations (<i>BAZ2B</i> and <i>DDIAS</i>). A trans-ethnic meta-analysis revealed another novel cross-population risk locus in <i>CREBBP</i>. Finally, we assessed the performance of a cross-ancestry polygenic risk score in the SCOURGE admixed American cohort. This study constitutes the largest GWAS for COVID-19 hospitalization in admixed Latin Americans conducted to date. This allowed to reveal novel risk loci and emphasize the need of considering the diversity of populations in genomic research.

">Cell-type specific projection patterns promote balanced activity in cortical microcircuits</a></h4>

              
                Brain structure provides the stage on which activity unfolds. Models linking connectivity to dynamics have relied on probabilistic estimates of connectivity derived from paired electrophysiological recordings or single-neuron morphologies obtained by light microscopy (LM) studies. Only recently have electron microscopy (EM) data sets been processed and made available for volumes of cortex on the cubic millimeter scale, thereby exposing the actual connectivity of neurons. Here, we construct a population-based, layer-resolved connectivity map from EM data, taking into account the spatial scale of local cortical connectivity. We compare the obtained connectivity with a map based on an established LM data set. Simulating spiking neural networks constrained by the derived microcircuit architectures shows that both models allow for biologically plausible ongoing activity when synaptic currents caused by neurons outside the network model are adjusted for every population independently. However, differentially varying the external current onto excitatory and inhibitory populations uncovers that only the EM-based model robustly shows plausible dynamics. Our work confirms the long-standing hypothesis that a preference of excitatory neurons for inhibitory targets, not present in the LM-based model, promotes balanced activity in the cortical microcircuit.

">Reliable sensory processing of superficial cortical interneurons is modulated by behavioral state</a></h4>

              
                The GABAergic interneurons within cortical layer 1 (L1) integrate sensory and top-down inputs to modulate network activity and induce the plasticity underlying learning. However, little is known about how sensory inputs drive L1 interneuron activity. We used two-photon calcium imaging to measure the sound-evoked responses of two L1 interneuron populations expressing VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) or NDNF (neuron-derived neurotrophic factor) in mouse auditory cortex. We find that L1 interneurons respond to both simple and complex sounds with high trial-to-trial variability. However, these interneurons respond reliably to just a narrow range of stimuli, reflecting selectivity to spectrotemporal sound features. This response reliability is modulated by behavioral state and predicted by the activity of neighboring interneurons. Our data reveal that L1 interneurons exhibit sensory tuning and identify the modulation of response reliability as a potential mechanism by which L1 relays state-dependent cues to shape sensory representations.

">Interpersonal Synchronization in Mother-Child Dyads: Neural and Motor Coupling as a Mechanism for Motor Learning and Development in Preschoolers</a></h4>

              
                Interpersonal movement synchrony (IMS) and brain-to-brain coupling play a crucial role in social behavior across species. In humans, IMS is often studied in structured tasks that require specific body movements, while spontaneous, unstructured movements have received less attention. In this study, we investigated both structured and spontaneous motor coordination in mother-child dyads. We recorded upper-body kinematics and dual-EEG from mothers and their preschool children during motor tasks and spontaneous face-to-face interactions. Our findings show that mother-child dyads synchronize their movements and neural activity, particularly in gamma band oscillations. This motor and neural synchrony evolves across task repetitions, with a strong correlation between motor and neural measures. Further, we observed that only motor synchronization was significantly related to the child's motor development stage, as assessed by the Movement Assessment Battery for Children. These results suggest that gamma band brain-to-brain coupling reflects joint motor coordination and mutual adaptation shaped by structured tasks and spontaneous interpersonal interactions.

">Semantic Dimensions Support the Cortical Representation of Object Memorability</a></h4>

              
                Recent work in vision sciences contends that objects carry an intrinsic property, memorability, that describes the likelihood that an object can be successfully encoded and later retrieved from memory. It has been shown that object memorability is supported by semantic information, but the neural correlates involved are largely unexplored. The present study explores these premises and asks whether neural correlates of object memorability can be accounted for by semantic dimensions. To investigate these questions, we combine three datasets: (1) feature norms for a database of ~1000 natural object images, (2) normative conceptual and perceptual memory data for those objects, and (3) neuroimaging data from an fMRI study collected using a subset (n=360) of those objects. We found that object-wise memorability elicits consistent brain activation across participants in key mnemonic regions (e.g., hippocampus and rhinal cortex), and that a substantial portion of the variance in this brain activity is mediated by the semantic factors describing these images. Regions with the strongest mediation effects are associated with sensory, motor, and visual processes, suggesting that the relationship between memorability and semantics may align with a sensory-functional account of the representation of concepts in the brain.

">Guided Visual Search is associated with a feature-based priority map in early visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Visual search models have long emphasised that task-relevant items must be prioritised for optimal performance. While it is known that search efficiency also benefits from active distractor inhibition, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are debated. Here, we used MEG in combination with Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT) to probe how neuronal excitability in early visual cortex is modulated during feature-guided visual search. Participants were instructed to indicate the presence or absence of a letter "T" presented amongst 16 and 32 "L"s. In the guided search condition, participants were informed about the colour of the "T" and could infer the colour of the irrelevant distractors. In the unguided search condition, the target colour was unknown. We found that guided search was associated with enhanced RIFT responses to the target colour, and decreased responses to the distractor colour compared to unguided search. These results conceptually replicated using both a conventional coherence approach, as well as with a General Linear Model approach based on a single-trial measure of the RIFT response. The present findings expand on previous reports based on electrophysiology and fMRI in humans and non-human primates by revealing that feature-guidance in visual search affects neuronal excitability as early as primary visual cortex.

">Examining Relationships between Functional and Structural Brain Network Architecture, Age, and Attention Skills in Early Childhood</a></h4>

              
                Early childhood is a critical period showing experience-dependent changes in brain structure and function. The complex link between the structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) of the brain is of particular interest, however, its relationship with both age and attention in early childhood is not well understood. In this study, children between the ages of 4 and 7, and at a one-year follow-up visit, underwent neuroimaging (diffusion-weighted and passive-viewing functional magnetic resonance imaging) and assessments for selective, sustained, and executive attention. We examined regional graph theory metrics and SC-FC coupling of the structural and functional networks. Partial least squares (PLS) was used to investigate longitudinal brain measure changes and cross-sectional associations with age and attention. We observed longitudinal changes in functional graph theory metrics and age-related decreases in SC modularity. Region-wise graph theory analyses revealed variable brain-behaviour relationships across the brain, highlighting regions where structural topology is linked to age and attentional performance. Furthermore, we identified SC as a dominant predictor of age when compared to FC and SC-FC coupling. The findings emphasise how early childhood is a dynamic period where cognitive functioning is intricately and predominantly linked to structural network features.

">Limiting hearing loss in transgenic mouse models</a></h4>

              
                Transgenic mice provide unprecedented access to manipulate and visualize neural circuits, however, those on a C57BL/6 background develop progressive hearing loss, significantly confounding systems-level and behavioral analysis. While outbreeding can limit hearing loss, it introduces strain variability and complicates the generation of complex genotypes. Here, we propose an approach to preserve hearing by crossing transgenic mice with congenic B6.CAST-Cdh23Ahl+ mice, which maintain low-threshold hearing into adulthood. Widefield and two-photon imaging of the auditory cortex revealed that 2.5-month-old C57BL/6 mice exhibit elevated thresholds to high frequency tones and widespread cortical reorganization, with most neurons responding best to lower frequencies. In contrast, Ahl+ C57BL/6 mice exhibited robust neural responses across a range of frequencies and sound levels (4-64 kHz, 30-90 dB SPL) and retained low thresholds into adulthood. Our approach offers a cost-effective solution for generating complex genotypes and facilitates more interpretable systems neuroscience research by eliminating confounding effects from hearing loss.

                We investigated cell assemblies in the frontal cortex of macaques during two discrimination tasks. Focusing on the period of goal-action transformation, we extracted spikes fired during assembly activation from the full neural activity and showed that the contribution of a neuron to assembly coding, when it coordinates with other assembly neurons, differs from its coding in isolation. Neurons with their flexible participation to multiple assemblies contributed to the encoding of new information not encoded by the neurons alone. Even non-discriminative neurons acquired selectivity as part of the collective activity of the assemblies. Thus, neurons in their assemblies process distinct information for various purposes as a chess simul master, playing on multiple chessboards. The reconfiguration of the participation of the neurons into different assemblies in the goal-action transformation process translated into a dynamic form of coding, whereas minimal reconfiguration was associated with the static goal coding of the memory period.

">Dynamic Attentional Control Through Mixed Prefrontal Cortex Resources</a></h4>

              
                Spatial attention can be either involuntarily drawn to salient, unexpected events (exogenous attention) or voluntarily directed (endogenous attention). Evidence suggests a link of both forms of attention to the (oculo)motor system. We investigated the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in this relationship using a task that spatially dissociated attention from motor planning in two monkeys. PFC units flexibly encoded either the attended location or motor target, with some showing overlapping coding. Endogenous attention promotes an early engagement of these shared resources, producing two key effects: (1) it prevents interference between motor and attention systems, and (2) it regulates the extent of the exogenous shifts for attentional capture, with stronger shifts occurring when endogenous attention is weak. Overall, we show that there are separate attention and motor systems, each of which can flexibly draw on some 'overlapping' resources based on environmental and internal demands.

">A triple serine motif in the intracellular domains of sortilin-related receptors SorCS1-3 regulates neurotrophic activity</a></h4>

              
                The Vps10p-domain receptors SorCS1-3 have been repeatedly associated with the development of neurological and psychiatric disorders. They have emerged as key regulators of synaptic activity and neurotrophic signaling, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here we report that the SorCS1-3 intracellular domains (ICDs) contain a conserved triple serine motif that potentially functions as a signaling switch to induce neurotrophic signaling in hippocampal neurons. We demonstrate that phosphorylation mimicking mutations of the SorCS1-3 triple serine motifs display neurotrophic activity independently of both their extracellular domains (ECDs) and BDNF, and that the substitution of serines to alanines renders neurons less responsive to BDNF. Hence, we develop triple serine motif-based cell-penetrating peptides that modulate downstream signaling kinases of the BDNF pathway, ultimately activating the transcription factor CREB. Taken together, we provide the first mechanistic insights into SorCS1-3 mediated neurotrophic signaling and use this knowledge to develop pharmacologically active modulators.

">Exploring the trade-off between deep-learning and explainable models for brain-machine interfaces</a></h4>

              
                People with brain or spinal cord-related paralysis often need to rely on others for basic tasks, limiting their independence. A potential solution is brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), which could allow them to voluntarily control external devices (e.g., robotic arm) by decoding brain activity to movement commands. In the past decade, deep-learning decoders have achieved state-of-the-art results in most BMI applications, ranging from speech production to finger control. However, the 'black-box' nature of deep-learning decoders could lead to unexpected behaviors, resulting in major safety concerns in real-world physical control scenarios. In these applications, explainable but lower-performing decoders, such as the Kalman filter (KF), remain the norm. In this study, we designed a BMI decoder based on KalmanNet, an extension of the KF that augments its operation with recurrent neural networks to compute the Kalman gain. This results in a varying "trust" that shifts between inputs and dynamics. We used this algorithm to predict finger movements from the brain activity of two monkeys. We compared KalmanNet results offline (pre-recorded data, n=13 days) and online (real-time predictions, n=5 days) with a simple KF and two recent deep-learning algorithms: tcFNN (non-ReFIT version) and LSTM. KalmanNet achieved comparable or better results than other deep learning models in offline and online modes, relying on the dynamical model for stopping while depending more on neural inputs for initiating movements. We further validated this mechanism by implementing a heteroscedastic KF that used the same strategy, and it also approached state-of-the-art performance while remaining in the explainable domain of standard KFs. However, we also see two downsides to KalmanNet. KalmanNet shares the limited generalization ability of existing deep-learning decoders, and its usage of the KF as an inductive bias limits its performance in the presence of unseen noise distributions. Despite this trade-off, our analysis successfully integrates traditional controls and modern deep-learning approaches to motivate high-performing yet still explainable BMI designs.

                The Child Mind Institute (CMI) Healthy Brain Network (HBN) project has recorded phenotypic, behavioral, and neuroimaging data from ~5,000 children and young adults between the ages of 5 and 21. Here, we present "analysis-ready" data from its high-density (128-channel) electroencephalographic (EEG) recording sessions formatted as Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) datasets (HBN-EEG) with behavioral and task-condition events annotated using Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED), making it analysis-ready for many purposes, without 'forensic' search for unreported details. We also ensured individual data files data and event integrity and marked inconsistencies. HBN-EEG sessions include six tasks, three with no participant behavioral input and three including button press responses following task instructions. Openly available participant information includes age, gender, and four psychopathology dimensions (internalizing, externalizing, attention, and p-factor) derived from bifactor model of questionnaire data. Currently, HBN-EEG data from more than 2,600 participants is freely available on NEMAR (nemar.org) and OpenNeuro in the form of nine dataset releases, with further dataset releases to follow.

">Deep-learning and analytical models give distinct results for the brain structure-function relationship in health and in psychosis</a></h4>

              
                Quantifying the intricate relationship between brain structure and function is of extreme importance in neuroscience. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for mapping brain structural connectivity measured via diffusion-MRI to resting-state functional connectivity measured via magnetoencephalography, utilizing a deep-learning model based on a Graph Multi-Head Attention AutoEncoder. We compare the results to those from an analytical model that utilizes shortest-path- length and search-information communication mechanisms. The deep-learning model performed well at predicting healthy participant functional connectivity at individual-participant level, in particular in the alpha and beta frequency bands (mean correlation coefficient over 0.8), and better than the analytical model. The two models identified distinct differences in the structure-function relationship in people with psychosis compared to healthy participants, which were highly statistically significant (p < 2x10-4 for the deep-learning model, p < 3x10-3 in the delta band for the analytical model). Our results imply that human brain structural connectivity and electrophysiological functional connectivity are tightly coupled. They also show that simple analytical algorithms are very good models for communication between brain areas in people with psychosis in the delta and theta bands, while more sophisticated models are required for the alpha and beta bands.

">Unveiling the role of miRNAs from MSC-EVs in neuroinflammation and behavioral impairments induced by chronic alcohol consumption</a></h4>

              
                Extracellular vesicles derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC-EVs) have emerged as a promising form of regenerative and immunomodulatory therapy; indeed, micro (mi)RNAs contained within MSC-EVs modulate target gene expression and impact disease-associated pathways. Chronic alcohol consumption results in neuroinflammation, brain damage, and impaired cognition; in this study, we asked whether the repeated intravenous administration of MSC-EVs could ameliorate neuroinflammation and behavioral impairment induced by chronic alcohol consumption in mice. MSC-EVs diminished the increased binding of a micro-positron emission tomography tracer (18F-FDG) when analyzing whole-brain 3D images and brain coronal sections of ethanol-treated mice. MSC-EV administration protected against ethanol-induced proinflammatory gene upregulation, cognitive dysfunction, and addictive-like behavior. miRNA sequencing data from MSC-EVs helped to reveal the elevated expression of EV-derived miR-483-5p and miR-140-3p in the brains of ethanol-treated mice following MSC-EV administration. In addition, MSC-EVs modulated the expression of pro-inflammatory-related miRNA target genes (e.g., Socs3, Tnf, Mtor, Atf6) in the brains of ethanol-treated mice. These results suggest that MSC-EVs could function as a neuroprotective therapy to ameliorate the neuroinflammation, cognitive dysfunction, and addictive-like behavior associated with chronic alcohol consumption.

">Fate plasticity of interneuron specification</a></h4>

              
                The generation of neuronal subtypes in the mammalian central nervous system is driven by competing genetic programs. The medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) gives rise to two major cortical interneuron (cIN) populations, marked by Somatostatin (Sst) and Parvalbumin (Pvalb), which develop on different timelines. The extent to which external signals influence these identities remains poorly understood. Pvalb-positive cINs are particularly important for regulating cortical circuits through strong perisomatic inhibition, yet they have been difficult to model in vitro. Here we investigated the role of the environment in shaping and maintaining Pvalb cINs. We grafted mouse MGE progenitors into a variety of 2D and 3D co-culture models, including mouse and human cortical, MGE, and thalamic systems with dissociated cells, organoids, organotypic cultures, and conditioned media. Across models, we observed distinct proportions of Sst- and Pvalb-positive cIN descendants. Strikingly, grafting MGE progenitors into 3D human, but not mouse, corticogenesis models led to efficient, non-autonomous differentiation of Pvalb-positive cINs. This differentiation was characterized by upregulation of Pvalb maturation markers, downregulation of Sst-specific markers, and the formation of perineuronal nets. Furthermore, lineage-traced postmitotic Sst-positive cINs, when grafted onto human cortical models, also upregulated Pvalb expression. These results reveal an unexpected level of fate plasticity in MGE-derived cINs, demonstrating that their identities can be dynamically shaped by the surrounding environment.

">Theta-gamma transcranial alternating current stimulation enhances motor skill acquisition in healthy young and older adults</a></h4>

              
                Theta-gamma transcranial alternating current stimulation (TG tACS) over primary motor cortex (M1) can improve motor skill acquisition in young adults, but the effect on older adults is unknown. This study investigated the effects of TG tACS on motor skill acquisition and M1 excitability in 18 young and 18 older adults. High-definition TG tACS (6 Hz theta, 75 Hz gamma) or sham tACS was applied over right M1 for 20 minutes during a ballistic left-thumb abduction motor training task performed in two experimental sessions. Motor skill acquisition was quantified as changes in movement acceleration during and up to 60 minutes after training. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to assess changes in M1 excitability with motor-evoked potentials (MEP) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) before and after training. We found that TG tACS increased motor skill acquisition compared with sham tACS in young and older adults (P < 0.001), with greater effects for young adults (P = 0.01). The improved motor performance with TG tACS lasted at least 60 minutes after training in both age groups. Motor training was accompanied by greater MEP amplitudes with TG tACS compared to sham tACS in young and older adults (P < 0.001), but SICI did not vary between tACS sessions (P = 0.40). These findings indicate that TG tACS over M1 improves motor skill acquisition and alters training-induced changes in M1 excitability in healthy young and older adults. TG tACS may therefore be beneficial to alleviate motor deficits in the ageing population.

">Reward processing in children with Affective Dysregulation</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Affective dysregulation (AD) in children is characterized by irritability, anger, and frequent intense temper outbursts. Considerable evidence implies altered processing of frustration about missed rewards, but few studies investigated the preceding and thus potentially predictive reward anticipation and initial delivery processing in children with AD. Methods: A total of 103 children aged 8 to 12 years (50 with AD and 53 without AD) were examined during a monetary reward anticipation task with event-related potential (ERP) components resolving reward anticipation (cue-CNV [Contingent Negative Variation]) and reward delivery phases (Reward Positivity and Feedback-Related Negativity). All components were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. Regression analyses also evaluated the associations between those ERP components and dimensional AD symptoms. Results: Children with AD showed attenuated anticipatory reward processing compared to No-ADs. The CNV at fronto-central site (FCz) showed a significant group effect (No AD>AD, p=0.017). Post-hoc test showed that this group difference was stronger for the cue monetary condition (monetary cue: p=.007, d=0.56, verbal cue: p=.901, d=0.16), and that only the No AD group showed a significant difference between conditions (p<0.001). No significant effects were obtained for the delivery phase. Regression analysis showed that a reduced anticipatory CNV at FCz significantly explained AD symptoms, and that anger/irritability and anxiety/depressive symptoms predicted a reduced anticipatory CNV at FCz. Conclusion: This neurophysiological characterization of reward anticipation and delivery in children with AD demonstrates altered neural activity in AD during anticipation of reward rather than following the delivery (or omission) of the reward itself. Our results highlight that altered reward anticipation in AD can occur outside frustration-prone tasks or settings, and underline the important role of both anger/irritability and anxiety/depressive symptoms in the pathophysiology of AD for atypical reward anticipation.

">Pannexin-2 deficient zebrafish develop ocular and visual motor behaviour defects</a></h4>

              
                Pannexin-2 (Panx2), unlike the other pannexin channels Panx1 and Panx3, exhibits a unique intracellular distribution, localizing at ER-mitochondria contact sites. These specialized microdomains are crucial for important cellular functions, including calcium homeostasis, lipid transfer, inflammation, and apoptosis. Despite their presence in neurons and glial cells, the function of Panx2 at ER-mitochondria contact sites in neurotransmission remains unclear. Here, we used TALEN technology to develop a Panx2 knockout (Panx2-/-) zebrafish model, to investigate its role in neuronal communication. In 6 days, post fertilization TL (Panx2+/+) larvae, Panx2 expression was observed in the inner and outer plexiform layers of the retina and the arborization fields of the optic tract. Transcriptome profiling of Panx2-/- larvae by RNA-seq analysis revealed down-regulation of vision-related genes, specifically those involved in visual and sensory perception and lens development. Behavioral tests showed that loss of Panx2 leads to altered visual motor response (VMR); Panx2-/- larvae exhibited reduced locomotor activity during light phases and increased activity during dark phases. Additionally, the knockout larvae displayed significantly impaired optomotor response (OMR). When we tested the geometric and refractive properties of adult eyes, optical coherence tomography (OCT) analysis of Panx2-/- fish revealed a longer mean axial length and a negative shift in retinal refractive error (RRE) values, both indicative of myopia. Furthermore, the increased corneal thickness observed in Panx2-/- fish corroborated the molecular and behavioural alterations. Our findings highlight a novel role of Panx2 in retinal development, visual perception, and ocular health.

">A membrane-targeted photoswitch restores physiological ON/OFF responses to light in the degenerate retina</a></h4>

              
                The lack of effective therapies for visual restoration in Retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration has led to the development of new strategies such as optogenetics and retinal prostheses. However, visual restoration is poor due to the massive light-evoked activation of retinal neurons, regardless of the segregation of visual information in ON and OFF channels, essential for contrast sensitivity and spatial resolution. Here, we show that Ziapin2, a membrane photoswitch which modulates neuronal capacitance and excitability in a light-dependent manner, is capable of reinstating, in two distinct genetic models of photoreceptor degeneration, brisk and sluggish ON, OFF, and ON-OFF responses in retinal ganglion cells evoked by full-field stimuli, with reactivation of their excitatory and inhibitory conductances. Intravitreally injected Ziapin2 in fully blind rd10 mice restored light-driven behavior and optomotor reflexes. The results indicate that Ziapin2 is a promising molecule for reinstating physiological visual responses in the late stages of retinal degeneration.

">Optimal control of spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Control theory provides a natural language to describe multi-areal interactions and flexible cognitive tasks such as covert attention or brain-machine interface (BMI) experiments, which require finding adequate inputs to a local circuit in order to steer its dynamics in a context-dependent manner. In optimal control, the target dynamics should maximize a notion of long-term value along trajectories, possibly subject to control costs. Because this problem is, in general, not tractable, current approaches to the control of networks mostly consider simplified settings (e.g., variations of the Linear-Quadratic Regulator). Here, we present a mathematical framework for optimal control of recurrent networks of stochastic spiking neurons with low-rank connectivity. An essential ingredient is a control-cost that penalizes deviations from the default dynamics of the network (specified by its recurrent connections), which motivates the controller to use the default dynamics as much as possible. We derive a Bellman Equation that specifies a Value function over the low-dimensional network state (LDS), and a corresponding optimal control input. The optimal control law takes the form of a feedback controller that provides external excitatory (inhibitory) synaptic input to neurons in the recurrent network if their spiking activity tends to move the LDS towards regions of higher (lower) Value. We use our theory to study the problem of steering the state of the network towards particular terminal regions which can lie either in or out of regions in the LDS with slow dynamics, in analogy to standard BMI experiments. Our results provide the foundation of a novel approach with broad applicability that unifies bottom-up and top-down perspectives on neural computation.

">Pharmacological inhibition of Fms-like kinase 3 (FLT3) promotes neuronal maturation and suppresses seizure in a mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase predominantly expressed in blood and brain cells. While the FLT3 signaling pathway has been extensively studied in blood cell development and leukemia, its role in the brain remains largely unexplored. Through our previous high-throughput drug screening work unexpectedly found that several small molecule FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i), including KW-2449 and Sunitinib, enhance expression of the gene encoding chloride transporter KCC2 in neurons. KCC2 is crucial for brain development and function, and its dysregulation is linked to many brain diseases. These findings suggest previously unrecognized roles of FLT3 signaling in brain health and disease that have yet to be systematically studied. In this study, we utilized a functional genomics approach to investigate the transcriptomic changes induced by pharmacological inhibition of the FLT3 pathway in brain cells, including cultured primary mouse neurons, a human stem cell-derived neuronal model of Rett syndrome (RTT), and human stem cell-derived microglia cultures. Our results show that treating human or mouse neurons with FLT3i drugs significantly upregulates genes crucial for brain development while downregulating genes linked to neuroinflammation. In contrast, FLT3i treatment of human microglia, which do not express FLT3, has no effect on their gene expression, highlighting the cell type-specific roles of FLT3 signaling in the brain. To further understand how FLT3 signaling regulates the expression of neuronal maturation genes such as KCC2, we conducted a curated CRISPR screen that identified a number of transcription factors involved in FLT3i-mediated KCC2 activation in neurons. The mRNA and protein levels of several neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) risk genes are significantly upregulated in FLT3i-treated neurons, indicating potential therapeutic applications of FLT3i in rescuing underexpression and/or haploinsufficiency of disease-associated genes. In our in vivo studies, we evaluated the efficacy of the FLT3i drug KW-2449 in mice, demonstrating that it can effectively cross the blood-brain barrier, induce KCC2 protein expression for up to 24 hours after a single injection, and reduces seizure activity in a chemoconvulsant-induced mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Collectively, our findings uncover previously unrecognized roles of neuron-specific FLT3 signaling in promoting neuronal maturation and reducing neuroinflammation. These results suggest that FLT3 kinase signaling regulates a transcriptional program vital for brain development and function, position it as a promising therapeutic target for NDD treatment.

">Oligodendrocytes use post-synaptic proteins to coordinate myelin formation on axons of distinct neurotransmitter classes</a></h4>

              
                Axon myelination is a powerful method to tune neuronal circuit output through deposition of different patterns, lengths, and thicknesses of sheaths on many axon types. Yet the molecular mechanisms of myelin formation on distinct axon classes remain largely unknown. Recent work indicates that myelin properties on different neurons may be unique and function through distinct signaling pathways, and that neuronal activity and vesicle release promote myelin formation. Here, we use the zebrafish and the scaffold protein Gephyrin (Gphn) as a tool to examine post-synaptic protein function in OLs with respect to myelinated axon class identity. We show that Gphn protein is enriched in myelin sheaths that wrap GABAergic and glycinergic axons. Using Gphn loss-of-function approaches, we found an accumulation of long myelin sheaths across development that specifically wrap GABAergic axons. Loss of Gphn also biases glutamatergic axons for myelination at the expense of GABAergic axons. Collectively, our results suggest that OLs use post-synaptic machinery to coordinate myelin formation in an axon identity-dependent manner.

                Parkinsons disease is a neurodegenerative disease, which is associated with accumulation of -synuclein protein aggregates and Lewy Body formation. These neurotoxic inclusions are especially harmful for dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. The cellular degradation system autophagy can reduce neurotoxicity caused by accumulated -synuclein, by targeting it for degradation. Previously, we demonstrated that human TBC1D15 inhibits autophagy in vitro, resulting in accumulation of neurotoxic protein aggregates. Conversely, lowering the TBC1D15 expression promotes autophagy and degradation of -synuclein and huntingtin proteins in various cell models. Here we show that knockdown of murine Tbc1d15 in vivo activates autophagy, reduces -synuclein-mediated neurotoxicity, and improves motor performance. Thus, targeting Tbc1d15 expression may be a therapeutic avenue for neurodegenerative diseases.

">Stimulus history, not expectation, drives sensory prediction errors in mammalian cortex</a></h4>

              
                Predictive coding (PC) is a popular framework to explain cortical responses. PC states that the brain computes internal models of expected events and responds robustly to unexpected stimuli with prediction errors that feed forward. This can be studied using oddball tasks. A repetitive sequence interrupted by a novel stimulus is a "local" oddball. "Global" oddballs defy expectations while repeating the local context. This dissociates expectation-driven neuronal prediction error responses vs. merely stimulus-history-driven release from adaptation. We recorded neuron spiking activity across the visual hierarchy in mice and monkeys viewing these oddballs. Local oddball responses largely followed PC hypotheses. They were robust, emerged early in layers 2/3, and fed forward. Global oddball responses challenged PC. They were weak, absent in most visual areas, more robust in prefrontal cortex, and emerged in non-granular layers. Contrary to the most popular PC models that emphasize prediction error computations occurring in early sensory areas and feeding forward, this implies that genuine predictive coding computations take place in more cognitive, higher-order areas.

">Enhanced Structural Brain Connectivity Analyses Using High Diffusion-weighting Strengths</a></h4>

              
                Tractography is a unique modality for the in vivo measurement of structural connectivity, crucial for understanding brain networks and neurological conditions. With increasing b-value, the diffusion-weighting signal becomes primarily sensitive to the intra-axonal signal. However, it remains unclear how tractography is affected by this observation. Here, using open-source datasets, we showed that at high b-values, DWI reduces the uncertainty in estimating fiber orientations. Specifically, we found the ratio of biologically-meaningful longer-range connections increases, accompanied with downstream impact of redistribution of connectome and network metrics. However, when going beyond b=6000 s/mm2, the loss of SNR imposed a penalty. Lastly, we showed that the data reaches satisfactory reproducibility with b-value above 1200 s/mm2. Overall, the results suggest that using b-values above 2500 s/mm2 is essential for more accurate connectome reconstruction by reducing uncertainty in fiber orientation estimation, supporting the use of higher b-value protocols in standard diffusion MRI scans and pipelines.

">Cross-task implications: How hippocampal event boundary responses predict unrelated memory performance</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal responses at event boundaries have been shown to predict memory performance for these events. However, are these hippocampal event boundary responses specific to memory for those particular events, or can they also have predictive power across various memory tasks? We used data from the Cam-CAN project (fMRI data from continuous movie viewing and memory results from an unrelated Famous Faces Task, N = 630) to determine whether hippocampal responses at event boundaries during the continuous movie viewing were indicative of memory performance in the unrelated Famous Faces task using various machine learning algorithms. The results showed that memory performance in the Famous Faces Task could be predicted based on participants hippocampal event boundary responses in another task, which suggests that the hippocampal event boundary responses are indicative for general memory performance. This might indicate importance of these hippocampal event boundary responses in terms of general information processing of the human brain.

                Research on serotonin reveals a lack of consensus regarding its role in brain volume, especially concerning biomarkers linked to neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, such as ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF-4), bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP-6), and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to investigate the influence of serotonin on brain structure and hippocampal volumes in relation to cognitive functions in AD, as well as its link with biomarkers like CNTF, FGF-4, BMP-6, and MMP-1. Data from the ADNI included 133 AD participants. Cognitive function was assessed using CDR-SB, serotonin levels were measured with the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit and UPLC-MS/MS, and neurotrophic factors and biomarkers were quantified using multiplex targeted proteomics. Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) analyzed gray matter volume changes via MRI. Statistical analyses employed Pearson correlation and Bootstrap methods, with p-values < 0.05 or 0.01 considered significant. The analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between serotonin levels and total brain volume (r = 0.179, p = 0.039) and hippocampal volumes (right: r = 0.181, p = 0.037; left: r = 0.217, p = 0.012). Besides, higher serotonin levels were associated with improved cognitive function, evidenced by a negative correlation with CDR-SB scores (r = -0.198, p = 0.023). Furthermore, total brain volume and hippocampal volumes showed significant negative correlations with CDR-SB scores, indicating that greater cognitive impairment was associated with reduced brain volume (total: r = -0.223, p = 0.010; left: r = -0.246, p = 0.004; right: r = -0.308, p < 0.001). Finally, serotonin levels were positively correlated with BMP-6 (r = 0.173, p = 0.047), CNTF (r = 0.216, p = 0.013), FGF-4 (r = 0.176, p = 0.043), and MMP-1 (r = 0.202, p = 0.019), suggesting a link between serotonin and neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. In conclusion, increased serotonin levels are associated with improved cognitive function, increased brain volume, and elevated levels of neurotrophic factors and biomarkers,specifically CNTF, FGF-4, BMP-6, and MMP-1, which are related to neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in AD.

                Precisely localizing the spatial distribution of proteins within various cell types in the brain, and in sub-cellular compartments such as the synapses, is critical for generating and testing hypothesis to elucidating the function of target proteins in the brain. The fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) has been studied extensively in the context of blood cell development and leukemia pathogenesis, but little is known about its role in the brain. Previous work characterizing FLT3 protein expression in the brain have not yielded convincing results, mainly limited by the low expression level of FLT3 and poor sensitivity of standard immunolabeling method using fluorescent secondary antibody. In this study, we report the systematic characterization of FLT3 protein localization during brain development using a highly sensitive immunolabeling methodology based on alkaline phosphatase (AP) polymer biochemistry. Our results reveal a previously unknown neuron-selective FLT3 expression pattern in both mouse and human cerebellum tissue samples, and demonstrate a gradual increase in the total FLT3 protein level and a cytosolic-to-dendritic change in subcellular FLT3 distribution during mouse cerebellum development. Through combining the AP immunolabeling of FLT3 with standard immunostaining of various cell type markers to achieve hybrid co-labeling of multiple antigens in tissue sections, we demonstrate that the main cell type that express FLT3 in the cerebellum is PV+, Calbindin+ Purkinje cells. To expand the use case of AP immunolabeling method in labeling neuronal proteins, we show robust labeling of Kir2.1, a potassium channel protein that is expressed at low level in neurons, in brain tissue sections collected from mouse, pig, and human brains. We further established that the AP immunolabeling method can be used in human stem cell-derived neurons to detect postsynaptic density scaffold protein PSD95 within fine subcellular structures such as dendritic spines and synapses, in cultured primary mouse cortical neurons and human stem cell-derived neurons. To our knowledge, our work represents the first report of applying AP immunolabeling to detect neuronal protein expression in brain tissue and cell samples. Moreover, our work reveals a previously unknown neuron-specific pattern of FLT3 expression in the brain, providing the foundation for further mechanistic studies to uncover its role in brain development and functioning.

                Vigilance plays a vital role in numerous high-risk professions, where real-time monitoring of vigilance levels is highly beneficial. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) utilizing EEG signals, along with machine learning and deep learning algorithms, present a promising solution for the classification and monitoring of vigilance levels. This study aimed to create a dataset for training such models by evaluating four experimental paradigms: the Hitchcock Air Traffic Controller Task (ATC), the simultaneous line task, the successive line task, and the Oddball task. Subjective reports and behavioral performance were analyzed to determine the effectiveness of these tasks in inducing vigilance decrements over time. The findings reveal that both the ATC and simultaneous line tasks effectively induced significant declines in subjective vigilance ratings and behavioral performance. In contrast, the Oddball task was less successful in generating a noticeable vigilance decrement. This research demonstrates the potential of the ATC and simultaneous line tasks to induce vigilance variations, providing valuable datasets for training vigilance detection algorithms. Additionally, it highlights the importance of considering non-linear fluctuations in vigilance and the need for more advanced techniques to accurately classify different vigilance states. Such improvements in vigilance monitoring could substantially enhance safety and well-being in critical work environments.

Among many severe symptoms, refractory epileptic events are a common neurological presentation of MD. However, the neuronal substrates and circuits for MD-induced epilepsy remain unclear. Here, using mouse models of mitochondrial epilepsy that lack mitochondrial complex I subunit NDUFS4 in a constitutive or conditional manner, we demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction leads to a reduction in the number of GABAergic neurons in the rostral external globus pallidus (GPe) and identify a specific affectation of pallidal Lhx6-expressing inhibitory neurons. Our findings further reveal that viral vector-mediated Ndufs4 re-expression in the GPe effectively prevents seizures and improves the survival in the models. Additionally, we highlight the subthalamic nucleus (STN) as a critical structure in the neural circuit involved in mitochondrial epilepsy, as its inhibition effectively reduces epileptic events. Thus, we have identified a novel role for pallido-subthalamic projections in the development of epilepsy in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results suggest STN inhibition as a potential therapeutic intervention for refractory epilepsy in patients with MD providing new leads in the quest to identify novel and effective treatments.

	<p>Background/Objectives: This study investigated the behavior of postural adjustments throughout the entire action: from the preparatory phase (anticipatory postural adjustment, APA), the focal movement phase (online postural adjustments, OPA), to the compensatory phase (compensatory postural adjustment, CPA) while raising the arms in a standing position, both with eyes opened and closed. The goal was to analyze the effects of reduced sensorial information and different heights on postural muscle activity during these three phases. Methods: Eight young women performed rapid shoulder flexion while standing on the ground and on a 1-m elevated platform. The EMG activity of the trunk and lower limb muscles was recorded during all three phases. Results: Although average muscle activity was similar on the ground and the elevated platform, the pattern of postural muscle activation varied across the motor action. During OPA, all postural muscle activity was the highest, while it was the lowest during APA. On the elevated platform postural muscles have increased their activation during APA. In the most stable condition (standing on the ground with eyes opened), muscle activity showed a negative correlation between APA and OPA, but there was no correlation between OPA and CPA. Conclusions: Our results suggest postural control adapts to sensory, motor, and cognitive conditions. Therefore, the increased demand for postural control due to the height of the support base demands greater flexibility in postural synergies and alters muscle activity.</p>

                <p>Executive control of movement enables inhibiting impulsive responses critical for successful navigation of the environment. Circuits mediating stop commands involve prefrontal and basal ganglia structures with fMRI evidence demonstrating increased activity during response inhibition in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)&mdash;often ascribed to maintaining task attentional demands. Using direct intraoperative cortical recordings in male and female human subjects, we investigated oscillatory dynamics along the rostral-caudal axis of dlPFC during a modified Go/No-go task, probing components of both proactive and reactive motor control. We assessed whether cognitive control is topographically organized along this axis and observed that low-frequency power increased prominently in mid-rostral dlPFC when inhibiting and delaying responses. These findings provide evidence for a key role for mid-rostral dlPFC low-frequency oscillations in sculpting motor control.</p>

                <p>The surprising omission or reduction of vital resources (food, fluid, social partners) can induce an aversive emotion known as frustrative nonreward (FNR), which can influence subsequent behavior and physiology. FNR is an integral mediator of irritability/aggression, motivation (substance use disorders, depression), anxiety/fear/threat, learning/conditioning, and social behavior. Despite substantial progress in the study of FNR during the twentieth century, research lagged in the later part of the century and into the early twenty-first century until the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria initiative included FNR and loss as components of the negative valence domain. This led to a renaissance of new research and paradigms relevant to basic and clinical science alike. The COVID-19 pandemic's extensive individual and social restrictions were correlated with increased drug and alcohol use, social conflict, irritability, and suicide, all potential consequences of FNR. This article highlights animal models related to these psychiatric disorders and symptoms and presents recent advances in identifying the brain regions and neurotransmitters implicated.</p>

                <p>Emotionally salient experiences are encoded and remembered more strongly, an effect that can be amplified by hormones like cortisol. Such memories can in turn profoundly influence later behavior. However, little is known about the link between amplified salience encoding and subsequent behavior. This pathway may be particularly important for risky alcohol drinking, which has been linked to sensitized salience responses, memory, and cortisol. To test this possibility, we integrated pharmacology using a double-blind cross-over design with fMRI, cognitive, and motivation assays across a range of healthy male and female social drinkers. As anticipated, cortisol enhanced memory for salient alcohol-related events; critically, this bias was in turn associated with later alcohol motivation. Increased alcohol motivation was particularly pronounced in more susceptible risky drinkers, for whom cortisol enhanced brain salience responses to alcohol. These sensitized salience responses predicted both memory biases and alcohol motivation. Together, these findings reveal maladaptive consequences of enhanced salience encoding.</p>

                <p>Communication between neurons and glia significantly influences the development maturation, plasticity, and disease progressions of the nervous system. As a new signaling modality, extracellular vesicles display a diverse role for robust functional regulation of neurons through their protein and nucleic acid cargoes.

                <p>The brain is a highly adaptable organ that is molded by experience throughout life. Although the field of neuroscience has historically focused on intrinsic neuronal mechanisms of plasticity, there is growing evidence that multiple glial populations regulate the timing and extent of neuronal plasticity, particularly over the course of development. This review highlights recent discoveries on the role of glial cells in the establishment of cortical circuits and the regulation of experience-dependent neuronal plasticity during critical periods of neurodevelopment. These studies provide strong evidence that neuronal circuit maturation and plasticity are non-cell autonomous processes that require both glial&ndash;neuronal and glial&ndash;glial cross talk to proceed. We conclude by discussing open questions that will continue to guide research in this nascent field.</p>

                <p>Primates, as social beings, have evolved complex brain mechanisms to navigate intricate social environments. This review explores the neural bases of body perception in both human and nonhuman primates, emphasizing the processing of social signals conveyed by body postures, movements, and interactions. Early studies identified selective neural responses to body stimuli in macaques, particularly within and ventral to the superior temporal sulcus (STS). These regions, known as body patches, represent visual features that are present in bodies but do not appear to be semantic body detectors. They provide information about posture and viewpoint of the body. Recent research using dynamic stimuli has expanded the understanding of the body-selective network, highlighting its complexity and the interplay between static and dynamic processing. In humans, body-selective areas such as the extrastriate body area (EBA) and fusiform body area (FBA) have been implicated in the perception of bodies and their interactions. Moreover, studies on social interactions reveal that regions in the human STS are also tuned to the perception of dyadic interactions, suggesting a specialized social lateral pathway. Computational work developed models of body recognition and social interaction, providing insights into the underlying neural mechanisms. Despite advances, significant gaps remain in understanding the neural mechanisms of body perception and social interaction. Overall, this review underscores the importance of integrating findings across species to comprehensively understand the neural foundations of body perception and the interaction between computational modeling and neural recording.</p>

                <p>Palmitoylation, a lipid-based posttranslational protein modification, plays a crucial role in regulating various aspects of neuronal function through altering protein membrane-targeting, stabilities, and protein&ndash;protein interaction profiles. Disruption of palmitoylation has recently garnered attention as disease mechanism in neurodegeneration. Many proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and associated neuronal dysfunction, including but not limited to amyloid precursor protein, &beta;-secretase (BACE1), postsynaptic density protein 95, Fyn, synaptotagmin-11, mutant huntingtin, and mutant superoxide dismutase 1, undergo palmitoylation, and recent evidence suggests that altered palmitoylation contributes to the pathological characteristics of these proteins and associated disruption of cellular processes. In addition, dysfunction of enzymes that catalyze palmitoylation and depalmitoylation has been connected to the development of neurological disorders. This review highlights some of the latest advances in our understanding of palmitoylation regulation in neurodegenerative diseases and explores potential therapeutic implications.</p>

                <p>The traditional view of glial cells as mere supportive tissue has shifted, due to advances in technology and theoretical conceptualization, to include a diversity of other functions, such as regulation of complex behaviors. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), have been shown to modulate synaptic functions through gliotransmitter-mediated neurotransmitter reuptake, influencing neuronal signaling and behavioral functions. Contemporary studies further highlight astrocytes&rsquo; involvement in complex cognitive functions. For instance, inhibiting astrocytes in the hippocampus can lead to memory deficits, suggesting their integral role in memory processes. Moreover, astrocytic calcium activity and astrocyte&ndash;neuron metabolic coupling have been linked to changes in synaptic strength and learning. Microglia, another type of glial cell, also extend beyond their supportive roles, contributing to learning and memory processes, with microglial reductions impacting these functions in a developmentally dependent manner. Oligodendrocytes, traditionally thought to have limited roles postdevelopment, are now recognized for their activity-dependent modulation of myelination and plasticity, thus influencing behavioral responses. Recent advancements in technology and computational modeling have expanded our understanding of glial functions, particularly how astrocytes influence neuronal circuits and behaviors. This review underscores the importance of glial cells in CNS functions and the need for further research to unravel the complexities of neuron&ndash;glia interactions, the impact of these interactions on brain functions, and potential implications for neurological diseases.</p>

                <p>The motor cortex is essential for controlling the flexible movements underlying complex behaviors. Behavioral flexibility involves the ability to integrate and refine new movements, thereby expanding an animal's repertoire. This review discusses recent strides in motor learning mechanisms across spatial and temporal scales, describing how neural networks are remodeled at the level of synapses, cell types, and circuits and across time as animals' learn new skills. It highlights how changes at each scale contribute to the evolving structure and function of neural circuits that accompanies the expansion and refinement of motor skills. We review new findings highlighted by advanced imaging techniques that have opened new vistas in optical physiology and neuroanatomy, revealing the complexity and adaptability of motor cortical circuits, crucial for learning and control. At the structural level, we explore the dynamic regulation of dendritic spines mediating corticocortical and thalamocortical inputs to the motor cortex. We delve into the role of perisynaptic astrocyte processes in maintaining synaptic stability during learning. We also examine the functional diversity among pyramidal neuron subtypes, their dendritic computations and unique contributions to single cell and network function. Further, we highlight how cortical activation is characterized by increased consistency and reduced strength as new movements are learned and how external inputs contribute to these changes. Finally, we consider the motor cortex's necessity as movements unfold over long time scales. These insights will continue to drive new research directions, enhancing our understanding of motor cortical circuit transformations that underpin behavioral changes expressed throughout an animal's life.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/40/e1234242024?rss=1">Challenges and Approaches in the Study of Neural Entrainment</a></h4>

              
                <p>When exposed to rhythmic stimulation, the human brain displays rhythmic activity across sensory modalities and regions. Given the ubiquity of this phenomenon, how sensory rhythms are transformed into neural rhythms remains surprisingly inconclusive. An influential model posits that endogenous oscillations entrain to external rhythms, thereby encoding environmental dynamics and shaping perception. However, research on neural entrainment faces multiple challenges, from ambiguous definitions to methodological difficulties when endogenous oscillations need to be identified and disentangled from other stimulus-related mechanisms that can lead to similar phase-locked responses. Yet, recent years have seen novel approaches to overcome these challenges, including computational modeling, insights from dynamical systems theory, sophisticated stimulus designs, and study of neuropsychological impairments. This review outlines key challenges in neural entrainment research, delineates state-of-the-art approaches, and integrates findings from human and animal neurophysiology to provide a broad perspective on the usefulness, validity, and constraints of oscillatory models in brain&ndash;environment interaction.</p>

                <p>Hormonal contraceptives (HCs) are one of the most highly prescribed classes of drugs in the world used for both contraceptive and noncontraceptive purposes. Despite their prevalent use, the impact of HCs on the brain remains inadequately explored. This review synthesizes recent findings on the neuroscience of HCs, with a focus on human structural neuroimaging as well as translational, nonhuman animal studies investigating the cellular, molecular, and behavioral effects of HCs. Additionally, we consider data linking HCs to mood disorders and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and stress response as a potential mediator. The review also addresses the unique sensitivity of the adolescent brain to HCs, noting significant changes in brain structure and function when HCs are used during this developmental period. Finally, we discuss potential effects of HCs in combination with smoking-derived nicotine on outcomes of ischemic brain damage. Methodological challenges, such as the variability in HC formulations and user-specific factors, are acknowledged, emphasizing the need for precise and individualized research approaches. Overall, this review underscores the necessity for continued interdisciplinary research to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms of HCs, aiming to optimize their use and improve women's health.</p>

                <p>Understanding the brain requires studying its multiscale interactions from molecules to networks. The increasing availability of large-scale datasets detailing brain circuit composition, connectivity, and activity is transforming neuroscience. However, integrating and interpreting this data remains challenging. Concurrently, advances in supercomputing and sophisticated modeling tools now enable the development of highly detailed, large-scale biophysical circuit models. These mechanistic multiscale models offer a method to systematically integrate experimental data, facilitating investigations into brain structure, function, and disease. This review, based on a Society for Neuroscience 2024 MiniSymposium, aims to disseminate recent advances in large-scale mechanistic modeling to the broader community. It highlights (1) examples of current models for various brain regions developed through experimental data integration; (2) their predictive capabilities regarding cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying experimental recordings (e.g., membrane voltage, spikes, local-field potential, electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography) and brain function; and (3) their use in simulating biomarkers for brain diseases like epilepsy, depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's, aiding in understanding their biophysical underpinnings and developing novel treatments. The review showcases state-of-the-art models covering hippocampus, somatosensory, visual, motor, auditory cortical, and thalamic circuits across species. These models predict neural activity at multiple scales and provide insights into the biophysical mechanisms underlying sensation, motor behavior, brain signals, neural coding, disease, pharmacological interventions, and neural stimulation. Collaboration with experimental neuroscientists and clinicians is essential for the development and validation of these models, particularly as datasets grow. Hence, this review aims to foster interest in detailed brain circuit models, leading to cross-disciplinary collaborations that accelerate brain research.</p>

                <p>Somatosensory neuroprostheses restore, replace, or enhance tactile and proprioceptive feedback for people with sensory impairments due to neurological disorders or injury. Somatosensory neuroprostheses typically couple sensor inputs from a wearable device, prosthesis, robotic device, or virtual reality system with electrical stimulation applied to the somatosensory nervous system via noninvasive or implanted interfaces. While prior research has mainly focused on technology development and proof-of-concept studies, recent acceleration of clinical studies in this area demonstrates the translational potential of somatosensory neuroprosthetic systems. In this review, we provide an overview of neurostimulation approaches currently undergoing human testing and summarize recent clinical findings on the perceptual, functional, and psychological impact of somatosensory neuroprostheses. We also cover current work toward the development of advanced stimulation paradigms to produce more natural and informative sensory feedback. Finally, we provide our perspective on the remaining challenges that need to be addressed prior to translation of somatosensory neuroprostheses.</p>

Despite decades of research, the development and function of motor circuits remain poorly understood. Breakthroughs in the field recently provided new tools and tractable model systems that set the stage to discover the molecular mechanisms and circuit logic underlying motor control. Here, we describe recent advances from both vertebrate (mouse, frog) and invertebrate (nematode, fruit fly) systems on cellular and molecular mechanisms that enable motor circuits to develop and function and highlight conserved and divergent mechanisms necessary for motor circuit development.</p>

                <p>Neuromodulators act on multiple timescales to affect neuronal activity and behavior. They function as synaptic fine-tuners and master coordinators of neuronal activity across distant brain regions and body organs. While much research on neuromodulation has focused on roles in promoting features of wakefulness and transitions between sleep and wake states, the precise dynamics and functions of neuromodulatory signaling during sleep have received less attention. This review discusses research presented at our minisymposium at the 2024 Society for Neuroscience meeting, highlighting how norepinephrine, dopamine, and acetylcholine orchestrate brain oscillatory activity, control sleep architecture and microarchitecture, regulate responsiveness to sensory stimuli, and facilitate memory consolidation. The potential of each neuromodulator to influence neuronal activity is shaped by the state of the synaptic milieu, which in turn is influenced by the organismal or systemic state. Investigating the effects of neuromodulator release across different sleep substates and synaptic environments offers unique opportunities to deepen our understanding of neuromodulation and explore the distinct computational opportunities that arise during sleep. Moreover, since alterations in neuromodulatory signaling and sleep are implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders and because existing pharmacological treatments affect neuromodulatory signaling, gaining a deeper understanding of the less-studied aspects of neuromodulators during sleep is of high importance.</p>

                <p>Most studies on the development of the visual system have focused on the mechanisms shaping early visual stages up to the level of primary visual cortex (V1). Much less is known about the development of the stages after V1 that handle the higher visual functions fundamental to everyday life. The standard model for the maturation of these areas is that it occurs sequentially, according to the positions of areas in the adult hierarchy. Yet, the existing literature reviewed here paints a different picture, one in which the adult configuration emerges through a sequence of unique network configurations that are not mere partial versions of the adult hierarchy. In addition to studying higher visual development per se to fill major gaps in knowledge, it will be crucial to adopt a network-level perspective in future investigations to unravel normal developmental mechanisms, identify vulnerabilities to developmental disorders, and eventually devise treatments for these disorders.</p>

                <p>Degeneracy is defined as multiple sets of solutions that can produce very similar system performance. Degeneracy is seen across phylogenetic scales, in all kinds of organisms. In neuroscience, degeneracy can be seen in the constellation of biophysical properties that produce a neuron's characteristic intrinsic properties and/or the constellation of mechanisms that determine circuit outputs or behavior. Here, we present examples of degeneracy at multiple levels of organization, from single-cell behavior, small circuits, large circuits, and, in cognition, drawing conclusions from work ranging from bacteria to human cognition. Degeneracy allows the individual-to-individual variability within a population that creates potential for evolution.</p>

                <p>The development of the visual system is a complex and multistep process characterized by the precise wiring of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon terminals with their corresponding neurons in the visual nuclei of the brain. Upon reaching primary image-forming nuclei (IFN), such as the superior colliculus and the lateral geniculate nucleus, RGC axons undergo extensive arborization that refines over the first few postnatal weeks. The molecular mechanisms driving this activity-dependent remodeling process, which is influenced by waves of spontaneous activity in the developing retina, are still not well understood. In this study, by manipulating the activity of RGCs in mice from either sex and analyzing their transcriptomic profiles before eye-opening, we identified the Type I membrane protein synaptotagmin 13 (Syt13) as involved in spontaneous activity-dependent remodeling. Using these mice, we also explored the impact of spontaneous retinal activity on the development of other RGC recipient targets such as nonimage-forming (NIF) nuclei and demonstrated that proper frequency and duration of retinal waves occurring prior to visual experience are essential for shaping the connectivity of the NIF circuit. Together, these findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular and physiological mechanisms governing activity-dependent axon refinement during the assembly of the visual circuit.</p>

                <p>The human brain exhibits both oscillatory and aperiodic, or 1/<I>f</I>, activity. Although a large body of research has focused on the relationship between brain rhythms and sensory processes, aperiodic activity has often been overlooked as functionally irrelevant. Prompted by recent findings linking aperiodic activity to the balance between neural excitation and inhibition, we investigated its effects on the temporal resolution of perception. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from participants (both sexes) during the resting state and a task in which they detected the presence of two flashes separated by variable interstimulus intervals. Two-flash discrimination accuracy typically follows a sigmoid function whose steepness reflects perceptual variability or inconsistent integration/segregation of the stimuli. We found that individual differences in the steepness of the psychometric function correlated with EEG aperiodic exponents over posterior scalp sites. In other words, participants with flatter EEG spectra (i.e., greater neural excitation) exhibited increased sensory noise, resulting in shallower psychometric curves. Our finding suggests that aperiodic EEG is linked to sensory integration processes usually attributed to the rhythmic inhibition of neural oscillations. Overall, this correspondence between aperiodic neural excitation and behavioral measures of sensory noise provides a more comprehensive explanation of the relationship between brain activity and sensory integration and represents an important extension to theories of how the brain samples sensory input over time.</p>

                <p>by Ruipeng Wei, Masahiro Hitomi, Tammy Sadler, Lamis Yehia, Daniela Calvetti, Jacob Scott, Charis Eng</p>

Persons with germline variants in the tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog, <i>PTEN</i>, are molecularly diagnosed with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS). PHTS confers high risks of specific malignancies, and up to 23% of the patients are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or developmental delay (DD). The accurate prediction of these two seemingly disparate phenotypes (cancer <i>vs</i>. ASD/DD) for PHTS at the individual level remains elusive despite the available statistical prevalence of specific phenotypes of the syndrome at the population level. The pleiotropy of the syndrome may, in part, be due to the alterations of the key multi-functions of PTEN. Maintenance of genome integrity is one of the key biological functions of PTEN, but no integrative studies have been conducted to quantify the DNA damage response (DDR) in individuals with PHTS and to relate to phenotypes and genotypes. In this study, we used 43 PHTS patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) to investigate the associations between DDR and <i>PTEN</i> genotypes and/or clinical phenotypes ASD/DD <i>vs</i>. cancer. The dynamics of DDR of γ-irradiated LCLs were analyzed using the exponential decay mathematical model to fit temporal changes in γH2AX levels which report the degree of DNA damage. We found that <i>PTEN</i> nonsense variants are associated with less efficient DNA damage repair ability resulting in higher DNA damage levels at 24 hours after irradiation compared to <i>PTEN</i> missense variants. Regarding PHTS phenotypes, LCLs from PHTS individuals with ASD/DD showed faster DNA damage repairing rate than those from patients without ASD/DD or cancer. We also applied the reaction-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) mathematical model, a tumor cell growth model with a DNA damage term, to accurately describe the DDR process in the LCLs. For each LCL, we can derive parameters of the PDE. Then we averaged the numerical results by PHTS phenotypes. By performing simple subtraction of two subgroup average results, we found that PHTS-ASD/DD is associated with higher live cell density at lower DNA damage level but lower cell density level at higher DNA damage level compared to LCLs from individuals with PHTS-cancer and PHTS-neither.

                <p>by Jan Lause, Philipp Berens, Dmitry Kobak</p>

A recent paper claimed that <i>t</i>-SNE and UMAP embeddings of single-cell datasets are “specious” and fail to capture true biological structure. The authors argued that such embeddings are as arbitrary and as misleading as forcing the data into an elephant shape. Here we show that this conclusion was based on inadequate and limited metrics of embedding quality. More appropriate metrics quantifying neighborhood and class preservation reveal the elephant in the room: while <i>t</i>-SNE and UMAP embeddings of single-cell data do not preserve high-dimensional distances, they can nevertheless provide biologically relevant information.

                Background Conventional antifungal therapies, including topical applications, are effective against oral candidiasis but have limitations such as resistance development and cytotoxicity especially for immunocompromised patients. Phytotherapy presents a promising alternative, offering potential solutions to these challenges. However, despite numerous clinical trials, there is a lack of standardized protocols for phytotherapeutic applications. This systematic review protocol seeks to evaluate the potential of phytotherapy as an alternative treatment for oral candidiasis and compare its efficacy with standard antifungal therapies. Protocol This protocol aims to assess the effectiveness of phytotherapy compared to standard antifungal treatments for oral candidiasis. Initially, controlled descriptors in MeSH terms (e.g., “Candidiasis, Oral,” “Phytotherapy”) and keywords were selected from MEDLINE and combined using Boolean operators (‘AND’, ‘OR’) to create a comprehensive search strategy. Titles and abstracts will be screened by two independent reviewers to select studies that meet the inclusion criteria. The quality and risk of bias of the selected studies will be assessed afterward. Data will be gathered using standardized tools and subsequently synthesized for analysis. Discrepancies between reviewers will be settled through discussion, or, if required, by involving a third reviewer. Discussion Results obtained from this systematic review will describe various natural compounds like essential oils, herbal extracts, and bioactive plant ingredients that exhibit antifungal properties used against oral candidiasis and will evaluate their effectiveness in comparison to standard antifungal treatments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1115/v1?src=rss">Assessing Africa’s position in the development of AI-enabled ECG devices [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in electrocardiographic (ECG) devices has become a pivotal area of research, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. These technologies are essential for enhancing cardiac diagnosis and monitoring. Methods This study assesses current trends, key contributors, and collaborative networks in the field of AI-enhanced ECG devices. We utilized a comprehensive analysis, using the Biblioshiny library from Bibliometrix for data exploration of data extracted from the Scopus database and VOSViewer for creating and visualizing maps. These tools were played an important role in conducting an in-depth analysis of the relationships and developments within the field. Results The analysis shows a significant increase in publications related to AI-enhanced ECG devices, with a marked surge during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the growing interest and technological advancements, the study exposes a notable disparity in the geographical distribution of research contributions, highlighting substantial under-representation of African researchers. This gap is attributed to infrastructural, financial constraints, and limited collaborative networks within the continent. Conclusion The rapid evolution and increasing importance of AI in ECG devices underscore the need for more inclusive research practices. There is a critical need to integrate and promote contributions from under-represented regions, particularly Africa, to ensure a globally diverse perspective in tackling health challenges. This study calls for enhanced participation and support for African researchers to bridge the existing research gap and foster global health equity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1114/v1?src=rss">Effect of lycopene on prostate cancer among native African men: A protocol for an open-label randomized clinical trial in Tanzania [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of death in men worldwide. The treatment of PCa depends on the clinical stage of the disease, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and histology. Lycopene is a bright red carotenoid found in tomatoes, which enhances apoptosis in prostate cells, but its effectiveness has not been studied in East African countries. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of lycopene from tomato extracts in reducing PSA levels, disease progression, and apoptosis in the prostate glands of men with PCa in Tanzania. Methods This study will be a randomized phase III clinical trial of men diagnosed with PCa in Tanzania. In total, 400 men will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive intervention (n=200) and control (n=200) and followed for 12 months. The intervention arm will receive tomato paste for daily use in addition to the standard treatment, whereas the control arm will only follow the standard of care. The primary endpoints will be a reduction in PSA levels, improved clinical status, and apoptosis of the prostate gland. Data analysis was performed based on the intention-to-treat principle. Descriptive statistics were used to compare average lycopene and PSA levels in the intervention group using T-test and Chi-squared tests. Generalized linear mixed models will be used to further assess the effect of lycopene on PCa progression, urinary symptoms, and PSA reduction. All statistical tests were two-sided at an alpha level of <0.05. Discussion The study used a food supplement as a drug/intervention with minimal or no adverse reactions. However, there is a fear that the control group may not adhere to the protocol after learning the benefits of tomato paste. The study findings will promote the consumption of tomato paste in males diagnosed with PCa to improve the clinical status and reduce disease progression. Trial registration The study has been registered at the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry with registration No PACTR202405488763956.

                Endometriosis is a benign, estrogen-dependent, persistent chronic inflammatory heterogeneous condition that features adhesions caused by estrogen-dependent periodic bleeding. It is characterised by a widely spread fibrotic interstitium that comprising of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, collagen fibres, extracellular proteins, inflammatory cells, and active angiogenesis found outside the uterus. Thus, fibrosis is recognized as a critical component because of which current treatments, such as hormonal therapy and surgical excision of lesions are largely ineffective with severe side effects, high recurrence rates, and significant morbidity. The symptoms include dysmenorrhea (cyclic or non-cyclic), dyspareunia, abdominal discomfort, and infertility. The significant lack of knowledge regarding the underlying root cause, etiology, and complex pathogenesis of this debilitating condition, makes it challenging to diagnose early and to implement therapeutic approaches with minimal side effects presenting substantial hurdles in endometriosis management. Research on understanding the pathogenesis of endometriosis is still ongoing to find biomarkers and develop non-hormonal therapeutic approaches. Current clinical research indicates a close relationship between endometriosis and fibrosis, which is thought to be tightly linked to pain, a major factor for the decline in the patient’s quality of life but little is known about the underlying pathophysiological cellular and molecular signaling pathways that lead to endometriosis-related fibrosis. The available experimental disease models have tremendous challenges in reproducing the human characteristics of the disease to assess treatment effectiveness. Future translational research on the topic has been hindered by the lack of an adequate fibrotic model of endometriosis emphasizing the necessity of etiological exploration. This review article’s goal is to examine recent developments in the field and pinpoint knowledge gaps that exist with a focus on the development of novel fibrotic mouse models for the early diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis and how this knowledge aids in the development of novel anti-fibrotic treatments which opens fresh avenues for a thorough investigation and extended research in the field of endometriosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95599">Cardiac afferent signals can facilitate visual dominance in binocular rivalry</a></h4>

              
                Sensory signals from the body’s visceral organs (e.g. the heart) can robustly influence the perception of exteroceptive sensations. This interoceptive–exteroceptive interaction has been argued to underlie self-awareness by situating one’s perceptual awareness of exteroceptive stimuli in the context of one’s internal state, but studies probing cardiac influences on visual awareness have yielded conflicting findings. In this study, we presented separate grating stimuli to each of subjects’ eyes as in a classic binocular rivalry paradigm – measuring the duration for which each stimulus dominates in perception. However, we caused the gratings to ‘pulse’ at specific times relative to subjects’ real-time electrocardiogram, manipulating whether pulses occurred during cardiac systole, when baroreceptors signal to the brain that the heart has contracted, or in diastole when baroreceptors are silent. The influential ‘Baroreceptor Hypothesis’ predicts the effect of baroreceptive input on visual perception should be uniformly suppressive. In contrast, we observed that dominance durations increased for systole-entrained stimuli, inconsistent with the Baroreceptor Hypothesis. Furthermore, we show that this cardiac-dependent rivalry effect is preserved in subjects who are at-chance discriminating between systole-entrained and diastole-presented stimuli in a separate interoceptive awareness task, suggesting that our results are not dependent on conscious access to heartbeat sensations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98665">Formation of multinucleated osteoclasts depends on an oxidized species of cell surface-associated La protein</a></h4>

              
                The bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts plays a critical role in the life-long remodeling of our bones that is perturbed in many bone loss diseases. Multinucleated osteoclasts are formed by the fusion of precursor cells, and larger cells – generated by an increased number of cell fusion events – have higher resorptive activity. We find that osteoclast fusion and bone resorption are promoted by reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling and by an unconventional low molecular weight species of La protein, located at the osteoclast surface. Here, we develop the hypothesis that La’s unique regulatory role in osteoclast multinucleation and function is controlled by an ROS switch in La trafficking. Using antibodies that recognize reduced or oxidized species of La, we find that differentiating osteoclasts enrich an oxidized species of La at the cell surface, which is distinct from the reduced La species conventionally localized within cell nuclei. ROS signaling triggers the shift from reduced to oxidized La species, its dephosphorylation and delivery to the surface of osteoclasts, where La promotes multinucleation and resorptive activity. Moreover, intracellular ROS signaling in differentiating osteoclasts oxidizes critical cysteine residues in the C-terminal half of La, producing this unconventional La species that promotes osteoclast fusion. Our findings suggest that redox signaling induces changes in the location and function of La and may represent a promising target for novel skeletal therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93113">Multiple origins of dorsal ecdysial sutures in trilobites and their relatives</a></h4>

              
                Euarthropods are an extremely diverse phylum in the modern, and have been since their origination in the early Palaeozoic. They grow through moulting the exoskeleton (ecdysis) facilitated by breaking along lines of weakness (sutures). Artiopodans, a group that includes trilobites and their non-biomineralizing relatives, dominated arthropod diversity in benthic communities during the Palaeozoic. Most trilobites – a hyperdiverse group of tens of thousands of species - moult by breaking the exoskeleton along cephalic sutures, a strategy that has contributed to their high diversity during the Palaeozoic. However, the recent description of similar sutures in early diverging non-trilobite artiopodans means that it is unclear whether these sutures evolved deep within Artiopoda, or convergently appeared multiple times within the group. Here, we describe new well-preserved material of <i>Acanthomeridion</i>, a putative early diverging artiopodan, including hitherto unknown details of its ventral anatomy and appendages revealed through CT scanning, highlighting additional possible homologous features between the ventral plates of this taxon and trilobite free cheeks. We used three coding strategies treating ventral plates as homologous to trilobite-free cheeks, to trilobite cephalic doublure, or independently derived. If ventral plates are considered homologous to free cheeks, <i>Acanthomeridion</i> is recovered sister to trilobites, however, dorsal ecdysial sutures are still recovered at many places within Artiopoda. If ventral plates are considered homologous to doublure or non-homologous, then <i>Acanthomeridion</i> is not recovered as sister to trilobites, and thus the ventral plates represent a distinct feature to trilobite doublure/free cheeks.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88670">I-Spin live, an open-source software based on blind-source separation for real-time decoding of motor unit activity in humans</a></h4>

              
                Decoding the activity of individual neural cells during natural behaviours allows neuroscientists to study how the nervous system generates and controls movements. Contrary to other neural cells, the activity of spinal motor neurons can be determined non-invasively (or minimally invasively) from the decomposition of electromyographic (EMG) signals into motor unit firing activities. For some interfacing and neuro-feedback investigations, EMG decomposition needs to be performed in real time. Here, we introduce an open-source software that performs real-time decoding of motor neurons using a blind-source separation approach for multichannel EMG signal processing. Separation vectors (motor unit filters) are optimised for each motor unit from baseline contractions and then re-applied in real time during test contractions. In this way, the firing activity of multiple motor neurons can be provided through different forms of visual feedback. We provide a complete framework with guidelines and examples of recordings to guide researchers who aim to study movement control at the motor neuron level. We first validated the software with synthetic EMG signals generated during a range of isometric contraction patterns. We then tested the software on data collected using either surface or intramuscular electrode arrays from five lower limb muscles (gastrocnemius lateralis and medialis, vastus lateralis and medialis, and tibialis anterior). We assessed how the muscle or variation of contraction intensity between the baseline contraction and the test contraction impacted the accuracy of the real-time decomposition. This open-source software provides a set of tools for neuroscientists to design experimental paradigms where participants can receive real-time feedback on the output of the spinal cord circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/73832">Temporal transcriptional response of Candida glabrata during macrophage infection reveals a multifaceted transcriptional regulator CgXbp1 important for macrophage response and fluconazole resistance</a></h4>

              
                <i>Candida glabrata</i> can thrive inside macrophages and tolerate high levels of azole antifungals. These innate abilities render infections by this human pathogen a clinical challenge. How <i>C. glabrata</i> reacts inside macrophages and what is the molecular basis of its drug tolerance are not well understood. Here, we mapped genome-wide RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupancy in <i>C. glabrata</i> to delineate its transcriptional responses during macrophage infection in high temporal resolution. RNAPII profiles revealed dynamic <i>C. glabrata</i> responses to macrophages with genes of specialized pathways activated chronologically at different times of infection. We identified an uncharacterized transcription factor (CgXbp1) important for the chronological macrophage response, survival in macrophages, and virulence. Genome-wide mapping of CgXbp1 direct targets further revealed its multi-faceted functions, regulating not only virulence-related genes but also genes associated with drug resistance. Finally, we showed that CgXbp1 indeed also affects fluconazole resistance. Overall, this work presents a powerful approach for examining host-pathogen interaction and uncovers a novel transcription factor important for <i>C. glabrata</i>'s survival in macrophages and drug tolerance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89705">An anciently diverged family of RNA binding proteins maintain correct splicing of a class of ultra-long exons through cryptic splice site repression</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we showed that the germ cell-specific nuclear protein RBMXL2 represses cryptic splicing patterns during meiosis and is required for male fertility (Ehrmann et al., 2019). Here, we show that in somatic cells the similar yet ubiquitously expressed RBMX protein has similar functions. RBMX regulates a distinct class of exons that exceed the median human exon size. RBMX protein-RNA interactions are enriched within ultra-long exons, particularly within genes involved in genome stability, and repress the selection of cryptic splice sites that would compromise gene function. The <i>RBMX</i> gene is silenced during male meiosis due to sex chromosome inactivation. To test whether RBMXL2 might replace the function of RBMX during meiosis we induced expression of RBMXL2 and the more distantly related RBMY protein in somatic cells, finding each could rescue aberrant patterns of RNA processing caused by RBMX depletion. The C-terminal disordered domain of RBMXL2 is sufficient to rescue proper splicing control after RBMX depletion. Our data indicate that RBMX and RBMXL2 have parallel roles in somatic tissues and the germline that must have been conserved for at least 200 million years of mammalian evolution. We propose RBMX family proteins are particularly important for the splicing inclusion of some ultra-long exons with increased intrinsic susceptibility to cryptic splice site selection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90766">The zinc-finger transcription factor Sfp1 imprints specific classes of mRNAs and links their synthesis to cytoplasmic decay</a></h4>

              
                To function effectively as an integrated system, the transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries must communicate through mechanisms that are still poorly understood. Here, we focus on the zinc-finger Sfp1, known to regulate transcription of proliferation-related genes. We show that Sfp1 can regulate transcription either by binding to promoters, like most known transcription activators, or by binding to the transcribed regions (gene bodies), probably via RNA polymerase II (Pol II). We further studied the first mode of Sfp1 activity and found that, following promoter binding, Sfp1 binds to gene bodies and affects Pol II configuration, manifested by dissociation or conformational change of its Rpb4 subunit and increased backtracking. Surprisingly, Sfp1 binds to a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally and stabilizes them. The interaction between Sfp1 and its client mRNAs is controlled by their respective promoters and coincides with Sfp1’s dissociation from chromatin. Intriguingly, Sfp1 dissociation from the chromatin correlates with the extent of the backtracked Pol II. We propose that, following promoter recruitment, Sfp1 accompanies Pol II and regulates backtracking. The backtracked Pol II is more compatible with Sfp1’s relocation to the nascent transcripts, whereupon Sfp1 accompanies these mRNAs to the cytoplasm and regulates their stability. Thus, Sfp1’s co-transcriptional binding imprints the mRNA fate, serving as a paradigm for the cross-talk between the synthesis and decay of specific mRNAs, and a paradigm for the dual-role of some zinc-finger proteins. The interplay between Sfp1’s two modes of transcription regulation remains to be examined.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Degenerative cerebellar ataxias (DCA) present a group of complex neurological disorders primarily affecting the cerebellum and its pathways. Classic manifestations include motor symptoms of cerebellar ataxia. However, emerging evidence suggests that the cerebellum also plays a crucial role in various cognitive and emotional processes. The objective was to assess the psychiatric profile of a heterogeneous group of patients with degenerative cerebellar ataxia. Methods: Our sample comprised 107 participants diagnosed with cerebellar degenerative ataxia. All patients were clinically evaluated using SARA, INAS, and different neuropsychiatric scales (ACE-R, HAMA, HAMD, AS, and GAF). Results: The majority of patients had autosomal dominant ataxia (38.3%) followed by sporadic ataxia (32.7%) with an average age at the moment of diagnosis of 35.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 16.23 years, while the mean duration of disease at the study beginning was 12.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.9 years. Psychiatric disorders were present in 40 patients (37.4%), with dysthymia (14.2%), major depressive disorder (9.4%), and MDD with melancholic features (7.6%). The presence of MDD with melancholic features was statistically significantly correlated with a lower ACE-R total score (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.223; p = 0.022), while dysthymia was statistically significantly associated with a shorter duration of the disease (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.226; p = 0.020) and older age (r = 0.197; p = 0.043). Statistically significant differences were observed between MSA-C patients and those with sporadic ataxia (HDRS p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, HARS p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, Apathy Scale p = 0.003, and GAF p = 0.004). Conclusions: Based on our findings, we can conclude that the degree of motor deficit has a significant impact on the development of psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and apathy. However, it is not the only factor, and the impact also depends on the type of DCA.</p>

	<p>Background: Immersive virtual reality has the potential to motivate and challenge patients who need and want to relearn movements in the process of neurorehabilitation. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and user acceptance of an innovative immersive virtual reality system (head-mounted display) used in combination with robot-assisted gait training in subjects suffering from neurological diseases. Methods: Fifteen participants suffering from cerebrovascular accident or spinal cord injury completed a single session of immersive virtual reality using a head-mounted display during a Lokomat&amp;amp;reg; gait session. Training parameters and safety indicators were collected, and acceptance was investigated among participants and therapists. Results: The results suggest that an immersive virtual reality system is feasible in terms of safety and tolerance. Furthermore, the very positive overall acceptance of the system suggests that it has the potential to be included in a robot-assisted gait training session using Lokomat&amp;amp;reg;. Conclusion: Overall, this study demonstrates that a fully immersive virtual reality system based on a head-mounted display is both feasible and well received by cerebrovascular accident and spinal cord injury patients and their therapists during robot-assisted gait training. This study suggests that such a virtual reality system could be a viable alternative to the screen-based training games currently used in neurorehabilitation. It may be especially suitable for enhancing patient motivation and adherence to training, particularly if the application is enjoyable and not mentally taxing.</p>

                Background: Technology serves as a potent tool that enhances the quality of teaching and learning experiences. However, when educators lack proficiency in utilizing technology, it leads to obstacles in providing effective education, resulting in emotions of frustration, diminished self-assurance, and uncertainty regarding their teaching abilities. This study aims to investigate the experiences of university faculty members in relation to the impact of technology on their mental well-being. Methods: For this qualitative study, ten professionals engaged in university-level teaching, encompassing research domains, were selected for interviews. Inclusion criteria were based on teaching experience, tenure, specific courses or subjects taught, and active involvement during the research phase. The guiding question for the study was framed as follows: "What are the experiences and perceptions of university faculty members concerning techno-stress?" Additionally, the study identified four subcategories: work overload, social and emotional interaction, adaption to new technologies, and expectations and teaching quality. Results: Techno-stress is a composite of emotional and physical reactions triggered by the improper use of technology. Faculty members’ encounters with techno-stress have substantial implications for their quality of life. The subcategories shed light on different aspects of the faculty’s experiences, including the burden of excessive workload, the influence of social and emotional interactions, the process of adapting to evolving technologies, and the connection between expectations and the quality of their teaching. Conclusions: This research underscores the significance of technology in higher education, highlighting its potential to positively impact teaching and learning. Nevertheless, faculty members’ struggles with techno-stress indicate a pressing need for effective training and support. Establishing limits on connectivity with technology and others emerges as a crucial step in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Ultimately, addressing techno-stress and providing appropriate guidance are essential for safeguarding the well-being of university faculty members and, consequently, enhancing the overall educational experience.

                <p>This study aims to explore the correlation of serum thyroid hormone levels to cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. In this retrospective study, 106 Chinese patients without cognitive impairments and 94 patients with cognitive impairments, including 55 with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and 39 with PD dementia (PDD), were analyzed. Clinical data regarding the PD assessments, including disease duration, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part 3 scores, and Hoehn and Yahr (H&ndash;Y) staging, were analyzed. Cognitive functions were evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score. Serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), and free triiodothyronine (FT3), were measured using ELISA. Significantly altered H&ndash;Y staging, disease duration, and UPDRS Part 3 scores were observed in PD patients with cognitive impairment compared with those without. Serum levels of FT3 were significantly decreased, while FT4 and TSH levels were significantly elevated in PD patients with cognitive impairment compared with those without. Combined detection of TSH, FT3, and FT4 showed value in distinguishing PD patients with and without cognitive impairment. Furthermore, a comparison of serum levels between PD-MCI and PDD patients revealed significant association between thyroid hormone levels and the degree of cognitive impairment in PD patients. Our findings suggest a relationship between changes in serum thyroid hormone levels and cognitive impairments in PD patients. Thyroid hormone levels, particularly FT3, may serve as potential markers for cognitive dysfunction in PD.</p>

                Global suicide rates owing to disaster impacts have been confusing because of varied and unclear results. This study aimed to investigate how suicides have occurred worldwide during disasters. The methodology used included a systematic literature review and comparative analysis. The disaster exacerbation (X, bad human nature, or suicide rate rise) perspective was compared with the disaster resilience (Y, good human nature, or suicide rate fall) perspective to extract disaster ecology (Z, neutral human nature, or suicide rate fluctuation) perspective from international leaders, government officials, researchers, and disaster victims. A major theme was that the four stakeholders would adopt the Z perspective based on the fusion of X and Y perspectives (leading to X+Y=Z), while embracing heterogeneous research, proactive and long-term strategies, education, and so on. This study relied heavily on the large-scale dynamics of suicide rates than previous studies.

                Background The WHO recommendation against the use of macrolides reflects the little low-quality evidence about the effect of azithromycin (AZ) on influenza A infection. Considering recent reports about AZ use despite the WHO’s unfavorable recommendations, we aimed to test the evidence for the usage of AZ in the treatment of influenza A infection. Methods Various online databases were searched till August 2023 and thorough text and evidence evaluation resulted in selecting 7 studies. Results The selected reports included randomized control trials (two), cohort (three), case/control (one) studies, and one case report. Pooling of the results was unattainable due to the variability among studies in patient criteria, study outcomes, and study designs. Based on the limited reports with insufficient evidence, a recommendation for the use of AZ in the treatment regimen was not possible despite the associated reduction in inflammatory cytokines by AZ administration and the absence of significant adverse effects or mortality in hospital-admitted or ICU patients. While these findings support the current guidelines for the treatment of influenza A infection, the evidence behind these guidelines and treatment characteristics were illustrated. Conclusion AZ shows a potential symptom improvement and pro-inflammatory laboratory indices in influenza A patients. Another positive aspect is the absence of complications associated with AZ administration to critically ill patients and acceptable prognosis. However, it is crucial to have more quality research on this matter that focuses on the indication of the use of AZ, and the timing of initiation, dosage, and duration of treatment while monitoring adverse events.

                Background: Major trauma places substantial demand on critical care services, is a leading cause of death in under 40-year-olds and causes significant morbidity and mortality across all age groups. Various factors influence patient outcome and predefining these could allow prognostication. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of mortality from major trauma in intensive care. Methods: This was a retrospective study of adult trauma patients admitted to general intensive care between January 2018 and December 2019. We assessed the impact on mortality of patient demographics, patterns of injury, injury scores (Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), Charlson’s comorbidity index (CCI), Acute Physiology and Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Probability of Survival Score (Ps19)), number of surgeries and mechanism of injury using logistic regression. Results: A total of 414 patients were included with a median age of 54 years (IQR 34–72). Overall mortality was 18.6%. The most common mechanism of injury was traffic collision (46%). Non-survivors were older, had higher ISS scores with lower GCS on admission and probability of survival scores. Factors independently predictive of mortality were age 70-80 (OR 3.047, p <0.05), age >80 (OR 24.969, p <0.001) and GCS <15 (OR 8.876, p <0.001). Ps19 was the best score for predicting mortality (p <0.001 for each score category), with an AUROC of 0.90. Conclusions: The significant mortality predictors were age, GCS <15 and Ps19. Contrary to previous studies CCI and APACHE II did not significantly predict mortality. Although Ps19 was found to be the best current prognostic score, trauma prognostication would benefit from a single validated scoring system incorporating both physiological variables and injury patterns.

                Background Schizophrenia, with its diverse and complex presentation, is a prime candidate for genetic investigation. Its heritability in both familial and sporadic cases, clinical overlap with other psychiatric conditions, and individual variations in response to treatment contribute to its complexity. Numerous genes and associated biochemical pathways show significant differences at the population, familial, and individual levels. Additionally, schizophrenia may represent an evolutionary trade-off for human brain development, creativity, and intellectual performance. Material and Methods This case pseudo-control study analyzed the whole genomes/exomes of seven Sudanese families with multiple siblings affected by schizophrenia. We examined shared variants among family members, including both cases and controls, and unique variants shared between patients but not controls. These variants were filtered based on their impact on protein function, expression levels, allele frequencies, ACMG classification for rare variants, and disease associations. Networks were created to identify central genes and common biological pathways. Results and Discussion The examination of this complex disorder in Sudanese families revealed numerous variants, both common and rare, showing differences between families and between our population and those reported in the literature. This highlights the challenge of accounting for the known heritability of the disease. Our hierarchical approach demonstrates that schizophrenia’s etiology involves the cumulative effect of various interacting variants in an ascending order of influence. Common variants are shared among all samples, while rare variants are shared among two or three families, most of which are associated with schizophrenia. In conclusion The significance lies not merely in the number of detected variants but in understanding their interactive roles, step by step, to reveal the complete picture of the disease’s phenotype.

                <p>by Bertram Klinger, Isabel Rausch, Anja Sieber, Helmut Kutz, Vanessa Kruse, Marieluise Kirchner, Philipp Mertins, Arnd Kieser, Nils Blüthgen, Dieter Kube</p>

B cell receptor (BCR) signaling is required for the survival and maturation of B cells and is deregulated in B cell lymphomas. While proximal BCR signaling is well studied, little is known about the crosstalk of downstream effector pathways, and a comprehensive quantitative network analysis of BCR signaling is missing. Here, we semi-quantitatively modelled BCR signaling in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells using systematically perturbed phosphorylation data of BL-2 and BL-41 cells. The models unveiled feedback and crosstalk structures in the BCR signaling network, including a negative crosstalk from p38 to MEK/ERK. The relevance of the crosstalk was verified for BCR and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed by global phosphoproteomics on ERK itself and known ERK target sites. Compared to the starting network, the trained network for BL-2 cells was better transferable to BL-41 cells. Moreover, the BL-2 network was also suited to model BCR signaling in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells lines with aberrant BCR signaling (HBL-1, OCI-LY3), indicating that BCR aberration does not cause a major downstream rewiring.

                <p>by Elin K. Falla, Nik J. Cunniffe</p>

Plant viruses threaten food security and are often transmitted by insect vectors. Non-persistently transmitted (NPT) plant viruses are transmitted almost exclusively by aphids. Because virions attach to the aphid’s stylet (mouthparts) and are acquired and inoculated via brief epidermal probes, the aphid–virus interaction is highly transient, with a very short aphid virus retention time. Many NPT viruses manipulate their host plant’s phenotype to change aphid behaviour to optimise virus transmission. Epidemiological models of this have overlooked a key feature of aphid NPT virus retention: probing or feeding on a plant causes aphids to lose the virus. Furthermore, experimental studies suggest aphids could possibly inoculate multiple healthy plants within one infective period if they do not feed. Consequences of this for virus manipulation of host plant phenotype have not been explored. Our new compartmental epidemiological model includes both behaviour-based aphid dispersal and infectivity loss rates, and the ability of infective aphids to probe multiple plants before virus loss. We use our model to explore how NPT virus-induced host phenotypes affect epidemic outcomes, comparing these results to representative previous models. We find that previous models behave fundamentally differently and underestimate the benefit of an ‘attract-and-deter’ phenotype, where the virus induces increased aphid attraction to infected plants but deters them from prolonged feeding. Our results also highlight the importance of characterising NPT virus retention upon the aphid during probing. Allowing for multiple infective probes increases disease incidence and the effectiveness of virus manipulation, with implications for epidemic prediction and control.

The continued scaling of genetic perturbation technologies combined with high-dimensional assays such as cellular microscopy and RNA-sequencing has enabled genome-scale reverse-genetics experiments that go beyond single-endpoint measurements of growth or lethality. Datasets emerging from these experiments can be combined to construct perturbative “maps of biology”, in which readouts from various manipulations (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9 knockout, CRISPRi knockdown, compound treatment) are placed in unified, relatable embedding spaces allowing for the generation of genome-scale sets of pairwise comparisons. These maps of biology capture known biological relationships and uncover new associations which can be used for downstream discovery tasks. Construction of these maps involves many technical choices in both experimental and computational protocols, motivating the design of benchmark procedures to evaluate map quality in a systematic, unbiased manner. Here, we (1) establish a standardized terminology for the steps involved in perturbative map building, (2) introduce key classes of benchmarks to assess the quality of such maps, (3) construct 18 maps from four genome-scale datasets employing different cell types, perturbation technologies, and data readout modalities, (4) generate benchmark metrics for the constructed maps and investigate the reasons for performance variations, and (5) demonstrate utility of these maps to discover new biology by suggesting roles for two largely uncharacterized genes.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011980">Spatial distribution of poultry farms using point pattern modelling: A method to address livestock environmental impacts and disease transmission risks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marie-Cécile Dupas, Francesco Pinotti, Chaitanya Joshi, Madhvi Joshi, Weerapong Thanapongtharm, Madhur Dhingra, Damer Blake, Fiona Tomley, Marius Gilbert, Guillaume Fournié</p>

The distribution of farm locations and sizes is paramount to characterize patterns of disease spread. With some regions undergoing rapid intensification of livestock production, resulting in increased clustering of farms in peri-urban areas, measuring changes in the spatial distribution of farms is crucial to design effective interventions. However, those data are not available in many countries, their generation being resource-intensive. Here, we develop a farm distribution model (FDM), which allows the prediction of locations and sizes of poultry farms in countries with scarce data. The model combines (i) a Log-Gaussian Cox process model to simulate the farm distribution as a spatial Poisson point process, and (ii) a random forest model to simulate farm sizes (i.e. the number of animals per farm). Spatial predictors were used to calibrate the FDM on intensive broiler and layer farm distributions in Bangladesh, Gujarat (Indian state) and Thailand. The FDM yielded realistic farm distributions in terms of spatial clustering, farm locations and sizes, while providing insights on the factors influencing these distributions. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of modelling realistic farm distributions in the context of epidemic spread by simulating pathogen transmission on an array of spatial distributions of farms. We found that farm distributions generated from the FDM yielded spreading patterns consistent with simulations using observed data, while random point patterns underestimated the probability of large outbreaks. Indeed, spatial clustering increases vulnerability to epidemics, highlighting the need to account for it in epidemiological modelling studies. As the FDM maintains a realistic distribution of farm location and sizes, its use to inform mathematical models of disease transmission is particularly relevant for regions where these data are not available.

                <p>by Vanessa Kay Miller, Kendal Broadie</p>

The optimization of brain circuit connectivity based on initial environmental input occurs during critical periods characterized by sensory experience-dependent, temporally restricted, and transiently reversible synapse elimination. This precise, targeted synaptic pruning mechanism is mediated by glial phagocytosis. Serotonin signaling has prominent, foundational roles in the brain, but functions in glia, or in experience-dependent brain circuit synaptic connectivity remodeling, have been relatively unknown. Here, we discover that serotonergic signaling between glia is essential for olfactory experience-dependent synaptic glomerulus pruning restricted to a well-defined <i>Drosophila</i> critical period. We find that experience-dependent serotonin signaling is restricted to the critical period, with both (1) serotonin production and (2) 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors specifically in glia, but not neurons, absolutely required for targeted synaptic glomerulus pruning. We discover that glial 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor signaling limits the experience-dependent synaptic connectivity pruning in the critical period and that conditional reexpression of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors within adult glia reestablishes “critical period-like” experience-dependent synaptic glomerulus pruning at maturity. These results reveal an essential requirement for glial serotonergic signaling mediated by 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors for experience-dependent synapse elimination.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002789">Dog–human vocal interactions match dogs’ sensory-motor tuning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eloïse C. Déaux, Théophane Piette, Florence Gaunet, Thierry Legou, Luc Arnal, Anne-Lise Giraud</p>

Within species, vocal and auditory systems presumably coevolved to converge on a critical temporal acoustic structure that can be best produced and perceived. While dogs cannot produce articulated sounds, they respond to speech, raising the question as to whether this heterospecific receptive ability could be shaped by exposure to speech or remains bounded by their own sensorimotor capacity. Using acoustic analyses of dog vocalisations, we show that their main production rhythm is slower than the dominant (syllabic) speech rate, and that human–dog-directed speech falls halfway in between. Comparative exploration of neural (electroencephalography) and behavioural responses to speech reveals that comprehension in dogs relies on a slower speech rhythm tracking (delta) than humans’ (theta), even though dogs are equally sensitive to speech content and prosody. Thus, the dog audio-motor tuning differs from humans’, and we hypothesise that humans may adjust their speech rate to this shared temporal channel as means to improve communication efficacy.
