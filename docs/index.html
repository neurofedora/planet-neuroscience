<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>As neuroscience techniques become increasingly sophisticatedand accessible, their application to marine mammal research remainsunderdeveloped and fragmented. Cetacean and pinniped brains exhibit remarkableevolutionary specializations; yet systematic, reproducible data across speciesare scarce. Ethical, logistical, and methodological constraints hinder samplingand analysis of central nervous system tissues, often limiting studies to smallcohorts and reducing diagnostic accuracy in neuropathological investigations.Gaps persist in understanding neuroanatomical organization, pathogeneticmechanisms of neurodegeneration, and the effects of acoustic and environmentalstressors on brain health. Noninvasive neuroimaging methods such as post-mortemmagnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging offer promise butsuffer from incompatible protocols and limited standardization. In-vitro andmolecular techniques including cellular reprogramming may provide new avenuesfor translational research if harmonized approaches are adopted. We identify a criticalneed for coordinated efforts to standardize best practice protocols for the sampling, storage and systematic analyses of marine mammal nervous tissues. To this end, we propose the formation of an inclusive, multidisciplinary network and invitecollaboration through our <a href="https://osf.io/e6zg2/?view_only=3ce751a651f245d2a374c6c7dba59e0a">Open Science Framework project</a>. By aligning methodologies and broadeninginternational partnerships, we aim to transform marine mammal neuroscience intoa robust contributor to comparative neurobiology and environmental healthmonitoring. This is a call to action to collectively grow this emerging field.</p>

                arXiv:2507.05268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) enables direct control of external devices by decoding the electroencephalogram (EEG) generated in the brain during imagined movements. However, due to inter-individual variability in brain activity, existing BCI models exhibit poor adaptability across subjects, thereby limiting their generalizability and widespread application. To address this issue, this paper proposes a cross-subject BCI algorithm named Cross-Subject DD (CSDD), which constructs a universal BCI model by extracting common features across subjects. The specific methods include: 1) training personalized models for each subject; 2) transforming personalized models into relation spectrums; 3) identifying common features through statistical analysis; and 4) constructing a cross-subject universal model based on common features. The experiments utilized the BCIC IV 2a dataset, involving nine subjects. Eight of these subjects were selected for training and extracing the common features, and the cross-subject decoding performance of the model was validated on the remaining subject. The results demonstrate that, compared with existing similar methods, our approach achieves a 3.28% improvement in performance. This paper introduces for the first time a novel method for extracting pure common features and constructing a universal cross-subject BCI model, thereby facilitating broader applications of BCI technology.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05888">Hierarchy or Heterarchy? A Theory of Long-Range Connections for the Sensorimotor Brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.05888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the traditional understanding of the neocortex, sensory information flows up a hierarchy of regions, with each level processing increasingly complex features. Information also flows down the hierarchy via a different set of connections. Although the hierarchical model has significant support, many anatomical connections do not conform to the standard hierarchical interpretation. In addition, hierarchically arranged regions sometimes respond in parallel, not sequentially as would occur in a hierarchy. This and other evidence suggests that two regions can act in parallel and hierarchically at the same time. Given this flexibility, the word "heterarchy" might be a more suitable term to describe neocortical organization. This paper proposes a new interpretation of how sensory and motor information is processed in the neocortex. The key to our proposal is what we call the "Thousand Brains Theory", which posits that every cortical column is a sensorimotor learning system. Columns learn by integrating sensory input over multiple movements of a sensor. In this view, even primary and secondary regions, such as V1 and V2, can learn and recognize complete 3D objects. This suggests that the hierarchical connections between regions are used to learn the compositional structure of parent objects composed of smaller child objects. We explain the theory by examining the different types of long-range connections between cortical regions and between the neocortex and thalamus. We describe these connections, and then suggest the specific roles they play in the context of a heterarchy of sensorimotor regions. We also suggest that the thalamus plays an essential role in transforming the pose between objects and sensors. The novel perspective we argue for here has broad implications for both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06041">Spin-Based Modeling of Perception as Emergent from contextualized Internal Evaluation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.06041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic model of perception of an interoceptive sensation in which spin-like variables encode an organism's internal evaluation of embodied vital norms associated with the sensation. Spins can take positive, negative, or neutral values. These local valorizations interact on a lattice embedded in the environmental context, and their collective configuration gives rise to a macroscopic perceptual state. By applying a coarse-graining procedure to a family of symmetric spin models, we derive a macroscopic Landau-type functional that makes explicit the mechanism by which key phenomenological features of perception, emerge from microscopic evaluative interactions. A central result is that the inclusion of a neutral evaluative state fundamentally alters the structure of the perceptual landscape, enhancing entropy, lowering the critical threshold, and increasing sensitivity to contextual input. These results establish a principled link between microscopic evaluative processes and large-scale perceptual organization, offering a flexible framework for integrating perceptual regulation and neurobiological modeling. The model integrates notions of neuroscience and cognitive science using the formalism of condensed matter field theory and providing novel theoretical insights and experimental predictions for conditions such as mental disorders and chronic pain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06108">Miniaturized optically-generated Bessel beam ultrasound for volumetric transcranial brain stimulation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.06108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-invasive stimulation of small, variably shaped brain sub-regions is crucial for advancing our understanding of brain functions. Current ultrasound neuromodulation faces two significant trade-offs when targeting brain sub-regions: miniaturization versus volumetric control and spatial resolution versus transcranial capability. Here, we present an optically-generated Bessel beam ultrasound (OBUS) device designed to overcome these limitations. This 2.33 mm-diameter miniaturized device delivers a column-shaped field achieving a lateral resolution of 152 um and an axial resolution of 1.93 mm, targeting brain sub-regions with an elongated volume of tissue activation. Immunofluorescence imaging of mouse brain slices confirms its ability to stimulate cells at a depth of 2.2 mm. Additionally, OBUS outperforms conventional Gaussian ultrasound in transcranial transmission efficiency and beam shape preservation. Electrophysiological recordings and functional MRI captured rodent brain responses evoked by OBUS, demonstrating OBUS's ability to non-invasively activate neural circuits in intact brains. This technology offers new possibilities for studying brain functions with precision and volumetric control.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06136">A Linear Generative Framework for Structure-Function Coupling in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.06136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain function emerges from coordinated activity across anatomically connected regions, where structural connectivity (SC) -- the network of white matter pathways - provides the physical substrate for functional connectivity (FC) -- the correlated neural activity between brain areas. While these structural and functional networks exhibit substantial overlap, their relationship involves complex, indirect mechanisms, including the dynamic interplay of direct and indirect pathways, recurrent network interactions, and neuromodulatory influences. To systematically untangle how structural architecture shapes functional patterns, this work aims to establish a set of rules that decode how direct and indirect structural connections and motifs give rise to FC between brain regions. Specifically, using a generative linear model, we derive explicit rules that predict an individual's resting-state fMRI FC from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-derived SC, validated against topological null models. Examining the rules reveals distinct classes of brain regions, with integrator hubs acting as structural linchpins promoting synchronization and mediator hubs serving as structural fulcrums orchestrating competing dynamics. Through virtual lesion experiments, we demonstrate how different cortical and subcortical systems distinctively contribute to global functional organization. Together, this framework disentangles the mechanisms by which structural architecture drives functional dynamics, enabling the prediction of how pathological or surgical disruptions to brain connectivity cascade through functional networks, potentially leading to cognitive and behavioral impairments.

                arXiv:2507.05263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in graph data analysis due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, as the network depth increases, the issue of over-smoothing becomes more severe, causing node representations to lose their distinctiveness. This paper analyzes the mechanism of over-smoothing through the analogy to Anderson localization and introduces participation degree as a metric to quantify this phenomenon. Specifically, as the depth of the GNN increases, node features homogenize after multiple layers of message passing, leading to a loss of distinctiveness, similar to the behavior of vibration modes in disordered systems. In this context, over-smoothing in GNNs can be understood as the expansion of low-frequency modes (increased participation degree) and the localization of high-frequency modes (decreased participation degree). Based on this, we systematically reviewed the potential connection between the Anderson localization behavior in disordered systems and the over-smoothing behavior in Graph Neural Networks. A theoretical analysis was conducted, and we proposed the potential of alleviating over-smoothing by reducing the disorder in information propagation.

                arXiv:2507.05505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of neural computation aims to understand the function of a neural system as an information processing machine. Neural systems are undoubtedly complex, necessitating principled and automated tools to abstract away details to organize and incrementally build intuition. We argue that systems with the same effective behavior should be abstracted by their ideal representative, i.e., archetype, defined by its asymptotic dynamical structure. We propose a library of archetypical computations and a new measure of dissimilarity that allows us to group systems based on their effective behavior by explicitly considering both deformations that break topological conjugacy as well as diffeomorphisms that preserve it. The proposed dissimilarity can be estimated from observed trajectories. Numerical experiments demonstrate our method's ability to overcome previously reported fragility of existing (dis)similarity measures for approximate continuous attractors and high-dimensional recurrent neural networks. Although our experiments focus on working memory systems, our theoretical approach naturally extends to general mechanistic interpretation of recurrent dynamics in both biological and artificial neural systems. We argue that abstract dynamical archetypes, rather than detailed dynamical systems, offer a more useful vocabulary for describing neural computation.

We hypothesize that humans leverage experience on one task to preemptively learn solutions to other tasks that were accessible but not pursued. We formalize this idea as Multitask Preplay, a novel algorithm that replays experience on one task as the starting point for "preplay" -- counterfactual simulation of an accessible but unpursued task. Preplay is used to learn a predictive representation that can support fast, adaptive task performance later on. We first show that, compared to traditional planning and predictive representation methods, multitask preplay better predicts how humans generalize to tasks that were accessible but not pursued in a small grid-world, even when people didn't know they would need to generalize to these tasks. We then show these predictions generalize to Craftax, a partially observable 2D Minecraft environment. Finally, we show that Multitask Preplay enables artificial agents to learn behaviors that transfer to novel Craftax worlds sharing task co-occurrence structure. These findings demonstrate that Multitask Preplay is a scalable theory of how humans counterfactually learn and generalize across multiple tasks; endowing artificial agents with the same capacity can significantly improve their performance in challenging multitask environments.

Abstract: We propose EEG2TEXT-CN, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents one of the earliest open-vocabulary EEG-to-text generation frameworks tailored for Chinese. Built on a biologically grounded EEG encoder (NICE-EEG) and a compact pretrained language model (MiniLM), our architecture aligns multichannel brain signals with natural language representations via masked pretraining and contrastive learning. Using a subset of the ChineseEEG dataset, where each sentence contains approximately ten Chinese characters aligned with 128-channel EEG recorded at 256 Hz, we segment EEG into per-character embeddings and predict full sentences in a zero-shot setting. The decoder is trained with teacher forcing and padding masks to accommodate variable-length sequences. Evaluation on over 1,500 training-validation sentences and 300 held-out test samples shows promising lexical alignment, with a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38\%. While syntactic fluency remains a challenge, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of non-phonetic, cross-modal language decoding from EEG. This work opens a new direction in multilingual brain-to-text research and lays the foundation for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.

                arXiv:2507.05534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two representation alternatives for the controllers of teams of cyber agents. We combine these controller representations with different evolutionary algorithms, one of which introduces a novel LLM-supported mutation operator. Using a cyber security scenario, we evaluate agent learning when one side is trained to compete against a side that does not evolve and when two sides coevolve with each other. This allows us to quantify the relative merits and tradeoffs of representation and algorithm combinations in terms of team performance. Our versions of grammatical evolution algorithms using grammars that allow a controller to be expressed in code-like logic can achieve the best team performance. The scenario also allows us to compare the performance impact and dynamics of coevolution versus evolution under different combinations. Across the algorithms and representations, we observe that coevolution reduces the performance highs and lows of both sides while it induces fluctuations on both sides. In contrast, when only one-side is optimized, performance peaks are higher and is more sustained than when both sides are optimized with coevolution.

                arXiv:2507.05847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale multi-objective optimization poses challenges to existing evolutionary algorithms in maintaining the performances of convergence and diversity because of high dimensional decision variables. Inspired by the motion of particles in physics, we propose a universal framework for large-scale multi-objective optimization based on particle drift and diffusion to solve these challenges in this paper. This framework innovatively divides the optimization process into three sub-stages: two coarse-tuning sub-stages and one fine-tuning sub-stage. Different strategies of drift-diffusion operations are performed on the guiding solutions according to the current sub-stage, ingeniously simulating the movement of particles under diverse environmental conditions. Finally, representative evolutionary algorithms are embedded into the proposed framework, and their effectiveness are evaluated through comparative experiments on various large-scale multi-objective problems with 1000 to 5000 decision variables. Moreover, comparative algorithms are conducted on neural network training problems to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in the practical problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the framework proposed in this paper significantly enhances the performance of convergence and diversity of MOEAs, and improves the computational efficiency of algorithms in solving large-scale multi-objective optimization problems.

Abstract: Dataless neural networks represent a paradigm shift in applying neural architectures to combinatorial optimization problems, eliminating the need for training datasets by encoding problem instances directly into network parameters. Despite the pioneering work of Alkhouri et al. (2022) demonstrating the viability of dataless approaches for the Maximum Independent Set problem, our comprehensive literature review reveals that no published work has extended these methods to the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). This paper addresses this gap by presenting the first dataless neural network approach for RCPSP, providing a complete mathematical framework that transforms discrete scheduling constraints into differentiable objectives suitable for gradient-based optimization. Our approach leverages smooth relaxations and automatic differentiation to unlock GPU parallelization for project scheduling, traditionally a domain of sequential algorithms. We detail the mathematical formulation for both precedence and renewable resource constraints, including a memory-efficient dense time-grid representation. Implementation and comprehensive experiments on PSPLIB benchmark instances (J30, J60, and J120) are currently underway, with empirical results to be reported in an updated version of this paper.

                arXiv:2507.05565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as robustness, has garnered significant attention. Recently, metamorphic testing that defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate the robustness of LLM executions. However, the MR-based robustness testing still requires a scalable number of MRs, thereby necessitating the optimization of selecting MRs. Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically generating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection. Additionally, most studies only considered a limited test space of single perturbation MRs in their evaluation of LLMs. In contrast, our paper proposes a search-based approach for optimizing the MR groups to maximize failure detection and minimize the LLM execution cost. Moreover, our approach covers the combinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in the robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented four search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel encoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing. We conducted comparative experiments on the four search algorithms along with a random search, using two major LLMs with primary Text-to-Text tasks. Our statistical and empirical investigation revealed two key findings: (1) the MOEA/D algorithm performed the best in optimizing the MR space for LLM robustness testing, and (2) we identified silver bullet MRs for the LLM robustness testing, which demonstrated dominant capabilities in confusing LLMs across different Text-to-Text tasks. In LLM robustness assessment, our research sheds light on the fundamental problem for optimized testing and provides insights into search-based solutions.

                arXiv:2507.05583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical computing holds promise for high-speed, energy-efficient information processing, with diffractive optical networks emerging as a flexible platform for implementing task-specific transformations. A challenge, however, is the effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser, holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance. Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing promises to transform AI systems by enabling them to perceive, respond to, and adapt swiftly and accurately to dynamic data and user interactions. However, traditional silicon-based and hybrid electronic technologies for artificial neurons constrain neuromorphic processors in terms of flexibility, scalability, and energy efficiency. In this study, we pioneer the use of Doped-Gain-Layer-on-Waveguide-Synapses for bio-inspired neurons, utilizing a pulsed pump-signal mechanism to enhance neuromorphic computation. This approach addresses critical challenges in scalability and energy efficiency inherent in current technologies.
  We introduce the concept of Gain on Waveguide Dynamics for synapses, demonstrating how non-linear pulse transformations of input probe signals occur under various pump-probe configurations. Our findings reveal that primarily properties of pulse amplitude, period as well material properties such as doping densities and population dynamics influence strongly the generation of spiking responses that emulate neuronal behaviour and effectively how computational logic is. By harnessing the complex interactions of asynchronous spiking pump techniques and ion densities in excited states, our method produces event-driven responses that mirror natural neuronal functions. This gain-enhanced environment supports short-term memory capabilities alongside essential characteristics like asynchronous spike generation, threshold operation, and temporal integration, foundational to brain-inspired spiking neural network paradigms.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Multiple Signal Classification algorithm is a powerful technique for high-resolution direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in array signal processing. However, the exhaustive search over the 2D an-gular domain leads to high computa-tional cost, limiting its applicability in real-time scenarios. In this work, we reformulate the peak-finding process as a multimodal optimization prob-lem, and propose a Differential Evolu-tion algorithm with Neighborhood Mutation (DE-NM) to efficiently lo-cate multiple spectral peaks without requiring dense grid sampling. Simu-lation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable estimation accuracy to the traditional grid search, while significantly reduc-ing computation time. This strategy presents a promising solution for real-time, high-resolution DOA estimation in practical applications. The imple-mentation code is available at https://github.com/zzb-nice/DOA_multimodel_optimize.

Abstract: Physical reservoir computing is an innovative idea for using physical phenomena as computational resources. Recent research has revealed that information processing techniques can improve the performance, but for practical applications, it is equally important to study the level of performance with a simple design that is easy to construct experimentally.

In this paper, we discuss the appropriate design of this reservoir, its performance, and its limitations.

Abstract: evortran is a modern Fortran library designed for high-performance genetic algorithms and evolutionary optimization. evortran can be used to tackle a wide range of problems in high-energy physics and beyond, such as derivative-free parameter optimization, complex search taks, parameter scans and fitting experimental data under the presence of instrumental noise. The library is built as an fpm package with flexibility and efficiency in mind, while also offering a simple installation process, user interface and integration into existing Fortran programs. evortran offers a variety of selection, crossover, mutation and elitism strategies, with which users can tailor an evolutionary algorithm to their specific needs. evortran supports different abstraction levels: from operating directly on individuals and populations, to running full evolutionary cycles, and even enabling migration between independently evolving populations to enhance convergence and maintain diversity. In this paper, we present the functionality of the evortran library, demonstrate its capabilities with example benchmark applications, and compare its performance with existing genetic algorithm frameworks. As physics-motivated applications, we use evortran to confront extended Higgs sectors with LHC data and to reconstruct gravitational wave spectra and the underlying physical parameters from LISA mock data, demonstrating its effectiveness in realistic, data-driven scenarios.

                arXiv:2507.06148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, SoftReMish, a new activation function designed to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks, is proposed. Using the MNIST dataset, a standard CNN architecture consisting of two convolutional layers, max pooling, and fully connected layers was implemented. SoftReMish was evaluated against popular activation functions including ReLU, Tanh, and Mish by replacing the activation function in all trainable layers. The model performance was assessed in terms of minimum training loss and maximum validation accuracy. Results showed that SoftReMish achieved a minimum loss (3.14e-8) and a validation accuracy (99.41%), outperforming all other functions tested. These findings demonstrate that SoftReMish offers better convergence behavior and generalization capability, making it a promising candidate for visual recognition tasks.

                arXiv:2503.19166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest within the theoretical community in analytically studying multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. This runtime analysis-focused research can help formally understand algorithm behaviour, explain empirical observations, and provide theoretical insights to support algorithm development and exploration. However, the test problems commonly used in the theoretical analysis are predominantly limited to problems with heavy "artificial" characteristics (e.g., symmetric, homogeneous objectives and linear Pareto fronts), which may not be able to well represent realistic scenarios. In this paper, we first discuss commonly used multi-objective functions in the theory domain and systematically review their features, limitations and implications to practical use. Then, we present several new functions with more realistic features, such as heterogenous objectives, local optimality and nonlinearity of the Pareto front, through simply mixing and matching classical single-objective functions in the area (e.g., LeadingOnes, Jump and RoyalRoad). We hope these functions can enrich the existing test problem suites, and strengthen the connection between theoretic and practical research.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19256">Enhancing Generalization of Spiking Neural Networks Through Temporal Regularization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.19256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly effective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process, revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading to significant improvements in model generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/ZBX05/Temporal-Regularization-Training.

Abstract: Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a nature-inspired stochastic meta-heuristic of the swarm intelligence field that mimics the hunting behavior of grey wolves. Differential evolution (DE) is a popular stochastic algorithm of the evolutionary computation field that is well suited for global optimization. In this part, we introduce a new algorithm based on the hybridization of GWO and two DE variants, namely the GWO-DE algorithm. We evaluate the new algorithm by applying various numerical benchmark functions. The numerical results of the comparative study are quite satisfactory in terms of performance and solution quality.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03113">Balancing Efficiency and Expressiveness: Subgraph GNNs with Walk-Based Centrality</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.03113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subgraph GNNs have emerged as promising architectures that overcome the expressiveness limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by processing bags of subgraphs. Despite their compelling empirical performance, these methods are afflicted by a high computational complexity: they process bags whose size grows linearly in the number of nodes, hindering their applicability to larger graphs. In this work, we propose an effective and easy-to-implement approach to dramatically alleviate the computational cost of Subgraph GNNs and unleash broader applications thereof. Our method, dubbed HyMN, leverages walk-based centrality measures to sample a small number of relevant subgraphs and drastically reduce the bag size. By drawing a connection to perturbation analysis, we highlight the strength of the proposed centrality-based subgraph sampling, and further prove that these walk-based centralities can be additionally used as Structural Encodings for improved discriminative power. A comprehensive set of experimental results demonstrates that HyMN provides an effective synthesis of expressiveness, efficiency, and downstream performance, unlocking the application of Subgraph GNNs to dramatically larger graphs. Not only does our method outperform more sophisticated subgraph sampling approaches, it is also competitive, and sometimes better, than other state-of-the-art approaches for a fraction of their runtime.

                arXiv:2504.08814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging field that harnesses advances in Quantum Computing (QC) to improve the scalability and efficiency of decentralized Federated Learning (FL) models. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of the emerging problems and solutions when FL meets QC, from research protocol to a novel taxonomy, particularly focusing on both quantum and federated limitations, such as their architectures, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and privacy preservation, so on. This work explores key developments and integration strategies, along with the impact of quantum computing on FL, keeping a sharp focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches. The paper offers an in-depth understanding of how the strengths of QC, such as gradient hiding, state entanglement, quantum key distribution, quantum security, and quantum-enhanced differential privacy, have been integrated into FL to ensure the privacy of participants in an enhanced, fast, and secure framework. Finally, this study proposes potential future directions to address the identified research gaps and challenges, aiming to inspire faster and more secure QFL models for practical use.

                <p>Mazes are a fundamental and widespread tool in behavior and systems neuroscience research in rodents, especially in spatial navigation and spatial memory investigations in <I>ad libitum</I> behaving animals. However, their form and inflexibility often restrict potential experimental paradigms that involve multiple or adaptive maze designs. Unique layouts often lead to elevated costs, whether financially or in terms of time investment from scientists. To alleviate these issues, we have developed an automated, modular maze system that is flexible and scalable. This open-source Adapt-A-Maze (AAM) system will allow for experiments with multiple track configurations in rapid succession. Additionally, the flexibility can expedite prototyping of behavioral paradigms. Automation ensures less variability in experimental parameters and higher throughput. Finally, the standardized componentry enhances experimental repeatability within labs and replicability across labs. Our maze was successfully used across labs, in multiple experimental designs, with and without extracellular or optical recordings, in rats. The AAM system presents multiple advantages over current maze options and can facilitate novel behavior and systems neuroscience research.</p>

                <p>Our ability to shift from one emotion to the next allows us to adapt our behaviors to a constantly changing and often uncertain environment. Although previous studies have identified cortical and subcortical regions involved in affective responding, none have shown how these regions track and represent transitions between different emotional states, nor how such responses are modulated based on the recent emotional context. To study this, we commissioned new musical pieces designed to systematically move participants (<I>N</I> = 39, 20 males and 19 females) through different emotional states during fMRI and to manipulate the emotional context in which different participants heard a musical motif. Using a combination of data-driven (hidden Markov modeling) and hypothesis-driven methods, we confirmed that spatiotemporal patterns of activation along the temporoparietal axis reflect transitions between music-evoked emotions. We found that the spatial and temporal signatures of these neural response patterns, as well as self-reported emotion ratings, were sensitive to the emotional context in which the music was heard. In particular, brain-state transitions associated with emotional changes occurred earlier in time when the preceding affective state was of a similar valence to the current affective state. The findings argue that emotional changes are an essential signal by which the temporoparietal lobe segments our continuous experiences, and further clarify its role in linking changes in external auditory signals with our dynamic and contextually dependent emotional responses.</p>

                Background Periodontitis is a multifactorial inflammatory disease characterized by the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. Proinflammatory markers such as IL-8, PGE2, and CRP play key roles in its pathogenesis and are also elevated in systemic conditions like COVID-19. Shared inflammatory pathways and increased ACE2 expression suggest a potential link between periodontitis and COVID-19. However, the long-term impact of COVID-19 on periodontal health remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the association between ACE2, IL-8, PGE2, CRP, and clinical periodontal parameters in individuals with and without a history of COVID-19. Methods A case-control study was conducted involving 47 participants from RSKGM FKG UI and Bhayangkara Hospital TK.I.R. Said Sukanto. Clinical parameters assessed included bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL). Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) was collected to analyze ACE2, IL-8, PGE2, and CRP levels. Participants were grouped based on COVID-19 history, with strict inclusion criteria and statistical analysis using G*Power, SPSS, and GraphPad Prism. Results ACE2, CRP, and IL-8 levels were significantly higher in individuals with a history of COVID-19 (p = 0.000, p = 0.000, and p = 0.006, respectively), while PGE2 showed a non-significant trend (p = 0.065). No significant differences were observed in BOP, PPD, and CAL between groups. CRP levels were significantly elevated in both periodontitis and non-periodontitis groups with a COVID-19 history. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between ACE2 and other biomarkers (IL-8, PGE2, CRP), as well as between IL-8 and clinical parameters (PPD, CAL). Conclusion This study indicates a correlation between elevated levels of ACE2, IL-8, PGE2, and CRP and the severity of periodontitis in individuals with a history of COVID-19. These findings emphasize the necessity for further research and periodontal care for patients with COVID-19 history.

                Psychoactive substances alter perception, mood, cognition, or consciousness and include a wide range of compounds such as alcohol, marijuana, nicotine, and khat. Substance use among college and university students is associated with significant health issues, academic struggles, and premature death. This scoping review examines digital health interventions, including mobile and internet platforms, targeting substance use reduction among college students in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A comprehensive search across databases such as PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Google Scholar identified 11 eligible studies conducted across seven countries between 2013 and 2025. These studies focused primarily on alcohol use and included digital health tools like instant messaging, Telegram applications, text messaging, and web-based interventions. The results suggest that digital health technologies can effectively motivate college students in LMICs to reduce or abstain from psychoactive substance use. However, there is a notable research gap in evaluating the effectiveness and feasibility of these tools, especially mobile text messaging, which remains one of the most widely used methods in LMICs. The review highlights the need for further research, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, to better understand the impact of digital health interventions on substance use reduction and to develop evidence-based programs for behavior change.

                Background Migration is a social determinant of health, and migrants often face health inequalities compared to host populations. Migrants are underrepresented in health research in many European countries, including Belgium, which is concerning. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a comprehensive framework aimed at guiding research on migration and health within the WHO European Region. This study supports evidence-based policymaking among European member states by providing a foundational structure for examining various strategies and methodologies. The framework serves as a catalyst for discussion and critical analysis, contributing to the formulation of a global research agenda on migration and health under WHO’s leadership. Additionally, it outlines key research priorities and offers strategic recommendations to enhance the understanding and response to health issues related to migration. One of these recommendations calls on researchers to “maximise the use of existing data from research and routinely collected data in health information systems”. Objective The overarching aim of our study is to map available sources of datasets about access to and use of medicines among migrant populations, and test if and under which conditions they can be used in research, by taking the case of Flanders, Belgium. Methods This study will involve conducting a focused review to map datasets used for reporting access to and use of medicines among migrants, followed by a qualitative study with key informants; a structured analysis of ethical and legal challenges to be addressed when using the datasets we identified for research; and content description and evaluation of the different identified datasets. Results We assert that the results of our study will help presenting the diverse sources of data about medicines access or use among migrant populations. They will be also used to provide recommendations about enhancing the possibilities of retrieving, and using data, including recommendations for (legal, ethical, methodological) risk mitigation for retrieving and using these data.

                Background Black Soldier Fly (BSF) larvae is a promising alternative source for animal feed due to their ability to convert organic waste into high-quality biomass rich in essential amino acids and beneficial fatty acids. However, the post-harvest processing method is crucial affecting nutritional value. This study evaluated the effects of five processing methods (air-drying, sun-drying, oven-drying, microwave-drying, and roasting) on the amino acid and fatty acid profiles of BSF larvae reared on rice bran, milk waste, and slaughterhouse waste combined substrate. Methods BSF larvae were reared for seven days on a combined substrate consisting of rice bran, milk waste, and slaughterhouse waste. After harvesting, the larvae underwent five different drying treatments until a constant weight was achieved. The dried larvae were ground into powder and analyzed for amino acid and fatty acid profiles. Results BSF larvae meal contained substantial amounts of essential amino acids, particularly lysine (1.76–2.41%), leucine (1.46–2.11%), and valine (1.41–1.77%). Fatty acid profiles of BSF larvae meal were predominantly composed of lauric acid (22.07–24.88%), palmitoleic acid (22.84–27.89%), and linolelaidic acid (20.95–23.86%). Microwave drying retained the highest levels of essential amino acids and fatty acids. Oven drying provided balanced retention, while roasting effectively preserved key fatty acids but posed a risk of amino acid degradation. Sun drying and air-drying maintained monounsaturated fatty acids and key amino acids, offering a cost-effective alternative despite the prolonged drying period. Conclusions Microwave drying is the most effective method for preserving the nutritional quality of BSF larvae meal, but other methods offer practical advantages depending on resource availability and processing goals. Future research should explore hybrid drying techniques, optimization of processing conditions, and long-term stability assessments to enhance the efficiency and applicability of BSF larvae meal as a sustainable feed ingredient.

                Background Performance monitoring is essential for enhancing academic staff productivity and institutional accountability in higher education. In Uganda, private chartered universities face challenges in implementing effective performance monitoring systems. This study examines the types and effectiveness of these systems in private chartered universities in Western Uganda. Methods The study was guided by Fayol’s Administrative Management Theory and Vroom’s Expectancy Theory. A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods design was employed. Quantitative data were collected from 386 academic staff using structured questionnaires, while qualitative data were gathered through in-depth interviews with 10 academic deans from four selected universities. Ethical approval was obtained from institutional review boards and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (SS3145ES). Descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analyses were used to analyze quantitative data, while thematic analysis was used for qualitative responses. Results Findings indicate that various performance monitoring tools are in use, including student evaluations, peer reviews, and supervisory assessments. However, their application is often inconsistent, with limited feedback loops and weak integration into staff development initiatives. Quantitative analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation between effective performance monitoring and academic staff performance (r = 0.48, p < 0.05). Regression analysis showed that performance monitoring accounted for 21.3% of the variance in staff performance. Conclusions While performance monitoring tools are present in private chartered universities in Western Uganda, their inconsistent implementation undermines their effectiveness. Strengthening the integration of monitoring outcomes into professional development and decision-making processes could enhance academic staff performance. These findings underscore the need for systematic policy enforcement and capacity-building in performance management practices within the sector.

                Chickenpox is an extremely contagious disease caused by a primary varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection. This case report describes a rare transmission of chickenpox potentially linked to an indirect route via surface contamination rather than direct person-to-person contact. A 27-year-old adult Black African male health care worker presented with severe headache, intermittent weakness and inability to walk, intermittent nausea, fever, shortness of breath, itching, pruritus, lesions with pus on the skin, sleep disturbances, and nightmares for two days. In this case report, the patient’s face, neck, and scapulae were the most infected areas of the body, and the rest of the body, except the legs, hands, genital areas, and buttocks, was also highly infected. Chickenpox was confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), positive IgM, viral culture, and low IgG. Acyclovir 800 mg orally, five times a day, was given for ten days to treat chickenpox infection because acyclovir inhibits varicella zoster virus replication. It is typically unable to eradicate VZV from the latent state in neurons. The patient showed marked improvement within a week and fully recovered without complications or post-herpetic sequelae. This case emphasizes the importance of strict infection control and hygiene protocols in preventing rare indirect transmission of the VZV, particularly in healthcare settings.

Development and association with symptoms of depression and anxiety. [version 2; peer review: 1 approve</a></h4>

              
                Background There is a need to go beyond mere measures of time used on social media. Existing tools inadequately capture the multidimensional nature of social media use, leaving a gap for concise yet comprehensive assessment tools. Aims This study aimed to develop a short questionnaire addressing three critical dimensions of social media use: self-presentation, negative experiences, and problematic use. The association between these dimensions and symptoms of anxiety and depression was also investigated. Methods This study uses two independent datasets of adolescents aged 16+ years in Norway. Using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) analyses, a pool of 31 social media items was analyzed to investigate factor structure and associations with symptoms of anxiety and depression. For model development, the “LifeOnSoMe”-study was employed (>3,500 participants), and data from a pilot study (~500 participants) was used for external validation. Results Based on ACO-analyses, a 20-item six-factor model was identified, encompassing social comparison and self-presentation (five items), and three items for each of the following domains: negative experiences (Negative acts and Unwanted attention from others) and problematic use (Subjective overuse, Social obligations, and Source of concern). Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated very good to excellent fit in both datasets, and consistent associations between the six different domains and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Discussion The proposed 20-item questionnaire captures six important aspects of social media use, and it may serve as a meaningful tool for assessing the potential association between social media use and mental health and related outcomes.

The COVID-19 pandemic and related non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) significantly alter the transmission dynamics of non-SARS-CoV-2 infectious diseases, with respiratory infections such as influenza being disproportionately affected. We aim to compare influenza’s epidemiological characteristics between pre-pandemic and post-pandemic periods to inform public health responses. We develop two influenza transmission models incorporating age structure and multi-strain dynamics, featuring time-varying transmission and mortality rates. Using publicly available U.S. data, we calibrate these models to evaluate age- and strain-specific transmission patterns and mortality rates across different pandemic eras. Our analysis reveals that during the final pandemic year, influenza transmission among adults (≥18 years) initially declined but rebounded to pre-pandemic levels within the first post-pandemic year following NPI relaxation and behavioral normalization, while transmission stability persists in the <18 cohort. All-age influenza mortality rates exhibit a transient elevation during the pandemic’s final year before returning to baseline levels pre-pandemic. Furthermore, after the COVID-19 pandemic, the transmission rate of influenza A decreases alongside peaks in new cases, while the transmission of influenza B fluctuates without a decline. Our findings indicate that while the COVID-19 pandemic has induced significant transient modifications in influenza’s epidemiological profile, key transmission and mortality characteristics regain pre-pandemic equilibrium within one year following pandemic resolution.

Open Educational Resources (OER) offer a transformative approach to education by providing freely accessible learning materials. However, creating OER that meet the FAIR principles—findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable—while navigating the complexities of copyright law presents unique challenges. This paper serves as a practical guide for educators and institutions wishing to develop and share FAIR-compliant OER while respecting intellectual property rights. It presents 10 quick tips that guide the process of developing legally secure FAIR OER from planning to creation to publication, including considerations for AI-generated materials. These quick tips cover critical aspects such as understanding licensing options, cataloguing resources to ensure comprehensive attribution, and effectively managing copyright concerns. By following these guidelines, educators can improve the discoverability and reusability of their materials, streamline the creation process, and contribute to a more open and collaborative educational landscape. This comprehensive approach not only supports the widespread dissemination of knowledge but also empowers educators to innovate and share resources effectively, fostering a global community of open science and education practice, while adhering legal regulations.

                <p>by Cassandra E. Benkwitt, Anna Zora, Ameer Ebrahim, Rodney Govinden, Ines D. Lange, Sean Evans, Melissa Schulze, Emma Cotton, Lucie Bennett, Nicholas A. J. Graham</p>

Cross-ecosystem nutrient fluxes can influence recipient food webs, including both static measures of structure and dynamic measures of function. However, a mechanistic basis for how nutrient subsidies affect both structure and function across multiple trophic levels is still lacking. Here, we investigate how nutrient subsidies provided by seabirds influence coral reefs, focusing on the link between primary producers and primary consumers. We quantified turf algal cover and herbivorous fish biomass (static metrics of structure), as well as productivity of turf algae and herbivorous fish (dynamic metrics of function) at sites in the inner Seychelles with a range of seabird densities due to different rat invasion histories. Turf algae grew faster with increasing amounts of seabird-derived nutrients. These higher rates of primary productivity, in turn, fueled higher productivity and biomass of herbivorous fishes. In contrast, seabird-derived nutrients did not increase cover of turf algae nor did turf algal cover affect herbivores. Instead, seabird nutrients indirectly enhanced herbivorous fish productivity and biomass via effects on primary productivity, which, in turn, led to increased top-down control by herbivores to limit turf algal cover. Overall, dynamic metrics better revealed the flow and effects of seabird-derived nutrients through coral-reef food chains and revealed the mechanisms by which seabirds can enhance coral-reef ecosystem function. These findings could be used to predict the benefits of removing introduced rats from islands, which can increase seabird populations and restore nutrient connectivity, thus potentially enhancing ecosystem function across multiple trophic levels on coral reefs.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The anterior and posterior hippocampus exhibit distinct patterns of connectivity and are consequently hypothesized to have distinct functions. While there is evidence that the posterior hippocampus interacts with the default network and the anterior hippocampus interacts with the attention network during memory processes, there are conflicting hypotheses regarding connectivity between the hippocampus and other brain regions during rest. If hippocampal connectivity during rest parallels connectivity during memory, we would expect the anterior hippocampus and posterior hippocampus to have preferential connectivity with the attention network and the default network, respectively. Alternatively, given the association between the hippocampus and the default network, both regions of the hippocampus may have similar levels of connectivity with the default network. We used data from the Human Connectome Project (with 864 participants) to investigate resting-state functional connectivity with the anterior and posterior hippocampus and evaluated the degree of overlap between these patterns of connectivity and the attention network and default network. In direct opposition to the connectivity pattern during memory, resting-state data revealed preferential connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and the default network and between the posterior hippocampus and the attention network. These findings indicate that connectivity with the anterior and posterior hippocampus may differ between rest and active memory processing. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that, during rest, the specific connectivity patterns supporting memory are less engaged. This does not imply an overall suppression of hippocampal connectivity but rather a relative reduction in engagement with the attention and default networks compared to task-based memory states. Such a shift may facilitate more dynamic network reconfiguration during memory encoding and retrieval.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Valproic acid (VPA), a first-line antiepileptic and mood-stabilizing drug, has been linked to congenital malformations, cognitive disabilities, and an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) when used during pregnancy. ASD is a lifelong developmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, repetitive behaviors, and cognitive deficits, with a higher prevalence in males. Growing evidence highlights that hippocampal circuits, particularly CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) subregions, are crucial for cognitive and social functions often impaired in ASD. Notably, VPA exposure at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) coincides with critical neurodevelopmental processes in the hippocampus, making it highly susceptible to oxidative damage and structural disruptions. Using a mouse model of ASD induced by a single prenatal VPA injection (400 mg/kg) at E12.5, this study assessed morphological and oxidative changes in the hippocampus. Male and female offspring were evaluated for core behavioral and cognitive alterations of ASD. After the behavioral tests, their brains were processed for Golgi-Cox staining and antioxidant enzyme dosage. The results showed that prenatal exposure to VPA indeed induces ASD-like behaviors, including reduced sociability, increased repetitive behaviors, and impaired working memory. Sholl analysis showed increased dendritic branching in granule and CA1 pyramidal neurons of VPA male mice, while VPA female mice exhibited hypoarborization in dentate gyrus granule cells. Both male and female VPA mice displayed higher dendritic spine density. Concurrently, oxidative stress was increased in the hippocampi of the VPA mice, as evidenced by alterations in oxidative stress biomarkers. Our work underscores gender differences in the effects of prenatal VPA exposure and points to a possible role for hippocampal neuron morphology and oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of ASD.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neurons linked to spatial navigation and toroidal dynamics in the mouse medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) show unexpected minute-scale (&lt; 0.01 Hz) oscillatory sequences without neural organization or clear relation to behavior. However, the conditions sustaining these’ ultraslow' equences remain uncertain. Since dopaminergic modulation of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) enables infraslow (&lt; 0.1 Hz) oscillations in sparse neural networks (SNN), we hypothesize that SNN might sustain minute-scale (ultraslow) oscillatory sequences when bypassing the modulation. Using computational simulations through detailed numerical investigations, the conditions that enable the MEC-like ultraslow rhythms are characterized in an Izhikevich's SNN with dopaminergic STDP modulation. To induce the ultraslow sequences, a few active neurons are defined at each simulation step following a toroid-like trajectory. The results indicate that even when disrupting the dopamine-based STDP learning, the ultraslow oscillations require a second-scale resetting of the membrane potential to keep the sequential firing. Interestingly, separate oscillations on synapses that do not contribute to the firing rate at a specific time step (silent synaptic connections) are observed in the presence of the sequences. Since the mechanisms underlying the experimental finding are unknown, the present manuscript generates hypotheses on the conditions that sustain minute-scale sequences, which will be relevant for the community studying population dynamics in the MEC.</p>

                Neuromuscular diseases can affect slow- and fast-twitch myofibers differently. Dos Santos et al. found that myofiber denervation represses the expression of fast-twitch genes and the transcription factor Maf. In both mouse and human muscles, Maf counteracts muscle atrophy by activating fast-twitch genes and repressing atrophy-associated genes.

                Prasanphanich et al. demonstrate that granulysin-high decidual natural killer cells (dNKs) of rhesus macaques and humans share conserved signatures of antimicrobial defense and immunoregulation. Moreover, granulysin-high dNKs respond to inflammation and infection by increasing cytotoxic, cytokine, and inflammatory signatures, further defining GNLY-high dNKs as important immune effectors providing placental immunity.

                Taylor et al. use single-particle cryo-EM to determine the in situ structure of a Junin virus glycoprotein complex (GPC). Structures of GPC-bound neutralizing antibodies, CR1-28 and J199, uncover molecular details of their GPC neutralization and their potential stabilization of a pre-fusion GPC conformation.

                Bangaru et al. provide structural insights on the antibody specificities induced by mRNA-1273 and NVX-CoV2373 COVID-19 vaccines. They reveal that polyclonal antibodies targeting a single site on the Spike NTD show immunodominance, high diversity, and limited cross-reactivity, thereby highlighting the need to direct responses away from this site.

                Zhang et al. found that the invasive fall webworm Hyphantria cunea uses horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to acquire a chitinase gene. This HGT-derived enzyme provides gut antifungal immunity, facilitating adaptation to new host Metasequoia glyptostroboides and enhancing host plant expansion.

                We examine how sex and gonadal steroids influence sharp wave (SPW)-ripples in vivo. SPW rates are reduced after gonadectomy, restored by testosterone in males, and 17β-estradiol in females. SPW rates of intact females are highest on estrus. Males have higher SPW rates than females, but female SPWs have greater power.

                He et al. uncover a complex molecular network involving AS2, JAG, and TCP24 that is critical for generating flat plant organs. They show that both AS2 and TCP24 interact with JAG, which is able to regulate the cell growth direction, and TCP24 down-regulates the expression of JAG.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99735">Unraveling CRP/cAMP-mediated metabolic regulation in Escherichia coli persister cells</a></h4>

              
                A substantial gap persists in our comprehension of how bacterial metabolism undergoes rewiring during the transition to a persistent state. Also, it remains unclear which metabolic mechanisms become indispensable for persister cell survival. To address these questions, we directed our efforts towards persister cells in <i>Escherichia coli</i> that emerge during the late stationary phase. These cells have been recognized for their exceptional resilience and are commonly believed to be in a dormant state. Our results indicate that the global metabolic regulator Crp/cAMP redirects the metabolism of these antibiotic-tolerant cells from anabolism to oxidative phosphorylation. Although our data demonstrates that persisters exhibit a reduced metabolic rate compared to rapidly growing exponential-phase cells, their survival still relies on energy metabolism. Extensive genomic-level analyses of metabolomics, proteomics, and single-gene deletions consistently highlight the critical role of energy metabolism, specifically the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, electron transport chain (ETC), and ATP synthase, in sustaining persister levels within cell populations. Altogether, this study provides much-needed clarification regarding the role of energy metabolism in antibiotic tolerance and highlights the importance of using a multipronged approach at the genomic level to obtain a broader picture of the metabolic state of persister cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98347">Diverse prey capture strategies in teleost larvae</a></h4>

              
                Animal behavior is adapted to the sensory environment in which it evolved, while also being constrained by physical limits, evolutionary history, and developmental trajectories. The hunting behavior of larval zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>), a cyprinid native to streams in Eastern India, has been well characterized. However, it is unknown if the complement and sequence of movements employed during prey capture by zebrafish is universal across freshwater teleosts. Here, we explore the syntax of prey capture behavior in larval fish belonging to the clade <i>Percomorpha</i>, whose last common ancestor with cyprinids lived ~240 mya. We compared the behavior of four cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika endemic to deep benthic parts of the lake (<i>Lepidiolamprologus attenuatus</i>, <i>Lamprologus ocellatus</i>, and <i>Neolamprologus multifasciatus</i>) or inhabiting rivers (<i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>) with that of medaka (<i>Oryzias latipes</i>), a fish found in rice paddies in East Asia. Using high-speed videography and neural networks, we tracked eye movements and extracted swim kinematics during hunting from larvae of these five species. Notably, we found that the repertoire of hunting movements of cichlids is broader than that of zebrafish, but shares basic features, such as eye convergence, positioning of prey centrally in the binocular visual field, and discrete prey capture bouts, including two kinds of capture strikes. In contrast, medaka swim continuously, track the prey monocularly without eye convergence, and position prey laterally before capturing them with a side swing. This configuration of kinematic motifs suggests that medaka may judge distance to prey predominantly by motion parallax, while cichlids and zebrafish may mainly use binocular visual cues. Together, our study documents the diversification of locomotor and oculomotor adaptations among hunting teleost larvae.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85300">Homophilic wiring principles underpin neuronal network topology in vitro</a></h4>

              
                Economic efficiency has been a popular explanation for how networks self-organize within the developing nervous system. However, the precise nature of the economic negotiations governing this putative organizational principle remains unclear. Here, we address this question further by combining large-scale electrophysiological recordings, to characterize the functional connectivity of developing neuronal networks <i>in vitro</i>, with a generative modeling approach capable of simulating network formation. We find that the best fitting model uses a homophilic generative wiring principle in which neurons form connections to other neurons which are spatially proximal and have similar connectivity patterns to themselves. Homophilic generative models outperform more canonical models in which neurons wire depending upon their spatial proximity either alone or in combination with the extent of their local connectivity. This homophily-based mechanism for neuronal network emergence accounts for a wide range of observations that are described, but not sufficiently explained, by traditional analyses of network topology. Using rodent and human neuronal cultures, we show that homophilic generative mechanisms can accurately recapitulate the topology of emerging cellular functional connectivity, representing an important wiring principle and determining factor of neuronal network formation <i>in vitro</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104181">Forward genetics in C. elegans reveals genetic adaptations to polyunsaturated fatty acid deficiency</a></h4>

              
                Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential for mammalian health and function as membrane fluidizers and precursors for signaling lipids, though the primary essential function of PUFAs within organisms has not been established. Unlike mammals who cannot endogenously synthesize PUFAs, <i>C. elegans</i> can de novo synthesize PUFAs starting with the Δ12 desaturase FAT-2, which introduces a second double bond to monounsaturated fatty acids to generate the PUFA linoleic acid. FAT-2 desaturation is essential for <i>C. elegans</i> survival since <i>fat-2</i> null mutants are non-viable; the near-null <i>fat-2(wa17</i>) allele synthesizes only small amounts of PUFAs and produces extremely sick worms. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we found that the <i>fat-2(wa17</i>) mutant has rigid membranes and can be efficiently rescued by dietarily providing various PUFAs, but not by fluidizing treatments or mutations. With the aim of identifying mechanisms that compensate for PUFA-deficiency, we performed a forward genetics screen to isolate novel <i>fat-2(wa17</i>) suppressors and identified four internal mutations within <i>fat-2</i> and six mutations within the HIF-1 pathway. The suppressors increase PUFA levels in <i>fat-2(wa17</i>) mutant worms and additionally suppress the activation of the <i>daf-16</i>, UPR<sup>er</sup> and UPR<sup>mt</sup> stress response pathways that are active in <i>fat-2(wa17</i>) worms. We hypothesize that the six HIF-1 pathway mutations, found in <i>egl-9</i>, <i>ftn-2</i>, and <i>hif-1,</i> all converge on raising Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels and in this way boost desaturase activity, including that of the <i>fat-2(wa17</i>) allele. We conclude that PUFAs cannot be genetically replaced and that the only genetic mechanism that can alleviate PUFA-deficiency do so by increasing PUFA levels.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104064">Function and firing of the Streptomyces coelicolor contractile injection system requires the membrane protein CisA</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial contractile injection systems (CIS) are phage tail-like macromolecular complexes that mediate cell-cell interactions by injecting effector proteins into target cells. CIS from <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i> (CIS<sup>Sc</sup>) are localized in the cytoplasm. Under stress, they induce cell death and impact the <i>Streptomyces</i> life cycle. It remains unknown, however, whether CIS<sup>Sc</sup> require accessory proteins to directly interact with the cytoplasmic membrane to function. Here, we characterize the putative membrane adaptor CisA, a conserved factor in CIS gene clusters across <i>Streptomyces</i> species. We show by cryo-electron tomography imaging and in vivo assays that CIS<sup>Sc</sup> contraction and function depend on CisA. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we provide an atomic model of the extended CIS<sup>Sc</sup> apparatus; however, CisA is not part of the complex. Instead, our findings show that CisA is a membrane protein with a cytoplasmic N-terminus predicted to interact with CIS<sup>Sc</sup> components, thereby providing a possible mechanism for mediating CIS<sup>Sc</sup> recruitment to the membrane and subsequent firing. Our work shows that CIS function in multicellular bacteria is distinct from type VI secretion systems and extracellular CIS, and possibly evolved due to the role CIS<sup>Sc</sup> play in regulated cell death.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102296">Epithelial cell chirality emerges through the dynamic concentric pattern of actomyosin cytoskeleton</a></h4>

              
                The chirality of tissues and organs is essential for their proper function and development. Tissue-level chirality derives from the chirality of individual cells that comprise the tissue, and cellular chirality is considered to emerge through the organization of chiral molecules within the cell. However, the principle of how molecular chirality leads to cellular chirality remains unresolved. To address this fundamental question, we experimentally studied the chiral behaviors of isolated epithelial cells derived from a carcinoma line and developed a theoretical understanding of how their behaviors arise from molecular-level chirality. We first found that the nucleus undergoes clockwise rotation, accompanied by robust cytoplasmic circulation in the same direction. During the rotation, actin and Myosin IIA assemble into the stress fibers with a vortex-like chiral orientation at the ventral side of the cell periphery, concurrently forming a concentric pattern at the dorsal side. Further analysis revealed that the intracellular rotation is driven by the concentric actomyosin filaments located dorsally, not by the ventral vortex-like chiral stress fibers. To elucidate how these concentric actomyosin filaments induce chiral rotation, we analyzed a theoretical model developed based on the theory of active chiral fluid. This model demonstrated that the observed cell-scale unidirectional rotation is driven by the molecular-scale chirality of actomyosin filaments even in the absence of cell-scale chiral orientational order. Our study thus provides novel mechanistic insights into how the molecular chirality is organized into the cellular chirality, representing an important step towards understanding left-right symmetry breaking in tissues and organs.

                Efficient learning requires estimation of, and adaptation to, different forms of uncertainty. If uncertainty is caused by randomness in outcomes (noise), observed events should have less influence on beliefs, whereas if uncertainty is caused by a change in the process being estimated (volatility) the influence of events should increase. Previously, we showed that humans respond appropriately to changes in volatility irrespective of outcome valence (Pulcu and Browning, 2017), but there is less evidence of a rational response to noise. Here, we test adaptation to variable levels of volatility and noise in human participants, using choice behaviour and pupillometry as a measure of the central arousal system. We find that participants adapt as expected to changes in volatility, but not to changes in noise. Using a Bayesian observer model, we demonstrate that participants are, in fact, adapting to estimated noise, but that their estimates are imprecise, leading them to misattribute it as volatility and thus to respond inappropriately.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98582">Quantitative intra-Golgi transport and organization data suggest the stable compartment nature of the Golgi</a></h4>

              
                How the intra-Golgi secretory transport works remains a mystery. The cisternal progression and the stable compartment models have been proposed and are under debate. Classic cisternal progression model posits that both the intra-Golgi transport and Golgi exit of secretory cargos should occur at a constant velocity dictated by the cisternal progression; furthermore, COPI-mediated intra-Golgi retrograde transport is essential for maintaining the Golgi organization. Leveraging our recently developed Golgi imaging tools in nocodazole-induced Golgi ministacks, we found that the intra-Golgi transport velocity of a secretory cargo decreases during their transition from the <i>cis</i> to the <i>trans</i>-side of the Golgi, and different cargos exhibit distinct velocities even within the same cisternae. We observed a vast variation in the Golgi residence times of different cargos. Remarkably, truncation of the luminal domain causes the Golgi residence time of Tac — a standard transmembrane secretory cargo without intra-Golgi recycling signals — to extend from 16 min to a notable 3.4 hr. Additionally, when COPI-mediated intra-Golgi retrograde transport was inhibited by brefeldin A, we found that nocodazole-induced Golgi can remain stacked for over 30–60 min. Therefore, our findings challenge the classical cisternal progression model and suggest the stable compartment nature of the Golgi.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102068">β-Glucan reprograms alveolar macrophages via neutrophil/IFNγ axis in a murine model of lung injury</a></h4>

              
                Alveolar macrophages (AMs) reside in the lower airways and play a crucial role in lung health and response to sterile inflammation and infections. AMs possess remarkable adaptability to different environmental challenges that can persist through their memory capacity (trained immunity). β-Glucan has been characterized as a potent inducer of central trained immunity by reprogramming haematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. In the present study, we show that systemic administration of β-glucan in mice induces peripheral trained immunity by reprogramming AMs in the lungs, in a Dectin1-independent manner. We furthermore demonstrate that AM reprogramming at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels exacerbate lung injury following bacterial (lipopolysaccharide) or viral (polyI:C) challenges via a neutrophil/IFN-γ-dependent manner. These findings identify an additional facet of β-glucan in trained immunity involving AM reprogramming and shed light on the potential detrimental effects of trained immunity.

">Community Socioeconomic Disadvantage relates to White Matter Hyperintensity Burden in Mid-to-Late Life Adults</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Residing in communities characterized by socioeconomic disadvantage may confer risk for neurodegenerative brain changes and future neuropathology. Based on prior evidence, this study tested the hypotheses that (1) community-level disadvantage would relate independently of individual-level socioeconomic position to white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), which reflect subclinical brain pathology that may presage later dementia; and (2) this association would be partly explained by blood pressure, cardiometabolic risk, and/or systemic levels of inflammation. These hypotheses were examined among otherwise healthy middle- and older-aged adults without clinical dementia at testing. Methods: Participants were 388 adults aged 40-72 years (53% female; 12% non-White) whose street addresses were entered into the Neighborhood Atlas to compute Area Deprivation Index scores by census block. Participants also underwent high resolution (7 Tesla) brain imaging to assess total WMH volume normalized for intracranial volume, and assessment of blood pressure, cardiometabolic (adiposity, lipids, glucose and insulin), and inflammatory (interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein) risk factors. Results: Linear regression models showed that higher community deprivation on the ADI associated with greater WMH volume, independently of age, sex, years of education and smoking. This association was largely independent of blood pressure, cardiometabolic risk and systemic inflammation. Conclusion: The present novel findings add to growing evidence that community disadvantage relates to preclinical neurodegenerative changes, which may contribute to accelerated brain and cognitive aging. Future work is warranted to better understand pathways that link residential environments to brain health and to identify targets for community and public policy interventions.

">The olfactory organ is a site for neuroendocrine modulation of reproduction in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is one of the most fascinating neuroendocrine peptides: It is essential for maintaining the reproductive state of vertebrates and also displays high sequence homology to the tridecapeptide mating pheromone of the yeast, S. cerevisiae. In spite of its highly conserved role in vertebrate reproduction, recent studies in zebrafish show that the loss of function of genes encoding Gnrh isoforms does not cause infertility. Here we first investigated whether Phoenixin, a novel peptide acting in the reproductive pathway of vertebrates, is the hormone that has replaced Gnrh in zebrafish. While loss of function of the phoenixin gene affected female differentiation, we observed no defects in fertility. We next reconsidered the GnRH pathway and turned to the natural world, where fishes use waterborne hormones to control reproduction. Thus, we investigated whether exogenous Gnrh affects the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Here we show that fish isolated from their conspecifics and kept in artificial water devoid of fish odors, mounted sex appropriate pituitary responses when Gnrh was added to the water. Furthermore, blocking the access of water to the olfactory organs eliminated these responses. We then analyzed Gnrh signaling by knocking out the gene encoding gnrh-receptor3 (gnrh-r3) and, surprisingly, found that fish homozygous for a gnrh-r3 null mutation were almost completely infertile: males did not produce sperm and females produced but a few mature oocytes. Finally, we found that Gnrh was present in nanomolar concentrations in the water that houses the fish, thus supporting the hypothesis that waterborne Gnrh from conspecifics plays a key role in regulating zebrafish reproduction in the absence of the endogenous ligand.

">Repeated extrinsic rewards following retrieval practice facilitate later memory</a></h4>

              
                The anticipation of extrinsic reward facilitates memory formation. However, it is unclear how reward following memory retrieval influences the information that is retrieved and later remembered. Here, we conducted four behavioral experiments (N=42 male/female young adults per experiment) in which we manipulated retrieval practice reward delivery. Across all experiments, participants studied word-image pairs and then completed two rounds of retrieval practice, followed by a final recognition test. Participants made vividness judgments during retrieval practice and in three of four experiments each response had a 50% chance of yielding positive feedback. We find that repeated rewards following retrieval practice facilitate later memory whereas low vivid retrieval practice impairs later memory. Together, these results suggest that the benefit of both retrieval practice and reward may be dependent on the strength of the memory that is retrieved.

">Electrophysiological Mechanisms of Psychedelic Drugs: A Systematic Review</a></h4>

              
                Serotonergic psychedelics are known for their profound effects on consciousness and are gaining renewed interest as potential psychiatric treatments. These advances underscore the need to clarify the mechanisms of action of these compounds. This systematic review compiles and critically evaluates 23 in vitro and 26 in vivo electrophysiological studies on psychedelic compounds, with an emphasis on layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex, where 5-HT2A receptors are densely expressed. Our findings reveal that psychedelics exert complex, heterogeneous effects on neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, and network oscillations. These results challenge the simplified view that psychedelics uniformly increase cortical excitability. Instead, they modulate both excitatory and inhibitory processes in a cell-type- and compartment-specific manner, with evidence for biphasic, dose-dependent, and context-sensitive responses. Activation of 5-HT2A receptors leads to intricate calcium signaling, downregulating excitatory currents and firing rates in many neurons, while enhancing glutamate release and activating a subset of projection fibers. Modulation of presynaptic and extrasynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors appears central to these effects, and some indirect evidence supports the involvement of intracellular 5-HT2A receptors. These insights prompt a reassessment of prevailing models of psychedelic action and underscore the value of incorporating electrophysiological data into psychedelic neuropharmacology.

">Striatal dopamine modulates reward-reinforced temporal learning in humans.</a></h4>

              
                The neurobiological mechanisms underlying human time perception remain elusive. Evidence has consistently linked striatal dopamine to timing behaviors, but it is still uncertain how rapid changes in dopamine may modulate human time perception. Many tasks designed to measure time perception utilize instrumental conditioning paradigms that reinforce correctly timed intervals. In these tasks, subjects are shown to improve their performance following repeated presentations of temporal cues, a phenomenon known as temporal learning. We sought to determine the association between rapid changes in human dopamine levels and temporal learning on an interval timing task that tested the reproduction of 1000ms, 3000ms, and 5000ms intervals in the presence and absence of monetary reinforcement. We utilized human voltammetry to measure real-time dopamine concentrations from the striatum of patients with Parkinsons disease while they performed the interval timing task. We first compared task behavior between patients with Parkinsons disease and neurologically healthy controls and found significant differences in the reproduction of 1000ms intervals, but not 3000ms or 5000ms intervals of time. Further, we observed that during 1000ms intervals, increases in striatal dopamine concentrations were associated with increases in temporal errors, but only during the expectation of monetary reinforcement. We also demonstrated that as temporal errors decrease overtime during temporal learning, so do striatal dopamine concentrations. These results suggest that dopamine may be driving temporal learning through the generation of temporal errors in response to positive reinforcement. These findings may have significant implications in our understanding of the role that dopamine plays in time perception.

">Not Just Noise: Impaired Oscillatory Entrainment Reflects Reduced Temporal Flexibility in Autism</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic patterns in the environment enhance neural activity, perception, and action. However, natural rhythms are often imprecise, requiring flexible adaptation. In autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), characterized by cognitive rigidity and atypical use of prior information - favoring immediate sensory input over predictive cues - entrainment to temporally variable input may be reduced at both neural and behavioral levels, though the neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we recorded high-density EEG and behavior in adults with ASD (n=20) and neurotypical (NT) controls (n=21) during a visual detection task with four rhythmic structures, parametrically varied from an isochronous fully regular rhythm, to a highly irregular one. Spectral analysis and temporal response function (TRF) models revealed significantly reduced modulation by temporal regularity in ASD, particularly in mildly jittered stimulation streams. Additionally, the coupling between phases of neural oscillations and behavior was diminished in ASD under the jittered conditions, suggesting reduced functional relevance of neural synchronization. Residual spectral power post-stimulation showed lower oscillatory entrainment in ASD, ruling out simple evoked-response explanations. Notably, the degree of neural modulation by temporal regularity was correlated with IQ within the ASD group, suggesting a link between temporal flexibility and individual cognitive profiles. These findings highlight impaired neural entrainment and reduced behavioral modulation by temporal structure in ASD, offering insight into inflexible responses to uncertain, volatile sensory environments.

">The neuroimaging correlates of depression established across six large-scale datasets</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging data offers noninvasive insights into the structural and functional organization of the brain and is therefore commonly used to study the brain basis of depression. To date, a substantial body of literature has suggested reduced size of subcortical regions and abnormal functional connectivity in frontal and default mode networks linked to depression. However, recent meta analyses have failed to identify significant converging correlates of depression across the literature such that a conclusive mapping of the neuroimaging correlates of depression remains elusive. Here we leveraged 23,417 participants across six datasets to comprehensively establish the neuroimaging correlates of depression. We found reductions in gray matter volume/ cortical surface area associated with depression in the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate and insula, confirming prior studies showing the importance of prefrontal and default mode regions in depression. Our findings demonstrate multiple surprising results including a lack of depression correlates in subcortical brain regions, significant depression correlates in somatomotor and visual regions, and limited functional connectivity findings. Overall, these results shed new light on key brain regions involved in the pathophysiology of depression, updating our understanding of the neuroimaging correlates of depression. We anticipate that these insights will inform further research into the role of sensorimotor and visual regions in depression and into the impact of heterogeneity on functional connectivity correlates of depression.

">Modulation of predictive coding in auditory paradigms of varying complexity in children with Specific Language Impairment.</a></h4>

              
                Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is a persistent difficulty in the acquisition and use of expressive and/or receptive language, which negatively impacts academic and social development. The present study evaluated the validity of the statistical learning model proposed to explain language difficulties in children with SLI. To this end, two auditory paradigms of varying complexity, framed within predictive coding theory, were passively presented to children diagnosed with SLI and without neurological impairments. The paradigms consisted of stimulus sequences with decreasing or increasing frequencies, interspersed with the sporadic occurrence of unexpected tone endings. The psychophysiological response was recorded using EEG, focusing on the P1, Mismatch Negativity (MMN), Post-imperative Negative Variation PINV, and Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) components. Results showed an absent MMN and a higher P1 response to deviant tones in children with SLI, suggesting an impaired development of frontal MMN generators, possibly compensated by the primary auditory cortex. SLI participants also showed increased PINV and CNV responses during the most complex paradigm, which could imply greater cognitive effort and resource allocation to the reassessment of stimulus patterns in this group. Finally, the incomplete maturation of frontal areas in children of this age range (3 to 11 years old) was proposed to explain the increased activity observed in both groups for the N1/MMN elicited in the simplest paradigm. These findings support statistical learning as a valid model for understanding the possible neural basis of SLI, identifying this type of predictive EEG design as a potential early detection protocol.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Previous studies have revealed that the moral level of targets can influence individuals’ empathic responses toward them. Here, we investigated the visual attention patterns and neural mechanisms related to how moral characteristics modulate individuals’ empathic responses to social pain via a word-priming social exclusion empathy task in which participants needed to judge whether the target persons with a high or low moral level were excluded or not in social situations. We found that for ERPs, when participants viewed neutral images, a significantly more negative N1 component was evoked in low-moral priming condition and a significantly more positive P3 component was evoked in high-moral priming condition. Regarding eye-tracking metrics, when participants viewed social exclusion images, the fixation time–related metrics under high-moral priming condition were significantly longer than those under low-moral priming condition. We speculate that this may be related to the expected conflict experienced by the participants when they saw high-moral individuals being socially excluded. This expected conflict may have caused attentional avoidance in that situation, which may be related to the relatively lower emotional arousal. This attentional avoidance during the early stage of visual processing resulted in significantly more cognitive resources being invested and longer fixation time–related metrics.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Daily life requires simultaneously processing spatial, temporal, and numerical inputs to form a valid mental representation of the environment. The interrelation between these perceptions has been a subject of theoretical debate. For instance, a theory of magnitude (ATOM) asserts that magnitude perceptions are processed in overlapping brain areas, which has been tested in behavioral and neuroimaging studies. We aimed to combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results using a coordinate-based meta-analysis to test this primary assumption of ATOM regarding overlapping brain areas. We conducted separate literature searches for space, time, and number perception following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The analysis was based on 19 articles regarding space, 38 regarding time, and 31 regarding number perception. Coordinates were analyzed using the “Activation Likelihood Estimation” method, which focused on conjunction analysis. Double conjunction analyses revealed activations mainly in the fronto-parietal areas and insular cortex. The triple conjunction analysis revealed activations in the right hemisphere, specifically in the inferior parietal and inferior frontal areas (previously linked to magnitude perception) and the anterior insular cortex (implicated in interoception and salience). In support of the ATOM theory, these findings suggest that overlapping neural networks may underlie space, time, and number perceptions.</span>

Relative to the control group, girls with FXS showed higher brain activation (NoGo&gt;Go) in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), angular gyrus, precentral gyrus, and left frontal pole, and lower activation in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, frontal pole, precentral cortex, middle temporal cortex, parietal lobe, and left superior temporal cortex. A significant positive correlation was found between DLPFC activation and response inhibition deficits in girls with FXS.

Literature search screenings found 16 studies and 16 experiments for the NAE and 46 studies and 47 experiments for the N-IAPS. GingerALE software employed activation likelihood estimation analyses to specify neural correlates within and between NAE and N-IAPS. Meta-analytic results from the NAE solely revealed the right fusiform gyrus encroaching the anterior cerebellum, while activations across frontal, occipital, temporal and subcortical areas were revealed for the N-IAPS. A commonality between the NAE and N-IAPS was revealed within the right fusiform gyrus. These results suggest that the domain-general neural systems are at play across negative visual affective experiences, yet the context of stimulus engagement, such as aesthetic, may modulate how these neural systems are employed. Given the scarcity of results, future research in neuroaesthetics must expand from positive aesthetic evaluations to ascertain neural correlates within negative aesthetic evaluations.</span>

                Background Current advancements in communication and information have important impacts on the agricultural sector. Technology has been instrumental in developing innovative approaches to enhancing farming productivity and efficiency while also addressing environmental concerns. With the aid of technology, researchers can collect and analyze vast amounts of agricultural data, enabling a deeper understanding of farming practices and facilitating more informed decision-making through cutting-edge techniques. Methods The study on Capsicum phenology introduces a nuanced approach by integrating statistical analysis specifically t-test and ANOVA to examine environmental parameters across various growth stages. This methodology offers a more detailed understanding a factors like temperature, humidity and soil moisture influence Capsicum development, providing a statistical foundation for adaptive crop management strategies. Results The results demonstrated substantial variability in these parameters, emphasizing the importance of tailored crop management strategies. Conclusion This research bridges a gap in Capsicum specific phenological studies and also sets a precedent for integrating statistical analysis with a smart agricultural technology paving the way for the development of autonomous crop management system that adapt to specific crop needs, thereby enhancing productivity and sustainability in agriculture.

                Background Sustainability in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which engage heavily in manufacturing provides them with an essential platform for implementing environmental strategy, which is aimed at reducing environmental damage and promoting environmental protection. This study aims to examine the impact of the reduction in resource use, the greening of processes and products on environmental strategy and the mediating role of green employee behaviour. Methods Primary data gathered with the help of questionnaires from employees of SMEs manufacturing in developing countries, Pakistan. The research gathered data from 211 participants by applying a pre-tested instrumental questionnaire and structural equation modelling (SEM) SmartPLS version 3 was used for data analysis. Results The results confirmed all direct effects, including a reduction in resource use, the greening of processes and products and green employee behaviour of environmental strategies in small and medium manufacturing firms. Also, confirmed partial mediation effect of green employee behavior between greening of processes and products and environmental strategy. Conclusion The current study clearly showed the need for programs and infrastructures that support resource reduction and greening businesses in SMEs. Companies’ implementation of green processes and technologies allows SMEs to take an environmentally responsible stand and become part of the movement toward sustainability. The research stresses the importance of green employee conduct as a mediator, the central point being the individual employee being engaged and aware of the subject and willing to participate in environmentally friendly practices. Therefore, small and medium enterprises should enlighten their staff to practice green behaviour, give them what they need and empower them to be change drivers that will trigger sustainability throughout the organisations.

                Background In England, the Professional Nurse Advocate (PNA) and Professional Midwifery Advocate (PMA) role places nurses and midwives at the centre of workforce retention and transformation. The PNA/PMA role blends professional leadership and clinical supervision through the A-EQUIP model, which is grounded in directing change and steering service development. The overarching impetus for the PNA/PMA role is to improve care quality whilst developing and sustaining cultures of professional wellbeing and nurse/midwife retention. To date, however, little is known about what the impact the PNA/PMA role has on the day-to-day practice of nurses and midwives, nor if it improves quality in practice, professional wellbeing, and retention. This study examines the impact of the PNA/PMA role on nurse/midwife involvement in quality improvement, wellbeing, and retention within one public sector healthcare NHS Trust in England. Methods During 2022, fourteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with PNA’s and PMA’s who had completed their training and are included on the NHS Trust PNA/PMA register. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed through qualitative descriptive analysis. Findings The analysis detected 5 themes and 10 subthemes: (1) Transforming in Tandem (a) Role of Advocacy, (b) Restorative Focus, (2) Creating Safe Spaces, (c) Emotional Support, (d) Interpersonal Relationships, (3) Challenging the Status Quo (e) Counteracting Blame Culture, (f ) Empowering Change (4) Empowerment and Development (g) Building Resilience, (5) Types of Advocacy (h) Educational and Emotional Advocacy (i) Coaching and Conversations. Conclusions The findings suggests that the most effective aspects of the PNA and PMA roles are those that directly empower individuals and create a supportive, reflective environment. However, while building resilience is vital, it is equally important to recognise its limits and ensure that healthcare professionals are not pushed to the point where their resilience becomes a barrier to their well-being and the overall improvement of their work environment.

                Background Motivational variables are of critical importance concerning students’ performance. The objective of the present study was to investigate the interrelationships between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, self-regulation, critical thinking, and academic performance among university students. Methods The participants were 250 students enrolled in university programs in education and psychology. The research instrument was a self-report questionnaire designed to assess intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, critical thinking, self-regulation, and academic achievement among university students. A path model analysis was employed to identify the relationships among the investigated variables. Results The results demonstrated that self-efficacy was predicted by intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, critical thinking was predicted by self-efficacy, and self-regulation was predicted by self-efficacy and critical thinking, thereby underscoring the pivotal role of self-efficacy. The findings indicate that academic achievement is predicted by critical thinking, and self-regulation, thereby underscoring the pivotal role of these variables in academic contexts. Conclusions The contributions of the present research are twofold, both theoretical and practical. On the one hand, the findings offer a more nuanced understanding of the interconnections between motivation, self-efficacy, critical thinking, and self-regulation. On the other hand, they provide valuable insights for developing educational strategies that enhance academic achievement by fostering these key factors.

                Introduction Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte imbalance, often caused by the Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH). SIADH results from excessive water retention due to inappropriate ADH secretion. While fluid restriction is a standard treatment, responses vary, and there is a need to identify predictors of non-response. Methods This prospective observational study involved 171 patients with SIADH. Inclusion criteria included serum sodium <125 mmol/L and urine osmolality >100 mOsm/kg along with others. Patients received fluid restriction (1 litre/day) with or without hypertonic saline. Data collection included clinical features, laboratory parameters, and response to treatment at 12 and 24 hours. The association between urine sodium, urine osmolality, and treatment response was analysed. Results The median age was 69 years, with a male predominance (59.1%). Pneumonia (28.7%) and malignancies (14%) were common aetiologies. Significant predictors of non-response to fluid restriction included high urine sodium and urine osmolality at the specified time limit. The group that failed to achieve the 24-hour serum sodium target had higher urine osmolality and sodium levels than responders. These findings align with previous studies highlighting the predictive value of urine osmolality and urine sodium. Conclusion Elevated urine sodium and urine osmolality significantly predict non-response to fluid restriction in SIADH. Identifying these markers can guide personalized treatment strategies, improving outcomes and avoiding unnecessary interventions

                Background This study investigated the utility of platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with COVID-19 with respect to age, early (a week) vs. delayed recovery (> a week) and mortality. Methods This was a retrospective study including 1,016 COVID-19 patients. The discriminatory power and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed. Results The mean age of patients was 45 (± 13.9), and 75.7% were males. Older patients had elevated NLR, PLR, D-dimer, CRP, and Interleukin-6 levels and longer hospital stay than the younger group (p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher in older adults (26.9% vs. 6.6%, p =0.001). On-admission NLR (5.8 vs. 3.2; P= 0.001) and PLR (253.9±221.1 vs. 192.2±158.5; p = 0.004) were higher in the non-survivors than survivors. Both PLR and NLR displayed significant discriminatory ability for mortality. NLR had a higher AUC and specificity, while PLR exhibited slightly higher sensitivity. In individuals aged ≤55, NLR showed superior discrimination (AUC=0.717) compared to PLR (AUC=0.620). Conversely, for older adults, PLR displayed enhanced discrimination (AUC=0.710), while NLR showed AUC=0.693. Conclusion Higher admission NLR and PLR levels were associated with delayed recovery, whereas an enhanced NLR was associated with considerably higher mortality in older COVID-19 patients.

                Background Antipsychotics are effective in reducing acute psychotic symptoms and preventing relapse in stabilized patients. However, their use remains controversial due to significant side effects and limited efficacy in some patients. This controversy is further compounded by some patients’ preferences to avoid or discontinue use, and the practice of involuntary admissions and antipsychotic medication treatment. Evaluating long-term outcomes, optimal discontinuation strategies, and the risks associated with managing first-episode psychosis without antipsychotics is challenging in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) due to ethical and safety concerns, participant attrition, and feasibility constraints. Real-world clinical practices vary widely in the duration, type, and non-use of antipsychotics due to provider variation. Methods We present a study that will utilize and link multiple longitudinal Norwegian national registry datasets, encompassing mental health care use, prescriptions, hospital emergency care contacts, injury presentations, educational outcomes, employment, criminal justice system contacts, and mortality. These data will enable descriptive analyses of outcomes for patients receiving different types, dosages, durations, and total exposures to antipsychotics, as well as for patients managed without antipsychotics. We also plan to estimate variations in public spending and societal costs. Variation in prescriber preferences will serve as quasi-randomization, allowing for causal inference after testing assumptions. Conclusions This study will provide empirical evidence to inform patients, carers, service providers, and policymakers in making complex decisions about antipsychotic maintenance treatment. Ethics and dissemination Ethic approval was granted by the Regional Ethical Committee for Medical and Health Services Research, Norway (REC South East, Committee D, REK 10895). Data will be pseudonymized for the project. The project group is committed to publishing all relevant findings in peer-reviewed journals, including null findings.

                Background GeoGebra® (a registered trademark of the International GeoGebra Institute) is dynamic, user-friendly, and open-source software that effectively connects geometry and algebra. By reducing abstraction and procedural demands, it facilitates students’ conceptual understanding. This study investigated the impact of GeoGebra integrated mathematics instruction on Grade 9 students’ achievement, conceptual understanding, and motivation regarding quadratic functions. Methods A quasi-experimental design with non-equivalent control groups was employed, involving 42 students in the experimental group and 45 in the control group, drawn from different intact classrooms in Worabe Town Administration, Ethiopia. The experimental group received instruction using GeoGebra, while the control group followed traditional teaching methods. The intervention was grounded in social constructivist theory. Data collection instruments included pre- and post-tests for mathematical achievement and conceptual understanding, as well as a motivation questionnaire. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS. Results The experimental group showed statistically significant improvement in both conceptual understanding and problem-solving performance compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Additionally, students in the GeoGebra-integrated instruction group reported significantly higher levels of motivation toward learning quadratic functions. Conclusions GeoGebra-integrated instruction has the potential to improve student achievement, reduce time spent on routine calculations, and address challenges related to multiple representations in mathematics. Furthermore, it enhances student motivation and engagement with critical mathematical concepts. These findings support the inclusion of dynamic mathematical software like GeoGebra in secondary mathematics instruction, especially for topics requiring visualization and symbolic reasoning.

                Backgrounds Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is a Gram-positive lactic acid bacterium known for its probiotic benefits, commonly found in fermented foods and mammalian gastrointestinal tracts. L. plantarum strain L47-2 was selected for its in vitro probiotic characteristics. Methods We investigated its antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria using the dual culture overlay method and assessed survival in a mimicked gastrointestinal tract by subjecting the bacteria to pH levels of 1.0–4.0 and bile salt concentrations of 0.1–0.5%. Adhesion to Caco-2 cells was also evaluated. Safety evaluations included phenotypic tests for antibiotic resistance and hemolytic activity, genotypic screening for virulence genes, and whole genome sequencing. Results After 4 hours, L47-2 survived well at pH 2.0 (57.0±3.6%) and 3.0 (66.3±2.5%), and maintained 35.0±3.0% survival in 0.4% bile salt. The L47-2 strain demonstrated antibacterial activity against gastrointestinal pathogens and exhibited safety as a probiotic strain. Notably, the L47-2 strain had high autoaggregation (76.3±3.2%) and coaggregation with specific pathogens ranging from 33.1 to 46.7%. Additionally, when compared to the assessed pathogens, the L47-2 strain showed the highest surface hydrophobicity, 68.4±0.4%. This strain exhibited potential adhesion to Caco-2 cells and inhibited the adhesion of all tested pathogens. It was most effective at inhibiting pathogenic bacterial strains rather than competing and displacing them. Pearson correlation analysis revealed significant positive relationships between autoaggregation and coaggregation (P=0.037), autoaggregation and adhesion to Caco-2 cells (P=0.020), and hydrophobicity and adhesion to Caco-2 cells (P=0.016). Conclusions The findings shed light on this strain’s probiotic potential and safety, as well as its already established functional capabilities, together with its potential applications as a biopreservative in the food industry and for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.

                Background Excessive alcohol consumption is a major public health issue among young adults in Latin America. The Questionnaire of Alcohol Consumption Outcome Expectations (CERCA) was developed to assess beliefs related to drinking, but its validity in different sociocultural contexts remains underexplored. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with 685 students from a public university in Ecuador, selected through stratified random sampling by sex. The CERCA instrument was applied, and both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed. The EFA used principal axis factoring, and CFA was conducted using AMOS v.24, with standard fit indices. Results The EFA revealed a two-factor model—Emotional Well-being and Social Interaction—explaining 89.5% of the variance, with high internal consistency (α = .952; ω = .948). The CFA confirmed superior fit for the modified two-factor model, the Alcohol Consumption Expectancy Questionnaire (ACEQ), with CFI = .990, RMSEA = .031, and non-significant χ2 (21.5, p = .064), outperforming the original three-factor model. No significant differences were found by sex, ethnicity, or living arrangement, though students from urban areas reported higher alcohol-related expectations. Conclusions The ACEQ demonstrates robust psychometric properties and provides a more parsimonious and culturally aligned structure than the original CERCA model. It offers a valid and reliable tool for assessing alcohol consumption expectations among Ecuadorian university students, supporting the development of targeted prevention strategies.

                Diabetes mellitus (DM) remains a major global health problem and particularly in low to middle income countries both because of the increasing prevalence and as a result of lack of access to affordable and effective treatment. Given the limitations of current pharmacological treatments, such as side effects and poor compliance, there is increasing interest in natural plant-derived alternatives. This systematic review explores the anti-diabetic potential of Cucurbita species, members of the Cucurbitaceae family, which have demonstrated promising hypoglycemic, antioxidant, and insulinotropic activities in preclinical models. Following PRISMA 2020 criteria, a comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science identified 16 eligible preclinical studies published between 2016 and 2025 that met strict inclusion criteria. Extracts from Cucurbita maxima, C. moschata, C. ficifolia, and C. pepo were shown to significantly reduce blood glucose concentrations, enhance antioxidant enzyme activity, promote pancreatic β-cell regeneration, and improve lipid profiles in diabetic animal models. These effects were predominantly observed following oral administration, reflecting traditional usage patterns and supporting clinical translatability. The geographically diverse research landscape underscores the global ethnobotanical relevance of Cucurbita species as complementary or alternative treatments for DM. However, the review also highlights gaps in the research, including the need for further pharmacokinetic, toxicological, and clinical studies to validate the efficacy and safety of these botanicals and to inform the development of standardized phytotherapeutic interventions. Overall, Cucurbita plants present a compelling case for further investigation as adjunct or alternative treatments for diabetes mellitus.

                Backgrounds Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.), is the most significant and highest-yielding crop among oil-producing crops worldwide. In 2020/2022, Basal stem rot (BSR) disease was observed in six oil palm growing Districts in Ghana. Methods Field study and laboratory analysis were conducted. A random sampling technique was used to select five plantation blocks from each District. Single-point disease assessments were done using Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) with a severity scale of 0-4. Molecular assays were performed on each sample using nucleic acid as a template. ITS and GanET sequence analysis were performed along with the formation of a phylogenetic tree using the FASTA algorithm with the Fungus database from EBI and NCBI GenBank. Koch’s postulate was followed to confirm the disease. Results The disease incidence was 11.3 % with the highest severity score of 4. Basal Stem Rot (BSR) is characterised by progressive stem decay coupled with the formation of large, perennial, woody basidiocarps. The average measurement of 2-65 cm in diameter on infected palms. Culture colonies were white, striated, undulating, woolly-cottony, and creamish pigment on the reverse, depicting attributes of Ganoderma fungus. Molecular confirmation was done by combining the ITS sequence of top matches of >97% to members of the genus Ganoderma, >98% and 99.3% identity to three sequences of Ganoderma sp. (HM138671; HM138670 and HM138672) generated from strains assigned to Ganoderma ryvardenii and compared with 132 published sequences of Ganoderma isolates. Conclusion This study presents the first report of Ganoderma ryvardenii causing BSR disease on oil palm in Ghana, potentially the first in West Africa, and second in Africa. Notably, the pathogen was previously first reported to cause similar disease on oil palm in Cameroon, highlighting its emerging threat to oil palm production in the Sub-Saharan African region.

                Objective This study analyzes the relationship between productive public policies and women’s empowerment in agricultural activities in the district of Aramango, Amazonas, Peru. The aim was to identify which dimensions of public policies significantly influence the levels of intrinsic, instrumental, and collective agency among women farmers. Methodology The research adopted a quantitative, non-experimental, cross-sectional approach. A survey validated by experts was administered to 40 women belonging to active agricultural associations in El Porvenir. The variables—public policies and empowerment—were measured in five and three dimensions, respectively. Rating scales were used to establish perception levels, and Spearman’s coefficient was employed to analyze correlations between variables. Results The results reveal a positive and statistically significant correlation between productive public policies and women’s empowerment (ρ = 0.318; p < 0.05), with particularly strong effects in the dimensions of knowledge (ρ = 0.458; p = 0.003) and market access (ρ = 0.344; p = 0.030). The dimensions of infrastructure, access to resources, and institutional framework did not show significant correlations. Medium levels of empowerment predominated, although there were advances in autonomy and participation. Conclusions Women’s empowerment in rural agricultural contexts depends on targeted public policies that prioritize technical training and equitable market access. The evidence supports the need to redesign policies using a territorial and intersectional approach to overcome structural barriers and promote the economic, social, and political autonomy of rural women.

                Introduction Periocular tissues are exposed to sunlight ultraviolet rays. Unreparable DNA damage may also araise. Thus, uncontrolled tumor proliferation may occur. Surgical excision remains a treatment associated with adjuvant management. Observation A 57-year male presented with optic correction. He was classified as skin prototype III. An ophthalmological examination revealed an ulcerative lower eyelid lesion. He underwent a biopsy with histological analysis confirmed the presence of malignant basaloid tumor cells. Complete excision was performed with 3 mm surgical margins and associated with radiotherapy. The follow-up was marked by good oncological and aesthetic results. Conclusion The periocular skin area is the most common site of malignant lesions in the head and neck. Locoregional extension and metastasis remain deadly complications. Early diagnosis is essential. Therefore, any periocular skin lesion should be considered, and biopsy should be performed at the slightest doubt.

                Background The primary barriers to effective and comprehensive treatment of mental disorders are insufficient resources and competent health and medical personnel, alongside social discrimination, stigma, and marginalization. Artificial intelligence-enabled technologies are emerging as a promising solution for longstanding difficulties, most notably is mobile-based therapy chatbots. Methods This is a quantitative, descriptive comparative research design aimed to identify the relationship between the utilization of the Artificial Intelligence Chabot, Stress, Anxiety, and Depression levels among Health Sciences University Students at a University within the United Arab Emirates. The sample was recruited from four health sciences Colleges by using Stratified random sampling technique (n= 298). Results Three tools were used for the data collection and the result revealed that a total of 206 participants (69.1%) reported having interacted with an AI chatbot, with the most used applications being Snapchat (76.9%), followed by ChatGPT and Bard (23.4% each). 40% of the participants reported that the chatbots understood them well, while 16% found that the chatbots helped to reduce their stress. Participants who used the AI chatbot were significantly more likely to suffer from moderate to extremely severe depression (63.5%) compared to those who had not used AI chatbots (36.7%, p<0.001). The multivariate regression analysis indicated that higher levels of depression (OR=1.022, 95% CI: 1.01-1.085, p<0.001) and anxiety (OR=1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.21, p<0.001) were strong predictors of increased AI chatbot usage. Conclusion Stress levels did not significantly predict AI chatbot usage. It is recommended that early intervention and support including university student counselling can significantly alleviate the burden of mental health issues and contribute to the overall well-being and academic success of students. AI chatbots in mental health care present a promising adjunct to nursing interventions; nonetheless, their implementation must be meticulously regulated to guarantee safe and practical assistance akin to the regulatory rigor imposed on registered healthcare practitioners.

                Background Credit card fraud detection remains a major challenge because of the highly imbalanced nature of transaction data. Conventional supervised models often suffer from low recall or high false positive rates, whereas unsupervised methods lack precision. Methods In this study, we propose a hybrid anomaly detection framework that combines an unsupervised autoencoder trained on normal transactions to capture reconstruction error patterns with a supervised XGBoost classifier trained on the same dataset. The hybrid system integrates both scores via an optimized thresholding mechanism to balance sensitivity and specificity. We evaluated the model on the publicly available Kaggle creditcard.csv dataset comprising 284,807 transactions, with only 492 labelled fraudulent. Results The proposed model achieved superior performance, with a recall of 0.9250, precision of 0.9569, F1-score of 0.9407, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.9407, with an accuracy of 0.9998, surpassing the results of similar published models using the same dataset. Conclusions This framework provides a practical, reproducible, high-performance solution for detecting financial fraud. The code, model configuration, and data-processing pipeline were made available to support transparency and future research.

                Background The derivation of novel biomarkers from biomedical data to accurately predict individual patient’s responses, would be an advance. We hypothesized that quantitative AI designed to analyze complex data, based on evolutionary computation, could identify algorithmic biomarkers from baseline data in a clinical trial, predictive of individual therapeutic responses. Methods A previously published randomized placebo controlled clinical trial in which patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) naive to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, were randomized to receive infliximab or placebo was analyzed. Baseline peripheral blood gene expression data, plus the treatment variable, infliximab or placebo, yielding 52,379 variables were available for 59 patients. The variable for analysis was a decrease in Disease Activity Score-28 (DSA28) score of 1.2. At 14 weeks, 20 of the 30 patients receiving infliximab had responded, and ten of the 29 patients receiving placebo had responded. Findings The AI derived a discovery algorithm, with 4 gene expression variables plus treatment assignment, that predicted responders versus non-responders for all 59 patients, with 100% accuracy. We present the discovery algorithm to enable transparent verification. Excluding the 4 gene expression variables, we then derived similarly accurate predictive algorithms with 4 other gene expression variables. We tested the hypothesis that the software could derive algorithms as predictors of treatment response applying just these 8 discovery gene expression variables to 6 previously published independent datasets. In each validation analysis, the accuracy of the algorithmic predictors surpassed those benchmarks previously reported, using a variety of analytic approaches. Conclusions AI based on evolutionary computation summarized a clinical trial, with transparent biomarker algorithms derived from baseline data, correctly predicting the outcome for all patients. The biomarker variables, validated in 6 independent cohorts, are now in development as a clinical test. This approach may expedite the discovery of companion diagnostics.

                Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted primary healthcare (PHC) workers, placing them at heightened risk of infection. Ensuring the implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in PHC settings is critical to safeguarding health workers and maintaining essential health services. This study aimed to assess the compliance of PHC facilities with the Indonesian Ministry of Health’s COVID-19 regulations. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted across 17 Primary Health Care (Puskesmas) facilities located in six provinces of Indonesia. Data were collected over a six-month period and analyzed based on 11 key variables: leadership and incident management systems; coordination and communication; surveillance and information management; risk management and public involvement; administrative, financial, and business continuity; human resources; essential support services; patient management; occupational health; mental health and psychosocial support; rapid identification and diagnosis; and infection prevention and control. Compliance was evaluated using a scoring system aligned with Ministry of Health standards. Results Of the 17 PHC facilities evaluated, 12 (71%) were classified as having “very good” compliance with COVID-19 IPC measures, while 5 (29%) were categorized as “good.” However, specific areas showed lower compliance rates, including occupational health, mental health, and psychosocial support (41%), human resources (50%), risk communication and community engagement (57%), and administrative, financial, and business continuity (58%). Conclusions While overall compliance with Ministry of Health regulations among PHC facilities was high, critical areas such as worker mental health, human resource management, and risk communication require targeted improvement. Policymakers, government agencies, and health institutions must enhance protection measures for PHC workers by strengthening human resource systems, updating risk communication strategies, and integrating business continuity planning tailored to pandemic conditions.

                Background Vector-borne diseases transmitted by various arthropods account for approximately 17% of the global burden of infectious diseases. These arthropods, especially mosquitoes, are particularly rampant in Mangalore because of the humid coastal climate and scaling urbanization. Objectives To identify the key determinants of mosquito presence in urban settings and assess community-based prevention strategies and control measures. Also to evaluate community perceptions of mosquito-borne diseases and quantify their burden from self-reported cases. Methods The study involved households in selected wards of the urban field practice area of the Department of Community Medicine, selected through convenience sampling. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire covering sociodemographic details, mosquito proliferation, breeding determinants, behavioral measures, perception of mosquito control, and self-reported cases of mosquito-borne diseases. The data were analyzed using Jamovi version 2.6.26. Results The study included 95 household participants, primarily female (70.5%) and literate individuals (94.8%). The 42.1% reported an increase in mosquito breeding sites over the past year and 69.4% recognized the rainy season, where mosquitoes were more prevalent. Seventy five percentage responded to water stagnation, which contributed to vector breeding. The survey showed, 91.5% of households used chemical measures as mosquito preventive measures. Ninety two percentage of respondents are aware of mosquito-borne diseases and 80% perceived regular environmental cleaning is a crucial method to prevent disease outbreaks. Thirty percentage of participants had suffered any mosquito-borne disease past year. Water stagnation (p = 0.033) and construction activity (p = 0.014) were significantly associated with a higher number of mosquitoes in the study setting. Conclusion This study reveals a gap in community knowledge and perception of mosquito-borne diseases, even though people are aware of basic precautions, such as using mosquito sprays and screens. However, proper intervention by local authority is needed to combat breeding factors, such as water stagnation and dense vegetation.

                Background Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury is ubiquitous among patients with critical conditions and contributes to high mortality rates. SA-AKI was experimentally elicited in murine models via cecal ligation and puncture. Aims This study aimed to determine the possible protective effects of montelukast on sepsis-induced acute kidney injury in a mouse sepsis model. Methods Albino male Swiss mice (n = 40) were allocated into four distinct groups: (i) normal group, (ii) CLP group, (iii) vehicle group, and (iv) Cecal Ligation and Puncture + Montelukast group (20 mg/kg one hour before Cecal Ligation and Puncture). Blood and tissue biochemical/routine indicators, renal function, Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury -related pathophysiological processes, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 gene expression in septic mice were assessed by histological hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay. Results The findings highlight that Montelukast reversed CLP-induced increases in serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine (Cr), and kidney injury molecule levels. It also significantly inhibited elevated concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), F2-isoprostane, and caspase-3 in renal tissues. Additionally, NF-κB protein levels were notably lower in the CLP+ montelukast group than in Cecal Ligation and Puncture group P<0.001. In addition, montelukast significantly mitigated extensive tubular damage in the murine sepsis group p<0.001. Conclusion These findings indicate that montelukast may serve as a promising therapeutic agent for sepsis-induced AKI.

                <p>by Xiaorui Dong, Du Jiao, Hongzhang Xue, Shiyu Fan, Chaochun Wei</p>

Traditional pangenome analysis focuses on gene presence/absence variations (gene PAVs). However, the current methods for gene PAV analysis are insensitive to detect small but valuable mutations within gene regions, and they overlook variations in intergenic regions. Additionally, the visual inspection of PAVs is an important but time-consuming step for pangenome analysis and result interpretation. To address these issues, we present APAV, an advanced toolkit designed for comprehensive PAV analysis and visualization. It integrates gene element-level PAV analysis and provides PAV analysis for arbitrary given regions in a genome. The resulted PAV profile can be visualized and investigated interactively with reports in HTML format, enabling researchers to conveniently verify sequencing read depth, target region coverage, and intervals of absence for each PAV. Furthermore, APAV offers various subsequent analysis and visualization functions based on the PAV profile table, including basic statistics, sample clustering, genome size estimation, and phenotype association analysis. We demonstrated the capability of APAV with pangenome analysis of tumor genomes and rice genomes. Performing PAV analysis at the element level not only provides more accurate information about the variations but also uncovers a larger number of variations for the phenotype-genotype association studies. In the rice genome analysis, we identified over twenty thousand distributed genes and more than fifty thousand distributed genetic elements. In the tumor genome analysis, element-level analysis revealed approximately three times as many phenotype-related genes as gene-level analysis. This indicates that altering the PAV unit from genes to smaller segments or elements can lead to more biological insights.

                <p>by Gyeongtae Kim, Pilwon Kim</p>

Engrams corresponding to distinct memories compete for retrieval in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, yet the detailed mechanisms underlying their formation remain elusive. Recent findings indicate that hippocampal inhibitory neurons display feature-selective firing patterns and diverse forms of synaptic plasticity, suggesting a crucial role in engram formation. Conventional CA3 attractor network models typically employ global inhibition, where inhibitory neurons uniformly suppress the activity of excitatory neurons. However, such models fail to capture the dynamics arising from sparse distributed coding or reflect inhibitory neurons’ roles in the competition between engrams during memory retrieval. We propose a mechanism for engram formation in CA3 using a spiking neural network model that emphasizes heterosynaptic plasticity at excitatory-to-inhibitory (E-to-I) synapses. In our model, inhibitory neurons associate with specific neural assemblies during encoding and selectively inhibit competing engrams during retrieval. Driven by a simplified feedforward dentate gyrus (DG), this mechanism generates sparse, distributed engrams in CA3. This representation allows us to examine the effects of selective inhibition on pattern completion across various conditions, including partially overlapping engrams. Simulations show that selective inhibition substantially enhances recall stability and accuracy compared to global inhibition alone. Furthermore, emergent activity patterns across DG, CA3, and CA1 of the model replicate experimental signatures of pattern separation and completion. These results suggest that assembly-specific inhibition mediated by heterosynaptic plasticity could provide a parsimonious mechanism for engram formation and competition in CA3, offering testable predictions for future experiments.

                <p>by Yuhan Li, Nicolò Gozzi, Nicola Perra</p>

The initial rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has been challenged by logistical issues, limited availability of doses, scarce healthcare capacity, spotty acceptance, and the emergence of variants of concern. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been critical to support these phases. However, vaccines may have prompted behavioural relaxation, potentially reducing NPIs adherence. Epidemic models have explored this phenomenon, but they have not been validated against data. Moreover, recent surveys provide conflicting results on the matter. The extent of behavioural relaxation induced by COVID-19 vaccines is still unclear. Here, we aim to study this phenomenon in four regions. We implement five realistic epidemic models which include age structure, multiple virus strains, NPIs, and vaccinations. One of the models acts as a baseline, while the others extend it including different behavioural relaxation mechanisms. First, we calibrate the baseline model and run counterfactual scenarios to quantify the impact of vaccinations and NPIs. Our results confirm the critical role of both in reducing infection and mortality rates. Second, using different metrics, we calibrate the behavioural models and compare them to each other and to the baseline. Including behavioural relaxation leads to a better fit of weekly deaths in three regions. However, the improvements are limited to a 2−10% reduction in weighted mean absolute percentage errors and these gains are generally offset by models’ increased complexity. Overall, we do not find clear signs of behavioural relaxation induced by COVID-19 vaccines on weekly deaths. Furthermore, our results suggest that if this phenomenon occurred, it generally involved only a minority of the population. Our work contributes to the retrospective validation of epidemic models developed amid the COVID-19 Pandemic and underscores the issue of non-identifiability of complex social mechanisms.

                <p>by Cristina S. D. Palma, Daniel J. Haller, Jeffrey J. Tabor, Oleg A. Igoshin</p>

Under starvation conditions, <i>B. subtilis</i> survives by differentiating into one of two cell types: biofilm matrix-producing cells or sporulating cells. These two cell-differentiation pathways are activated by the same phosphorylated transcription factor - Spo0A~P. Despite sharing the activation mechanism, these cell fates are mutually exclusive at the single-cell level. This decision has been shown to be controlled by the effects of growth rate on gene dosage and protein dilution in the biofilm matrix production network. In this work, we explore an alternative mechanism of growth rate-mediated control of this cell fate decision. Namely, using deterministic and stochastic modeling, we investigate how the growth-rate-dependent pulsing dynamics of Spo0A~P affect biofilm matrix deactivation and activation. Specifically, we show that the Spo0A~P pulsing frequency tunes the biofilm matrix deactivation and activation probability. Interestingly, we found that DNA replication is the cell cycle stage that most substantially contributes to the deactivation of biofilm matrix production. Finally, we report that the deactivation of biofilm matrix production is not primarily regulated by the effects of growth rate on gene dosage and protein dilution. Instead, it is driven by changes in the pulsing period of Spo0A~P. In summary, our findings elucidate another mechanism governing biofilm deactivation during the late stages of starvation, thereby advancing our understanding of how bacterial networks interpret dynamic transcriptional regulatory signals to control stress-response pathways.

                <p>by Christo Morison, Dudley Stark, Weini Huang</p>

Genetic mutations are footprints of cancer evolution and reveal critical dynamic parameters of tumour growth, which otherwise are hard to measure <i>in vivo</i>. The mutation accumulation in tumour cell populations has been described by various statistics, such as site frequency spectra (SFS), single-cell division distributions (DD) and mutational burden distributions (MBD). While DD and SFS have been intensively studied in phylogenetics especially after the development of whole genome sequencing technology of bulk samples, MBD has drawn attention more recently with the single-cell sequencing data. Although those statistics all arise from the same somatic evolutionary process, an integrated understanding of these distributions is missing and requires novel mathematical tools to better inform the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of tumours. Here we introduce dynamical matrices to analyse and unite the SFS, DD and MBD and derive recurrence relations for the expectations of these three distributions. While we successfully recover classic exact results in pure-birth cases for the SFS and the DD through our new framework, we derive a new expression for the MBD and approximate all three distributions when death is introduced. We demonstrate a natural link between the SFS and the single-cell MBD, and show that the MBD can be regenerated through the DD. Counter-intuitively, the single-cell MBD is mainly driven by the stochasticity arising in the DD, rather than the extra stochasticity in the number of mutations at each cell division.

During drug development, candidate compounds are extensively tested for proarrhythmic risk and in particular risk of Torsade de Pointes (TdP), as indicated by prolongation of the QT interval. Drugs that inhibit the rapid delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr) can prolong the action potential duration (APD) and thereby the QT interval, and so are routinely rejected. However, simultaneous inhibition of the L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL) can mitigate the effect of IKr inhibition, so that including both effects can improve test specificity. Mathematical models of the action potential (AP) can be used to predict the APD prolongation resulting from a given level of IKr and ICaL inhibition, but for use in safety-testing their predictive capabilities should first be carefully verified. We present the first systematic comparison between experimental drug-induced APD and predictions by AP models. New experimental data were obtained <i>ex vivo</i> for APD response to IKr and/or ICaL inhibition by applying 9 compounds at different concentrations to adult human ventricular trabeculae at physiological temperature. Compounds with similar effects on IKr and ICaL exhibited less APD prolongation compared to selective IKr inhibitors. We then integrated <i>in vitro</i> IC50 patch-clamp data for IKr and ICaL inhibition by the tested compounds into simulations with AP models. Models were assessed against the <i>ex vivo</i> data on their ability to recapitulate drug-induced APD changes observed experimentally. None of the tested AP models reproduced the APD changes observed experimentally across all combinations and degrees of IKr and/or ICaL inhibition: they matched the data either for selective IKr inhibitors or for compounds with comparable effects on IKr and ICaL. This work introduces a new benchmarking framework to assess the predictivity of current and future AP models for APD response to IKr and/or ICaL inhibition. This is an essential primary step towards an <i>in silico</i> framework that integrates <i>in vitro</i> data for translational clinical cardiac safety.

When formed in vivo, murine hemostatic thrombi exhibit a heterogeneous architecture comprised of distinct regions of densely and sparsely packed platelets. In this study, we utilize high-resolution electron microscopy alongside machine learning and physics-based simulations to investigate how such clot microstructure impacts molecular diffusivity. We used Serial Block Face – Scanning Electron Microscopy (SBF-SEM) to image select volumes of hemostatic masses formed in a mouse jugular vein, producing high-resolution 2D images. Images were segmented using machine learning software (Cellpose), whose training was augmented by manually segmented images. The segmented images were then utilized as 2D computational domains for Lattice Kinetic Monte-Carlo (LKMC) simulations. This process constitutes a computational pipeline that combines purely data-derived biological domains with physics-driven simulations to estimate how molecular movement is hindered in a hemostatic platelet mass. Using our pipeline, we estimated that the 2D hindered diffusion rates of a globular protein range from 2% to 40% of the unhindered rate, with denser packing regions lending to lower molecular diffusivity. These data suggest that coagulation reactions rates, thrombin generation and activity, as well as platelet releasate activity may be drastically impacted by the internal geometry of a hemostatic thrombus.

                <p>by Paul van Lent, Olga Bunkova, Bálint Magyar, Léon Planken, Joep Schmitz, Thomas Abeel</p>

Motivation: Metabolic kinetic models are widely used to model biological systems. Despite their widespread use, it remains challenging to parameterize these Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) for large scale kinetic models. Recent work on neural ODEs has shown the potential for modeling time-series data using neural networks, and many methodological developments in this field can similarly be applied to kinetic models.
Results: We have implemented a simulation and training framework for Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models using JAX/Diffrax, which we named <i>jaxkineticmodel</i>. JAX allows for automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation capabilities to speed up the parameterization of kinetic models, while also allowing for hybridizing kinetic models with neural networks. We show the robust capabilities of training kinetic models using this framework on a large collection of SBML models with different degrees of prior information on parameter initialization. We furthermore showcase the training framework implementation on a complex model of glycolysis. Finally, we show an example of hybridizing kinetic model with a neural network if a reaction mechanism is unknown. These results show that our framework can be used to fit large metabolic kinetic models efficiently and provides a strong platform for modeling biological systems.
Implementation: Implementation of <i>jaxkineticmodel</i> is available as a Python package at https://github.com/AbeelLab/jaxkineticmodel.

The mammalian neocortex, organized into six cellular layers or laminae, forms a cortical network within layers. Layer-specific computations are crucial for sensory processing of visual stimuli within the primary visual cortex. Laminar recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) are a powerful tool to study neural activity within cortical layers. Electric brain stimulation is widely used in basic neuroscience and in a large range of clinical applications. However, the layer-specific effects of electric stimulation on LFPs remain unclear. To address this gap, we recorded laminar LFP from capuchin monkeys’ primary visual cortex while presenting a flash visual stimulus. Simultaneously, we applied a low-frequency sinusoidal current to the occipital lobe with an offset frequency to the flash stimulus repetition rate. We analyzed the modulation of visual-evoked potentials with respect to the phase of applied electric stimulation. Our results reveal that only the deeper layers, but not the superficial layers, show phase-dependent changes in LFP components with respect to the applied current. Employing a cortical column model, we show that these in vivo observations can be explained by phase-dependent changes in the driving force within neurons of deeper layers. Our findings offer crucial insight into the selective modulation of cortical layers through electrical stimulation, thus advancing approaches for more targeted neuromodulation.

                <p>by Ainsley Temudo, Nina Dolfen, Bradley R. King, Genevieve Albouy</p>

Memory systems in humans are less segregated than initially thought as learning tasks from different memory domains (e.g., declarative versus procedural) can recruit similar brain areas. However, it remains unclear whether the functional role of these overlapping brain regions – and the hippocampus in particular – is domain-general. Here, we test the hypothesis that the hippocampus encodes and preserves the temporal order of sequential information irrespective of the nature of that information. We used multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired during the execution of learned sequences of movements and objects to assess brain patterns related to procedural and declarative memory processes, respectively. We also tested whether the hippocampus represents information about temporal order of items (here movements and objects in the motor and declarative domains, respectively) in a learned sequence irrespective of their nature. We also examined such coding in brain regions involved in both motor (primary and premotor cortices) and object (perirhinal cortex and parahippocampus) sequence learning. Our results suggest that hippocampal and perirhinal multivoxel activation patterns do not carry information about specific items or temporal position in a random series of objects or movements. Rather, these regions code for the representation of items in their learned temporal position in sequences irrespective of their nature (i.e., item-position coding). In contrast, although all other ROIs showed evidence of item-position coding, this representation could – at least partially – be attributed to the coding of other information such as position information. Altogether, our findings indicate that regions in the medial temporal lobe represent the temporal order of sequential information similarly in both the declarative and the motor memory domains. Our data suggest that these regions contribute to the development of item-position maps that might provide a cognitive framework for sequential behaviors irrespective of their nature.

                <p>by Ankita Sengupta, Devarajan Sridharan</p>

Reward expectation robustly guides both attention and decisions. Yet, whether common or distinct mechanisms mediate each of these processes remains unknown. Previous studies have often conflated the effect of reward expectation on sensory processing and decision-making because locations selected for sensory prioritization (sensitivity effects) were also prioritized for decisions (criterion effects). Here, we identify distinct forms of reward expectation that separably control spatial attention and decisional biases in human cortex. Sensitivity and criterion were independently modulated when expected rewards varied across locations (“space-specific”) or choices (“choice-specific”), respectively. Only sensitivity, not criterion, modulations reflected a limited, conserved attentional resource. Established neural and physiological signatures of attention, including gain modulation of event-related potentials, alpha-band power lateralization, and eye-movement biases, were elicited only by space-specific reward modulation. By contrast, neural correlates of decisional biases, including pre-stimulus alpha power suppression, selectively accompanied choice-specific reward modulation. Attention-related neural markers predicted sensitivity modulation by space-specific reward expectation but not criterion modulation by choice-specific reward expectation, indicating their distinct underlying mechanisms. Our findings uncover fundamentally dissociable behavioral and neural underpinnings of reward expectation effects on sensory and decisional selection, with critical implications for understanding how reward, attention, and choice are linked in the human brain.

                <p>by Chantal Wissing, Lena S. Eschholz, Maxime Maheu, Kathrin Sauter, Fabio Morellini, J. Simon Wiegert, Alexander Dieter</p>

The locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine (NE) system is involved in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Refining our understanding of LC function largely relies on selective transgene expression in LC-NE neurons, allowing targeted manipulation and readout of noradrenergic neurons. Here, we performed a side-by-side comparison of the most commonly used strategies to genetically target the LC, including different cre driver lines and promoter-mediated transgene expression. We report differences between these strategies in terms of transgene expression efficacy and specificity. Parallelly, we found no behavioral alterations in cre-expressing mice of any mouse line compared to wild-type littermates. Finally, to further facilitate the investigation of LC-NE function, we created a suite of constructs, including a reporter protein, a calcium indicator, and a light-driven cation channel, whose expression is mediated by the previously described PRS×8 promoter. These constructs allow identification, monitoring, and manipulation of LC-NE activity either in wild-type mice, or in combination with tissue-specific manipulations of different cre driver lines. The results of our study are crucial for the interpretation of previous experiments using the respective targeting strategies, as well as for the design of future studies.

                Abstract: Forensic anthropology is the study of skeletal remains for the identification of individuals and anthropology deals with study of human. Many research has been conducted to estimate stature from different body parts like foot, extremities, hand, vertebrae etc. In some cases, finding all body parts and bones in whole will be difficult in the crime scene for forensic examination. In such cases it becomes necessary to use other region such as the head and facial region for the estimation of height. Determination of height is an important in forensic examination for identification of the individual. This study was done to find the correlation between the stature and the morphological variations of the external auricular region for the estimation of stature for the purpose of forensic investigation. The study was conducted on 385 male individuals, total of 4 ear parameters were measured from both the ears using the digital caliper. The data was analyzed using Jamovi version 2.4.11. The result showed that there was positive correlation between all the dimensions with stature. The linear regression was done to find the statically significant difference between the stature and the parameters and it was found that the most predicted variable in males is the left ear length(p<0.001). This study concludes that the external auricular morphometry can be as an additional tool for the estimation of stature in the forensic investigation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-181/v2?src=rss">The comparison of totally ultrasound-guided versus fluoroscopy-guided shockwave lithotripsy in renal stone treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) has been a well-known therapy since years ago, especially for renal stones less than 20 mm. This study compared the effectiveness of totally ultrasound-guided (US-guided) and fluoroscopy-guided (FS-guided) SWL in treating renal and ureteral stones. A protocol has been registered in PROSPERO databases for systematic reviews. A systematic literature search was conducted in five online databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, EMBASE, ProQuest, and Scopus). We included all available articles that compared the effectiveness and safety of US-SWL to FS-SWL. A risk of bias assessment was done using Risk of Bias (Rob) Tools for randomized interventional studies and Risk of bias in non-randomized studies interventions (ROBINS-I) Tools for Non-randomized studies. The primary outcome was the stone-free rate, and the secondary outcome was the complication rate. Subgroup analyses were performed for adult and pediatric groups. A comprehensive literature search identified seven comparative articles that matched the criteria: two randomized trials and six retrospective cohort studies comprising 1,255 patients (609 using US-SWL). The results revealed a significant difference in overall stone-free rates between US-guided and FS-guided SWL RR 0.76(95% CI; 0.61-0.95, p=0.02) and in adults RR 0.76(95% CI; 0.60-0.96), but not children groups RR 0.68(95% CI; 0.24-1.88). US-SWL might be favourable due to the radiation-free procedure and real-time presentation. Complication rates were low, and no life-threatening complications were reported. In conclusion, US-guided SWL is more effective than FS-guided SWL for treating renal stones, with a low incidence of complications. Further randomized controlled trials with larger populations are needed to explore the comparison more accurately.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1134/v3?src=rss">Searching for non-English literature may be unnecessary for German HTA Reports [version 3; peer review: 2 approved, 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Health technology assessment (HTA) reports are based on comprehensive information retrieval. Current standards discourage the use of search restrictions, such as publication date and language. Given limited resources, it was unclear whether the effort invested in screening and translating studies published in languages other than English provided relevant additional information compared with the inclusion of English-language publications alone. We therefore analysed the impact of non-English publications on the conclusions of HTA reports produced by the German HTA agency, the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). Methods We determined whether non-English publications were included in all German HTA reports on non-drug interventions (published by IQWiG between 06/2007 to 08/2018) and on selected drug interventions. If at least one non-English publication was included, we assessed for each endpoint whether or not the exclusion of non-English publications changed the conclusion. If a non-English publication did not contain information relevant to the HTA report, we classified the publication as “not relevant”. Results Of 70 HTA reports, 38 (54%) included 126 non-English publications. In 4 reports (6%) with 50 endpoints investigated in 39 PICO questions, the exclusion of a total of 10 non-English publications led to a change in the conclusions for 13 endpoints (8 PICO questions). This was largely due to the fact that in many cases, non-English publications were the predominant or only literature available, resulting in a lack of analysable data after their exclusion. Conclusions In general, studies only published in non-English languages have little influence on the conclusions of German HTA reports. For the vast majority of topics, a language restriction to English seems justified. Studies published in non-English languages may be useful in exceptional cases, for example when an intervention is only available in certain countries.

                Katahira et al. show scRNA-seq indicating roles of mitochondrial membrane architecture during VSV infection. Altered mitochondrial structure-metabolism by F1FO ATP synthase inhibition, inducing oligomerization of the complex, reduces viral replication. Consistently, MIC60 deletion in CD11c-expressing cells limits viral replication and consequently reduces prolonged immune activation, associated with accumulation of anti-viral itaconate.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94628">The molecular logic of Gtr1/2- and Pib2-dependent TORC1 regulation in budding yeast</a></h4>

              
                The Target of Rapamycin kinase Complex 1 (TORC1) regulates cell growth and metabolism in eukaryotes. Previous studies have shown that, in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, nitrogen and amino acid signals activate TORC1 via the highly conserved small GTPases, Gtr1/2, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate binding protein, Pib2. However, it was unclear if/how Gtr1/2 and Pib2 cooperate to control TORC1. Here, we report that this dual regulator system pushes TORC1 into at least three distinct signaling states: (i) a Gtr1/2 on, Pib2 on, rapid growth state in nutrient replete conditions; (ii) a Gtr1/2 inhibited, Pib2 on, adaptive/slow growth state in poor-quality growth medium; and (iii) a Gtr1/2 off, Pib2 off, quiescent state in starvation conditions. We suggest that other signaling pathways work in a similar way to drive a multilevel response via a single kinase, but the behavior has been overlooked since most studies follow signaling to a single reporter protein.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101984">The ESCRT protein CHMP5 restricts bone formation by controlling endolysosome-mitochondrion-mediated cell senescence</a></h4>

              
                The dysfunction of the cellular endolysosomal pathway, such as in lysosomal storage diseases, can cause severe musculoskeletal disorders. However, how endolysosomal dysfunction causes musculoskeletal abnormalities remains poorly understood, limiting therapeutic options. Here, we report that CHMP5, a member of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III protein family, is essential to maintain the endolysosomal pathway and regulate bone formation in osteogenic lineage cells. Genetic ablation of <i>Chmp5</i> in mouse osteogenic cells increases bone formation in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, <i>Chmp5</i> deletion causes endolysosomal dysfunction by decreasing the VPS4A protein, and CHMP5 overexpression is sufficient to increase the VPS4A protein. Subsequently, endolysosomal dysfunction disturbs mitochondrial functions and increases mitochondrial ROS, ultimately resulting in skeletal cell senescence. Senescent skeletal cells cause abnormal bone formation by combining cell-autonomous and paracrine actions. Importantly, the elimination of senescent cells using senolytic drugs can alleviate musculoskeletal abnormalities in <i>Chmp5</i> conditional knockout mice. Therefore, our results show that cell senescence represents an underpinning mechanism and a therapeutic target for musculoskeletal disorders caused by the aberrant endolysosomal pathway, such as in lysosomal storage diseases. These results also uncover the function and mechanism of CHMP5 in the regulation of cell senescence by affecting the endolysosomal-mitochondrial pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105525">The C-terminus of the multi-drug efflux pump EmrE prevents proton leak by gating transport</a></h4>

              
                The model multi-drug efflux pump from <i>Escherichia coli</i>, EmrE, can perform multiple types of transport leading to different biological outcomes, conferring resistance to some drug substrates and enhancing susceptibility to others. While transporters have traditionally been classified as antiporters, symporters, or uniporters, there is growing recognition that some transporters may exhibit mixed modalities. This raises new questions about their regulation and mechanism. Here, we show that the C-terminal tail of EmrE acts as a secondary gate, preventing proton leak in the absence of drug. Substrate binding unlocks this gate, allowing transport to proceed. Truncation of the C-terminal tail (∆107-EmrE) leads to altered pH regulation of alternating access, an important kinetic step in the transport cycle, as measured by NMR. ∆107-EmrE has increased proton leak in proteoliposomes, and bacteria expressing this mutant have reduced growth. Molecular dynamics simulations of ∆107-EmrE show the formation of a water wire from the open face of the transporter to the primary binding site in the core, facilitating proton leak. In WT-EmrE, the C-terminal tail forms specific interactions that block the formation of the water wire. Together, these data strongly support the C-terminus of EmrE acting as a secondary gate that regulates access to the primary binding site.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103256">Magnetically steered cell therapy for reduction of intraocular pressure as a treatment strategy for open-angle glaucoma</a></h4>

              
                Trabecular meshwork (TM) cell therapy has been proposed as a next-generation treatment for elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma, the most common cause of irreversible blindness. Using a magnetic cell steering technique with excellent efficiency and tissue-specific targeting, we delivered two types of cells into a mouse model of glaucoma: either human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) or induced pluripotent cell derivatives (iPSC-TM cells). We observed a 4.5 [3.1, 6.0] mmHg or 27% reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) for 9 months after a single dose of only 1500 magnetically steered hAMSCs, explained by increased outflow through the conventional pathway and associated with a higher TM cellularity. iPSC-TM cells were also effective, but less so, showing only a 1.9 [0.4, 3.3] mmHg or 13% IOP reduction and increased risk of tumorigenicity. In both cases, injected cells remained detectable in the iridocorneal angle 3 weeks post-transplantation. Based on the locations of the delivered cells, the mechanism of IOP lowering is most likely paracrine signaling. We conclude that magnetically steered hAMSC cell therapy has potential for long-term treatment of ocular hypertension in glaucoma.

                Antibiotic resistance and tolerance present significant challenges in global healthcare, necessitating alternative strategies such as phage therapy. However, the rapid emergence of phage-resistant mutants poses a potential risk. Here, using <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> ATCC 43816 and its lytic phage Kp11 as a model system, we investigated bacterial persistence against phages, characterized by heterogeneous survival, analogous to antibiotic persistence. We found that heat treatment enhanced persistence and increased bacterial survival under phage exposure, subsequently promoting the evolution of phage resistance. Further experiments demonstrated that heat stress leads to a reduction in envelope components, thereby inhibiting phage DNA injection. Additionally, this heat-induced reduction resulted in systematic alterations in envelope stress responses, rendering bacteria tolerant to the antibiotic polymyxin while making them hypersensitive to pH changes and immune clearance. Our findings provide novel insights into bacteria-phage interactions and highlight potential challenges in implementing phage therapy in clinical settings.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91609">Highly sensitive in vivo detection of dynamic changes in enkephalins following acute stress in mice</a></h4>

              
                Enkephalins are opioid peptides that modulate analgesia, reward, and stress. In vivo detection of enkephalins remains difficult due to transient and low endogenous concentrations and inherent sequence similarity. To begin to address this, we previously developed a system combining in vivo optogenetics with microdialysis and a highly sensitive mass spectrometry-based assay to measure opioid peptide release in freely moving rodents (Al-Hasani et al., 2018, eLife). Here, we show improved detection resolution and stabilization of enkephalin detection, which allowed us to investigate enkephalin release during acute stress. We present an analytical method for real-time, simultaneous detection of Met- and Leu-enkephalin (Met-Enk and Leu-Enk) in the mouse nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) after acute stress. We confirm that acute stress activates enkephalinergic neurons in the NAcSh using fiber photometry and that this leads to the release of Met- and Leu-Enk. We also demonstrate the dynamics of Met- and Leu-Enk release as well as how they correlate to one another in the ventral NAc shell, which was previously difficult due to the use of approaches that relied on mRNA transcript levels rather than posttranslational products. This approach increases spatiotemporal resolution, optimizes the detection of Met-Enk through methionine oxidation, and provides novel insight into the relationship between Met- and Leu-Enk following stress.

">Listening Beyond The Labels</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative condition of cognitive decline, presents formidable challenges to patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems. Early identification is essential for successful intervention, but traditional diagnosis requires expensive neuroimaging and lengthy clinical assessments, which compromise access. This study proposes a semi-supervised machine learning strategy for AD diagnosis based on acoustic features from brief speech samples. The approach takes advantage of mel-spectrogram features to extract vocal patterns without manual transcription or linguistic preprocessing. Informative sound patterns are detected using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that gradually adds unlabeled speech data during training through pseudo-labeling. By emphasizing scalable, non-invasive methods that rely solely on unprocessed vocal inputs, this work presents a practical solution for large-scale cognitive screening in resource-limited settings.

">The amblyopic acuity deficit: impact on the identification of letters distorted by spatial scrambling algorithms</a></h4>

              
                The letter acuity impairment in the amblyopic eye often exceeds predictions made from the cut-off spatial frequency for grating detection. Spatial scrambling in the amblyopic eye's projections to the visual cortex has been proposed to bear some responsibility for this additional deficit. Using a novel stimulus algorithm that creates spatially scrambled bandpass letters, we generated stimuli simulating either: i) "cortical scrambling" at the output of oriented model "simple cells", or ii) "subcortical scrambling" of isotropic subunits that combine to form these simple cells. We also investigated a more conventional "noise masking" with bandpass noise. We performed two bandpass letter identification experiments, equating the stimuli shown to each eye by normalising either: i) their contrast, presenting them at four times their contrast detection threshold; or ii) their spatial scale, presenting them at twice the participant's acuity threshold for each eye. At the group level, we found that the amblyopic eye is less efficient at performing letter identification in bandpass noise. We did not find an overall significant difference with either scrambling type when comparing efficiency between the amblyopic and fellow eye, but we did find such a difference when partitioning our participants by their stereopsis ability. In further analyses of the pattern of mistakes, we found the amblyopic eye shows a distinctive behaviour which correlates with the acuity deficit for both types of scrambling. These results demonstrate that our scrambled stimuli interrogate a component of amblyopic vision that is functionally distinct from that addressed by contrast noise masking.

                The psychedelic psilocybin may have lasting therapeutic effects for patients with chronic pain syndromes. Some clinical and preclinical data suggest these putative benefits derive from direct analgesic effects. However, this possibility has not been comprehensively tested in preclinical models.

">Human TDP-43 overexpression in zebrafish motor neurons triggers MND-like phenotypes through gain-of-function mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Dysregulation of the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), including intraneuronal cytoplasmic mislocalisation and aggregation is a feature of multiple neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD), limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) and alzheimers disease (AD). Unravelling the causes and functional consequences of TDP-43 dysregulation is paramount to understanding disease mechanisms as well as identifying effective therapeutic targets. Here we present a comprehensive in vivo characterisation of three stable transgenic zebrafish models that express human TDP-43 variants in motor neurons. We demonstrate that overexpression of predominantly nuclear wildtype TDP-43, cytoplasm-targeted TDP-43, and an ALS-linked variant (G294V) each induce toxic gain-of-function effects, leading to impaired motor function, motor neuron loss, and muscle atrophy. Importantly, these models reveal distinct phenotypes, with the ALS-linked mutant exhibiting axonal transport deficits and neuromuscular junction disruption, while cytoplasmic mislocalised TDP-43 heightened susceptibility to oxidative stress. Two FDA-approved drugs used to treat ALS, edaravone and riluzole, were examined in these models and revealed that edaravone, but not riluzole, was effective in rescuing motor deficits associated with cytoplasmic TDP-43 expression and, to a lesser extent, mutant TDP-43_G294V. Collectively, these findings reveal distinct pathological consequences of TDP-43 dysregulation, providing neuron-centric mechanistic insights, and establish the humanised TDP-43 zebrafish as an efficient system for preclinical therapeutic testing.

">Education Shapes the Link Between EEG Aperiodic Components and Cognitive Aging</a></h4>

              
                Healthy aging brings widespread shifts in aperiodic (non-oscillatory) electroencephalographic (EEG) components, which may underlie physiological changes in cognitive performance. Education, a known protective factor against age-related decline in cognitive performance, has been largely overlooked in studies linking aperiodic EEG components to cognition. This study addresses this gap, hypothesizing that education moderates the interplay between age, aperiodic components, and cognitive performance, as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. We reanalyzed an open-source EEG dataset of 714 healthy individuals aged 18-91 years using Generalized Additive Mixed Models. Aperiodic exponent and offset both declined with age, but higher education levels mitigated these declines. Notably, exponent and offset interacted with age and education in predicting MMSE performance in the bilateral cingulate, left hippocampus, bilateral parietal, right occipital, and left temporal regions. Among older adults, the relationship between the aperiodic components and cognitive performance diverged by education: those with lower education showed worse cognitive outcomes with lower exponents and offsets, whereas higher-educated individuals after 60 years showed a reverse pattern, with lower exponents and offsets predicting better MMSE performance. Our findings suggest that the link between aperiodic components and cognitive aging is not straightforward but depends on moderating factors such as education. These results underscore the importance of accounting for individual differences, like educational background, when exploring age-related changes in EEG aperiodic components and cognition.

">Neural mechanisms of structural inference: an EEG investigation of linguistic phrase structure categorization</a></h4>

              
                Language comprehension is a complex cognitive process of understanding spoken or written language, during which the brain derives meanings and interprets messages by constructing hierarchical structures from word sequences. A key component underlying this process is structural inference. This computation determines the syntactic category ('head') of phrases, such as noun phrases (NP) and verb phrases (VP). Categorization confers distinct semantic and distributional properties. However, isolating neural correlates of structural inference is challenging, as modulations of syntactic category usually alter lexical content. Here, we collected the electroencephalography (EEG) data while participants read Mandarin NPs and VPs, which differ in their syntactic 'headedness' but with lexical-semantics, lexical-syntactic categories and word order strictly conserved. We found significant theta power increases at left central-parietal scalp sites in NPs relative to VPs around the presentation (0-210 ms) of the nouns, where only the nouns in NPs project a head. Both NPs and VPs relative to one-word phrases exhibited spatiotemporally consistent low-frequency power increases at the point of linguistic composition, consistent with previous studies. Overall, our findings offer novel constraints on neurocomputational accounts of linguistic structure-building through these previously undocumented signatures of syntactic inference.

">Neural Timescale of Adolescents Major Depressive Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Adolescent major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by heterogeneous symptomatology and complex neurodevelopmental underpinnings. Here, we investigated whether cortical intrinsic neural timescales (INT), a measure of temporal stability in neural activity, are altered in adolescents with MDD and whether these alterations relate to clinical symptoms, suicidality, early life adversity, and underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Using resting state fMRI in adolescents with MDD and healthy controls (HCs), we found widespread reductions in INT in frontal, parietal, and sensorimotor regions, with a notable prolongation in the left temporoparietal junction. Disrupted timescales significantly impaired network modularity and clustering, and SVR based machine learning revealed that altered INT patterns predicted individual depression and anxiety severity. INT abnormalities were further associated with suicidal ideation and childhood trauma, particularly emotional and physical neglect. Biophysical modeling linked INT variations to local recurrent excitation and external input strength, differing between HCs and MDD. Spatial correlations with PET derived neurotransmitter receptor maps demonstrated that INT alterations colocalize with serotonergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic systems. Transcriptomic enrichment analysis revealed associations with genes involved in mitochondrial function, synaptic signaling, and metabolic regulation. Together, these findings identify neural timescale disruption as a core pathophysiological feature of adolescent MDD, bridging macroscale dynamics with microcircuit and molecular architecture. INT may serve as a promising biomarker and mechanistic target for precision psychiatry in youth depression.

">Long-term independent use of an intracortical brain-computer interface for speech and cursor control</a></h4>

              
                Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide naturalistic communication and digital access to people with severe paralysis by decoding neural activity associated with attempted speech and movement. Recent work has demonstrated highly accurate intracortical BCIs for speech and cursor control, but two critical capabilities needed for practical viability were unmet: independent at-home operation without researcher assistance, and reliable long-term performance supporting accurate speech and cursor decoding. Here, we demonstrate the independent and near-daily use of a multimodal BCI with novel brain-to-text speech and computer cursor decoders by a man with paralysis and severe dysarthria due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Over nearly two years, the participant used the BCI for more than 3,800 cumulative hours to maintain rich interpersonal communication with his family and friends, independently control his personal computer, and sustain full-time employment -- despite being paralyzed. He communicated 183,060 sentences -- totaling 1,960,163 words -- at an average rate of 56.1 words per minute. He labeled 92.3% of sentences as being decoded at least mostly correctly. In formal quantifications of performance where he was asked to say words presented on a screen, attempted speech was consistently decoded with over 99% word accuracy (125,000 word vocabulary). The participant also used the speech BCI as keyboard input and the cursor BCI as mouse input to control his personal computer, enabling him to send text messages, emails, and to browse the internet. These results demonstrate that intracortical BCIs have the potential to support independent use in the home, marking a critical step toward practical assistive technology for people with severe motor impairment.

">Towards Precision Functional Brain Network Mapping in Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Parkinsons disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition that leads to widespread disruption of large-scale brain networks and is further complicated by substantial individual variability in symptomology, progression rates, and treatment response. Consequently, the investigation of individual differences in networks measured via resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) may provide insight. However, most RSFC studies are unable to identify interindividual differences due to poor reliability and group average network definitions. Precision RSFC addresses these shortcomings through extended data collection, strict denoising, and individual network definition, but remains untested in PD. Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility and reliability of precision RSFC studies in PD. Methods: We collected >100 minutes of RSFC data from 20 PD and 6 healthy controls participants. We evaluated the level of motion, reliability and stability of RSFC measures in each participant and contrasted these measures between the PD and HC groups, as well as compared to a conventional 5 minutes of RSFC data. In addition, we created individualized brain network measures in PD participants to establish feasibility in this population. Results: Using precision methods, the PD group produced reliable and stable RSFC measures of brain networks of similar quality to healthy controls and substantially better than conventional methods. Individualized network maps from individuals with PD demonstrate differences from group averages and from each other, including in key motor systems. Conclusion: Precision RSFC is feasible and reliable in individuals with PD. This approach holds promise for advancing personalized diagnostics and identifying brain-based biomarkers underlying clinical variability in PD.

">Neuroplasticity of directed connectivity in long-term meditation: Evidence from EEG Granger causality</a></h4>

              
                The objective of the present study was to characterize the effects of long-term meditation (LTM) on directed connectivity patterns during resting-state and meditative brain states. Specifically, it was aimed to identify major cortical sources of information flow and target regions of information influx, and to reveal which frequency-specific oscillatory networks are critically involved in directing information flux in experienced meditators.

Multivariate Granger causality (GC) was computed from high-resolution EEG signals recorded from long-term (LTM, n = 22) and short-term meditators (STM, n = 17) in four conditions: rest, Focused Attention Meditation, Open Monitoring Meditation, and Loving Kindness Meditation. GC was analyzed in the time and frequency domains to assess frequency-specific networks supporting the directed connectivity between key cortical regions (frontal and parietal) in the two hemispheres.

According to the results, long-practice meditation was characterized by a significant increase of information flow (1) from posterior to frontal cortical regions, and (2) across frontal regions of the two hemispheres. These dominant transfers were supported by multi-spectral oscillatory networks involving theta, alpha and beta frequency bands, with most prominent expression of GC alpha peak. This pattern of enhanced information transfer in LTM relative to STM was observed in both resting state and each meditation state.

These results suggest that long-term meditation is associated with a shift in resting-state brain dynamics toward reduced reliance on slow, undirected intrinsic oscillations, and enhanced directional connectivity in frequencies linked to attention and cognitive control. The dominant posterior-to-anterior directionality points to a reorganization of cognitive control networks that may support the phenomenological qualities of extensive meditation (sustained attention, internal attention, present-moment awareness, and reduced cognitive elaboration). The similarity of between-group differences in directionality patterns across states points to a neuroplastic effect of long-term meditation and highlights meditation as a potential model for investigating adaptive neuroplasticity in large-scale brain networks.

">Psychedelic 5-HT2A agonist increases spontaneous and evoked 5-Hz oscillations in visual and retrosplenial cortex</a></h4>

              
                Visual perception appears largely stable in time. However, psychophysical studies have revealed that theta waves (4-8 Hz) can modulate perception and have been linked to various cognitive states and functions. Neither the contribution of theta waves to cortical activity nor their impact during aberrant brain states have been resolved at high spatiotemporal scales. Here, using cortex-wide population voltage imaging in awake mice, we found that bouts of 5-Hz oscillations in the visual cortex are accompanied by similar oscillations in the retrosplenial cortex, occurring both spontaneously and evoked by visual stimulation. Injection of psychotropic 5-HT2AR agonist induced a significant increase in spontaneous 5-Hz oscillations, and also increased the power, occurrence probability and temporal persistence of visually evoked 5-Hz oscillations. This modulation of 5-Hz oscillations in both cortical areas indicates a strengthening of top-down control of perception, supporting an underlying mechanism of perceptual filling and visual hallucinations.

">Satiety Does Not Silence Food Attention: BMI Modulates Attentional Bias Toward High-Calorie Cues</a></h4>

              
                Background: Attentional bias (AB) for palatable foods has been linked to overeating, yet data on its modulation with body-mass index (BMI) and hunger/satiety are inconsistent. We tested whether hunger, sensory-specific satiety and BMI interact to shape automatic capture of attention by real high-calorie snack foods. Methods: Two emotional-attentional-blink (EAB) experiments presented food distractors either 300 msec (lag-3) or 900 msec (lag-9) before a neutral target. Experiment 1 (N = 183; whole BMI range) randomly assigned participants to taste (non-satiated), satiated or non-eating conditions; the snacks eaten (or not eaten) subsequently re-appeared as distractors in the EAB task. Experiment 2 (N = 61; 31 overweight/obese, 30 normal-weight) manipulated hunger/satiety states and snack type (consumed vs. novel) orthogonally, in a double session design. Results: Experiment 1; food images presented at lag-3 reduced target detection compared with lag-9 (OR = 0.61, CI 0.50 - 0.75, p < .01. Higher BMI predicted a larger AB when hungry, but a smaller AB when satiated (OR = 0.65, CI 0.48 - 0.88, p < 0.01). Experiment 2; For novel snacks, an interaction revealed that participants with overweight/obesity retained robust AB after satiation, whereas AB declined for participants with normal-weight (OR = 2.45, CI 1.09 - 5.51, p = 0.03). For snacks just eaten, AB remained significant in both groups (lag-3 vs. lag-9: OR = 0.37, CI 0.25 - 0.55, p < .001). Conclusions: Real-food cues automatically biased attention regardless of metabolic state, with BMI modulating this effect: even when satiated, individuals with overweight/obesity continue to orient their attention toward both familiar and novel high-calorie foods. These findings suggest that satiety signals alone may be insufficient to curb attentional capture by food in obesity, highlighting the need for interventions that target attentional control and limit food availability.

                Repeatedly processing an object leads to subsequent behavioral improvements in its identification and reductions in associated neural activity, a form of neural processing efficiency that multiple theoretical models have attempted to explain. Using simultaneous fMRI-EEG in humans during object naming, we find that stimulus-driven oscillatory power from high (gamma) to low frequencies (theta) increases and resolves earlier with repetition in task-engaged frontal and occipitotemporal brain regions identified as showing repetition suppression in fMRI. Changes in gamma oscillatory power in these regions were correlated with behavioral priming across subjects and additionally with fMRI repetition suppression in left frontal cortex, providing multimodal support for a novel mixture of the previously proposed Synchrony and Facilitation models.

">Music-evoked reactivation during continuous perception is associated with enhanced subsequent recall of naturalistic events</a></h4>

              
                Music is a potent cue for recalling personal experiences, yet the neural basis of music-evoked memory remains elusive. We address this question by using the full-length film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to examine how repeated musical themes reactivate previously encoded events in cortex and shape next-day recall. Participants in an fMRI study viewed either the original film (with repeated musical themes) or a no-music version. By comparing neural activity patterns between these groups, we found that music-evoked reactivation of neural patterns linked to earlier scenes in the default mode network was associated with improved subsequent recall. This relationship was specific to the music condition and persisted when we controlled for a proxy measure of initial encoding strength (spatial intersubject correlation), suggesting that music-evoked reactivation may play a role in making event memories stick that is distinct from what happens at initial encoding.

">Sleep promotes aversive value coding in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is a state of reduced behavioural responsiveness to the external world. Lowered arousal is thought to arise from sensory gating in the brain, yet there is compelling evidence that stimuli can still be processed to some degree. Which aspects of sensory information are processed during sleep remains largely unknown. Here, we perform comprehensive recordings of activity from multiple neuron types during sleep and wakefulness in the Drosophila olfactory association center. We find that baseline activity of dopamine neurons (DANs) is distinct between active, rest and sleep states, enabling a decoder to predict when the fly is asleep. Optogenetic inhibition of DANs acutely induces sleep and lowers odor-evoked arousal, suggesting causality between DAN activity and behavior. We then examine odor processing during sleep, and find that whereas coding of odor identity in Kenyon cells (KCs) remains intact, coding of odor value in DANs is altered. Specifically, DANs encoding positive (attractive) and negative (aversive) values change their odor responses in an opposing manner, producing more aversive odor representations during sleep. Consistent with these changes in neural activity, sleeping flies awoken by odors show reduced approach and increased avoidance behaviour. Taken together, our data reveal that the brain does not simply suppress the propagation of sensory signals during sleep; rather, it utilizes different cell types to retain or modify specific aspects of sensory information. The aversive odor evaluation in DANs may have ethological benefits as it suppresses the motivation to pursue attractive odors during sleep and primes defensive action when aroused by the scent of potential dangers.

">Cortico-striatal dynamics across working memory stages</a></h4>

              
                Working memory depends on the temporary retention and manipulation of information, bridging the gap between short-term memory and information processing functions. However, when the same working memory task is repeated over several days, it raises the question of whether the rule or task set becomes automated (or proceduralized). The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is crucial for working memory. Yet, the role of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) in the automation (proceduralization) of rules or task sets remains to be clarified. Using a longitudinal approach of the delay non-match to place (DNMP) task in a T-maze combined to silencing the mPFC or DLS in mice, we show that the mPFC becomes less critical in the maintenance phase of the task as behaviour progressively shifts toward automation. During this phase, the DLS facilitates automated processing. Accordingly, silencing the DLS during maintenance of the task triggers an adaptation in learning strategies, reactivating a goal-directed behaviour. Our findings strengthen the view that memory traces result from a dynamic reorganization of neural networks, challenging the classical view that information merely migrates between brain structures. We here propose that the memory trace remains in a dormant state less energy-consuming for the system while still allowing for rapid flexibility in case of task modification.

">Inhibiting Clarinet/CLA-1 restores function to injured motor neurons</a></h4>

              
                To regain function, injured axons need to both regenerate and reform synapses with appropriate postsynaptic cells. We found that inhibiting the scaffolding protein Clarinet/CLA-1, a C. elegans ortholog of Piccolo and Fife, robustly improves axon regeneration. Despite the importance of CLA-1 during synapse development, disrupting the medium isoform of CLA-1 increases the number of axons that regenerate to the neuromuscular junction without significantly influencing synapse reformation. Consequently, the axons that do regenerate are capable of regaining function. Mechanistically, the enhanced axon regeneration observed in cla-1(-) mutants depends on the function of PTRN-1, a microtubule minus-end binding protein. Our data supports a model where loss of CLA-1 promotes PTRN-1 function, which speeds trafficking of injury-related cargo to and from the lesion, thus improving repair. Together, our results reveal a highly conserved synaptic active zone protein that can be manipulated to enhance axon regeneration without sacrificing the function of the repaired axons.

">Multiplexed detection of nuclear immediate early gene expression reveals hippocampal neuronal subpopulations that engage in the acquisition and updating of spatial experience</a></h4>

              
                Acquired spatial representations are not static. Each re-exposure to the spatial environment stimulates retrieval of the stored experience followed by information re-encoding, including updating if the environment has changed. It remains unclear if the same neurons are involved in these three events. Here, we used a multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) approach that detected time-locked nuclear immediate early gene(IEG) expression to identify hippocampal neuronal ensembles that were engaged in the acquisition of a spatial representation, as well as its subsequent stabilization and/or updating. Responses were assessed in distal(dCA1) and proximal CA1(pCA1) of male rats. Homer1a was used to detect neuronal recruitment triggered by novel learning of a holeboard environment(HB). cFos and Arc expression was used to detect ensemble stability and/or expansion, or ensemble remodeling, respectively, that was triggered by animal exposure to the now familiar HB that included novel objects(HBO) 25min after the initial HB exposure. Novel HB exposure resulted in nuclear Homer1a expression in both dCA1 and pCA1. Subsequent HBO triggered significant cFos and Arc expression only in dCA1. IEG co-labelling (Homer1a/cFos, Homer1a/Arc and Homer1a/cFos/Arc) was also only evident in dCA1, reflecting both re-iteration and remodeling of dCA1, but not pCA1 ensembles. In sum, we show that the contiguous acquisition and updating of spatial representations recruits distinct populations of CA1-neurons reflecting ensemble selection and stabilization, as well as ensemble remodeling. Moreover, whereas dCA1 and pCA1 are involved in the acquisition of the original spatial representation, only dCA1 is engaged in representation updating related to changes in spatial content information.

">Genome-wide analysis reveals pathways important for the development and maturation of excitatory synaptic connections to GABAergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                A high degree of cell and circuit-specific regulation has presented challenges for efforts to precisely define molecular mechanisms controlling synapse formation and maturation. Here, we pursue an unbiased forward genetic approach to identify C. elegans genes involved in the formation and maturation of cholinergic synaptic connections with GABAergic motor neurons as indicated by the distribution of GFP-tagged postsynaptic AChRs in GABAergic dendrites. We identified mutations in 3 genes that identify key processes in synapse/circuit maturation: postsynaptic receptor assembly, cargo trafficking, and synapse structural organization. Mutation of the RUN domain (RPIP8, UNC-14, and NESCA) cargo adaptor unc-14 dramatically impacted both dendritic spines and overall GABAergic neuron morphology. In contrast, mutation of the nicotinic acetylcholine alpha subunit unc-63 caused a failure in AChR assembly in GABAergic neurons but did not significantly alter dendritic spine structure or abundance. Notably, specific expression of wild type unc-14 cDNA in either GABAergic neurons or presynaptic cholinergic neurons was not sufficient to rescue the unc-14 mutant phenotype while pan neuronal expression provided significant rescue, indicating that disruptions in GABAergic neuron morphology arise from compound effects. Finally, we obtained a mutation in the Liprin-; synaptic scaffold syd-2 that produces a stop codon in a C-terminal SAM domain and has severe effects on dendritic spines and AChR localization. Our unbiased strategy identified key genes that implicate three distinct cellular processes important for synapse/circuit development and maturation. The identification of these genes from our screen highlights how mechanisms for receptor assembly, cargo trafficking and synapse structural organization each contribute to circuit connectivity.

">Intravital Multimodal Imaging of Human Cortical Organoids for Chronic Stroke Treatment in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Chronic stroke leads to enduring neurological deficits and remains a major clinical challenge. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cortical organoids (COs) offer promise for regenerative therapies, yet their application in chronic stroke remains understudied, in part due to limited tools for monitoring graft in vivo. Here, we present a Multimodal Imaging Platform for Organoid Tracking (MIPOT), which integrates MRI, bioluminescence imaging, light microscopy, and two-photon fluorescence microscopy to noninvasively track transplanted COs in the post-stroke brain over time. Using MIPOT, we verified precise delivery of COs into cleaned stroke cavities, observed progressive declines in viability within the first 10 days, and introduced labeling methods for functional in vivo tracking of COs at subcellular resolution. By 4 weeks post-transplantation, histological analysis revealed survival of COs in the cerebral cortex. Notably, COs engrafted into the hippocampus displayed enhanced maturation, underscoring the role of local microenvironments in graft integration. MIPOT enables dynamic, noninvasive evaluation of hiPSC COs in chronic stroke, providing a foundation for mechanistic studies and translational development of organoid-based therapies.

">Progressive Remodeling of Global Protein Interaction Networks in a Mouse Model of Tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative disease is marked not just by loss of proteins or cells, but by dynamic rewiring of macromolecular interaction networks that precede and drive pathology. Here, we present the first temporally resolved, systems-scale map of multi-protein complex remodeling in a tauopathy model, integrating cofractionation mass spectrometry, quantitative phosphoproteomics, and machine learning to decode phosphorylation-dependent shifts in protein interactomes across disease progression. This interactomic atlas identifies functionally validated assemblies, including MAPT::Dpysl2 and Cyfip1::actin complexes that modulate early disease phenotypes in vivo. By revealing how phosphorylation tunes macromolecular complex architecture and function, this work reframes tauopathy as a disease of dynamic network instability, and establishes a generalizable framework for early detection and mechanistic dissection of neurodegeneration.
