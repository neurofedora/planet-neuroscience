	<p>Patients with post-stroke impairments present often significant variation in response to therapeutic interventions. Recent studies have shown that daily music listening can aid post-stroke recovery of language and memory, but reliable predictors of treatment response are unknown. Utilizing data from the music intervention arms of a single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) on stroke patients (N = 31), we built regression models to predict the treatment response of a two-month music listening intervention on language skills and verbal memory with baseline demographic, clinical and musical data as well as fMRI data from a music listening task. Clinically, greater improvement in verbal memory and language skills after the music listening intervention were predicted by the severity of the initial deficit and educational level. Neurally, greater baseline fMRI activation during vocal music listening in the left parietal cortical and medial frontal areas predicted greater treatment-induced improvement in language skills and greater baseline engagement of the auditory network during instrumental music listening predicted improvement in both verbal memory and language skills. Our results suggest that clinical, demographic, and neuroimaging data predicts music listening treatment response. This data could be used clinically to target music-based treatments.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex differences in choice-based thermal nociceptive tasks in adult rats</a></h4>

              
                Interest in the role of sex as a biological variable continues to increase, including a mandate for the study of both sexes in NIH-funded research. Choice-based thermal nociceptive tests allow for the study of a more spontaneous response to thermal stimuli and avoidance behavior compared to traditional nociceptive assays, and their usage has been increasing in recent years. However, to date no comparison of naive male and female responses to such tests has been published. As sex differences are known to exist in both human chronic pain conditions and rodent models of nociception, it is critical to understand the impact of sex on any nociceptive assay. Herein, we examined the effect of sex on two choice-based thermal nociceptive tests, the thermal gradient test and the temperature place preference test, in adult rats. We report that marked sex differences exist in responses to these tests. Namely, the activation of a 10 C-to-47 C thermal gradient results in an increase in time spent in the 10 C zone in females, compared to a reduction in males. In a temperature place preference test pairing a surface temperature of 22 C with either 5 C, 10 C, 47 C, or 50 C, males spent less than 50% of their time in every non-22 C zone, but in females this was only observed when testing 50 C. Together, these results suggest that male rats show more avoidance behavior to non-ambient temperatures when given free access to multiple zones, including at temperatures which are milder than those typically used to evoke a nociceptive response in traditional hot and cold plate tests.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The gradient model of brain organization in decisions involving 'empathy for pain'</a></h4>

              
                Recent meta-analytic studies of social cognition and the functional imaging of empathy have exposed the overlap between their neural substrates and heteromodal association areas. The 'gradient model' of cortical organization proposes a close relationship between these areas and highly connected hubs in the default mode network, a set of cortical areas deactivated by demanding tasks. Here, we used a decision-making task and representational similarity analysis with classic 'empathy for pain' visual stimuli to probe the relationship between high-level representations of imminent pain in others and the high end of the gradient of this model. High-level representations were found to co-localize with task deactivations or the transitions from activations to deactivations. These loci belonged to two groups: those that loaded on the high end of the principal cortical gradient and were associated by meta-analytic decoding with the default mode network, and those that appeared to accompany functional repurposing of somatosensory cortex in the presence of visual stimuli. In contrast to the nonspecific meta-analytic decoding of these loci, low-level representations, such as those of body parts involved in pain or of pain itself, were decoded with matching topics terms. These findings suggest that that task deactivations may set out cortical areas that host high-level representations, but whose functional characterization in terms of simple mappings is unlikely. We anticipate that an increased understanding of the cortical correlates of high-level representations may improve neurobiological models of social interactions and psychopathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Joint Learning of Full-structure Noise in Hierarchical Bayesian Regression Models</a></h4>

              
                We consider the reconstruction of brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG). This inverse problem can be formulated as a linear regression with independent Gaussian scale mixture priors for both the source and noise components. Crucial factors influencing accuracy of source estimation are not only the noise level but also its correlation structure, but existing approaches have not addressed estimation of noise covariance matrices with full structure. To address this shortcoming, we develop hierarchical Bayesian (type-II maximum likelihood) models for observations with latent variables for source and noise, which are estimated jointly from data. As an extension to classical sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), where across-sensor observations are assumed to be independent and identically distributed, we consider Gaussian noise with full covariance structure. Using the majorization-maximization framework and Riemannian geometry, we derive an efficient algorithm for updating the noise covariance along the manifold of positive definite matrices. We demonstrate that our algorithm has guaranteed and fast convergence and validate it in simulations and with real MEG data. Our results demonstrate that the novel framework significantly improves upon state-of-the-art techniques in the real-world scenario where the noise is indeed non-diagonal and fully-structured. Our method has applications in many domains beyond biomagnetic inverse problems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Does the brain care about averages? A simple test.</a></h4>

              
                Trial-averaged metrics, e.g. in the form of tuning curves and population response vectors, are a basic and widely accepted way of characterizing neuronal activity. But how relevant are such trial-averaged responses to neuronal computation itself? Here we present a simple test to estimate whether average responses reflect aspects of neuronal activity that contribute to neuronal processing in a specific context. The test probes two assumptions inherent in the usage of average neuronal metrics: 1) Reliability: Neuronal responses repeat consistently enough across single stimulus instances that the average response template they relate to remains recognizable to downstream regions. 2) Behavioural relevance: If a single-trial response is more similar to the average template, this should make it easier for the animal to identify the correct stimulus or action. We apply this test to a large publicly available data set featuring electrophysiological recordings from 42 cortical areas in behaving mice. In this data set, we show that single-trial responses were less correlated to the average response template than one would expect if they simply represented discrete versions of the template, down-sampled to a finite number of spikes. Moreover, single-trial responses were barely stimulus-specific -- they could not be clearly assigned to the average response template of one stimulus. Most importantly, better-matched single-trial responses did not predict accurate behaviour for any of the recorded cortical areas. We conclude that in this data set, average responses do not seem particularly relevant to neuronal computation in a majority of brain areas, and we encourage other researchers to apply similar tests when using trial-averaged neuronal metrics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Graph Ricci Curvatures Reveal Disease-related Changes in Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a set of neurodevelopmental disorders that pose a significant global health burden. Measures from graph theory have been used to characterise ASD-related changes in resting-state fMRI functional connectivity networks (FCNs), but recently developed geometry-inspired measures have not been applied so far. In this study, we applied geometry-inspired graph Ricci curvatures to investigate ASD-related changes in resting-state fMRI FCNs. To do this, we applied Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci curvatures to compare networks of ASD and healthy controls (N = 1112) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE-I) dataset. We performed these comparisons at the brain-wide level as well as at the level of individual brain regions, and further, determined the behavioral relevance of region-specific differences with Neurosynth meta-analysis decoding. We found brain-wide ASD-related differences for both Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci curvatures. For Forman-Ricci curvature, these differences were distributed across 83 of the 200 brain regions studied, and concentrated within the Default Mode, Somatomotor and Ventral Attention Network. Meta-analysis decoding identified the brain regions showing curvature differences as involved in social cognition, memory, language and movement. Notably, comparison with results from previous non-invasive stimulation (TMS/tDCS) experiments revealed that the set of brain regions showing curvature differences overlapped with the set of brain regions whose stimulation resulted in positive cognitive or behavioural outcomes in ASD patients. These results underscore the utility of geometry-inspired graph Ricci curvatures in characterising disease-related changes in ASD, and possibly, other neurodevelopmental disorders.

	<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common and pivotal non-motor symptom in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). It is necessary to use the appropriate tools to characterize the cognitive profiles and identify the subjects at risk of MCI in clinical practice. A cohort of 207 non-demented patients with PD and 52 age- and gender-matched cognitively normal controls (NCs) underwent the Chinese Version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-BC) evaluation. Patients with PD also received detailed motor and non-motor evaluation by serial scales. Cognitive profiles were investigated in patients with PD-MCI, relative to patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and cognitively NCs. In addition, differences in demography, major motor and non-motor symptoms were compared between patients with PD-MCI and PD-NC. There were 70 patients with PD-MCI, occupying 33.8% of the total patients. Patients with PD-MCI had impairment in multiple cognitive domains, especially in executive function, memory and visuospatial function on MoCA-BC, relative to cognitively NCs or PD-NC. Compared with PD-NC patients, PD-MCI patients were older (p = 0.002) and had a later onset age (p = 0.007) and higher score of the Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III (p = 0.001). The positive rate of clinical possible rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (cpRBD) in the PD-MCI group was significantly increased relative to the PD-NC group (p = 0.003). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that older age (OR = 1.06; p = 0.012), higher score of UPDRS-III (OR = 1.03; p = 0.018) and the presence of cpRBD (OR = 2.10; p = 0.037) were independently associated factors of MCI in patients with PD. In conclusion, executive function, memory and visuospatial function are the main impaired cognitive profiles in PD-MCI via MoCA-BC. Aging, motor severity and RBD may be independently related factors of MCI in PD.</p>

	<p>Currently, there are no pharmacological treatments able to reverse nigral degeneration in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), hence the unmet need for the provision of neuroprotective agents. Cannabis-derived phytocannabinoids (CDCs) and resveratrol (RSV) may be useful neuroprotective agents for PD due to their anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. To evaluate this, we undertook a systematic review of the scientific literature to assess the neuroprotective effects of CDCs and RSV treatments in pre-clinical in vivo animal models of PD. The literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science core collection were systematically searched to cover relevant studies. A total of 1034 publications were analyzed, of which 18 met the eligibility criteria for this review. Collectively, the majority of PD rodent studies demonstrated that treatment with CDCs or RSV produced a significant improvement in motor function and mitigated the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Biochemical analysis of rodent brain tissue suggested that neuroprotection was mediated by anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. This review highlights the neuroprotective potential of CDCs and RSV for in vivo models of PD and therefore suggests their potential translation to human clinical trials to either ameliorate PD progression and/or be implemented as a prophylactic means to reduce the risk of development of PD.</p>

	<p>The objectives of this study were: (1) to identify subjects with hyperprolactinemia in a clinical sample of patients; (2) to compare the neurologic, psychiatric, and sleep conditions found in patients subgrouped by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and hyperprolactinemia; and (3) to identify patients with hyperprolactinemia and EDS not supported by the presence of any other neurologic, psychiatric, or sleep disorder, or substance/medication use. A retrospective chart review of inpatients was carried out in order to identify all patients in whom the prolactin (PRL) serum levels were determined. A total of 130 subjects were retrieved: 55 had increased levels of PRL, while the remaining 75 participants had normal PRL levels. EDS was reported by 32 (58.2%) participants with increased PRL and 34 (45.3%) with normal PRL. Obstructive sleep apnea or other sleep or neurologic/psychiatric conditions could explain EDS in all participants with normal PRL. Among subjects with increased PRL, eight had no other neurologic/psychiatric or sleep disorder (or drug) potentially causing EDS; these participants, at polysomnography, had time in bed, sleep period time, and total sleep time longer than those with EDS associated to another condition. These findings can be considered as a preliminary indication of a role of hyperprolactinemia in EDS and represent a basis for future controlled studies able to test this hypothesis in a reliable, objective, and methodologically more appropriate way.</p>

	<p>Background: There is an increasing body of research supporting the idea that cardiac interoceptive accuracy (IAc) can be improved by training. Findings concerning the effects of a single yoga session on IAc and the related construct emotional experience are sparse. The aim of this study was to examine if a single yoga session increases IAc and improves emotional experience. Methods: 137 students were randomly assigned to a 20-min yoga session (n = 47), an endurance session (n = 46), or an inactive control condition (n = 44). IAc and emotional experience were assessed before and after the sessions. Results: There were no significant changes in IAc, or positive and negative affect. IAc at baseline and the change in positive effect were found as predictors for IAc after the yoga session. Conclusion: A 20-min yoga session seems to be not applicable to improve IAc and emotional experience. Future studies should investigate long-term interventions and diverse healthy and clinical populations.</p>

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e19f9a16-d089-4c57-8bdf-32c979782343/jnr24991-toc-0001-m.png"
     alt="Effects of place of stimulation on the interaural time difference sensitivity in bilateral electrical intracochlear stimulations: Neurophysiological study in a rat model"/>
<p>The effects of the intracochlear location of electrical stimulation on the sensitivity to interaural time difference (ITD) were determined by using a single-unit recording in the rat inferior colliculus. The ability to discriminate the ITD differences of apical stimulation, determined by the just noticeable difference, are better than those of basal stimulation.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We examined the sensitivity of the neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) in male and female rats to the interaural time differences (ITDs) conveyed in electrical pulse trains. Using bipolar pairs of electrodes that selectively activate the auditory nerve fibers at different intracochlear locations, we assessed whether the responses to electrical stimulation with ITDs in different frequency regions were processed differently. Most well-isolated single units responded to the electrical stimulation in only one of the apical or basal cochlear regions, and they were classified as either apical or basal units. Regardless of the cochlear stimulating location, more than 70% of both apical and basal units were sensitive to ITDs of electrical stimulation. However, the pulse rate dependence of neural ITD sensitivity differed significantly depending on the location of the stimulation. Moreover, ITD discrimination thresholds and the relative incidence of ITD tuning type markedly differed between units activated by apical and basal stimulations. With apical stimulation, IC neurons had a higher incidence of peak-type ITD function, which mostly exhibited the steepest position of the tuning curve within the rat's physiological ITD range of ±160 μs and, accordingly, had better ITD discrimination thresholds than those with basal stimulation. These results support the idea that ITD processing in the IC might be determined by functionally segregated frequency-specific pathways from the cochlea to the auditory midbrain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Organization of sympathetic innervation of interscapular brown adipose tissue in the mouse</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) is under sympathetic control, and recent studies emphasized the importance of efferent sympathetic and afferent sensory or humoral feedback systems to regulate adipose tissue function and overall metabolic health. However, functional studies of the sympathetic nervous system in the mouse are limited, because details of anatomy and fine structure are lacking. Here, we used reporter mice for tyrosine hydroxylase expressing neurons (TH:tomato mice), iDISCO tissue clearance, confocal, light sheet, and electron microscopy to clarify that <b>a)</b> iBAT receives sympathetic input via dorsal rami (instead of often cited intercostal nerves); <b>b)</b> dorsal rami T1-T5 correspond to the post-ganglionic input from sympathetic chain ganglia (stellate/T1-T5); <b>c)</b> dorsal rami serve as conduits for sympathetic axons that branch off in finer nerve bundles to enter iBAT; <b>d)</b> axonal varicosities show strong differential innervation of brown (dense innervation) versus white (sparse innervation) adipocytes, that surround the core iBAT in the mouse and are intermingled in human adipose tissues, <b>e)</b> axonal varicosities can form neuro-adipocyte junctions with brown adipocytes. Taken together, we demonstrate that sympathetic iBAT innervation is organized by specific nerves and terminal structures that can be surgically and genetically accessed for neuromodulatory purposes.</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>In the premature newborn, perinatal inflammation mediated by microglia contributes significantly to neurodevelopmental injuries including white matter injury (WMI). Brain inflammation alters development through neuroinflammatory processes mediated by activation of homeostatic microglia toward a pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic phenotype. Investigating immune regulators of microglial activation is crucial to find effective strategies to prevent and treat WMI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ex vivo microglial cultures and a mouse model of WMI induced by perinatal inflammation (interleukin-1-beta [IL-1β] and postnatal days 1–5) were used to uncover and elucidate the role of microRNA-146b-5p in microglial activation and WMI.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A specific reduction in vivo in microglia of <i>Dicer</i>, a protein required for microRNAs maturation, reduces pro-inflammatory activation of microglia and prevents hypomyelination in our model of WMI. Microglial miRNome analysis in the WMI model identified miRNA-146b-5p as a candidate modulator of microglial activation. Ex vivo microglial cell culture treated with the pro-inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) led to overexpression of immunomodulatory miRNA-146b-5p but its drastic reduction in the microglial extracellular vesicles (EVs). To increase miRNA-146b-5p expression, we used a 3DNA nanocarrier to deliver synthetic miRNA-146b-5p specifically to microglia. Enhancing microglial miRNA-146b-5p overexpression significantly decreased LPS-induced activation, downregulated IRAK1, and restored miRNA-146b-5p levels in EVs. In our WMI model, 3DNA miRNA-146b-5p treatment significantly prevented microglial activation, hypomyelination, and cognitive defect induced by perinatal inflammation.</p>
<h2>Interpretations</h2>
<p>These findings support that miRNA-146b-5p is a major regulator of microglia phenotype and could be targeted to reduce the incidence and the severity of perinatal brain injuries and their long-term consequences. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Time course of EEG power during creative problem-solving with insight or remote thinking</a></h4>

              
                Problem-solving often requires creativity and is critical in everyday life. However, the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying creative problem-solving remain poorly understood. Two mechanisms have been highlighted: forming new connections from and between the problem elements and insight solving (with a sudden realization of a solution). We examined EEG activity during an adapted version of a classical insight problem task, the Remote Associates Test, that requires finding a word connecting three words. It allowed us to explore remoteness in semantic connections (by varying the remoteness of the solution word across trials) and insight solving (identified as a "Eureka" moment reported by the participants). Semantic remoteness was associated with a power increase in alpha band (8-12Hz) in a left parieto-temporal cluster, beta band (13-30Hz) in a right fronto-temporal cluster in the early phase of the task, and theta band (3-7Hz) in frontal cluster before the participants responded. Insight solving was associated with power increase preceding the response in alpha and gamma band (31-60Hz) in left temporal clusters and theta band in a frontal cluster. Source reconstructions show the brain regions associated with these clusters. Overall, our findings shed new light on the dynamic of some of the mechanisms involved in creative problem-solving.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine release in nucleus accumbens is under tonic inhibition by adenosine A1 receptors regulated by astrocytic ENT1 and dysregulated by ethanol</a></h4>

              
                Striatal adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) activation can inhibit dopamine release. A1Rs on other striatal neurons are activated by an adenosine tone that is limited by equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) that is enriched on astrocytes and is ethanol-sensitive. We explored whether dopamine release in nucleus accumbens core is under tonic inhibition by A1Rs, and is regulated by astrocytic ENT1 and ethanol. In ex vivo striatal slices from male and female mice, A1R agonists inhibited dopamine release evoked electrically or optogenetically and detected using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, most strongly for lower stimulation frequencies and pulse numbers, thereby enhancing the activity-dependent contrast of dopamine release. Conversely, A1R antagonists reduced activity-dependent contrast but enhanced evoked dopamine release levels, even for single optogenetic pulses indicating an underlying tonic inhibition. The ENT1 inhibitor NBTI reduced dopamine release and promoted A1R-mediated inhibition, and conversely, virally-mediated astrocytic overexpression of ENT1 enhanced dopamine release and relieved A1R-mediated inhibition. By imaging the genetically encoded fluorescent adenosine sensor GRAB-Ado, we identified a striatal extracellular adenosine tone that was elevated by the ENT1 inhibitor and sensitive to gliotoxin fluorocitrate. Finally, we identified that ethanol (50 mM) promoted A1R-mediated inhibition of dopamine release, through diminishing adenosine uptake via ENT1. Together, these data reveal that dopamine output dynamics are gated by a striatal adenosine tone, limiting amplitude but promoting contrast, regulated by ENT1, and promoted by ethanol. These data add to the diverse mechanisms through which ethanol modulates striatal dopamine, and to emerging datasets supporting astrocytic transporters as important regulators of striatal function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Similarity in evoked responses does not imply similarity in macroscopic network states across tasks</a></h4>

              
                There is an ongoing debate as to whether cognitive processes arise from a group of functionally specialized brain modules (modularism) or as the result of a distributed nonlinear process (dynamical systems theory). The former predicts that tasks that recruit similar brain areas should have an equivalent degree of similarity in their connectivity. The latter allows for differential connectivity, even when the areas recruited are largely the same. Here we evaluated both views by comparing activation and connectivity patterns from a large sample of healthy subjects (N=242) that performed two executive control tasks, color-word Stroop task and Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT), known to recruit similar brain areas. Using a measure of instantaneous connectivity based on edge time series as outcome variables, we estimated task-related network profiles as connectivity changes between incongruent and congruent information conditions. The degree of similarity of such profiles at the group level between both tasks was substantially smaller than their overlapping activation responses. A similar finding was observed at the subject level and when employing a different method for defining task-related connectivity. Our results are consistent with the perspective of the brain as a dynamical system, suggesting that task representations should be understood at both node and edge (connectivity) levels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Timing is everything: event-related transcranial direct current stimulation improves motor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                There is a fundamental discord between the foundational theories underpinning motor learning and how we currently apply transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS). The former is dependent on tight coupling of events; the latter is conducted with very low temporal resolution, typically being applied for 10-20 minutes, prior to or during performance of a particular motor or cognitive task. Here we show that when short duration stimulation epochs (< 3 seconds) are yoked to movement, only the reaching movements repeatedly performed simultaneously with stimulation are selectively enhanced. We propose that mechanisms of Hebbian-like learning are potentiated within neural circuits that are active during movement and concurrently stimulated, thus driving improved adaptation.

                Various physical stimulation methods are developed to minimize the invasiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS). Among them, only magnetic field can penetrate into the biological tissues without scattering or absorption, which makes it ideal for untethered DBS. Recently developed magnetogenetics have shown the potential of developing treatments for neurological disorders. However, magnetogenetic approaches have potential side effects from overexpression of exogenous ion channels and gene delivery with viral vectors. Here, we demonstrated that the iron oxide magnetic nanodiscs (~270 nm) can be used as transducers to trigger calcium responses in the wild-type cultured neurons during the application of slow varying weak magnetic fields (50 mT at 10 Hz). Moreover, we identified that the intrinsic mechanosensitive ion channel transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC), which were widely expressed in the brain, plays the main roles in this magnetomechanical stimulation. Finally, when we applied magnetic fields to the awake mice with magnetic nanodiscs injecting into subthalamic nucleus, the magnetomechanical stimulation triggered neuronal activities in the targeted region and the downstream region. Overall, this research demonstrated a magnetomechanical approach that can be used for wireless neuronal stimulation in vitro and untethered DBS in awake mice in vivo without implants or genetic manipulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">White Matter Hyperintensity Distribution Differences in Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease Cohorts</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in the aging population in general, as well as in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. They are known to exacerbate the cognitive deficits and worsen the clinical outcomes in the patients. However, it is not well-understood whether there are disease-specific differences in prevalence and distribution of WMHs in different neurodegenerative disorders. Methods: Data included 976 participants with cross-sectional T1-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRIs from the Comprehensive Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia (COMPASS-ND) cohort of the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA) with eleven distinct diagnostic groups: cognitively intact elderly (CIE), subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), vascular MCI (V-MCI), Alzheimers dementia (AD), vascular AD (V-AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), cognitively intact elderly with Parkinsons disease (PD-CIE), cognitively impaired Parkinsons disease (PD-CI), and mixed dementias. WMHs were segmented using a previously validated automated technique. WMH volumes in each lobe and hemisphere were compared against matched CIE individuals, as well as each other, and between men and women. Results: All cognitively impaired diagnostic groups had significantly greater overall WMH volumes than the CIE group. Vascular groups (i.e. V-MCI, V-AD, and mixed dementia) had significantly greater WMH volumes than all other groups, except for FTD, which also had significantly greater WMH volumes than all non-vascular groups. Women tended to have lower WMH burden than men in most groups and regions, controlling for age. The left frontal lobe tended to have a lower WMH burden than the right in all groups. In contrast, the right occipital lobe tended to have greater WMH loads than the left. Conclusions: There were distinct differences in WMH prevalence and distribution across diagnostic groups, sexes, and in terms of asymmetry. WMH burden was significantly greater in all neurodegenerative dementia groups, likely encompassing areas exclusively impacted by neurodegeneration as well as areas related to cerebrovascular disease pathology.

                Dynamic protein S-palmitoylation is critical for neuronal function, development, and synaptic plasticity. Activity-dependent changes in palmitoylation have been observed for several neuronal substrates, however a full characterization of the activity-regulated palmitoylome is lacking. Here, we use an unbiased approach to identify differentially palmitoylated proteins in the mouse hippocampus following context-dependent fear conditioning. Of the 121 differentially palmitoylated proteins identified 63 were synaptic proteins, while others were associated with metabolic functions, cytoskeletal organization, and signal transduction. The vast majority of synaptic proteins exhibited increased palmitoylation following fear conditioning, whereas proteins that exhibited decreased palmitoylation were predominantly associated with metabolic processes. We show a link between dynamic palmitoylation and synapse plasticity by demonstrating that the palmitoylation of one of our identified proteins, PRG-1/LPPR4, is essential for activity-induced insertion of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. Together, this study identifies networks of synaptic proteins whose dynamic palmitoylation may play a central role in learning and memory.

                Kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus generate GnRH pulses, and act as critical initiators of functional gonadotrophin secretion, and reproductive competency. However, kisspeptin in other brain regions, most notably the posterodorsal subnucleus of the medial amygdala (MePD), plays a significant modulatory role over the hypothalamic kisspeptin population; our recent studies using optogenetics have shown that low frequency light stimulation of MePD kisspeptin results in increased LH pulse frequency. Nonetheless, the neurochemical pathways that underpin this regulatory function remain unknown. To study this, we have utilised an optofluid technology, precisely combining optogenetic stimulation with pharmacological receptor antagonism, to investigate the neurotransmission involved in this circuitry. We have shown that functional neurotransmission of both GABAA and glutamate is a requirement for effective modulation of the GnRH pulse generator by amygdala kisspeptin neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ionotropic glutamate receptors in the retina - a bioinformatical meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Glutamate is an essential neurotransmitter for signal processing in the vertical pathway of the mammalian retina, where it is involved in the distribution of visual information into several parallel channels. The excitatory effects of glutamate are mediated by AMPA-, kainate-, and NMDA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). The expression patterns of these receptors in the vertebrate retina have been investigated so far with mainly immunocytochemical, in-situ hybridization, and electrophysiological/pharmacological techniques. Here, we have used scRNA sequencing data from chicken, mouse, macaque, and human retina to describe and compare the profile of iGluR expression in major retinal cell types across species. Our results suggest that major retinal cell types each express a unique set of iGluRs with substantial differences between non-mammalian and mammalian retinae. Expression of iGluRs has been investigated in more detail for amacrine and bipolar cell types of the human retina, each showing minor variations of a common pattern. The differential expression of iGluRs is likely to convey unique signal processing properties to individual elements of the retinal circuitry.

                Recent political polarization has highlighted the extent to which individuals with opposing views experience ongoing events in markedly different ways. In this study, we explored the neural mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon. We conducted functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) scanning right- and left-wing participants watching political videos just before the 2019 elections in Israel. Behavioral results demonstrated significant differences between left- and right-wing participants in their interpretation of the videos' content. Neuroimaging results revealed partisanship-dependent differences in both high-order regions and early-motor and somato-sensory regions, although no such differences were found with regard to neutral content. Moreover, we found that most of the political content was more potent in synchronizing participants with right-wing views, and that this synchronization was observed already in early visual and auditory cortices. These results suggest that political polarization is not limited to higher-order processes as previously thought, but rather emerges already in motor and sensory regions.

                Neuropathic pain is a leading cause of high impact pain, is often disabling and is poorly managed by current therapeutics. Here we focused on a unique group of neuropathic pain patients undergoing thoracic vertebrectomy where the DRG is removed as part of the surgery allowing for molecular characterization and identification of mechanistic drivers of neuropathic pain independently of preclinical models. Our goal was to quantify whole transcriptome RNA abundances using RNA-seq in pain-associated human DRGs from these patients, allowing comprehensive identification of molecular changes in these samples by contrasting them with non-pain associated DRGs. We sequenced 70 human DRGs, including over 50 having mRNA libraries with neuronal mRNA. Our expression analysis revealed profound sex differences in differentially expressed genes including increase of IL1B, TNF, CXCL14, and OSM in male and including CCL1, CCL21, PENK and TLR3 in female DRGs associated with neuropathic pain. Co-expression modules revealed enrichment in members of JUN-FOS signaling in males, and centromere protein coding genes in females. Neuro-immune signaling pathways revealed distinct cytokine signaling pathways associated with neuropathic pain in males (OSM, LIF, SOCS1) and females (CCL1, CCL19, CCL21). We validated cellular expression profiles of a subset of these findings using RNAscope in situ hybridization. Our findings give direct support for sex differences in underlying mechanisms of neuropathic pain in patient populations.

                Advances in applied machine learning techniques to neuroimaging have encouraged scientists to implement models to early diagnose brain disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease. Predicting various stages of Alzheimer's disease is challenging; however, existing deep learning complex techniques could perform such a prediction. Therefore, using novel architectures with less complexity but efficient pattern extraction capabilities such as transformers has been of interest to neuroscientists. This study introduced an optimized vision transformer architecture to predict the aging effect in healthy adults (>75 years), mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's' brains within the same age group using resting-state functional and anatomical magnetic resonance imaging data. Our optimized architecture known as OViTAD, which is currently the sole vision transformer-based end-to-end pipeline, outperformed the existing transformer models and most state-of-the-art solutions with F1-scores of 97%{+/-}0.0 and 0.9955%{+/-}0.0039 achieved from the testing sets for the two modalities in the triple-class prediction experiments where the number of trainable parameters decreased by 30% compared to a vanilla transformer. To ensure the robustness and reproducibility of our optimized vision transformer, we repeated the modeling process three times for all the experiments and reported the averaged evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we implemented a visualization technique to illustrate the effect of global attention on brain images. Also, we exhaustively implemented models to explore the impact of combining healthy brains with two other groups in the two modalities. This study could open a new avenue of adopting and optimizing vision transformers for neuroimaging applications, especially for Alzheimer's Disease prediction.

                Acquisition of high quality manual annotations is vital for the development of segmentation algorithms. However, to create them we require a substantial amount of expert time and knowledge. Large numbers of labels are required to train convolutional neural networks due to the vast number of parameters that must be learned in the optimisation process. Here, we develop the STAMP algorithm to allow the simultaneous training and pruning of a UNet architecture for medical image segmentation with targeted channelwise dropout to make the network robust to the pruning. We demonstrate the technique across segmentation tasks and imaging modalities. It is then shown that, through online pruning, we are able to train networks to have much higher performance than the equivalent standard UNet models while reducing their size by more than 85% in terms of parameters. This has the potential to allow networks to be directly trained on datasets where very low numbers of labels are available.

                During development, retinal progenitors navigate a complex landscape of fate decisions that culminates with an array of unique cell types that are required for proper vision. Here, we aim to identify factors that are required for fate decisions in photoreceptors. These factors help create a diversity of photoreceptor subtypes that sustain vision in day and night, enable the detection of colors, of prey and predators, and other aspects of vision. To identify these factors, we generate a high-quality and deep transcriptomic profile of each photoreceptor subtype in zebrafish. From these profiles, we focus on transcription factors---key players in cell-fate decisions. We apply CRISPR-F0 screening as a versatile platform to explore the involvement of transcription factors in photoreceptor subtype-specification. We find that three differentially-expressed transcription factors (Foxq2, Tbx2a and Tbx2b) play unique roles in controlling the identity of photoreceptor subtypes within the retina. Our results provide novel insights into the function of these factors and how photoreceptors acquire their final identities. Furthermore, we have made our transcriptomic dataset openly available and easy to explore. This dataset and the screening method will be valuable to the scientific community and will enable the exploration of genes involved in many essential aspects of photoreceptor biology.

                Word reading includes a series of cognitive processes that convert low-level visual characteristics to neural representations. However, the consistency of the neural mechanisms for processing these cognitive components across different writing systems in bilinguals remains inconclusive. Here, we explored this question by employing representational similarity analysis with a semantic access task involving Chinese words, English words and Chinese pinyin. Divergent spatial distribution patterns were detected for each type of brain representation across ideographic and alphabetic languages, resulting in 100% classification accuracy. Meanwhile, convergent cognitive components processing was found in the core language-related regions in left hemisphere, including the inferior frontal gyrus, temporal pole, superior and middle temporal gyrus, precentral gyrus and supplementary motor areas. Broadly, our findings indicated that the neural basis for word recognition of different writing systems in bilinguals was divergent in spatial locations of neural representations but convergent in functions, which supported and enriched the assimilation-accommodation hypothesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nociceptive stimuli activate the hypothalamus-habenula circuit to inhibit the mesolimbic reward system</a></h4>

              
                Nociceptive signals interact with various regions of the brain, including those involved in physical sensation, reward, cognition, and emotion. Emerging evidence points to a role of nociception in the modulation of the mesolimbic reward system. The mechanism by which nociception affects dopamine (DA) signaling and reward is unclear. The lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the lateral habenula (LHb) receive somatosensory inputs and are structurally connected with the mesolimbic DA system. Here we show that the LH-LHb pathway is necessary for nociceptive modulation of this system. Our extracellular single-unit recordings and head-mounted microendoscopic calcium imaging revealed that nociceptive stimulation by tail-pinch excited LHb and LH neurons, which was inhibited by chemical lesion of the LH. Tail-pinch decreased extracellular DA release in the nucleus accumbens ventrolateral shell, which was blocked by disruption of the LH. Furthermore, tail-pinch attenuated cocaine-induced locomotor activity, 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior, which was inhibited by chemogenetic silencing of the LH-LHb pathway. Our findings suggest that nociceptive stimulation recruits the LH-LHb pathway to inhibit mesolimbic DA system and drug reinstatement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Increasing the Spatial Extent of Attention Strengthens Surround Suppression</a></h4>

              
                Here we investigate how the extent of spatial attention affects center-surround interaction in visual motion processing. To do so, we measured motion direction discrimination thresholds in humans using drifting gratings and two attention conditions. Under the narrow attention condition, attention was limited to the central part of the visual stimulus, whereas under the wide attention condition, it was directed to both the center and surround of the stimulus. We found stronger surround suppression under the wide attention condition. The magnitude of the attention effect increased with the size of the surround when the stimulus had low contrast, but did not change when it had high contrast. Results also showed that attention had a weaker effect when the center and surround gratings drifted in opposite directions. Next, to establish a link between the behavioral results and the neuronal response characteristics, we performed computer simulations using the divisive normalization model. Our simulations showed that the model can successfully predict the observed behavioral results using parameters derived from the medial temporal (MT) area of the cortex. These findings reveal the critical role of spatial attention on surround suppression and establish a link between neuronal activity and behavior. Further, these results also suggest that the reduced surround suppression found in certain clinical disorders (e.g., schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder) may be caused by abnormal attention mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Simultaneous pathway engagement of translation in astrocytes, circadian rhythm in GABAergic neurons and cytoskeleton in glutamatergic neurons precede electroencephalographic changes in neurodegenerative prion disease</a></h4>

              
                Selective vulnerability is an enigmatic feature of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), whereby a widely expressed protein causes lesions in specific brain regions and cell types. This selectivity may arise from cells possessing varying capacities to regain proteostasis when stressed by cytotoxic protein conformers. Using the RiboTag method in mice, translational responses of five neural subtypes to acquired prion disease (PrD) were measured. Pre-onset and disease onset timepoints were chosen based on longitudinal electroencephalography (EEG) that revealed a gradual increase in theta power between 10- and 18-weeks after prion injection, resembling a clinical feature of human PrD. At disease onset, marked by significantly increased theta power and histopathological lesions, mice had pronounced translatome changes in all five cell types despite having a normal outward appearance. Remarkably, at a pre-onset stage, prior to EEG and neuropathological changes, we found that 1) translatomes of astrocytes indicated a sharply reduced synthesis of ribosomal and mitochondrial components, 2) excitatory neurons showed increased expression of cytoskeletal genes, and 3) inhibitory neurons revealed reduced expression of circadian rhythm network genes. Further assessment for the role of circadian rhythms using a jet lag paradigm modestly exacerbated disease. These data demonstrate that early translatome responses to neurodegeneration emerge prior to other signs of disease and are unique to different cell types. Therapeutic strategies may need to target multiple pathways, each in specific populations of cells, early in the disease process.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term consequences of alcohol use in early adolescent mice: focus on neuroadaptations in GR, CRF and BDNF</a></h4>

              
                Our aim was to assess the cognitive and emotional state, as well as related-changes in Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR), Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF) and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) expression of adolescent C57BL/6J male mice after a 5-week two-bottle choice protocol (postnatal day (pd) 21 to pd52). Additionally, we wanted to analyze whether the behavioral and neurobiological effects observed in the late adolescence (pd62) lasted until the adulthood (pd84). Behavioral testing revealed that alcohol during early adolescence increased anxiety-like and compulsive-related behaviors and it was maintained in the adulthood. Concerning cognition, working memory was only altered in late adolescent mice, whereas object location test performance was impaired in both ages. In contrast, novel object recognition remained unaltered. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that alcohol during adolescence diminished BDNF+ cells in the cingulate cortex, the hippocampal CA1 layer and the central amygdala. Regarding hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) functioning, alcohol abuse increased the GR and CRF expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and the central amygdala. Besides, GR density was also higher in the prelimbic cortex and the basolateral amygdala regardless of animals age. Our findings suggest that adolescent alcohol exposure led to long-term behavioral alterations along with changes in BDNF, GR and CRF expression in limbic brain areas involved in stress response, emotional regulation, and cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Layer-specific developmentally precise axon targeting of transient suppressed-by-contrast retinal ganglion cells (tSbC RGCs)</a></h4>

              
                The mouse retina encodes diverse visual features in the spike trains of more than 40 retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types. Each RGC type innervates a specific subset of the more than 50 retinorecipient brain areas. Our catalog of RGC types and feature representations is nearing completion. Yet, we know little about where specific RGC types send their information. Furthermore, the developmental strategies by which RGC axons choose their targets and pattern their terminal arbors remain obscure. Here we identify a genetic intersection (Cck-Cre and Brn3cCKOAP) that selectively labels transient Suppressed-by-Contrast (tSbC) RGCs, a member of an evolutionarily conserved functionally mysterious RGC subclass. We find that tSbC RGCs selectively innervate the dorsolateral and ventrolateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus (dLGN and vLGN), the superior colliculus (SC), and the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT). They binocularly innervate dLGN and vLGN but project only contralaterally to SC and NOT. In each target, tSbC RGC axons occupy a specific sublayer, suggesting that they restrict their input to specific circuits. The tSbC RGC axons span the length of the optic tract by birth and remain poised there until they simultaneously innervate their four targets around postnatal day five. The tSbC RGC axons make no errors in choosing their targets and establish mature stratification patterns from the outset. This precision is maintained in the absence of Brn3c. Our results provide the first map of SbC inputs to the brain, revealing a narrow target set, unexpected laminar organization, target-specific binocularity, and developmental precision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural tracking as an objective measure of auditory perception and speech intelligibility</a></h4>

              
                The neural tracking framework enables the analysis of neural responses (EEG) to continuous natural speech, e.g., a story or a podcast. This allows for objective investigation of a range of auditory and linguistic processes in the brain during natural speech perception. This approach is more ecologically valid than traditional auditory evoked responses and has great potential for both research and clinical applications. In this article, we review the neural tracking framework and highlight three prominent examples of neural tracking analyses. This includes the neural tracking of the fundamental frequency of the voice (f0), the speech envelope and linguistic features. Each of these analyses provides a unique point of view into the hierarchical stages of speech processing in the human brain. f0-tracking assesses the encoding of fine temporal information in the early stages of the auditory pathway, i.e. from the auditory periphery up to early processing in the primary auditory cortex. This fundamental processing in (mostly) subcortical stages forms the foundation of speech perception in the cortex. Envelope tracking reflects bottom-up and top-down speech-related processes in the auditory cortex, and is likely necessary but not sufficient for speech intelligibility. To study neural processes more directly related to speech intelligibility, neural tracking of linguistic features can be used. This analysis focuses on the encoding of linguistic features (e.g. word or phoneme surprisal) in the brain. Together these analyses form a multi-faceted and time-effective objective assessment of the auditory and linguistic processing of an individual.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A brainstem integrator for self-localization and positional homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                To accurately track self-location, animals need to integrate their movements through space. In amniotes, representations of self-location have been found in regions such as the hippocampus. It is unknown whether more ancient brain regions contain such representations and by which pathways they may drive locomotion. Fish displaced by water currents must prevent uncontrolled drift to potentially dangerous areas. We found that larval zebrafish track such movements and can later swim back to their earlier location. Whole-brain functional imaging revealed the circuit enabling this process of positional homeostasis. Position-encoding brainstem neurons integrate optic flow, then bias future swimming to correct for past displacements by modulating inferior olive and cerebellar activity. Manipulation of position-encoding or olivary neurons abolished positional homeostasis or evoked behavior as if animals had experienced positional shifts. These results reveal a multiregional hindbrain circuit in vertebrates for optic flow integration, memory of self-location, and its neural pathway to behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural crest-related NXPH1/α-NRXN signaling opposes neuroblastoma malignancy by inhibiting metastasis</a></h4>

              
                Neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer that can present as low- or high-risk tumors (LR-NBs and HR-NBs), the latter group showing poor prognosis due to metastasis and strong resistance to current therapy. NBs are known to originate from alterations to cells in the sympatho-adrenal lineage derived from the neural crest, but whether LR-NBs and HR-NBs differ in the way they exploit the transcriptional program underlying their developmental origin remains unclear. Here, we compared the transcriptional landscapes of primary samples of LR-NBs, HR-NBs and human fetal adrenal gland, and thereby identified the transcriptional signature associated to NB formation that further distinguishes LR-NBs from HR-NBs. The majority of the genes comprising this signature belong to the core sympatho-adrenal developmental program, are associated with favorable patient prognosis and with diminished disease progression. The top candidate gene of this list, Neurexophilin-1 (NXPH1), encodes a ligand of the transmembrane receptors -Neurexins (-NRXNs). Our functional in vivo and in vitro assays reveal that NXPH1/-NRXN signaling has a dual impact on NB behavior: whereas NXPH1 and -NRXN1 promote NB tumor growth by stimulating cell proliferation, they conversely inhibit the ability of NB cells to form metastases. Our findings uncover a module of the neural crest-derived sympatho-adrenal developmental program that opposes neuroblastoma malignancy by impeding metastasis, and pinpoint NXPH1/-NRXN signaling as a promising target to treat HR-NBs.

	<p>Although sleep problems are common in children with ADHD, their extent, preceding risk factors, and the association between neurocognitive performance and neurobiological processes in sleep and ADHD, are still largely unknown. We examined sleep variables in school-aged children with ADHD, addressing their intra-individual variability (IIV) and considering potential precursor symptoms as well as the chronotype. Additionally, in a subgroup of our sample, we investigated associations with neurobehavioral functioning (n = 44). A total of 57 children (6&amp;amp;ndash;12 years) with (n = 24) and without ADHD (n = 33) were recruited in one center of the large ESCAlife study to wear actigraphs for two weeks. Actigraphy-derived dependent variables, including IIV, were analyzed using linear mixed models in order to find differences between the groups. A stepwise regression model was used to investigate neuropsychological function. Overall, children with ADHD showed longer sleep onset latency (SOL), higher IIV in SOL, more movements during sleep, lower sleep efficiency, and a slightly larger sleep deficit on school days compared with free days. No group differences were observed for chronotype or sleep onset time. Sleep problems in infancy predicted later SOL and the total number of movements during sleep in children with and without ADHD. No additional effect of sleep problems, beyond ADHD symptom severity, on neuropsychological functioning was found. This study highlights the importance of screening children with ADHD for current and early childhood sleep disturbances in order to prevent long-term sleep problems and offer individualized treatments. Future studies with larger sample sizes should examine possible biological markers to improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: The King-Devick (KD) rapid number naming test is sensitive for concussion diagnosis, with increased test time from baseline as the outcome measure. Eye tracking during KD performance in concussed individuals shows an association between inter-saccadic interval (ISI) (the time between saccades) prolongation and prolonged testing time. This pilot study retrospectively assesses the relation between ISI prolongation during KD testing and cognitive performance in persistently-symptomatic individuals post-concussion. (2) Results: Fourteen participants (median age 34 years; 6 women) with prior neuropsychological assessment and KD testing with eye tracking were included. KD test times (72.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 20.7 s) and median ISI (379.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 199.1 msec) were prolonged compared to published normative values. Greater ISI prolongation was associated with lower scores for processing speed (WAIS-IV Coding, r = 0.72, p = 0.0017), attention/working memory (Trails Making A, r = &amp;amp;minus;0.65, p = 0.006) (Digit Span Forward, r = 0.57, p = &amp;amp;minus;0.017) (Digit Span Backward, r= &amp;amp;minus;0.55, p = 0.021) (Digit Span Total, r = &amp;amp;minus;0.74, p = 0.001), and executive function (Stroop Color Word Interference, r = &amp;amp;minus;0.8, p = 0.0003). (3) Conclusions: This pilot study provides preliminary evidence suggesting that cognitive dysfunction may be associated with prolonged ISI and KD test times in concussion.</p>

	<p>Aim: To develop a microsimulation model to assess the potential health economic impact of software-assisted MRI in detecting disease activity or progression in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients. Methods: We develop a simulated decision analytical model based on a hypothetical cohort of RRMS patients to compare a baseline decision-making strategy in which only clinical evolution (relapses and disability progression) factors are used for therapy decisions in MS follow-up, with decision-making strategies involving MRI. In this context, we include comparisons with a visual radiologic assessment of lesion evolution, software-assisted lesion detection, and software-assisted brain volume loss estimation. The model simulates clinical (EDSS transitions, number of relapses) and subclinical (new lesions and brain volume loss) disease progression and activity, modulated by the efficacy profiles of different disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The simulated decision-making process includes the possibility to escalate from a low efficacy DMT to a high efficacy DMT or to switch between high efficacy DMTs when disease activity is detected. We also consider potential error factors that may occur during decision making, such as incomplete detection of new lesions, or inexact computation of brain volume loss. Finally, differences between strategies in terms of the time spent on treatment while having undetected disease progression/activity, the impact on the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s quality of life, and costs associated with health status from a US perspective, are reported. Results: The average time with undetected disease progression while on low efficacy treatment is shortened significantly when using MRI, from around 3 years based on clinical criteria alone, to 2 when adding visual examination of MRI, and down to only 1 year with assistive software. Hence, faster escalation to a high efficacy DMT can be performed when MRI software is added to the radiological reading, which has positive effects in terms of health outcomes. The incremental utility shows average gains of 0.23 to 0.37 QALYs over 10 and 15 years, respectively, when using software-assisted MRI compared to clinical parameters only. Due to long-term health benefits, the average annual costs associated with health status are lower by $1500&amp;amp;ndash;$2200 per patient when employing MRI and assistive software. Conclusions: The health economic burden of MS is high. Using assistive MRI software to detect and quantify lesions and/or brain atrophy has a significant impact on the detection of disease activity, treatment decisions, health outcomes, utilities, and costs in patients with MS.</p>

	<p>Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), despite being a hepatotropic virus, is the causative agent of many systemic disorders, such as vasculitis, autoimmune diseases, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a broad spectrum of neurological and psychiatric manifestations. Although symptoms have been misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, only recently, evidence of direct (inflammatory) or indirect (immune-mediated) HCV-dependent cerebral effects has been established. HCV infection can promote acute inflammatory response, pro-coagulative status and ischemic disorders, and neurodegeneration. These effects rely on cerebral HCV replication, possibly mediated by blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier alterations. Further study is needed to better understand the HCV-related mechanisms of brain damage.</p>

	<p>Recent evidence underlines the importance of seeing learning disorders in terms of their partial association (comorbidity). The present concept paper presents a model of reading that aims to account for performance on a naturalistic reading task within a comorbidity perspective. The model capitalizes on the distinction between three independent levels of analysis: competence, performance, and acquisition: Competence denotes the ability to master orthographic&amp;amp;ndash;phonological binding skills; performance refers to the ability to read following specific task requirements, such as scanning the text from left to right. Both competence and performance are acquired through practice. Practice is also essential for the consolidation of item-specific memory traces (or instances), a process which favors automatic processing. It is proposed that this perspective might help in understanding surface dyslexia, a reading profile that has provoked a prolonged debate among advocates of traditional models of reading. The proposed reading model proposes that surface dyslexia is due to a defective ability to consolidate specific traces or instances. In this vein, it is a &amp;amp;ldquo;real&amp;amp;rdquo; deficit, in the sense that it is not due to an artifact (such as limited exposure to print); however, as it is a cross-domain defect extending to other learning behaviors, such as spelling and math, it does not represent a difficulty specific to reading. Recent evidence providing initial support for this hypothesis is provided. Overall, it is proposed that viewing reading in a comorbidity perspective might help better understand surface dyslexia and might encourage research on the association between surface dyslexia and other learning disorders.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Mirror therapy is one of the promising interventions for the upper limb rehabilitation of stroke patients. Postural asymmetry during mirror therapy was pointed out as a possibility to influence stroke patients&amp;amp;rsquo; rehabilitation negatively. However, it is still difficult to find studies on the postural changes in mirror therapy concept interventions. This study compared three methods of postural differences as follows: traditional mirror therapy (mirror); displaying the real-time movement of the unaffected side on the screen above the affected side (screen); and playing a pre-recorded movement of the unaffected side on a tablet placed on a movable box where the affected hand is put inside (movable). (2) Methods: to observe a kinematic difference, we recruited 16 healthy volunteers to go through three different interventions (mirror, screen, movable). The motion capture system made observations on the postures before and during interventions, then compared and analyzed. (3) Results: while using the mirror, the sitting posture was observed to become asymmetric, and the following unique posture was observed where the target hand went further from the trunk while performing tasks. In addition, the shoulder of the target side came forward, and the difference between both elbow flexion angles was also observed. On the other hand, the screen or movable device did not cause a significant change in the sitting posture, and no additional postural differences were observed either. (4) Conclusions: mirror therapy showed a tendency to cause lateral flexion opposite the target hand, thus, creating additional postural change. However, developed methods controlled spine tilt, and enabled the keeping of the midline while sitting during the intervention.</p>

	<p>The aim of the COmedication Study assessing Mono- and cOmbination therapy with levodopa-carbidopa inteStinal gel (COSMOS) was to assess the use of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) as monotherapy in patients with advanced Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (APD) in routine clinical practice. COSMOS was an international observational study with one cross-sectional visit and retrospective data collection. In Romania, 95 adult patients with APD on LCIG treatment for at least 12 months were enrolled and stratified according to their LCIG therapy after 12 months: monotherapy (without any add-on PD medication), monotherapy with night PD medication and LCIG + add-on medication. Compared to the moment of LCIG initiation, the percentage of patients on monotherapy increased at three months after LCIG initiation and remained constant up to 12 months, when 30.5% of the patients were on LCIG monotherapy and 11.6% were on monotherapy with night medication. &amp;amp;ldquo;Off&amp;amp;rdquo; time and &amp;amp;ldquo;On&amp;amp;rdquo; time with dyskinesia decreased from LCIG initiation to patient visit in all groups. LCIG monotherapy with or without night medication may provide a simplified treatment option for selected APD patients, with long-term efficacy similar to that of LCIG plus add-on medication.</p>

	<p>While significant progress has been achieved in studying resting-state functional networks in a healthy human brain and in a wide range of clinical conditions, many questions related to their relationship to the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s cellular constituents remain. Here, we use quantitative Gradient-Recalled Echo (qGRE) MRI for mapping the human brain cellular composition and BOLD (blood&amp;amp;ndash;oxygen level-dependent) MRI to explore how the brain cellular constituents relate to resting-state functional networks. Results show that the BOLD signal-defined synchrony of connections between cellular circuits in network-defined individual functional units is mainly associated with the regional neuronal density, while the between-functional units&amp;amp;rsquo; connectivity strength is also influenced by the glia and synaptic components of brain tissue cellular constituents. These mechanisms lead to a rather broad distribution of resting-state functional network properties. Visual networks with the highest neuronal density (but lowest density of glial cells and synapses) exhibit the strongest coherence of the BOLD signal as well as the strongest intra-network connectivity. The Default Mode Network (DMN) is positioned near the opposite part of the spectrum with relatively low coherence of the BOLD signal but with a remarkably balanced cellular contents, enabling DMN to have a prominent role in the overall organization of the brain and hierarchy of functional networks.</p>

                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted medical education on multiple levels, and medical students have been forced to adjust to distance learning, altered clinical opportunities, and standardized testing inconsistencies. We sought to identify the effects of these dramatic deviations on medical students’ career plans. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of medical students between July 13, 2020, and September 9, 2020 in order to assess the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on students’ career decisions. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Results: Of the 585 eligible medical students, we had a final sample of 76 responses (n=76) (13% response rate). Students felt neutral regarding having more time to explore research projects (Mean ± SD; 3.06 ± 1.18) and hobbies (3.43 ± 1.28). Most survey respondents somewhat disagreed that they considered quitting medical school during the pandemic (1.55 ± 1.10). Students somewhat agreed that they view the field of medicine more positively since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (3.60 ± 1.09). Respondents somewhat agreed that they would be unable to explore other specialties and find their best fit (3.55 ± 1.32). We found that the minority (4/66, 6%) of students had considered changing their specialty. Students felt neutral in terms of their Step 1 (3.25 ± 1.05) or Step 2 (2.81 ± 1.02) score deterring them from future career opportunities. Conclusions:  Most medical students have experienced barriers in their career pathway as a direct cause of COVID-19 restrictions on medical education, including the ability to explore different specialties to discover their best fit or find a chance to network with mentors. However, despite these obstacles, most students remain committed to medicine.

                Background: This study investigated how the inclusion of Boesenbergia pandurata extract (BPE) in goldfish feed affects fish growth, immunity, and resistance to infection by Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens.   Methods: Four fish feeds, were prepared by adding BPE at the concentrations of 0 (control), 2, 4, and 6 g kg-1, respectively, and 120 goldfish (Cyprinus carpio; initial weight 5 g) were separated into 12 boxes and fed with specific pellets and examined thrice. The experiment lasted 12 weeks, beginning with the different feeds, fish growth was measured at Weeks 4 and 8 after the feeding period. Moreover, a challenge test with pathogen bacteria to assay disease resistance was administered at Week 8 after the feeding period, and the survival rate and relative percentage of survival were quantified at Week 12.   Results: At Week 8, the goldfish that were fed BPE-containing feeds were significantly heavier than the fish that received the control feed (pellet without BPE), and the highest weight gain, reaching 72.44 g, was obtained with Pellet 3; accordingly, the specific growth rate after BPE treatment (5.7%) was higher than that after control treatment. Conversely, the feed conversion ratio in the control group, 2.03, was higher than the ratios in the BPE groups, which were decreased to 0.55–0.90. Lastly, BPE treatment consistently enhanced the immunity parameters of goldfish (relative to control treatment) at weeks 4 and 8, and following BPE treatment, the rate of resistance against bacterial infection, 68.3%–77.0%, was higher than that after control treatment.   Conclusions: BPE addition in goldfish feed clearly produces a positive effect by enhancing fish growth, immunity, and resistance to infection by pathogenic bacteria, and 4 g kg-1 is the optimal BPE concentration in feed prepared for goldfish.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A systematic review of ePCR systems on reducing the response time of prehospital medical care [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Poor communication at the time of patient handover is recognized as a root cause of a considerable proportion of preventable deaths. Despite several advantages, the Patient Care Report (PCR) implementation may include insufficient details for demonstrating the functional status of the patients during the actual response which can further prolong the response time. Healthcare entities have been emphasizing the need to implement e-PCR systems. This systematic review aimed to examine the impact of e-PCR systems on reducing response time of prehospital care. Methods Literature search was carried out using the relevant search terms and keywords with inclusion and exclusion criteria. N=6 researchers that focused on the impact of e-PCR systems on reducing response time of prehospital medical care were included within this review. Results The findings indicated that ePCR implementation led to prominent improvements in the quality of the care services provided by the healthcare organisation. Additionally, ePCR reduces the response rate by data standardization.   Conclusion The implementation of e-PCR systems ensures the availability of records and automates reporting on given quality metrics. Moreover, the implementation of e-PCR systems also improved response time and increased the out of hospital rates of survival. However, fear of increasing the ambulance run time, compromise on the availability of ambulance, and challenges in integration with the existing information systems implemented within the hospitals, were some of the most common challenging situations associated with implementing e-PCR systems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Inequality and migration in Kenya: Investigating the subnational associations using census data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Since the early 2000s, there has been an extensive debate on whether migration and inequality are interlinked, with varying conclusions arising from methodological as well as theoretical dispositions. The aim of this study is to contribute to this debate by exploring the nexus between several dimensions of inequalities and migration in Kenya. Methods: This study used the subnational(county) data on inequalities and migration in Kenya obtained from several reports. Four explanatory variables including access to water, electricity, composite index of County Human Development Index (County HDI) and County Gini were used. Our dependent variable was migration intensity, measured by the Revised Weighted Net Migration Rate. Correlation and spatial regression analysis were performed to model the relationship between migration and inequality.   Results: Findings revealed that migration had a non-linear relationship with income inequality, such that a change in one unit of migration intensity results in a 567 negative change in County Gini. The County Gini had the highest explanatory power in our model, although counties with high HDI tend to have higher migration intensities. Migration intensities in the country were not randomly distributed as we found evidence of spatial clustering with two key emergent hotspots, a high-high in the lake region and a low-low in the coastal region. Regions with low migration intensities correspond with higher poverty, implying that structural factors may explain the migration intensities in the country.   Conclusions: The study highlights that the subnational income inequality reduces as migration intensifies. We conclude that migration has an equalizing effect on inequality as observed in some studies. Regions with high poverty tend to have lower migration intensity, implying that structural factors are important in influencing migration. Use of migration intensity and application of spatial analysis have improved our understanding of migration and inequality, and should be applied in future research.

                Background: The government's support for public health care in Thailand is very important and necessary. Therefore, there must be a supervisory process for budgeting to create the most equality and fairness to all people. At present, the instruments used to monitor health fund performance cannot be comprehensively assessed for effectiveness such as planning, organizing, leading and controlling. To address this gap, we created the Assessment Criteria for Operation control of Local security health Fund (ACOLF) which evaluates old assessment criteria, review literature and experience as separate constructs. Methods: The ACOLF is a 42-item survey with 12 old assessment criteria, 26 review literature and four experience items rated on scale from 0-9. In an observational analytical study, the survey was administered to 406 general population participants working in a provincial office for local administration. Validity and reliability were evaluated by testing construct validity. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to confirm the item of old assessment criteria, review literature and experience. Reliability of the questionnaires was tested using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Results: The ACOLF demonstrated convergent construct validity (KMO = 0.88 and Bartlett's Test; p value <0.001) and explaining 88.95% of the variance of this construct. There were seven factors involved and all  factors consisted of a total of 41 variables observed by the weight of the composition of the observed variables ranged from 0.780 to 0.972 at the significance level of 0.05. The reliability of the assessment criteria was tested using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, the total results was at 0.889. Conclusions: The ACOLF is a short, cover activity, valid, and reliable instrument for assessment operation control of local security health fund. Based on research findings the tool can be used to comprehensively assess the performance of local security health fund.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The job applicant reactions towards Patterned Behavior Description Interview (PBDI) and Mixed Situational and Patterned Behavior Description Interview (Mixed SPBDI) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: When applying for a job, applicant reactions are defined as the amount to which the applicants of the job regard the process of selection as impartial or unbiased. The questions for the structured interview can be future-oriented (Situational Interview) or past-oriented (Patterned Behaviour Description Interview). Past research on using SI or PBDI in selection process and their effects on applicant reactions showed that applicant reactions are highest towards PBDI. Methods: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of combining PBDI and SI (mixed SPBDI) as interview questions, and to differentiate its effect with PBDI. This study involved 46 lecturers from the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). This study used (a) mixed SPBDI, and PBDI as interview questions, and (b) Applicant Reaction Questionnaires which was based on the Organizational Justice theory. The interview was conducted in a transcript form. After the participants answered the interview transcripts, they answered the applicant reactions questionnaires. The data was then analysed and presented. Results: The results showed a significant difference between mixed SPBDI and PBDI, with the PBDI’s mean (M = 13.61; SD = 1.57) is significantly higher than the mixed SPBDI’s mean (M = 10.89; SD 1.91), t (46) = 7.22; p < 0.01. Specifically, applicants reacted more positively to PBDI interview content compared to the mixed SPBDI. Conclusion: This research had few limitations such as the interview being conducted in the form of transcript and not verbally as in real workplace context. It is also limited to studying the reactions in terms of only perceived fairness and no other elements such as organizational effectiveness or the decision making of the applicants. Nevertheless, this study has contributed to the theoretical and research development in applicant reactions, and to the practical application for organizations in Malaysia.

<p>Electroconvulsive therapy relieves pain by decreasing brain local function and global network patterns, while increasing structure in pain-related circuit.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Approximately two-thirds of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients have pain, which exacerbates the severity of depression. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an efficacious treatment that can alleviate depressive symptoms; however, treatment for pain and the underlying neural substrate is elusive. We enrolled 34 patients with MDD and 33 matched healthy controls to complete clinical assessments and neuroimaging scans. MDD patients underwent second assessments and scans after ECT. We defined a pain-related network with a published meta-analysis and calculated topological patterns to reveal topologic alterations induced by ECT. Using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs), we probed local function aberrations of pain-related circuits in MDD patients. Subsequently, we applied gray matter volume (GMV) to reveal structural alterations of ECT relieving pain. The relationships between functional and structural aberrations and pain were determined. ECT significantly alleviated pain. The neural mechanism based on pain-related circuits indicated that ECT weakened the circuit function (ALFF: left amygdala and right supplementary motor area), while augmenting the structure (GMV: bilateral amygdala/insula/hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex). The topologic patterns became less efficient after ECT. Correlation analysis between the change in pain and GMV had negative results in bilateral amygdala/insula/hippocampus. Similarity, there was a positive correlation between a change in ALFF in the left amygdala and improved clinical symptoms. ECT improved pain by decreasing brain local function and global network patterns, while increasing structure in pain-related circuits. Functional and structural alterations were associated with improvement in pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Attention network modulation via tRNS correlates with attention gain</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) can enhance vision in the healthy and diseased brain. Yet, the impact of multi-day tRNS on large-scale cortical networks is still unknown. We investigated the impact of tRNS coupled with behavioral training on resting-state functional connectivity and attention. We trained human subjects for 4 consecutive days on two attention tasks, while receiving tRNS over the intraparietal sulci, the middle temporal areas, or Sham stimulation. We measured resting-state functional connectivity of nodes of the dorsal and ventral attention network (DVAN) before and after training. We found a strong behavioral improvement and increased connectivity within the DVAN after parietal stimulation only. Crucially, behavioral improvement positively correlated with connectivity measures. We conclude changes in connectivity are a marker for the enduring effect of tRNS upon behavior. Our results suggest that tRNS has strong potential to augment cognitive capacity in healthy individuals and promote recovery in the neurological population.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of human dorsal root ganglion neurons</a></h4>

              
                Somatosensory neurons with cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) project to the skin, muscles, bones, and viscera to detect touch and temperature as well as to mediate proprioception and many types of interoception. In addition, the somatosensory system conveys the clinically relevant noxious sensations of pain and itch. Here, we used single nuclear transcriptomics to characterize transcriptomic classes of human DRG neurons that detect these diverse types of stimuli. Notably, multiple types of human DRG neurons have transcriptomic features that resemble their mouse counterparts although expression of genes considered important for sensory function often differed between species. More unexpectedly, we identified several transcriptomic classes with no clear equivalent in the other species. This dataset should serve as a valuable resource for the community, for example as means of focusing translational efforts on molecules with conserved expression across species.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Metabolomic profiling reveals a differential role for hippocampal glutathione reductase in infantile memory formation</a></h4>

              
                The metabolic mechanisms underlying the formation of early-life episodic memories remain poorly characterized. Here, we assessed the metabolomic profile of the rat hippocampus at different developmental ages both at baseline and following episodic learning. We report that the hippocampal metabolome significantly changes over developmental ages and that learning regulates differential arrays of metabolites according to age. The infant hippocampus had the largest number of significant changes following learning, with downregulation of 54 metabolites. Of those, a large proportion was associated with the glutathione-mediated cellular defenses against oxidative stress. Further biochemical, molecular, and behavioral assessments revealed that infantile learning evokes a rapid and persistent increase in the activity of neuronal glutathione reductase, the enzyme that regenerates reduced glutathione from its oxidized form. Inhibition of glutathione reductase selectively impaired long-term memory formation in infant but not in juvenile and adult rats, confirming its age-specific role. Thus, metabolomic profiling revealed that the hippocampal glutathione-mediated antioxidant pathway is differentially required for the formation of infantile memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibitory co-transmission from midbrain dopamine neurons relies on presynaptic GABA uptake</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA)-releasing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNcDA) inhibit target cells in the striatum through postsynaptic activation of {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for GABAergic signaling remain unclear, as SNcDA neurons lack enzymes typically required to produce GABA or package it into synaptic vesicles. Here we show that aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 (Aldh1a1), an enzyme proposed to function as a GABA synthetic enzyme in SNcDA neurons does not produce GABA for synaptic transmission. Instead, we demonstrate that SNcDA axons obtain GABA exclusively through presynaptic uptake using the membrane GABA transporter Gat1 (encoded by Slc6a1). GABA is then packaged for vesicular release using the vesicular monoamine transporter Vmat2. Our data therefore show that presynaptic transmitter recycling can substitute for de novo GABA synthesis and that Vmat2 contributes to vesicular GABA transport, expanding the range of molecular mechanisms available to neurons to support inhibitory synaptic communication.

                The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-37 (IL-37) is a member of the IL-1 family but not expressed in mice. We used a human IL 37 (hIL-37tg) expressing mouse, which has been subjected to various models of local and systemic inflammation as well as immunological challenges. Those studies demonstrate an immune-modulatory role of IL-37 which can be characterized as an important suppressor of innate immunity. We investigated the functions of IL-37 in the CNS and explored the effects of IL-37 on neuronal architecture and function, microglia phenotype, cytokine production and behavior after inflammatory challenge by intraperitoneal LPS-injection. Reduced spine density, activated microglia phenotype and impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) were observed in wild-type mice after LPS injection, whereas hIL-37tg mice showed no impairment. In addition, we crossed the hIL-37tg mouse with an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (APP/PS1) to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-37 under chronic neuroinflammatory conditions. Our results show that IL-37 is able to limit inflammation in the brain after acute inflammatory events and prevent the loss of cognitive abilities in a mouse model of AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Input to layer 1 of somatosensory cortex: Local input outweighs long-range and can modulate the activity of layer 1 interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Neocortical layer (L) 1 is a locus for interactions between long-range inputs, L1 interneurons and apical tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Even though we have a wealth of information about L1, the level and effect of local input to this layer have not been quantified. Here we characterized the input to L1 of mouse somatosensory cortex with fast blue, monosynaptic rabies and optogenetics. Our work shows that most of the input to L1 is local, and that both local and long-range inputs to this layer arise predominantly from L2/3 and L5 neurons. Subtypes of L5 and L6b neurons project to the overlying L1 with different probabilities. VIP and SST interneurons in L2/3 and L5 also innervate L1. A subset of local L5, the intratelencephalic, pyramidal neurons, drive L1 interneurons but have no effect on L5 apical tuft dendrites. Monosynaptic rabies-based retrograde labelling reveals presynaptic boutons covering the entire somato-dendritic axis of pyramidal neurons, including in L1. When fast blue application was combined with rabies virus, we found that only a fraction of local and long-range neurons was both presynaptic to L5 neurons and projected to L1. These results demonstrate that L1 receives a large proportion of its input from local neurons, and that some of these inputs specifically target interneurons. We conclude that L1 is not just a site for interaction between long-range feedback and apical tuft dendrites of pyramidal cells, it is also a site for complex modulation of pyramidal neurons and interneurons by local inputs.

                Brain swelling occurs in cerebral malaria (CM) and may either reverse or result in fatal outcome. It is currently unknown how brain swelling in CM reverses, as investigations have been hampered by inadequate animal models. In this study, we show that reversible brain swelling in experimental murine cerebral malaria (ECM) can be induced reliably after single vaccination with radiation-attenuated sporozoites as revealed by in vivo high-field (9.4T) magnetic resonance imaging. Our results provide evidence that parenchymal fluid increase and consecutive brain swelling results from transcellular blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD), as revealed by electron microscopy. This mechanism enables reversal of brain swelling but does not prevent persistent focal brain damage, evidenced by microhemorrhages, in areas of most severe BBBD. In a cohort of 27 pediatric and adult CM patients (n=4 fatal, n=23 non-fatal) two out of four fatal CM patients (50%) and 8 out of 23 non-fatal CM patients (35%) showed microhemorrhages on MRI at clinical field strength of 1.5T, emphasizing the translational potential of the experimental model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Supplementary motor area contributions to rhythm perception</a></h4>

              
                Timing is everything, but our understanding of the neural mechanisms of timing remains limited, particularly for timing of sequences. Temporal sequences can be represented relative to a recurrent beat (beat-based or relative timing), or as a series of absolute durations (non-beat-based or absolute timing). Neuroimaging work suggests involvement of the basal ganglia, supplementary motor area (SMA), the premotor cortices, and the cerebellum in both beat- and non-beat-based timing. Here we examined how beat-based timing and non-beat-based sequence timing were affected by modulating excitability of the supplementary motor area, the right cerebellum, and the bilateral dorsal premotor cortices, using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Participants were subjected to a sham stimulation session, followed an active stimulation session where anodal or cathodal 2mA tDCS was applied to the SMA, right premotor cortex, left premotor cortex, or the cerebellum. During both sessions, participants discriminated changes in rhythms which differentially engage beat-based or non-beat-based timing. Rhythm discrimination performance was improved by increasing SMA excitability, and impaired by decreasing SMA excitability. This polarity-dependent effect on rhythm discrimination was absent for cerebellar or premotor cortex stimulation, suggesting a crucial role of the SMA and/or its functionally connected networks in rhythmic timing mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Couching the brain's multiple-demand and language-specific systems within a macroscale gradient of cortical connectivity</a></h4>

              
                The cerebrum comprises a set of specialised systems that tile across the cortical sheet, forming a tapestry-like configuration. For example, the multiple-demand and language-specific systems occupy largely separate neural estates and exhibit disparate functional profiles. Although delimiting the boundary between systems informs where cortical sheet functionally fractionates, it remains unclear why different systems' topographical placements are spatially configured in typical manners and how a macroscale architecture arises from this topography. Novel approaches have tackled this challenge by condensing the topography into a principal gradient, which represents the workflow of information processing from sensory-motoric to abstract-cognitive. To understand how the multiple-demand and language-specific systems are accommodated in the gradient framework, here we used fMRI to probe cognitive operations in semantic vs. visuospatial domains and projected functional activities onto the principal gradient. We found that the two systems showed distinct trajectories of distribution along gradient tiers, suggesting different roles in the transition from sensation to cognition. Critically, when semantic processing became difficult, the brain recruited a specialised 'semantic-control' system that was a functional and anatomical 'hybrid' juxtaposed between the multi-demand and language systems. We discuss how the brain's modular division can be better understood through the lens of a dimensionality-reduced gradient-like architecture.

	<p>The present study demonstrates that synaptamide (N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine), an endogenous metabolite of docosahexaenoic acid, when administered subcutaneously (4 mg/kg/day, 14 days), exhibits analgesic activity and promotes cognitive recovery in the rat sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury (CCI) model. We analyzed the dynamics of GFAP-positive astroglia and S100&amp;amp;beta;-positive astroglia activity, the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF), and two subunits of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR1 and NMDAR2A) in the hippocampi of the experimental animals. Hippocampal neurogenesis was evaluated by immunohistochemical detection of DCX. Analysis of N-acylethanolamines in plasma and in the brain was performed using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technique. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that synaptamide (1) reduces cold allodynia, (2) improves working memory and locomotor activity, (3) stabilizes neurogenesis and astroglial activity, (4) enhances the expression of NGF and NMDAR1, (5) increases the concentration of Ca2+ in astrocytes, and (6) increases the production of N-acylethanolamines. The results of the present study demonstrate that synaptamide affects the activity of hippocampal astroglia, resulting in faster recovery after CCI.</p>

	<p>Robotic-assisted therapy (RAT) is a task-specific approach for treating gait disorders in individuals with neurological impairments. However, the effectiveness of RAT is not clear for different severities of involvement, pathologies, and ages. This study aimed to assess the functional and clinical status outcomes after RAT in individuals with cerebral palsy (CP). Twenty-eight individuals with bilateral spastic CP were enrolled (female = 10; male = 18; age = 15.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.0 years). The RAT program consisted of 30 sessions: five sessions weekly for six weeks. Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and clinical physical examinations were evaluated before and after RAT. Our results suggested that the RAT program with the described protocol can improve the general gross motor functions of individuals with CP in Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels I and II, and primarily improves performance on less complex GMFM items for those in GMFCS levels III and IV. The lower baseline functional level was related to a greater functional improvement. Older individuals were noticed to improve more in GMFM dimension D. Regarding impairments evaluated by clinical examinations, no change was found after RAT intervention. It is worth mentioning that the strength of knee muscles was not affected either.</p>

	<p>Although many musical intervention studies exist in the wider framework of neuroscience and psychology, the preliminary importance of feasibility studies is rarely discussed. Adding to this fact the limited research existing on the therapeutic and restorative potential of music exposure during early developmental periods, pushed us to concentrate on investigating newborns&amp;amp;rsquo; perception of music and its impact on the brain. Here, we explore the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) approach when measuring and comparing the neurophysiological perception of music versus language on the brainstem of newborns using auditory brainstem response (ABR). Twenty-five healthy full-term infants were recruited, eight of which were measured within their first 10 days postpartum. The evaluation of the study&amp;amp;rsquo;s feasibility appealed to five main objectives that essentially answer the question: Can our protocol work? Each objective proposes questions based on Orsmond and Cohn&amp;amp;rsquo;s guiding framework, designed to assess, and assist feasibility in understanding barriers toward a study&amp;amp;rsquo;s success. Our results justify that newborns are well capable of undergoing the study and given meticulous considerations and improvements on the intervention resources. The procedure&amp;amp;rsquo;s communication and technical obstacles are resoluble. Moreover, assimilation of external factors to adapt, such as the culture variation and the ABR protocol implementation are necessary. The study was well received in the selected region (Middle East), and the recording procedure showed potential outcomes for a comprehensive RCT.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Sex differences in early language delay and in developmental language disorder</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Developmental language disorder (DLD) is a neurodevelopmental condition, occurring in about 3% to 7% of preschoolers, that can impair communication and negatively impact educational and social attainments, in spite of adequate neurological, cognitive, emotional, social development, and educational opportunities for language learning. Significant risk factors for DLD are male sex, familial history of early language delay, low parental education, and various perinatal factors. A strong sex effect with a higher prevalence of language delay and DLD in males than in females has been consistently reported. Neurobiological and environmental risk factors, interacting with each other, are probably responsible for the phenotypic expression of DLD. The aim of this brief review is to further the knowledge of the role of sex in early language delay and DLD by analyzing the evidence from four significant sources: epidemiological studies, studies on twins, family aggregation studies, and studies on sex chromosome trisomies. Data pertaining only to sex differences (biological and physiological characteristics of females and males) will be analyzed. Studies on family aggregations and twins confirm the role of genetic factors and of sex in determining language abilities and disabilities, but genes alone do not determine outcomes. Sex chromosome trisomies represent a unique example of the relationship between a genetic alteration and a language disorder. Clarification of how sex acts in determining DLD could provide new information on early risk factors and, thus, contribute to improve diagnosis and clinical management.</p>

                Clinical presentation of liver hydatidosis can vary from asymptomatic forms to lethal complications. We report herein a rare case of a 27-year-old male from a rural Tunisian region who presented with large-abundance haematemesis, haemodynamic instability, and marked biological data of hypersplenism. Endoscopy showed bleeding esophageal varicose veins that were ligated. Abdominal ultrasound concluded the presence of three type CE2 hydatic liver cysts causing portal cavernoma with signs of portal hypertension. Despite resuscitation, the patient died of massive rebleeding leading to haemorrhagic shock. Hepatic hydatid cyst should be considered as an indirect cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in endemic countries. Early abdominal ultrasound in varicose haemorrhage is essential in orienting the diagnosis.

     alt="Timing of treatment with an endogenous opioid alters immune response and spinal cord pathology in female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis"/>
<p>Adult female C57BL/6 mice inoculated with myelin oligodendrocytic glycoprotein (MOG<sub>35–55</sub>) emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant followed by pertussis toxin resulted in a behavioral profile consistent with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a rodent model of multiple sclerosis. EAE mice displayed a wide range of behaviors which could be effectively reduced by treatment with naltrexone at low dosages (0.1 mg/kg; LDN) or opioid growth factor (10 mg/kg; OGF) initiated at the time of disease induction (prophylactic) or at the onset of EAE. The efficacy of treatment as measured by cytokine levels, behavior, sensitivity, and OGF serum values were dependent on the timing of therapy.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that primarily affects women during the second or third decade of life. The mechanism is hypothesized to involve unregulated peripheral inflammation resulting in blood–brain barrier damage, and eventual axonal damage and demyelination. Based on this understanding, the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), often is utilized to study lymphocyte activation. Therapeutic paradigms of exogenous opioid growth factor (OGF) or low-dose naltrexone (LDN) treatment can modulate EAE, but little is reported regarding OGF or LDN effects on peripheral inflammation, microglia activation, and/or macrophage proliferation. Moreover, little is known about differential responses to LDN or OGF relative to the duration and timing of treatment. Utilizing a female mouse model of EAE, two treatment regimens were established to investigate differences between prophylactic treatment and traditional therapy initiated at the time of disease presentation. Prophylactic OGF or LDN treatment delayed the onset of behavior, suppressed neutrophil replication, and curtailed lymphocyte proliferation which ultimately improved behavioral outcome. Traditional therapy with OGF or LDN reversed behavioral deficits, restored OGF and IL-17 serum levels, and inhibited microglial activation within 8 days. Reduced serum OGF levels in untreated EAE mice correlated with increased microglia activation within lumbar spinal cords. Both treatment regimens of OGF or LDN reduced activated microglia, whereas only prophylactic treatment prevented CNS macrophage aggregation. These data demonstrate that the timing of LDN or OGF treatment initiation alters outcomes and can prevent or reverse behavioral deficits, cytokine activation, and spinal cord pathology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Refining the content and design of an alcohol reduction app, Drink Less, to improve its usability and effectiveness: a mixed methods approach [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Digital interventions have the potential to reduce alcohol consumption, although evidence on the effectiveness of apps is lacking. Drink Less is a popular, evidence-informed app with good usability, putting it in a strong position to be improved upon prior to conducting a confirmatory evaluation. This paper describes the process of refining Drink Less to improve its usability and likely effectiveness. Methods: The refinement consisted of three phases and involved qualitative and quantitative (mixed) methods: i) identifying changes to app content, based on findings from an initial evaluation of Drink Less, an updated review of digital alcohol interventions and a content analysis of user feedback; ii) designing new app modules with public input and a consultation with app developers and researchers; and iii) improving the app’s usability through user testing. Results: As a result of the updated review of digital alcohol interventions and user feedback analysis in Phase 1, three new modules: ‘Behaviour Substitution’, ‘Information about Antecedents’ and ‘Insights’, were added to the app. One existing module – ‘Identity Change’ – was removed based on the initial evaluation of Drink Less. Phases 2 and 3 resulted in changes to existing features, such as improving the navigational structure and onboarding process, and clarifying how to edit drinks and goals. Conclusions: A mixed methods approach was used to refine the content and design of Drink Less, providing insights into how to improve its usability and likely effectiveness. Drink Less is now ready for a confirmatory evaluation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A case series of ocular involvement in bullous pemphigoid: clinical features, management, and outcomes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Ocular involvement in cases of bullous pemphigoid is rare and when present, the signs are usually subtle and in the form of fine tarsal scarring and dry eye disease. The current report aims to describe the clinical features and management protocols in a series of cases with aggressive ocular manifestations at presentation. All cases of bullous pemphigoid seen between 2017 and 2020 were included in this retrospective case series. Data regarding the clinical features, treatment administered, and outcomes was collected. Five cases (n=10 eyes) of bullous pemphigoid disease with ocular involvement were included. All eyes had significant cicatricial conjunctival changes in the form of symblephara, inferior forniceal shortening, and tarsal conjunctival scarring. Conjunctival granulomas were present in 3/10 eyes. Corneal involvement in the form of punctate keratitis was present in all eyes while 4/10 eyes had an epithelial defect as well. The management of these cases involved topical therapy with corticosteroids and lubricants (n=10 eyes) while pulse doses of intravenous methyl prednisolone were administered in 5/5 cases. Pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide was supplemented in 2/5 cases. Adequate control of the disease was noted in 3/5 cases while one case had a recalcitrant form of the disease and developed a dermalised ocular surface in both eyes. The last patient was lost to follow up during the course of therapy. Bullous pemphigoid can present with an aggressive form of cicatrizing conjunctivitis similar to other variants of autoimmune blistering disorders and must be considered as a differential in cases presenting with ocular cicatricial disease. Long-term intensive immunosuppression is required for the management of these cases to preserve the visual function and the integrity of the globe.

                Background: This paper presents a soft sensor design technique for the estimation of pitch and yaw angular positions of a Twin Rotor MIMO System (TRMS). The objective of the proposed work was to calculate the value of pitch and yaw angular positions using a stochastic estimation technique.  Methods: Measurements from optical sensors were used to measure fan blade rotations per minute (RPM).  The Kalman filter, which is a stochastic estimator, was used in the proposed system and its results were compared with those of the Luenberger observer and neural network. The Twin Rotor MIMO System is a nonlinear system with significant cross-coupling between its rotors.  Results: The estimators were designed for the decoupled system and were applied in real life to the coupled TRMS. The convergence of estimation to the actual values was checked on a practical setup. The Kalman filter estimators were evaluated for various inputs and disturbances, and the results were corroborated in real-time.  Conclusion:  From the proposed work it was seen that the Kalman filter had at least Integral Absolute Error (IAE), Integral Square Error (ISE), Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE) as compared to the neural network and the Luenberger based observer.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of Nigella sativa on general health and immune system in young healthy volunteers; a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Nigella sativa (N. sativa) is traditionally used as an immune enhancer in different communities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of N. sativa on immunity related parameters in young healthy subjects. This study was a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial. Fifty-two healthy subjects (48 male and 4 female) 18-25 years old were enrolled in the study. They were randomly divided into four groups; the first received charcoal capsules and served as controls and the other three received 0.5, 1 g, and 2 g of powdered N. sativa capsules, respectively. Two blood samples were obtained from all participant, before initiation of the trial and at the end of the four weeks intervention. One sample was used for routine health screening by evaluating liver and renal functions as well as complete blood count and differential. The second sample was used to measure certain cytokines including; IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF. A third and fourth samples were obtained from the last cohort of subjects before and after treatment; the third was used for measuring immunoglobulins and CD profile and the fourth for evaluating certain gene expressions (INF-γ, NF-κ-B, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-13, IL-8, and IL-6). Only 1 g dose of N. sativa produced a significant elevation in total lymphocyte count, CD3+ and CD4+ counts. One gram N. sativa increased the absolute lymphocyte count from 1850±0.24 to 2170±0.26 (p=0.008), CD3+ from 1184.4±75.60 to 1424±114.51 (p=0.009), and CD4+ from 665.6±141.66 to 841±143.36 (p=0.002).  This elevation in T cells was lost by increasing the dose of N. sativa to 2g. The rest of the parameters were not changed significantly in all doses. The results show a promising immunopotentiation effect of N. sativa by elevating helper T cells and the optimum dose for young age group seems to be 1 g.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cross-sectional assessment of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with knee osteoarthritis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are prevalent in India. However, there is dearth of literature among Indians studying the relationship between the two. This study was carried out to assess various cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in patients with knee OA with an objective to investigate their association, screening and management.  Methods: In total, 225 patients were included in this cross-sectional study. Participants were diagnosed with knee OA on the basis of the Kellgren and Lawrence (K-L) classification of their radiograph. Participants were also assessed for CV risk factors (age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, smoking) with the help of the Joint British Society QRisk3 calculator (JBS3) a comprehensive risk score calculator as well as a screening tool, which produces three more variables, namely 10-years risk of developing CVD, physiological heart age and life expectancy. Chi Square, Fishers exact test and one-way ANOVA tests were used to compare the categorical and quantitative variables, respectively. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between CV risk factors and knee OA. Multiple regression analysis was done to adjust the multiple con-founders and determine their significance. Results: Patients with severe knee OA had a statistically significantly higher prevalence of CV risk factors (p<0.05). Grade 4 knee OA patients were found to have a mean JBS3 risk of 38%, heart age of 82 years and life expectancy of 77 years as compared to grade 2 patients who had a mean JBS3 risk of 11%, heart age of 63 years and life expectancy of 82 years.  Conclusions: Our study concluded that there is a strong positive correlation between knee OA and CVD, with CV risk score being directly proportional to the severity of OA.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Intrinsic functional connectivity in the default mode network predicts mnemonic discrimination: A connectome‐based modeling approach</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability to distinguish existing memories from similar perceptual experiences is a core feature of episodic memory. This ability is often examined using the mnemonic similarity task in which people discriminate memories of studied objects from perceptually similar lures. Studies of the neural basis of such mnemonic discrimination have mostly focused on hippocampal function and connectivity. However, default mode network (DMN) connectivity may also support such discrimination, given that the DMN includes the hippocampus, and its connectivity supports many aspects of episodic memory. Here, we used connectome-based predictive modeling to identify associations between intrinsic DMN connectivity and mnemonic discrimination. We leveraged a wide range of abilities across healthy younger and older adults to facilitate this predictive approach. Resting-state functional connectivity in the DMN predicted mnemonic discrimination outside the MRI scanner, especially among prefrontal and temporal regions and including several hippocampal regions. This predictive relationship was stronger for younger than older adults, primarily for temporal–prefrontal connectivity. The novel associations established here are consistent with mounting evidence that broader cortical networks including the hippocampus support mnemonic discrimination. They also suggest that age-related network disruptions undermine the extent that the DMN supports this ability. This study provides the first indication of how intrinsic functional properties of the DMN support mnemonic discrimination.</p>

     alt="Deletion of transcription factor AP-2β from the developing murine trabecular meshwork region leads to progressive glaucomatous changes"/>
<p>Conditional deletion of transcription factor activating protein 2-beta (AP-2β) from the developing trabecular meshwork region (AP-2β trabecular meshwork region knockouts/AP-2β TMR KOs) results in a reduction in expression of trabecular meshwork markers, such as αSMA (panels a,b), accompanied by an increased intraocular pressure (IOP) (panel c). Increased IOP is correlated with a reduction in the number of Brn3a-positive cells (panels d,e), in addition to reduced retinal function (panels f,g), making the AP-2β TMR KO a model of human primary angle-closure glaucoma that can be used to test IOP-lowering drugs and neuroprotective strategies.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness and can result from abnormalities in anterior segment structures required for aqueous humor outflow, including the trabecular meshwork (TM) and Schlemm's canal (SC). Transcription factors such as AP-2β play critical roles in anterior segment development. Here, we show that the <i>Mgp-</i>Cre knock-in (<i>Mgp</i>-Cre.KI) mouse can be used to target the embryonic periocular mesenchyme giving rise to the TM and SC. Fate mapping of male and female mice indicates that AP-2β loss causes a decrease in iridocorneal angle cells derived from <i>Mgp</i>-Cre.KI-expressing populations compared to controls. Moreover, histological analyses revealed peripheral iridocorneal adhesions in AP-2β mutants that were accompanied by a decrease in expression of TM and SC markers, as observed using immunohistochemistry. In addition, rebound tonometry showed significantly higher intraocular pressure (IOP) that was correlated with a progressive significant loss of retinal ganglion cells, reduced retinal thickness, and reduced retinal function, as measured using an electroretinogram, in AP-2β mutants compared with controls, reflecting pathology described in late-stage glaucoma patients. Importantly, elevated IOP in AP-2β mutants was significantly reduced by treatment with latanoprost, a prostaglandin analog that increases unconventional outflow. These findings demonstrate that AP-2β is critical for TM and SC development, and that these mutant mice can serve as a model for understanding and treating progressive human primary angle-closure glaucoma.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The alpha/B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant exhibits significantly higher affinity for ACE-2 and requires lower inoculation doses to cause disease in K18-hACE2 mice</a></h4>

              
                The alpha/B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 lineage emerged in autumn 2020 in the United Kingdom and transmitted rapidly until winter 2021 when it was responsible for most new COVID-19 cases in many European countries. The incidence domination was likely due to a fitness advantage that could be driven by the RBD residue change (N501Y), which also emerged independently in other Variants of Concern such as the beta/B.1.351 and gamma/P.1 strains. Here we present a functional characterization of the alpha/B.1.1.7 variant and show an eight-fold affinity increase towards human ACE-2. In accordance with this, transgenic hACE-2 mice showed a faster disease progression and severity after infection with a low dose of B.1.1.7, compared to an early 2020 SARS-CoV-2 isolate. When challenged with sera from convalescent individuals or anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies, the N501Y variant showed a minor, but significant elevated evasion potential of ACE-2/RBD antibody neutralization. The data suggest that the single asparagine to tyrosine substitution remarkable rise in affinity may be responsible for the higher transmission rate and severity of the B.1.1.7 variant.

                Identifying the molecular fingerprint of organismal cell types is key for understanding their function and evolution. Here, we use single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to survey the cell types of the sea urchin early pluteus larva, representing an important developmental transition from non-feeding to feeding larva. We identify 21 distinct cell clusters, representing cells of the digestive, skeletal, immune, and nervous systems. Further subclustering of these reveal a highly detailed portrait of cell diversity across the larva, including the identification of neuronal cell types. We then validate important gene regulatory networks driving sea urchin development and reveal new domains of activity within the larval body. Focusing on neurons that co-express <i>Pdx-1</i> and <i>Brn1/2/4</i>, we identify an unprecedented number of genes shared by this population of neurons in sea urchin and vertebrate endocrine pancreatic cells. Using differential expression results from Pdx-1 knockdown experiments, we show that Pdx1 is necessary for the acquisition of the neuronal identity of these cells.  We hypothesize that a network similar to the one orchestrated by Pdx1 in the sea urchin neurons was active in an ancestral cell type and then inherited by neuronal and pancreatic developmental lineages in sea urchins and vertebrates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">EGFR transactivates RON to drive oncogenic crosstalk</a></h4>

              
                Crosstalk between different receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is thought to drive oncogenic signaling and allow therapeutic escape. EGFR and RON are two such RTKs from different subfamilies, which engage in crosstalk through unknown mechanisms. We combined high-resolution imaging with biochemical and mutational studies to ask how EGFR and RON communicate. EGF stimulation promotes EGFR-dependent phosphorylation of RON, but ligand stimulation of RON does not trigger EGFR phosphorylation – arguing that crosstalk is unidirectional. Nanoscale imaging reveals association of EGFR and RON in common plasma membrane microdomains. Two-color single particle tracking captured formation of complexes between RON and EGF-bound EGFR. Our results further show that RON is a substrate for EGFR kinase, and that transactivation of RON requires formation of a signaling competent EGFR dimer. These results support a role for direct EGFR/RON interactions in propagating crosstalk, such that EGF-stimulated EGFR phosphorylates RON to activate RON-directed signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis cytochrome bcc in complex with Q203 and TB47, two anti-TB drug candidates</a></h4>

              
                Pathogenic mycobacteria pose a sustained threat to global human health. Recently, cytochrome <i>bcc</i> complexes have gained interest as targets for antibiotic drug development. However, there is currently no structural information for the cytochrome <i>bcc</i> complex from these pathogenic mycobacteria. Here, we report the structures of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> cytochrome <i>bcc</i> alone (2.68 Å resolution) and in complex with clinical drug candidates Q203 (2.67 Å resolution) and TB47 (2.93 Å resolution) determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. <i>M. tuberculosis</i> cytochrome <i>bcc</i> forms a dimeric assembly with endogenous menaquinone/menaquinol bound at the quinone/quinol-binding pockets. We observe Q203 and TB47 bound at the quinol-binding site and stabilized by hydrogen bonds with the side chains of <sub>QcrB</sub>Thr<sup>313</sup> and <sub>QcrB</sub>Glu<sup>314</sup>, residues that are conserved across pathogenic mycobacteria. These high-resolution images provide a basis for the design of new mycobacterial cytochrome <i>bcc</i> inhibitors that could be developed into broad-spectrum drugs to treat mycobacterial infections.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A naturalistic environment to study visual cognition in unrestrained monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Macaque monkeys are widely used to study vision. In the traditional approach, monkeys are brought into a lab to perform visual tasks while they are restrained to obtain stable eye tracking and neural recordings. Here, we describe a novel environment to study visual cognition in a more natural setting as well as other natural and social behaviors. We designed a naturalistic environment with an integrated touchscreen workstation that enables high-quality eye tracking in unrestrained monkeys. We used this environment to train monkeys on a challenging same-different task. We also show that this environment can reveal interesting novel social behaviors. As proof of concept, we show that two naïve monkeys were able to learn this complex task through a combination of socially observing trained monkeys and through solo trial-and-error. We propose that such naturalistic environments can be used to rigorously study visual cognition as well as other natural and social behaviors in freely moving monkeys.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multisensory-motor integration in olfactory navigation of silkmoth, Bombyx mori, using virtual reality system</a></h4>

              
                Most animals survive and thrive due to navigational behavior to reach their destinations. In order to navigate, it is important for animals to integrate information obtained from multisensory inputs and use that information to modulate their behavior. In this study, by using a virtual reality (VR) system for an insect, we investigated how the adult silkmoth integrates visual and wind direction information during female search behavior (olfactory behavior). According to the behavioral experiments using a VR system, the silkmoth had the highest navigational success rate when odor, vision, and wind information were correctly provided. However, the success rate of the search was reduced if the wind direction information provided was different from the direction actually detected. This indicates that it is important to acquire not only odor information but also wind direction information correctly. When the wind is received from the same direction as the odor, the silkmoth takes positive behavior; if the odor is detected but the wind direction is not in the same direction as the odor, the silkmoth behaves more carefully. This corresponds to a modulation of behavior according to the degree of complexity (turbulence) of the environment. We mathematically modeled the modulation of behavior using multisensory information and evaluated it using simulations. The mathematical model not only succeeded in reproducing the actual silkmoth search behavior but also improved the search success relative to the conventional odor-source search algorithm.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">ANTH domains within CALM, HIP1R, and Sla2 recognize ubiquitin internalization signals</a></h4>

              
                Attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) to cell surface proteins serves as a signal for internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). How ubiquitinated membrane proteins engage the internalization apparatus remains unclear. The internalization apparatus contains proteins such as Epsin and Eps15, which bind Ub, potentially acting as adaptors for Ub-based internalization signals. Here we show that additional components of the endocytic machinery including CALM, HIP1R, and Sla2 bind Ub via their N-terminal ANTH domain, a domain belonging to the superfamily of ENTH and VHS domains. Structural studies revealed that Ub binds with µM affinity to a unique C-terminal region within the ANTH domain not found in ENTH domains. Functional studies showed that combined loss of Ub-binding by ANTH-domain proteins and other Ub-binding domains within the yeast internalization apparatus caused defects in the Ub-dependent internalization of the GPCR Ste2 that was engineered to rely exclusively on Ub as an internalization signal. In contrast, these mutations had no effect on the internalization of Ste2 engineered to use an alternate Ub-independent internalization signal. These studies define new components of the internalization machinery that work collectively with Epsin and Eps15 to specify recognition of Ub as an internalization signal.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A functional topography within the cholinergic basal forebrain for encoding sensory cues and behavioral reinforcement outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) project throughout the cortex to regulate arousal, stimulus salience, plasticity, and learning. Although often treated as a monolithic structure, the basal forebrain features distinct connectivity along its rostrocaudal axis that could impart regional differences in BFCN processing. Here, we performed simultaneous bulk calcium imaging from rostral and caudal BFCNs over a one-month period of variable reinforcement learning in mice. BFCNs in both regions showed equivalently weak responses to unconditioned visual stimuli and anticipated rewards. Rostral BFCNs in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band were more responsive to reward omission, more accurately classified behavioral outcomes, and more closely tracked fluctuations in pupil-indexed global brain state. Caudal tail BFCNs in globus pallidus and substantia innominata were more responsive to unconditioned auditory stimuli, orofacial movements, aversive reinforcement, and showed robust associative plasticity for punishment-predicting cues. These results identify a functional topography that diversifies cholinergic modulatory signals broadcast to downstream brain regions.

                The positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) is a critical co-activator for transcription of most cellular and viral genes, including those of HIV. While P-TEFb is regulated by 7SK snRNA in proliferating cells, P-TEFb is absent due to diminished levels of CycT1 in quiescent and terminally differentiated cells, which has remained unexplored. In these cells, we found that CycT1 not bound to CDK9 is rapidly degraded. Moreover, productive CycT1:CDK9 interactions are increased by PKC mediated phosphorylation of CycT1 in human cells. Conversely, dephosphorylation of CycT1 by PP1 reverses this process. Thus, PKC inhibitors or removal of PKC by chronic activation results in P-TEFb disassembly and CycT1 degradation. This finding not only recapitulates P-TEFb depletion in resting CD4+ T cells but also in anergic T cells. Importantly, our studies reveal mechanisms of P-TEFb inactivation underlying T cell quiescence, anergy, and exhaustion as well as proviral latency and terminally differentiated cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Golgi membrane protein Erd1 Is essential for recycling a subset of Golgi glycosyltransferases</a></h4>

              
                Protein glycosylation in the Golgi is a sequential process that requires proper distribution of transmembrane glycosyltransferase enzymes in the appropriate Golgi compartments. Some of the cytosolic machinery required for the steady-state localization of some Golgi enzymes are known but existing models do not explain how many of these enzymes are localized. Here, we uncover the role of an integral membrane protein in yeast, Erd1, as a key facilitator of Golgi glycosyltransferase recycling by directly interacting with both the Golgi enzymes and the cytosolic receptor, Vps74. Loss of Erd1 function results in mislocalization of Golgi enzymes to the vacuole/lysosome. We present evidence that Erd1 forms an integral part of the recycling machinery and ensures productive recycling of several early Golgi enzymes. Our work provides new insights on how the localization of Golgi glycosyltransferases is spatially and temporally regulated, and is finely tuned to the cues of Golgi maturation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neutrophil-mediated oxidative stress and albumin structural damage predict COVID-19-associated mortality</a></h4>

              
                Human serum albumin (HSA) is the frontline antioxidant protein in blood with established anti-inflammatory and anticoagulation functions. Here we report that COVID-19-induced oxidative stress inflicts structural damages to HSA and is linked with mortality outcome in critically ill patients. We recruited 39 patients who were followed up for a median of 12.5 days (1-35 days), among them 23 had died. Analyzing blood samples from patients and healthy individuals (n=11), we provide evidence that neutrophils are major sources of oxidative stress in blood and that hydrogen peroxide is highly accumulated in plasmas of non-survivors. We then analyzed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of spin labelled fatty acids (SLFA) bound with HSA in whole blood of control, survivor, and non-survivor subjects (n=10-11). Non-survivor' HSA showed dramatically reduced protein packing order parameter, faster SLFA correlational rotational time, and smaller S/W ratio (strong-binding/weak-binding sites within HSA), all reflecting remarkably fluid protein microenvironments. Following loading/unloading of 16-DSA we show that transport function of HSA maybe impaired in severe patients. Stratified at the means, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis indicated that lower values of S/W ratio and accumulated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in plasma significantly predicted in-hospital mortality (S/W≤0.15, 81.8% (18/22) vs. S/W&gt;0.15, 18.2% (4/22), <i>p</i>=0.023; plasma [H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]&gt;8.6 mM, 65.2% (15/23) vs. 34.8% (8/23), <i>p</i>=0.043). When we combined these two parameters as the ratio ((S/W)/[H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]) to derive a risk score, the resultant risk score lower than the mean (&lt; 0.019) predicted mortality with high fidelity (95.5% (21/22) vs. 4.5% (1/22), logrank c<sup>2</sup> = 12.1, <i>p</i>=4.9x10<sup>-4</sup>). The derived parameters may provide a surrogate marker to assess new candidates for COVID-19 treatments targeting HSA replacements and/or oxidative stress.

                Fully automated proteomic pipelines have the potential to achieve deep coverage of cellular proteomes with high throughput and scalability. However, it is important to evaluate performance, including both reproducibility and ability to provide meaningful levels of biological insight. Here, we present an approach combining high field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometer (FAIMS) interface and data independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics approach developed as part of the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI), a large-scale effort to understand how inherited diseases may manifest in neuronal cells. Our FAIMS-DIA approach identified more than 8000 proteins per mass spectrometry (MS) acquisition as well as superior total identification, reproducibility, and accuracy compared to other existing DIA methods. Next, we applied this approach to perform a longitudinal proteomic profiling of the differentiation of iPSC-derived neurons from the KOLF2.1J parental line used in iNDI. This analysis demonstrated a steady increase in expression of mature cortical neuron markers over the course of neuron differentiation. We validated the performance of our proteomics pipeline by comparing it to single cell RNA-Seq datasets obtained in parallel, confirming expression of key markers and cell type annotations. An interactive webapp of this temporal data is available for aligned-UMAP visualization and data browsing (https://share.streamlit.io/anant-droid/singlecellumap). In summary, we report an extensively optimized and validated proteomic pipeline that will be suitable for large-scale studies such as iNDI.

                Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). A plethora of evidence has indicated a role for LRRK2 in endolysosomal trafficking in neurons, while LRRK2 function in glia, although highly expressed, remains largely unknown. Here we present evidence that LRRK2/dLRRK mediates a glial lysosomal pathway that contributes to the mechanism of PD. Independent of its kinase activity, glial LRRK2/dLRRK knockdown in the immortalized microglial cells or flies results in enlarged and swelling lysosomes fewer in number. These lysosomes are less mobile, wrongly acidified, and exhibit defective membrane permeability and reduced activity of the lysosome hydrolase cathespin B. In addition, microglial LRRK2 depletion causes increased Caspase 3 levels, leading to glial apoptosis, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and locomotor deficits in an age-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a functional role of LRRK2/dLRRK in regulating the glial lysosomal pathway; deficits in lysosomal biogenesis and function linking to glial apoptosis potentially underlie the mechanism of DA neurodegeneration, contributing to the progression of PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex-specific transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic signatures of PTSD-like fear acquisition.</a></h4>

              
                Our understanding of the molecular pathology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is rapidly evolving and is being driven by advances in sequencing techniques. Conventional short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a central tool in transcriptomics research that enables unbiased gene expression profiling. With the recent emergence of Oxford Nanopore direct RNA-seq (dRNA-seq), it is now also possible to interrogate diverse RNA modifications, collectively known as the epitranscriptome. Here, we present our analyses of the male and female mouse amygdala transcriptome and epitranscriptome, obtained using parallel Illumina RNA-seq and Oxford Nanopore dRNA-seq, associated with the acquisition of PTSD-like fear induced by Pavlovian cued-fear conditioning. We report significant sex-specific differences in the amygdala transcriptional response during fear acquisition, and a range of shared and dimorphic epitranscriptomic signatures. Differential RNA modifications are enriched among mRNA transcripts associated with neurotransmitter regulation and mitochondrial function, many of which have been previously implicated in PTSD. Very few differentially modified transcripts are also differentially expressed, suggesting an influential, expression-independent role for epitranscriptional regulation in PTSD-like fear-acquisition. Overall, our application of conventional and newly developed methods provides a platform for future work that will lead to new insights into and therapeutics for PTSD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lateralization of autonomic activity in response to limb-specific threat</a></h4>

              
                In times of stress or danger, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) signals the fight or flight response. A canonical function of ANS activity is to globally mobilize metabolic resources, preparing the organism to respond to threat. Yet a body of research has demonstrated that, rather than displaying a homogenous pattern across the body, autonomic responses to arousing events - as measured through changes in electrodermal activity (EDA) - can differ between right and left body locations. Surprisingly, the metabolic function of such ANS asymmetry has not been investigated. In the current study, we investigated whether asymmetric autonomic responses could be induced through limb-specific aversive stimulation. Participants were given mild electric stimulation to either the left or right arm while EDA was monitored bilaterally. Across participants, a strong ipsilateral EDA response bias was observed, with increased EDA response in the hand adjacent to the stimulation. This effect was observable in over 50% of individual subjects. These results demonstrate that autonomic output is more complex than canonical interpretations suggest. We suggest that, in stressful situations, autonomic outputs can prepare either the whole-body fight or flight response, or a simply a limb-localized flick, which can effectively neutralize the threat while minimizing global resource consumption. These findings provide insight into the evolutionary pathway of neural systems processing general arousal by linking observed asymmetry in the peripheral arousal response to a historical leveraging of neural structures organized to mediate responses to localized threat.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Hybrid Communication Pattern in Brain Structural Network Revealed by Evolutionary Computation</a></h4>

              
                The human brain functional connectivity network (FCN) is constrained and shaped by the information communication processes in the structural connectivity network (SCN). The underlying communication model thus becomes a critical issue for understanding structure-function coupling in the human brain. A number of communication models featuring different point-to-point routing strategies have been proposed, with shortest path (SP), diffusion (DIF), and navigation (NAV) as the typical, respectively requiring network global knowledge, local knowledge, and their combination for path seeking. Yet these models all assumed the entire brain to use a uniform routing strategy, which contradicted lumping evidence supporting the wide variety of brain regions in both terms of biological substrates and functional exhibitions. In this study, we developed a novel communication model that allowed each brain region to choose a routing strategy from SP, DIF, and NAV independently. A genetic algorithm was designed to uncover the underlying region-wise hybrid routing strategy (namely HYB) for maximizing the structure-function coupling. The HYB-based model outperformed the three typical models in terms of predicting FCN and supporting robust communication. In HYB, brain regions in lower-order functional modules inclined to choose the routing strategies requiring more global knowledge, while those in higher-order functional components preferred to choose DIF. Additionally, compared to regions using SP and NAV, regions using DIF had denser structural connections, participated in more functional modules, but were less dominant within them. Together, our findings revealed and evidenced the possibility and advantages of hybrid routing underpinning efficient SCN communication.

                Background: Virally-mediated chemogenetic techniques hold the promise of circuit-specific neuromodulation for human brain disorders. Their protracted development in primates and issues related to the specificity of the actuator drugs has significantly slowed their implementation. Here we took a multi-disciplinary approach to assessing the translational appropriateness of a newly identified actuator drug, deschloroclozapine (DCZ). Methods: Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data was acquired from seven rhesus macaques (6 males and 1 female) after administration of either vehicle, 0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg DCZ, the latter of which produce 80% and near 100% chemogenetic receptor occupancy, respectively. Seed-based comparative-connectome analysis and independent component analysis assessed dose dependent neural impact. Two subsets of subjects were tested on socio-emotional tasks (N = 4), and a probabilistic learning task (N = 3), assessing DCZ's impact on unconditioned and conditioned affective responses, respectively. Results: Neither vehicle nor 0.1 mg/kg DCZ changed overall functional connectivity, affective responses, or reaction times in the learning task. 0.3 mg/kg DCZ increased functional connectivity, particularly in frontal regions, and increased reaction times in the learning task. Notably, there was a positive correlation between changes in overall functional connectivity and reaction time. Conclusions: These experiments show the utility of rs-fMRI for in-vivo drug screening and benchmarking. We found that low dose DCZ does not alter brain function or affective behavior. However, higher doses of DCZ impacts frontal connectivity and is associated with deficits in task execution. Implementation of these methods will accelerate the development of chemogenetic in primates for research and therapeutic approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automated methodology for optimal selection of the minimum electrode subset for accurate EEG source localization based on Genetic Algorithm optimization</a></h4>

              
                High-density Electroencephalography (HD-EEG) has been proven to be the most accurate option to estimate the neural activity inside the brain. Although multiple studies report the effect of electrode number on source localization for specific sources and specific electrode configurations, the electrodes for each configuration have been manually selected to uniformly cover the entire head, going from 32 to 128 electrodes, where electrodes were not selected according to their contribution to accuracy. In this work, an optimization-based study aimed to determine the minimum number of electrodes and identify optimal combinations of electrodes that can keep the localization accuracy of HD-EEG reconstructions. This optimization approach incorporates scalp landmark positions of widely used EEG montages. In this way, a systematic search for the minimum electrode subset is performed for single and multiple source localization problems. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) combined with source reconstruction methods is used to formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that minimize (1) the localization error for each source and (2) the number of required EEG electrodes. It can be used for evaluating the source localization quality of low-density EEG systems (consumer-grade wearable EEG). We performed an evaluation over synthetic and real EEG dataset with known ground-truth. The experimental results shown that selected electrode combinations with 6 electrodes can obtain for a single source case, an equal or better accuracy than HD-EEG (with more than 200 channels) when reconstructing a particular brain activity in more than 88% of the cases (in synthetic signals) and 63% (in real signals), and more than 88% and 73% of the cases when considering combinations with 8 channels. For a multiple-source case of three sources (only with synthetic signals), it was found that an equal or better accuracy than HD-EEG with 231 electrodes was attained in at least 58%, 76%, and 82% of the cases, when using optimized combinations of 8, 12, and 16 electrodes, respectively. Additionally, in such electrode numbers a lower mean error and standard deviation than with 231 electrodes was obtained.

                Objectives: Promoting neurogenesis mediated recovery is one of the most sought after strategies in recovery after cerebral stroke. In this paper we elucidate how neurogenesis related genes are altered in the early stroke environment, to hint at potential pathways for therapeutic recovery. Materials and Methods: Around 97 microarray datasets derived from stroke affected rat brains were collected from NCBI-GEO. Datasets were normalized and subjected to a meta-analysis in Network Analyst to identify differentially expressed genes. Gene enrichment analyses were carried out using GSEA, and WebGestalt and results were visualized using Cytoscape Enrichment mapping. Results: Nearly 939 differentially expressing genes were identified in the cerebral stroke group. Among them, 30 neurogenesis related genes were identified through enrichment mapping analysis, and 35 genes through Protein-Protein Interaction analysis. Highest upregulated neurogenesis genes were found to be TSPO, GFAP, VIM, and TGFB1. The Highest Downregulated neurogenesis genes were found to be THY1, NR1D1, CDK5, STX1B, and NOG. Conclusions: Through this study, we have identified that during the acute time frame after stroke, the majority of the neurogenesis genes related to neural proliferation and neural differentiation are downregulated, while the majority of the genes related to neuronal migration were upregulated. A single or combined therapeutic approach against the identified dysregulated genes could greatly aid neural restoration and functional recovery during the postischemic stage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Scalable and Modular Automated Pipeline for Stitching of Large Electron Microscopy Datasets</a></h4>

              
                Serial section Electron Microscopy can produce high throughput imaging of large biological specimen volumes. The high-resolution images are necessary to reconstruct dense neural wiring diagrams in the brain, so called connectomes. A high fidelity volume assembly is required to correctly reconstruct neural anatomy and synaptic connections. It involves seamless 2D stitching of the images within a serial section followed by 3D alignment of the stitched sections. The high throughput of ssEM necessitates 2D stitching to be done at the pace of imaging, which currently produces tens of terabytes per day. To achieve this, we present a modular volume assembly software pipeline ASAP(Assembly Stitching and Alignment Pipeline) that is scalable and parallelized to work with distributed systems. The pipeline is built on top of the Render [18] services used in the volume assembly of the brain of adult Drosophila melanogaster [2]. It achieves high throughput by operating on the meta-data and transformations of each image stored in a database, thus eliminating the need to render intermediate output. The modularity of ASAP allows for easy adaptation to new algorithms without significant changes to the workflow. The software pipeline includes a complete set of tools to do stitching, automated quality control, 3D section alignment, and rendering of the assembled volume to disk. We also implemented a workflow engine that executes the volume assembly workflow in an automated fashion triggered following the transfer of raw data. ASAP has been successfully utilized for continuous processing of several large-scale datasets of the mouse visual cortex and human brain samples including one cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex [1, 25]. The pipeline also has multi-channel processing capabilities and can be applied to fluorescence and multi-modal datasets like array tomography.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Systematic Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Neuroanatomically-Based Age Prediction in Youth</a></h4>

              
                Application of machine learning algorithms to structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data has yielded behaviorally meaningful estimates of the biological age of the brain (brain-age). The choice of the machine learning approach in estimating brain-age in children and adolescents is important because age-related brain changes in these age-groups are dynamic. However, the comparative performance of the multiple machine learning algorithms available has not been systematically appraised. To address this gap, the present study evaluated the accuracy (Mean Absolute Error; MAE) and computational efficiency of 21 machine learning algorithms using sMRI data from 2,105 typically developing individuals aged 5 to 22 years from five cohorts. The trained models were then tested in an independent holdout datasets, comprising 4,078 pre-adolescents (aged 9-10 years). The algorithms encompassed parametric and nonparametric, Bayesian, linear and nonlinear, tree-based, and kernel-based models. Sensitivity analyses were performed for parcellation scheme, number of neuroimaging input features, number of cross-validation folds, and sample size. The best performing algorithms were Extreme Gradient Boosting (MAE of 1.25 years for females and 1.57 years for males), Random Forest Regression (MAE of 1.23 years for females and 1.65 years for males) and Support Vector Regression with Radial Basis Function Kernel (MAE of 1.47 years for females and 1.72 years for males) which had acceptable and comparable computational efficiency. Findings of the present study could be used as a guide for optimizing methodology when quantifying age-related changes during development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A scale-invariant perturbative approach to study information communication in dynamic brain networks</a></h4>

              
                How communication among neuronal ensembles shapes functional brain dynamics at the large scale is a question of fundamental importance to Neuroscience. To date, researchers have primarily relied on two alternative ways to address this issue 1) in-silico neurodynamical modelling of functional brain dynamics by choosing biophysically inspired non-linear systems, interacting via a connection topology driven by empirical data; and 2) identifying topological measures to quantify network structure and studying them in tandem with functional metrics of interest, e.g. co-variation of time series in brain regions from fast (EEG/ MEG) and slow (fMRI) timescales. While the modelling approaches are limited in scope to only scales of the nervous system for which dynamical models are well defined, the latter approach does not take into account how the network architecture and intrinsic regional node dynamics contribute together to inter-regional communication in the brain. Thus, developing a generalized scale-invariant measure of interaction between network topology and constituent regional dynamics can potentially resolve how transmission of perturbations in brain networks alter function e.g. by neuropathologies, or the intervention strategies designed to mitigate them. In this work, we introduce a recently developed theoretical perturbative framework in network science into a neuroscientific framework, to conceptualize the interaction of regional dynamics and network architecture in a quantifiable manner. This framework further provides insights into the information communication contributions of putative regions and sub-networks in the brain, irrespective of the observational scale of the phenomenon (firing rates to BOLD fMRI time series). The proposed approach can directly quantify network-dynamical interactions without reliance on a specific class of models or response characteristics: linear/nonlinear. By simply gauging the asymmetries in responses to perturbations, we obtain insights into the significance of regions in communication and their influence over the rest of the network. Moreover, coupling perturbations with functional lesions can also answer which regions contribute the most to information spread: a quantity termed Flow. The simplicity of the proposed technique allows translation to an experimental setting where the response asymmetries and flow can inversely act as a window into the dynamics of regions. For proof-of-concept, we apply the perturbative approach on in-silico data generated for human resting state network dynamics, using different established dynamical models that mimic empirical observations. We also apply the perturbation approach at the level of large scale Resting State Networks (RSNs) to gauge the range of network-dynamical interactions in mediating information flow across brain regions.

                Background: Human milk contains large amounts of exosomes (MEs) and their regulatory microRNA cargos, whereas infant formulas contain only trace amounts of MEs and microRNAs. Breastfeeding has been implicated in optimal brain development but experimental evidence linking ME intake with brain development is limited. Objectives: We assessed the transport of MEs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and ME accumulation in distinct regions of the brain in brain endothelial cells and suckling mice. We further assessed BME-dependent gene expression profiles and effects on the dendritic complexity of hippocampal granule cells and phenotypes of BME depletion in neonate, juvenile and adult mice. Methods: The transfer of MEs across the BBB was assessed by using bovine MEs labeled with FM4-64 or loaded with IRDye-labeled miR-34a in murine brain endothelial bEnd.3 cell monolayers and dual chamber systems, and in wild-type newborn pups fostered to exosome and cargo tracking (ECT) dams that express MEs endogenously labeled with a CD63-eGFP fusion protein for subsequent analysis by serial two-photon tomography and staining with anti-eGFP antibodies. Effects of MEs on gene expression and dendritic architecture of granule cells was analyzed in hippocampi from juvenile mice fed exosome and RNA-depleted (ERD) and exosome and RNA-sufficient (ERS) diets by using RNA-sequencing analysis and Golgi-Cox staining followed by integrated neuronal tracing and morphological analysis of neuronal dendrites, respectively. Spatial learning and severity of kainic acid-induced seizures were assessed in mice fed ERD and ERS diets. Results: bEnd.3 cells internalized MEs by using a saturable transport mechanism and secreted miR-34a across the basal membrane. MEs penetrated the entire brain in fostering experiments; major regions of accumulation included the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum. Two hundred ninety-five genes were differentially expressed in hippocampi from male mice fed ERD and ERS diets; high-confidence gene networks included pathways implicated in axon guidance and calcium signaling. Only one gene was differentially expressed in females fed the experimental diets. Juvenile pups fed the ERD diet had reduced dendritic complexity of dentate granule cells in the hippocampus, scored nine-fold lower in the Barnes maze test of spatial learning and memory (P < 0.01), and the severity of seizures was 5-fold higher following kainic acid administration in adult mice fed the ERD diet compared to mice fed the ERS diet (P < 0.01). Conclusions: MEs cross the BBB and contribute toward optimal neuronal development, spatial learning and memory, and resistance to kainic acid-induced seizures in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activation of LH GABAergic inputs counteracts fasting-induced changes in tVTA/RMTG neurons.</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are strongly innervated by GABAergic neurons in the tail of the VTA (tVTA), also known as the rostralmedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). Disinhibition of dopamine neurons through firing of the GABAergic neurons projecting from the lateral hypothalamus (LH) leads to reward seeking and consumption through dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. VTA dopamine neurons respond to changes in motivational state, yet less is known of whether tVTA/RMTg GABAergic neurons or the LH GABAergic neurons that project to them are also affected by changes in motivational state, such as fasting. An acute 16 h overnight fast decreased the excitability of tVTA/RMTg GABAergic neurons of male and female mice. In addition, fasting decreased synaptic strength at LH GABA to tVTA/RMTg GABAergic synapses, indicated by reduced amplitude of optically evoked currents, decreased readily releasable pool (RRP) size and replenishment. Optical stimulation of LH GABA terminals suppressed evoked action potentials of tVTA/RMTg GABAergic neurons in unfasted mice, but this effect decreased following fasting in both males and females. Furthermore, during fasting, LH GABA inputs to tVTA/RMTg neurons maintained functional connectivity during depolarization, as depolarization block was reduced following fasting. Taken together, inhibitory synaptic transmission from LH GABA inputs onto tVTA/RMTg GABAergic neurons decreases following fasting, however ability to functionally inhibit tVTA/RMTg GABAergic neurons is preserved, allowing for possible disinhibition of dopamine neurons and subsequent foraging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interaction between theta-phase and spike-timing dependent plasticity simulates theta induced memory effects</a></h4>

              
                Rodent studies suggest that spike timing relative to hippocampal theta activity determines whether potentiation or depression of synapses arise. Such changes also depend on spike timing between pre- and post-synaptic neurons, known as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). STDP, together with theta-phase-dependent learning, has inspired several computational models of learning and memory. However, evidence to elucidate how these mechanisms directly link to human episodic memory is lacking. In a computational model, we modulate long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of STDP, by opposing phases of a simulated theta rhythm. We fit parameters to a hippocampal cell culture study in which LTP and LTD were observed to occur in opposing phases of a theta rhythm. Further, we modulated two inputs by cosine waves with synchronous and asynchronous phase offsets and replicate key findings in human episodic memory. Learning advantage was found for the synchronous condition, as compared to the asynchronous conditions, and was specific to theta modulated inputs. Importantly, simulations with and without each mechanism suggest that both STDP and theta-phase-dependent plasticity are necessary to replicate the findings. Together, the results indicate a role for circuit-level mechanisms, which bridges the gap between slice preparation studies and human memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Population-level asymmetry of the cerebral cortex: reproducibility, lifespan changes, heritability, and individual differences</a></h4>

              
                Cortical asymmetry is a ubiquitous feature of brain organization that is altered in neurodevelopmental disorders and aging. Achieving consensus on cortical asymmetries in humans is necessary to uncover the genetic-developmental mechanisms that shape them and factors moderating cortical lateralization. Here, we delineate population-level asymmetry in cortical thickness and surface area vertex-wise in 7 datasets and chart asymmetry trajectories across life (4-89 years; observations = 3937; 70% longitudinal). We reveal asymmetry interrelationships, heritability, and test associations in UK Biobank (N=~37,500). Cortical asymmetry was robust across datasets. Whereas areal asymmetry is predominantly stable across life, thickness asymmetry grows in development and declines in aging. Areal asymmetry correlates in specific regions, whereas thickness asymmetry is globally interrelated across cortex and suggests high directional variability in global thickness lateralization. Areal asymmetry is moderately heritable (max h2SNP ~19%), and phenotypic correlations are reflected by high genetic correlations, whereas heritability of thickness asymmetry is low. Finally, we detected an asymmetry association with cognition and confirm recently-reported handedness links. Results suggest areal asymmetry is developmentally stable and arises in early life, whereas developmental changes in thickness asymmetry may lead to directional variability of global thickness lateralization. Our results bear enough reproducibility to serve as a standard for future brain asymmetry studies.

                Mesoscopic (0.1-0.5 mm) interrogation of the living human brain is critical for a comprehensive understanding of brain structure and function. However, in vivo techniques for mesoscopic imaging have been hampered by the sensitivity challenges of acquiring data at very high resolutions and the lack of analysis tools that can retain fine-scale detail while also accurately positioning measurements relative to the complex folded structure of the cerebral cortex. Here, we present an experimental dataset in which we image the anatomical structure of the visual and auditory cortices of five participants at 0.35 x 0.35 x 0.35 mm3 resolution. To analyze this challenging dataset, we design and implement two sets of novel methodology: a method for mitigating imaging artifacts related to blood motion and a suite of software tools for accurate quantification and visualization of the mesoscopic structure of the cortical surface. Applying these methods, we demonstrate the ability to clearly identify structures that are visible only at the mesoscopic scale, including cortical layers and intracortical blood vessels. We freely share our dataset and tools with the research community, thereby enabling investigations of fine-scale neurobiological structures in both the current and future datasets. Overall, our results demonstrate the viability of mesoscopic imaging as a quantitative tool for studying the living human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An exploratory study of EEG connectivity during the first year of life in preterm and full-term infants</a></h4>

              
                Aim: to evaluate EEG connectivity during the first year of age in healthy full-term infants and preterm infants with prenatal and perinatal risk factors for perinatal brain damage. Methods: Three groups of infants were studied: healthy at full-term infants (n = 71), moderate and late preterm infants (n = 54), and very preterm infants (n = 56). All preterm infants had perinatal or/and perinatal risk factors for brain damage. EEG was obtained during phase II of natural NREM sleep. EEG analysis was performed in 24 segments of 2.56 s free of artifacts. For the calculation of EEG sources, the spectral Structured Sparse Bayesian Learning (sSSBL) was used. Connectivity was computed by the phase-lag index. Results: In healthy full-term infants, EEG interhemispheric connectivity in the different frequency bands followed similar trends with age to those reported in each frequency band: delta connectivity decreases, theta increases at the end of the year, in the alpha band, different trends were observed according to the region studied, and beta interhemispheric connectivity decreases with age. EEG connectivity in preterm infants showed differences from the results of the term group.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reducing voltage-dependent potassium channel Kv3.4 levels ameliorates synapse loss in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease</a></h4>

              
                Synapse loss is associated with cognitive decline in Alzheimers disease (AD) and owing to their plastic nature, synapses are an ideal target for therapeutic intervention. Oligomeric amyloid beta (Ab) around amyloid plaques is known to contribute to synapse loss in mouse models and is associated with synapse loss in human AD brain tissue, but the mechanisms leading from Ab; to synapse loss remain unclear. Recent data suggest that the fast-activating and -inactivating voltage-gated potassium channel subtype 3.4 (Kv3.4) may play a role in Ab-mediated neurotoxicity. Here, we tested whether this channel could also be involved in Ab synaptotoxicity. Using adeno-associated virus and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) technology, we reduced Kv3.4 expression in neurons of the somatosensory cortex of APP/PS1 mice. These mice express human familial AD associated mutations in amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 and develop amyloid plaques and plaque-associated synapse loss similar to that observed in AD brain. We observe that reducing Kv3.4 levels ameliorates dendritic spine loss and changes spine morphology compared to control virus. In support of translational relevance, Kv3.4 protein was observed in human AD and control brain and is associated with synapses in human iPSC-derived cortical neurons. Interestingly, we observe a decrease in Kv3.4 expression in iPSC derived cortical neurons when they are challenged with human Alzheimers disease derived brain homogenate. These results suggest that approaches to reduce Kv3.4 expression and/or function could be protective against Ab-induced synaptic alterations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Non-invasive real-time access to spatial attention information from 3T fMRI BOLD signals</a></h4>

              
                Access to higher cognitive functions in real-time remains very challenging, because these functions are internally driven and their assessment is based onto indirect measures. In addition, recent finding show that these functions are highly dynamic. Previous studies using intra-cortical recordings in monkeys, succeed to access the (x,y) position of covert spatial attention, in real-time, using classification methods applied to monkey prefrontal multi-unit activity and local field potentials. In contrast, the direct access to attention with non-invasive methods is limited to predicting the attention localisation based on a quadrant classification. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility to track covert spatial attention localization using non-invasive fMRI BOLD signals, with an unprecedented spatial resolution. We further show that the errors produced by the decoder are not randomly distributed but concentrate on the locations neighbouring the cued location and that behavioral errors correlate with weaker decoding performance. Last, we also show that the voxels contributing to the decoder precisely match the visual retinotopic organization of the occipital cortex and that single trial access to attention is limited by the intrinsic dynamics of spatial attention. Taken together, these results open the way to the development of remediation and enhancement neurofeedback protocols targeting the attentional function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Consequences of human Tau aggregation in the hippocampal formation of ageing mice in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated Tau (pTau) in the brain is associated with cognitive and motor impairments, and ultimately neurodegeneration. We investigate how human pTau affects cells and network activity in the hippocampal formation of THY-Tau22 tauopathy model mice in vivo. We find that pTau preferentially accumulates in deep-layer pyramidal neurons, leading to neurodegeneration, and we establish that pTau spreads to oligodendrocytes. During goal-directed virtual navigation in aged transgenic mice, we detect fewer high-firing pyramidal cells, with the remaining cells retaining their coupling to theta oscillations. Analysis of network oscillations and firing patterns of pyramidal and GABAergic neurons recorded in head-fixed and freely-moving mice suggests preserved neuronal coordination. In spatial memory tests, transgenic mice have reduced short-term familiarity but spatial working and reference memory are surprisingly normal. We hypothesize that unimpaired subcortical network mechanisms implementing cortical neuronal coordination compensate for the widespread pTau aggregation, loss of high-firing cells and neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Association between plasma phospho-tau181 and cognitive change from age 73 to 82: Lothian Birth Cohort 1936</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Plasma phospho-tau 181 (p-tau181) is a promising blood biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. However, its predictive validity for age-related cognitive decline without dementia remains unclear. Several forms of p-tau have been shown to contribute to synapse degeneration, but it is unknown whether p-tau181 is present in synapses. Here, we tested whether plasma p-tau181predicts cognitive decline and whether it is present in synapses in human brain. METHODS: General cognitive ability and plasma p-tau181 concentration were measured in 195 participants at ages 72 and 82. Levels of p-tau181 in total homogenate and synaptic fractions were compared with western blot (n=10-12 per group), and synaptic localisation was examined using array tomography. RESULTS: Elevated baseline plasma p-tau181 and increasing p-tau181 over time predicted steeper general cognitive decline. We observe p-tau181 in neurites, presynapses, and post-synapses in the brain. DISCUSSION: Baseline and subsequent change in plasma p-tau181 may represent rare biomarkers of differences in cognitive ageing across the 8th decade of life and may play a role in synaptic function in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Generation of Infant-dedicated Fine-grained Functional Parcellation Maps of Cerebral Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Infancy is a dynamic and immensely important period in human brain development. Studies of infant functional development using resting-state fMRI rely on precisely defined cortical parcellation maps. However, available adult-based functional parcellation maps are not applicable for infants due to their substantial differences in functional organizations. Fine-grained infant-dedicated cortical parcellation maps are highly desired but remain scarce, due to difficulties ranging from acquiring to processing of infant brain MRIs. In this study, leveraging 1,064 high-resolution longitudinal rs-fMRIs from 197 infants from birth to 24 months and advanced infant-dedicated processing tools, we create the first set of infant-specific, fine-grained cortical functional parcellation maps. Besides the conventional folding-based cortical registration, we specifically establish the functional correspondences across individuals using functional gradient densities and generate both age-specific and age-common fine-grained parcellation maps. The first set of comprehensive brain functional developmental maps are accordingly derived, and reveals a complex, hitherto unseen multi-peak fluctuation development pattern in temporal variations of gradient density, network sizes, and local efficiency, with more dynamic changes during the first 9 months than other ages. Our proposed method is applicable in generating fine-grained parcellations for the whole lifespan, and our parcellation maps will be available online to advance the neuroimaging field.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pulse-Width Modulation-based TMS mimics effects of conventional TMS on human primary motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Objective: We developed a novel transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) device to generate flexible stimuli and patterns. The system synthesizes digital equivalents of analog waveforms, relying on the filtering properties of the nervous system. Here, we test the hypothesis that the novel pulses can mimic the effect of conventional pulses on the cortex. Approach: A second-generation programmable TMS (pTMS2) stimulator with magnetic pulse shaping capabilities using pulse-width modulation (PWM) was tested. A computational and an in-human study on twelve healthy participants compared the neuronal effects of conventional and modulation-based stimuli. Main results: Both the computational modeling and the in-human stimulation showed that the PWM-based system can synthesize pulses to effectively stimulate the human brain, equivalent to conventional stimulators. The comparison includes motor threshold, MEP latency and input-output curve measurements. Significance: PWM stimuli can fundamentally imitate the effect of conventional magnetic stimuli while adding considerable flexibility to TMS systems, enabling the generation of highly configurable TMS protocols.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prefrontal, striatal, and VTA subnetwork dynamics during novelty and exploration</a></h4>

              
                Multiple distinct brain areas have been implicated in memory including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatum (STR), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Information-exchange across these widespread networks requires flexible coordination at a fine time-scale. In the present study, we collected high-density recordings from the PFC, STR, and VTA of male rats during baseline, encoding, consolidation, and retrieval stages of memory formation. Novel sub-regional clustering analyses identified patterns of spatially restricted, temporally coherent, and frequency specific signals that were reproducible across days and were modulated by behavioral states. Clustering identified miniscule patches of neural tissue. Generalized eigen decomposition (GED) reduced each cluster to a single time series. Amplitude envelope correlation of the cluster time series was used to assess functional connectivity between clusters. Dense intra- and inter regional functional connectivity characterized the baseline period, with delta oscillations playing an outsized role. There was a dramatic pruning of network connectivity during encoding. Connectivity rebounded during consolidation, but connections in the theta band became stronger, and those in the delta band were weaker. Finally, during retrieval, connections were not as severely reduced as they had been during encoding, and specifically theta and higher-frequency connections were stronger. Underlying these connectivity changes, the anatomical extent of clusters observed in the gamma band in the PFC and in both the gamma and delta bands in the VTA changed markedly across behavioral conditions. These results demonstrate the brain's ability to reorganize functionally at both the intra- and inter-regional levels during different stages of memory processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human-in-the-loop optimization of visual prosthetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Retinal prostheses are a promising strategy to restore sight to patients with retinal degenerative diseases. These devices compensate for the loss of photoreceptors by electrically stimulating neurons in the retina. Currently, the visual function that can be recovered with such devices is very limited. This is due, in part, to current spread, unintended axonal activation, and the limited resolution of existing devices. Here we show, using a recent model of prosthetic vision, that optimizing how visual stimuli are encoded by the device can help overcome some of these limitations, leading to dramatic improvements in visual perception. We propose a strategy to do this in practice, using patients' feedback in a visual task. The main challenge of our approach comes from the fact that, typically, one only has access to a limited number of noisy responses from patients. We propose two ways to deal with this: first, we use a model of prosthetic vision to constrain and simplify the optimisation; second, we use preferential Bayesian optimisation to efficiently learn the encoder using minimal trials. As a proof-of concept, we presented healthy subjects with visual stimuli generated by a recent model of prosthetic vision, to replicate the perceptual experience of patients fitted with an implant. Our optimisation procedure led to significant and robust improvements in perceived image quality, that transferred to increased performance in other tasks. Importantly, our strategy is agnostic to the type of prosthesis and thus could readily be implemented in existing implants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping of morpho-electric features to molecular identity of cortical inhibitory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Knowledge of the cell-type-specific composition of the brain is useful in order to understand the role of each cell type as part of the network. Here, we estimated the composition of the whole cortex in terms of well characterised morphological and electrophysiological inhibitory neuron types (me-types). We derived probabilistic me-type densities from an existing atlas of molecularly defined cell-type densities in the mouse cortex. We used a well-established me-type classification from rat somatosensory cortex to populate the cortex. These me-types were well characterized morphologically and electrophysiologically but they lacked molecular marker identity labels. To extrapolate this missing information, we employed an additional dataset from the Allen Institute for Brain Science containing molecular identity as well as morphological and electrophysiological data for mouse cortical neurons. We first built a latent space based on a number of comparable morphological and electrical features common to both data sources. We then identified 13 morpho-electrical clusters that merged neurons from both datasets while being molecularly homogeneous. The resulting clusters best mirror the molecular identity classification solely using available morpho-electrical features. Finally, we stochastically assigned a molecular identity to a me-type neuron based on the latent space cluster it was assigned to. The resulting mapping was used to derive inhibitory me-types densities in the cortex.

	<p>Treatment refractory Tourette syndrome has been shown to be improved with deep brain stimulation, but with multiple possible stimulation locations and variable and incomplete benefit. This study presents a single case of complete amelioration of motor and verbal tics in a patient with Tourette syndrome during placement of 12 stereo-EEG electrodes to identify optimal targets for permanent stimulating electrodes. Subsequently, substantial improvement in motor and verbal tic frequency occurred with placement and programming of permanent electrodes in bilateral globus pallidus internus and nucleus accumbens, but without the complete resolution seen during depth electrode placement. We suggest that simultaneous stimulation at multiple patient-specific targets could provide effective control of Tourette symptomatology, but further study will be needed.</p>

	<p>About 25&amp;amp;ndash;35% of United States veterans who fought in the 1990&amp;amp;ndash;1991 Gulf War report several moderate or severe chronic systemic symptoms, defined as Gulf War illness (GWI). Thirty years later, there is little consensus on the causes or biological underpinnings of GWI. The Gulf War Era Cohort and Biorepository (GWECB) was designed to investigate genetic and environmental associations with GWI and consists of 1343 veterans. We investigate candidate gene&amp;amp;ndash;toxicant interactions that may be associated with GWI based on prior associations found in human and animal model studies, focusing on SNPs in or near ACHE, BCHE, and PON1 genes to replicate results from prior studies. SOD1 was also considered as a candidate gene. CDC Severe GWI, the primary outcome, was observed in 26% of the 810 deployed veterans included in this study. The interaction between the candidate SNP rs662 and pyridostigmine bromide (PB) pills was found to be associated with CDC Severe GWI. Interactions between PB pill exposure and rs3917545, rs3917550, and rs2299255, all in high linkage disequilibrium in PON1, were also associated with respiratory symptoms. These SNPs could point toward biological pathways through which GWI may develop, which could lead to biomarkers to detect GWI or to better treatment options for veterans with GWI.</p>

                For over a century, stability of spatial context across related episodes has been considered a source of memory interference, impairing memory retrieval. However, contemporary memory integration theory generates a diametrically opposite prediction. Here, we aimed to resolve this discrepancy by manipulating local context similarity across temporally disparate but related episodes...

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are a commonly used tool in neuroscience to efficiently label, trace, and/or manipulate neuronal populations. Highly specific targeting can be achieved through recombinase-dependent AAVs in combination with transgenic rodent lines that express Cre-recombinase in specific cell types. Visualization of viral expression is typically achieved through fluorescent reporter proteins (e.g., GFP or mCherry) packaged within the AAV genome. Although nonamplified fluorescence is usually sufficient to observe viral expression, immunohistochemical amplification of the fluorescent reporter is routinely used to improve viral visualization. In the present study, Cre-dependent AAVs were injected into the neocortex of wild-type C57BL/6J mice. While we observed weak but consistent nonamplified off-target double inverted open reading frame (DIO) expression in C57BL/6J mice, antibody amplification of the GFP or mCherry reporter revealed notable Cre-independent viral expression. Off-target expression of DIO constructs in wild-type C57BL/6J mice occurred independent of vendor, AAV serotype, or promoter. We also evaluated whether Cre-independent expression had functional effects via designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). The DREADD agonist C21 (compound 21) had no effect on contextual fear conditioning or c-Fos expression in DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry<sup>+</sup> cells of C57BL/6J mice. Together, our results indicate that DIO constructs have off-target expression in wild-type subjects. Our findings are particularly important for the design of experiments featuring sensitive systems and/or quantitative measurements that could be negatively impacted by off-target expression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Deletion of Stim1 in Hypothalamic Arcuate Nucleus Kiss1 Neurons Potentiates Synchronous GCaMP Activity and Protects against Diet-Induced Obesity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons are essential for reproduction, but their role in the control of energy balance and other homeostatic functions remains unclear. High-frequency firing of hypothalamic arcuate Kiss1 (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) neurons releases kisspeptin into the median eminence, and neurokinin B (NKB) and dynorphin onto neighboring Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons to generate a slow EPSP mediated by TRPC5 channels that entrains intermittent, synchronous firing of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. High-frequency optogenetic stimulation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons also releases glutamate to excite the anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and inhibit the orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons via metabotropic glutamate receptors. At the molecular level, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium-sensing protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is critically involved in the regulation of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and neuronal excitability through its interaction with plasma membrane (PM) calcium (e.g., TRPC) channels. Therefore, we hypothesized that deletion of <I>Stim1</I> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons would increase neuronal excitability and their synchronous firing, which ultimately would affect energy homeostasis. Using optogenetics in combination with whole-cell recording and GCaMP6 imaging in slices, we discovered that deletion of <I>Stim1</I> in Kiss1 neurons significantly increased the amplitude and duration of the slow EPSP and augmented synchronous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i oscillations in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Deletion of <I>Stim1</I> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons amplified the actions of NKB and protected ovariectomized female mice from developing obesity and glucose intolerance with high-fat dieting (HFD). Therefore, STIM1 appears to play a critical role in regulating synchronous firing of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, which ultimately affects the coordination between energy homeostasis and reproduction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hypothalamic arcuate kisspeptin (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) neurons are essential for stimulating the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and maintaining fertility. However, Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons appear to be a key player in coordinating energy balance with reproduction. The regulation of calcium channels and hence calcium signaling is critically dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium-sensing protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), which interacts with the plasma membrane (PM) calcium channels. We have conditionally deleted <I>Stim1</I> in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and found that it significantly increased the excitability of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and protected ovariectomized female mice from developing obesity and glucose intolerance with high-fat dieting (HFD).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tonic GABAA Receptor-Mediated Currents of Human Cortical GABAergic Interneurons Vary Amongst Cell Types</a></h4>

              
                <p>Persistent anion conductances through GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs) are important modulators of neuronal excitability. However, it is currently unknown how the amplitudes of these currents vary among different cell types in the human neocortex, particularly among diverse GABAergic interneurons. We have recorded 101 interneurons in and near layer 1 from cortical tissue surgically resected from both male and female patients, visualized 84 of them and measured tonic GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R currents in 48 cells with an intracellular [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>] of 65 m<scp>m</scp> and in the presence of 5 &mu;<scp>m</scp> GABA. We compare these tonic currents among five groups of interneurons divided by firing properties and four types of interneuron defined by axonal distributions; rosehip, neurogliaform, stalked-bouton, layer 2&ndash;3 innervating and a pool of other cells. Interestingly, the rosehip cell, a type of interneuron only described thus far in human tissue, and layer 2&ndash;3 innervating cells exhibit larger tonic currents than other layer 1 interneurons, such as neurogliaform and stalked-bouton cells; the latter two groups showing no difference. The positive allosteric modulators of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs allopregnanolone and DS2 also induced larger current shifts in the rosehip and layer 2&ndash;3 innervating cells, consistent with higher expression of the  subunit of the GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R in these neurons. We have also examined how patient parameters, such as age, seizures, type of cancer and anticonvulsant treatment may alter tonic inhibitory currents in human neurons. The cell type-specific differences in tonic inhibitory currents could potentially be used to selectively modulate cortical circuitry.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tonic currents through GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs) are a potential therapeutic target for a number of neurologic and psychiatric conditions. Here, we show that these currents in human cerebral cortical GABAergic neurons display cell type-specific differences in their amplitudes which implies differential modulation of their excitability. Additionally, we examine whether the amplitudes of the tonic currents measured in our study show any differences between patient populations, finding some evidence that age, seizures, type of cancer, and anticonvulsant treatment may alter tonic inhibition in human tissue. These results advance our understanding of how pathology affects neuronal excitability and could potentially be used to selectively modulate cortical circuitry.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Extent of Task Specificity for Visual and Tactile Sequences in the Auditory Cortex of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing</a></h4>

              
                <p>It has been proposed that the auditory cortex in the deaf humans might undergo task-specific reorganization. However, evidence remains scarce as previous experiments used only two very specific tasks (temporal processing and face perception) in visual modality. Here, congenitally deaf/hard of hearing and hearing women and men were enrolled in an fMRI experiment as we sought to fill this evidence gap in two ways. First, we compared activation evoked by a temporal processing task performed in two different modalities, visual and tactile. Second, we contrasted this task with a perceptually similar task that focuses on the spatial dimension. Additional control conditions consisted of passive stimulus observation. In line with the task specificity hypothesis, the auditory cortex in the deaf was activated by temporal processing in both visual and tactile modalities. This effect was selective for temporal processing relative to spatial discrimination. However, spatial processing also led to significant auditory cortex recruitment which, unlike temporal processing, occurred even during passive stimulus observation. We conclude that auditory cortex recruitment in the deaf and hard of hearing might involve interplay between task-selective and pluripotential mechanisms of cross-modal reorganization. Our results open several avenues for the investigation of the full complexity of the cross-modal plasticity phenomenon.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous studies suggested that the auditory cortex in the deaf may change input modality (sound to vision) while keeping its function (e.g., rhythm processing). We investigated this hypothesis by asking deaf or hard of hearing and hearing adults to discriminate between temporally and spatially complex sequences in visual and tactile modalities. The results show that such function-specific brain reorganization, as has previously been demonstrated in the visual modality, also occurs for tactile processing. On the other hand, they also show that for some stimuli (spatial) the auditory cortex activates automatically, which is suggestive of a take-over by a different kind of cognitive function. The observed differences in processing of sequences might thus result from an interplay of task-specific and pluripotent plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Sexually Dimorphic Olfactory Neuron Mediates Fixed Action Transition during Courtship Ritual in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                <p>Animals perform a series of actions in a fixed order during ritualistic innate behaviors. Although command neurons and sensory pathways responding to external stimuli that trigger these behaviors have been identified, how each action is induced in a fixed order in response to multimodal sensory stimuli remains unclear. Here, the sexually dimorphic lateral antennal lobe tract projection neuron 4 (lPN4) in male <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> mediates the expression of a fixed behavioral action pattern at the beginning of the courtship ritual, in which a male taps a female body and then extends a wing unilaterally to produce a courtship song. We found that blocking the synaptic output of lPN4 caused an increase in the ratio of male flies that extended a wing unilaterally without tapping the female body, whereas excitation of lPN4 suppressed the transition from the tapping phase to the unilateral wing extension phase. Real-time calcium imaging showed that lPN4 is activated by a volatile pheromone, palmitoleic acid, whose responses were inhibited by simultaneous gustatory stimulation with female cuticular hydrocarbons, showing the existence of an "AND-gate" for multimodal sensory inputs during male courtship behaviors. These results suggest that the function of lPN4 is to suppress unilateral wing extension while responding to a female smell, which is released by appropriate contact chemosensory inputs received when tapping a female. As the female smell also promotes male courtship behaviors, the olfactory system is ready to simultaneously promote and suppress the progress of courtship actions while responding to a female smell.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although it has been 80 years since Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen introduced how multiple acts comprising separate innate behaviors are released in a fixed order according to external stimuli, the neural circuits responsible for such fixed action patterns remain largely unknown. The male courtship behavior of <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> is a good model to investigate how such a fixed behavioral sequence is determined in the brain. Here, we show that lateral antennal lobe tract projection neuron 4 (lPN4) in <I>D. melanogaster</I> functions as an "AND-gate" for volatile and contact chemosensory inputs, mediating the expression of tapping behaviors before unilateral wing extension during male courtship rituals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Perigenual and Subgenual Anterior Cingulate Afferents Converge on Common Pyramidal Cells in Amygdala Subregions of the Macaque</a></h4>

              
                <p>The subgenual (sgACC) and perigenual (pgACC) anterior cingulate are important afferents of the amygdala, with different cytoarchitecture, connectivity, and function. The sgACC is associated with arousal mechanisms linked to salient cues, whereas the pgACC is engaged in conflict decision-making, including in social contexts. After placing same-size, small volume tracer injections into sgACC and pgACC of the same hemisphere in male macaques, we examined anterogradely labeled fiber distribution to understand how these different functional systems communicate in the main amygdala nuclei at both mesocopic and cellular levels. The sgACC has broad-based termination patterns. In contrast, the pgACC has a more restricted pattern, which was always nested in sgACC terminals. Terminal overlap occurred in subregions of the accessory basal and basal nuclei, which we termed "hotspots." In triple-labeling confocal studies, the majority of randomly selected CaMKII&alpha;-positive cells (putative amygdala glutamatergic neurons) in hotspots received dual contacts from the sgACC and pgACC. The ratio of dual contacts occurred over a surprisingly narrow range, suggesting a consistent, tight balance of afferent contacts on postsynaptic neurons. Large boutons, which are associated with greater synaptic strength, were ~3 times more frequent on sgACC versus pgACC axon terminals in hotspots, consistent with a fast "driver" function. Together, the results reveal a nested interaction in which pgACC ("conflict/social monitoring") terminals converge with the broader sgACC ("salience") terminals at both the mesoscopic and cellular level. The presynaptic organization in hotspots suggests that shifts in arousal states can rapidly and flexibly influence decision-making functions in the amygdala.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The subgenual (sgACC) and perigenual cingulate (pgACC) have distinct structural and functional characteristics and are important afferent modulators of the amygdala. The sgACC is critical for arousal, whereas the pgACC mediates conflict-monitoring, including in social contexts. Using dual tracer injections in the same monkey, we found that sgACC inputs broadly project in the main amygdala nuclei, whereas pgACC inputs were more restricted and nested in zones containing sgACC terminals (hotspots). The majority of CaMKII&alpha; + (excitatory) amygdala neurons in hotspots received converging contacts, which were tightly balanced. pgACC and sgACC afferent streams are therefore highly interdependent in these specific amygdala subregions, permitting "internal arousal" states to rapidly shape responses of amygdala neurons involved in conflict and social monitoring networks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Global Configuration of Visual Stimuli Alters Co-Fluctuations of Cross-Hemispheric Human Brain Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>We tested how a stimulus gestalt, defined by the neuronal interaction between local and global features of a stimulus, is represented within human primary visual cortex (V1). We used high-resolution fMRI, which serves as a surrogate of neuronal activation, to measure co-fluctuations within subregions of V1 as (male and female) subjects were presented with peripheral stimuli, each with different global configurations. We found stronger cross-hemisphere correlations when fine-scale V1 cortical subregions represented parts of the same object compared with different objects. This result was consistent with the vertical bias in global processing and, critically, was independent of the task and local discontinuities within objects. Thus, despite the relatively small receptive fields of neurons within V1, global stimulus configuration affects neuronal processing via correlated fluctuations between regions that represent different sectors of the visual field.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We provide the first evidence for the impact of global stimulus configuration on cross-hemispheric fMRI fluctuations, measured in human primary visual cortex. Our results are consistent with changes in the level of -band synchrony, which has been shown to be affected by global stimulus configuration, being reflected in the level fMRI co-fluctuations. These data help narrow the gap between knowledge of global stimulus configuration encoding at the single-neuron level versus at the behavioral level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distal CA1 Maintains a More Coherent Spatial Representation than Proximal CA1 When Local and Global Cues Conflict</a></h4>

              
                <p>Entorhinal cortical projections show segregation along the transverse axis of CA1, with the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) sending denser projections to proximal CA1 (pCA1) and the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) sending denser projections to distal CA1 (dCA1). Previous studies have reported functional segregation along the transverse axis of CA1 correlated with the functional differences in MEC and LEC. pCA1 shows higher spatial selectivity than dCA1 in these studies. We employ a double rotation protocol, which creates an explicit conflict between the local and the global cues, to understand the differential contributions of these reference frames to the spatial code in pCA1 and dCA1 in male Long&ndash;Evans rats. We show that pCA1 and dCA1 respond differently to this local-global cue conflict. pCA1 representation splits as predicted from the strong conflicting inputs it receives from MEC and dCA3. In contrast, dCA1 rotates more in concert with the global cues. In addition, pCA1 and dCA1 display comparable levels of spatial selectivity in this study. This finding differs from the previous studies, perhaps because of richer sensory information available in our behavior arena. Together, these observations indicate that the functional segregation along proximodistal axis of CA1 is not of the amount of spatial selectivity but that of the nature of the different inputs used to create and anchor spatial representations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Subregions of the hippocampus are thought to play different roles in spatial navigation and episodic memory. It was previously thought that the distal part of area CA1 of the hippocampus carries lesser information about space than proximal CA1 (pCA1). We report that distal CA1 (dCA1) spatial representation moves more in concert with the global cues than pCA1 when the local and the global cues conflict. We also show that spatial selectivity is comparable along the proximodistal axis in this experimental protocol. Thus, different parts of the brain receiving differential outputs from pCA1 and dCA1 receive spatial information in different spatial reference frames encoded using different sets of inputs, rather than different amounts of spatial information as thought earlier.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">MIF versus SIF Motoneurons, What Are Their Respective Contribution in the Oculomotor Medial Rectus Pool?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Multiply-innervated muscle fibers (MIFs) are peculiar to the extraocular muscles as they are non-twitch but produce a slow build up in tension on repetitive stimulation. The motoneurons innervating MIFs establish en grappe terminals along the entire length of the fiber, instead of the typical en plaque terminals that singly-innervated muscle fibers (SIFs) motoneurons establish around the muscle belly. MIF motoneurons have been proposed to participate only in gaze holding and slow eye movements. We aimed to discern the function of MIF motoneurons by recording medial rectus motoneurons of the oculomotor nucleus. Single-unit recordings in awake cats demonstrated that electrophysiologically-identified medial rectus MIF motoneurons participated in different types of eye movements, including fixations, rapid eye movements or saccades, convergences, and the slow and fast phases of the vestibulo-ocular nystagmus, the same as SIF motoneurons did. However, MIF medial rectus motoneurons presented lower firing frequencies, were recruited earlier and showed lower eye position (EP) and eye velocity (EV) sensitivities than SIF motoneurons. MIF medial rectus motoneurons were also smaller, had longer antidromic latencies and a lower synaptic coverage than SIF motoneurons. Peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) revealed that electrical stimulation to the myotendinous junction, where palisade endings are located, did not recurrently affect the firing probability of medial rectus motoneurons. Therefore, we conclude there is no division of labor between MIF and SIF motoneurons based on the type of eye movement they subserve.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In addition to the common singly-innervated muscle fiber (SIF), extraocular muscles also contain multiply-innervated muscle fibers (MIFs), which are non-twitch and slow in contraction. MIF motoneurons have been proposed to participate only in gaze holding and slow eye movements. In the present work, by single-unit extracellular recordings in awake cats, we demonstrate, however, that both SIF and MIF motoneurons, electrophysiologically-identified, participate in the different types of eye movements. However, MIF motoneurons showed lower firing rates (FRs), recruitment thresholds, and eye-related sensitivities, and could thus contribute to the fine adjustment of eye movements. Electrical stimulation of the myotendinous junction activates antidromically MIF motoneurons but neither MIF nor SIF motoneurons receive a synaptic reafferentation that modifies their discharge probability.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Brainstem Mechanisms of Pain Modulation: A within-Subjects 7T fMRI Study of Placebo Analgesic and Nocebo Hyperalgesic Responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pain perception can be powerfully influenced by an individual's expectations and beliefs. Although the cortical circuitry responsible for pain modulation has been thoroughly investigated, the brainstem pathways involved in the modulatory phenomena of placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia remain to be directly addressed. This study used ultra-high-field 7 tesla functional MRI (fMRI) to accurately resolve differences in brainstem circuitry present during the generation of placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia in healthy human participants (<I>N</I> = 25, 12 male). Over 2 successive days, through blinded application of altered thermal stimuli, participants were deceptively conditioned to believe that two inert creams labeled lidocaine (placebo) and capsaicin (nocebo) were acting to modulate their pain relative to a third Vaseline (control) cream. In a subsequent test phase, fMRI image sets were collected while participants were given identical noxious stimuli to all three cream sites. Pain intensity ratings were collected and placebo and nocebo responses determined. Brainstem-specific fMRI analysis revealed altered activity in key pain modulatory nuclei, including a disparate recruitment of the periaqueductal gray (PAG)&ndash;rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) pathway when both greater placebo and nocebo effects were observed. Additionally, we found that placebo and nocebo responses differentially activated the parabrachial nucleus but overlapped in engagement of the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. These data reveal that placebo and nocebo effects are generated through differential engagement of the PAG&ndash;RVM pathway, which in concert with other brainstem sites likely influences the experience of pain by modulating activity at the level of the dorsal horn.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding endogenous pain modulatory mechanisms would support development of effective clinical treatment strategies for both acute and chronic pain. Specific brainstem nuclei have long been known to play a central role in nociceptive modulation; however, because of the small size and complex organization of the nuclei, previous neuroimaging efforts have been limited in directly identifying how these subcortical networks interact during the development of antinociceptive and pro-nociceptive effects. We used ultra-high-field fMRI to resolve brainstem structures and measure signal change during placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia. We define overlapping and disparate brainstem circuitry responsible for altering pain perception. These findings extend our understanding of the detailed organization and function of discrete brainstem nuclei involved in pain processing and modulation.</p>
