              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Non-canonical function of an Hif-1α splice variant contributes to the sustained flight of locusts</a></h4>

              
                The hypoxia inducible factor (Hif) pathway is functionally conserved across metazoans in modulating cellular adaptations to hypoxia. However, the functions of this pathway under aerobic physiological conditions are rarely investigated. Here, we show that Hif-1α2, a locust Hif-1α isoform, does not induce canonical hypoxic responses but functions as a specific regulator of locust flight, which is a completely aerobic physiological process. Two Hif-1α splice variants were identified in locusts, a ubiquitously expressed Hif-1α1 and a muscle-predominantly expressed Hif-1α2. Hif-1α1 that induces typical hypoxic responses upon hypoxia exposure remains inactive during flight. By contrast, the expression of Hif-1α2, which lacks C-terminal transactivation domain, is less sensitive to oxygen tension but induced extensively by flying. Hif-1α2 regulates physiological processes involved in glucose metabolism and antioxidation during flight and sustains flight endurance by maintaining redox homeostasis through upregulating the production of a reactive oxygen species (ROS) quencher, DJ-1. Overall, this study reveals a novel Hif-mediated mechanism underlying prolonged aerobic physiological activity.

                <b>Background:</b> Young people living with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) are at increased risk of schizophrenia, intellectual disability, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In common with these conditions, 22q11.2DS is also associated with sleep problems. We investigated whether abnormal sleep or sleep-dependent network activity in 22q11.2DS reflects convergent, early signatures of neural circuit disruption also evident in associated neurodevelopmental conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nuclear fascin regulates cancer cell survival</a></h4>

              
                Fascin is an important regulator of F-actin bundling leading to enhanced filopodia assembly. Fascin is also overexpressed in most solid tumours where it supports invasion through control of F-actin structures at the periphery and nuclear envelope. Recently, fascin has been identified in the nucleus of a broad range of cell types but the contributions of nuclear fascin to cancer cell behaviour remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that fascin bundles F-actin within the nucleus to support chromatin organisation and efficient DDR. Fascin associates directly with phosphorylated Histone H3 leading to regulated levels of nuclear fascin to support these phenotypes. Forcing nuclear fascin accumulation through the expression of nuclear-targeted fascin-specific nanobodies or inhibition of Histone H3 kinases results in enhanced and sustained nuclear F-actin bundling leading to reduced invasion, viability, and nuclear fascin-specific/driven apoptosis. These findings represent an additional important route through which fascin can support tumourigenesis and provide insight into potential pathways for targeted fascin-dependent cancer cell killing.

	<p>Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with poor academic performance also among university students. This relationship may be made more complex by comorbid conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mediating role of anxiety and depressive symptoms in the relationship between ADHD and academic performance. Data were drawn from the CAMPUS study (registration number: 0058642/21), an ongoing survey on university students&amp;amp;rsquo; mental health. Using a logit model, mediation analyses were carried out to test whether the relationship between ADHD symptoms (assessed by ASRS-5) and academic performance might be mediated by depressive (assessed by PHQ-9) and anxiety (assessed by GAD-7) symptoms. Our results showed that worse academic performance is associated with ADHD symptoms (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). However, about 24% of the overall association between ADHD symptoms and academic performance was mediated by depressive symptoms (indirect effect: 0.065, 95%CI 0.022; 0.100), whereas the contribution of anxiety symptoms to the model was not significant. Along with the association between ADHD symptoms and poor academic performance, our findings highlight the key mediating role of depressive symptoms, which may be targeted with tailored support, ultimately improving both the academic performance and the well-being of university students with ADHD.</p>

	<p>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a growth factor that regulates T-cell autocrine secretion and has long been considered to be closely related to immune response. With the advance in neuroinflammation theory and immunology research on schizophrenia, it is interesting and meaningful to discuss the possible role of IL-2 in schizophrenia. Here, we reviewed a series of studies published from the 1990s and found that IL-2 was closely associated with schizophrenia. For example, IL-2 is responsible for mediating toxic reactions, which are the causes of schizophrenia symptoms in patients, and such symptoms resolve after discontinuation of the drug. In addition, we focused on the changes of IL-2 in the onset, progression and treatment of schizophrenia and the possible mechanisms by which IL-2 affects schizophrenia. Our review suggests that IL-2 is associated with schizophrenia and plays a role in its pathogenesis, and progression IL-2 and sIL-2R could serve as potential biomarkers of schizophrenia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Behavioral Forgetting of Olfactory Learning Is Mediated by Interneuron-Regulated Network Plasticity in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Forgetting is important for animals to manage acquired memories to enable adaptation to changing environments; however, the neural network in mechanisms of forgetting is not fully understood. To understand the mechanisms underlying forgetting, we examined olfactory adaptation, a form of associative learning, in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>. The forgetting of diacetyl olfactory adaptation in <I>C. elegans</I> is regulated by secreted signals from AWC sensory neurons via the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway. These signals cause a decline of the sensory memory trace in AWA neurons, where diacetyl is mainly sensed. To further understand the neural network that regulates this forgetting, we investigated the function of interneurons downstream of AWA and AWC neurons. We found that a pair of interneurons, AIA, is indispensable for the proper regulation of behavioral forgetting of diacetyl olfactory adaptation. Loss or inactivation of AIA caused the impairment of the chemotaxis recovery after adaptation without causing severe chemotaxis defects in the naive animal. AWA Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging analyses suggested that loss or inactivation of AIA interneurons did not affect the decline of the sensory memory trace after the recovery. Furthermore, AIA responses to diacetyl were observed in naive animals and after the recovery, but not just after the conditioning, suggesting that AIA responses after the recovery are required for the chemotaxis to diacetyl. We propose that the functional neuronal circuit for attractive chemotaxis to diacetyl is changed temporally at the recovery phase so that AIA interneurons are required for chemotaxis, although AIAs are dispensable for attractive chemotaxis to diacetyl in naive animals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Coordination between Eye Movement and Whisking in Head-Fixed Mice Navigating a Plus Maze</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Navigation through complex environments requires motor planning, motor preparation, and the coordination between multiple sensory&ndash;motor modalities. For example, the stepping motion when we walk is coordinated with motion of the torso, arms, head, and eyes. In rodents, movement of the animal through the environment is coordinated with whisking. Even head-fixed mice navigating a plus maze position their whiskers asymmetrically with the bilateral asymmetry signifying the upcoming turn direction. Here we report that, in addition to moving their whiskers, on every trial mice also move their eyes conjugately in the direction of the upcoming turn. Not only do mice move their eyes, but they coordinate saccadic eye movement with the asymmetric positioning of the whiskers. Our analysis shows that asymmetric positioning of whiskers predicted the turn direction that mice will make at an earlier stage than eye movement. Consistent with these results, our observations also revealed that whisker asymmetry increases before saccadic eye movement. Importantly, this work shows that when rodents plan for active behavior, their motor plans can involve both eye and whisker movement. We conclude that, when mice are engaged in and moving through complex real-world environments, their behavioral state can be read out in the movement of both their whiskers and eyes.</p>

                <p>by Elena Piretto, Gianluca Selvaggio, Damiano Bragantini, Enrico Domenici, Luca Marchetti</p>

In this paper, a logical-based mathematical model of the cellular pathways involved in the COVID-19 infection has been developed to study various drug treatments (single or in combination), in different illness scenarios, providing insights into their mechanisms of action. Drug simulations suggest that the effects of single drugs are limited, or depending on the scenario counterproductive, whereas better results appear combining different treatments. Specifically, the combination of the anti-inflammatory Baricitinib and the anti-viral Remdesivir showed significant benefits while a stronger efficacy emerged from the triple combination of Baricitinib, Remdesivir, and the corticosteroid Dexamethasone. Together with a sensitivity analysis, we performed an analysis of the mechanisms of the drugs to reveal their impact on molecular pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mapping of promoter usage QTL using RNA-seq data reveals their contributions to complex traits</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Naoto Kubota, Mikita Suyama</p>

Genomic variations are associated with gene expression levels, which are called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Most eQTL may affect the total gene expression levels by regulating transcriptional activities of a specific promoter. However, the direct exploration of genomic loci associated with promoter activities using RNA-seq data has been challenging because eQTL analyses treat the total expression levels estimated by summing those of all isoforms transcribed from distinct promoters. Here we propose a new method for identifying genomic loci associated with promoter activities, called promoter usage quantitative trait loci (puQTL), using conventional RNA-seq data. By leveraging public RNA-seq datasets from the lymphoblastoid cell lines of 438 individuals from the GEUVADIS project, we obtained promoter activity estimates and mapped 2,592 puQTL at the 10% FDR level. The results of puQTL mapping enabled us to interpret the manner in which genomic variations regulate gene expression. We found that 310 puQTL genes (16.1%) were not detected by eQTL analysis, suggesting that our pipeline can identify novel variant–gene associations. Furthermore, we identified genomic loci associated with the activity of “hidden” promoters, which the standard eQTL studies have ignored. We found that most puQTL signals were concordant with at least one genome-wide association study (GWAS) signal, enabling novel interpretations of the molecular mechanisms of complex traits. Our results emphasize the importance of the re-analysis of public RNA-seq datasets to obtain novel insights into gene regulation by genomic variations and their contributions to complex traits.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Accounting for multiple imputation-induced variability for differential analysis in mass spectrometry-based label-free quantitative proteomics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marie Chion, Christine Carapito, Frédéric Bertrand</p>

Imputing missing values is common practice in label-free quantitative proteomics. Imputation aims at replacing a missing value with a user-defined one. However, the imputation itself may not be optimally considered downstream of the imputation process, as imputed datasets are often considered as if they had always been complete. Hence, the uncertainty due to the imputation is not adequately taken into account. We provide a rigorous multiple imputation strategy, leading to a less biased estimation of the parameters’ variability thanks to Rubin’s rules. The imputation-based peptide’s intensities’ variance estimator is then moderated using Bayesian hierarchical models. This estimator is finally included in moderated <i>t</i>-test statistics to provide differential analyses results. This workflow can be used both at peptide and protein-level in quantification datasets. Indeed, an aggregation step is included for protein-level results based on peptide-level quantification data. Our methodology, named mi4p, was compared to the state-of-the-art limma workflow implemented in the DAPAR R package, both on simulated and real datasets. We observed a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, while the overall performance of mi4p outperforms DAPAR in terms of <i>F</i>-Score.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A multi-objective based clustering for inferring BCR clonal lineages from high-throughput B cell repertoire data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nika Abdollahi, Lucile Jeusset, Anne Langlois De Septenville, Hugues Ripoche, Frédéric Davi, Juliana Silva Bernardes</p>

The adaptive B cell response is driven by the expansion, somatic hypermutation, and selection of B cell clonal lineages. A high number of clonal lineages in a B cell population indicates a highly diverse repertoire, while clonal size distribution and sequence diversity antigen selective pressure. Identifying clonal lineages is fundamental to many repertoire studies, including repertoire comparisons, clonal tracking, and statistical analysis. Several methods have been developed to group sequences from high-throughput B cell repertoire data. Current methods use clustering algorithms to group clonally-related sequences based on their similarities or distances. Such approaches create groups by optimizing a single objective that typically minimizes intra-clonal distances. However, optimizing several objective functions can be advantageous and boost the algorithm convergence rate. Here we propose a new method based on multi-objective clustering. Our approach requires V(D)J annotations to obtain the initial groups and iteratively applies two objective functions that optimize cohesion and separation within clonal lineages simultaneously. We show that our method greatly improves clonal lineage grouping on simulated benchmarks with varied mutation rates compared to other tools. When applied to experimental repertoires generated from high-throughput sequencing, its clustering results are comparable to the most performing tools and can reproduce the results of previous publications. The method based on multi-objective clustering can accurately identify clonally-related antibody sequences and presents the lowest running time among state-of-art tools. All these features constitute an attractive option for repertoire analysis, particularly in the clinical context. MobiLLe can potentially help unravel the mechanisms involved in developing and evolving B cell malignancies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A simple model of the attentional blink and its modulation by mental training</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nadav Amir, Naftali Tishby, Israel Nelken</p>

The attentional blink (AB) effect is the reduced probability of reporting a second target (T2) that appears shortly after a first one (T1) within a rapidly presented sequence of distractors. The AB effect has been shown to be reduced following intensive mental training in the form of mindfulness meditation, with a corresponding reduction in T1-evoked P3b brain potentials. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. We propose a dynamical-systems model of the AB, in which attentional load is described as the response of a dynamical system to incoming impulse signals. Non-task related mental activity is represented by additive noise modulated by meditation. The model provides a parsimonious computational framework relating behavioral performance, evoked brain potentials and training through the concept of reduced mental noise.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multiscale modelling of desquamation in the interfollicular epidermis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Claire Miller, Edmund Crampin, James M. Osborne</p>

Maintenance of epidermal thickness is critical to the barrier function of the skin. Decreased tissue thickness, specifically in the stratum corneum (the outermost layer of the tissue), causes discomfort and inflammation, and is related to several severe diseases of the tissue. In order to maintain both stratum corneum thickness and overall tissue thickness it is necessary for the system to balance cell proliferation and cell loss. Cell proliferation in the epidermis occurs in the basal layer and causes constant upwards movement in the tissue. Cell loss occurs when dead cells at the top of the tissue are lost to the environment through a process called desquamation. Desquamation is thought to occur through a gradual reduction in adhesion between cells, due to the cleaving of adhesion proteins by enzymes, in the stratum corneum.
In this paper we will investigate combining a (mass action) subcellular model of desquamation with a three dimensional (cell centre based) multicellular model of the interfollicular epidermis to better understand maintenance of epidermal thickness. Specifically, our aim is to determine if a hypothesised biological model for the degradation of cell-cell adhesion, from the literature, is sufficient to maintain a steady state tissue thickness. These investigations show the model is able to provide a consistent rate of cell loss in the multicellular model. This loss balances proliferation, and hence maintains a homeostatic tissue thickness. Moreover, we find that multiple proliferative cell populations in the basal layer can be represented by a single proliferative cell population, simplifying investigations with this model.
The model is used to investigate a disorder (Netherton Syndrome) which disrupts desquamation. The model shows how biochemical changes can cause disruptions to the tissue, resulting in a reduced tissue thickness and consequently diminishing the protective role of the tissue. A hypothetical treatment result is also investigated: we compare the cases of a partially effective homogeneous treatment (where all cells partially recover) and a totally effective heterogeneous treatment (in which a proportion of the cells totally recover) with the aim to determine the difference in the response of the tissue to these different scenarios. Results show an increased benefit to corneum thickness from the heterogeneous treatment over the homogeneous treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cross-fitted instrument: A blueprint for one-sample Mendelian randomization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by William R. P. Denault, Jon Bohlin, Christian M. Page, Stephen Burgess, Astanand Jugessur</p>

Bias from weak instruments may undermine the ability to estimate causal effects in instrumental variable regression (IVR). We present here a new approach to handling weak instrument bias through the application of a new type of instrumental variable coined ‘Cross-Fitted Instrument’ (CFI). CFI splits the data at random and estimates the impact of the instrument on the exposure in each partition. These estimates are then used to perform an IVR on each partition. We adapt CFI to the Mendelian randomization (MR) setting and term this adaptation ‘Cross-Fitting for Mendelian Randomization’ (CFMR). We show that, even when using weak instruments, CFMR is, at worst, biased towards the null, which makes it a conservative one-sample MR approach. In particular, CFMR remains conservative even when the two samples used to perform the MR analysis completely overlap, whereas current state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., MR RAPS) display substantial bias in this setting. Another major advantage of CFMR lies in its use of all of the available data to select genetic instruments, which maximizes statistical power, as opposed to traditional two-sample MR where only part of the data is used to select the instrument. Consequently, CFMR is able to enhance statistical power in consortia-led meta-analyses by enabling a conservative one-sample MR to be performed in each cohort prior to a meta-analysis of the results across all the cohorts. In addition, CFMR enables a cross-ethnic MR analysis by accounting for ethnic heterogeneity, which is particularly important in meta-analyses where the participating cohorts may have different ethnicities. To our knowledge, none of the current MR approaches can account for such heterogeneity. Finally, CFMR enables the application of MR to exposures that are either rare or difficult to measure, which would normally preclude their analysis in the regular two-sample MR setting.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The Madeira cockroach <i>Rhyparobia maderae</i> is a nocturnal insect and a prominent model organism for the study of circadian rhythms. Its master circadian clock, controlling circadian locomotor activity and sleep–wake cycles, is located in the accessory medulla of the optic lobe. For a better understanding of brain regions controlled by the circadian clock and brain organization of this insect in general, we created a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of all neuropils of the cerebral ganglia based on anti-synapsin and anti-γ-aminobutyric acid immunolabeling of whole mount brains. Forty-nine major neuropils were identified and three-dimensionally reconstructed. Single-cell dye fills complement the data and provide evidence for distinct subdivisions of certain brain areas. Most neuropils defined in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> could be distinguished in the cockroach as well. However, some neuropils identified in the fruit fly do not exist as distinct entities in the cockroach while others are lacking in the fruit fly. In addition to neuropils, major fiber systems, tracts, and commissures were reconstructed and served as important landmarks separating brain areas. Being a nocturnal insect, <i>R. maderae</i> is an important new species to the growing collection of 3D insect brain atlases and only the second hemimetabolous insect, for which a detailed 3D brain atlas is available. This atlas will be highly valuable for an evolutionary comparison of insect brain organization and will greatly facilitate addressing brain areas that are supervised by the circadian clock.</p>

<p>Development of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins in the PGN of the cat.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The thalamic reticular nucleus receives axons from the thalamic sensory nuclei and the cerebral cortex. The visual part of this nucleus in carnivores is the perigeniculate nucleus located dorsal to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The perigeniculate nucleus participates in the modulation of visual processing and in the transition of synchronized slow rhythmicity during sleep into desynchronized high-frequency activity during arousal and consists of inhibitory neurons. The main neurochemical markers for perigeniculate neurons are glutamic acid decarboxylase and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein parvalbumin. Previous studies of postnatal development focused on the morphological features of the perigeniculate nucleus; however, its neurochemistry remains poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the postnatal development of perigeniculate neurons using immunohistochemical labeling of parvalbumin, two related Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins (calretinin and calbindin), glutamic acid decarboxylase, and a common neuronal protein, NeuN, in kittens that were 0–123 days old and in adult cats. In parallel with the well-known dominant neuronal populations expressing parvalbumin and GAD67 and persisting until adulthood, transient populations expressing calretinin and calbindin were observed. The calbindin-positive neurons were similar to the main perigeniculate population and showed close morphological features and parvalbumin coexpression. In contrast, the calretinin-positive neurons differed in their morphological characteristics and did not express GAD67, thus distinguishing them from the majority of perigeniculate neurons. A possible link between these populations was revealed, and the development of thalamocortical processing is discussed.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptide S (NPS) increases wakefulness. A small number of neurons in the brainstem express <i>Nps</i>. These neurons are located in or near the parabrachial nucleus (PB), but we know very little about their ontogeny, connectivity, and function. To identify <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons within the molecular framework of the PB region, we used in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and Cre-reporter labeling in mice. The primary concentration of <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons borders the lateral lemniscus at far-rostral levels of the lateral PB. Caudal to this main cluster, <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons scatter through the PB and form a secondary concentration medial to the locus coeruleus (LC). Most <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons in the PB region are <i>Atoh1</i>-derived, <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing, and mutually exclusive with neurons expressing <i>Calca</i> or <i>Lmx1b</i>. Among <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing PB neurons, those expressing <i>Nps</i> are distinct from intermingled subsets expressing <i>Cck</i> or <i>Pdyn</i>. Examining <i>Nps</i> Cre-reporter expression throughout the brain identified novel populations of neurons in the nucleus incertus, anterior hypothalamus, and lateral habenula. This information will help focus experimental questions about the connectivity and function of NPS neurons.</p>

                Safavi et al. propose a value-based decision-theoretic framework for perceptual multistability. This synergizes with previous Helmholtzian accounts of perception and also offers a more comprehensive computational and algorithmic treatment of perceptual dynamics in healthy and psychiatric populations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parallel cognitive maps for short-term statistical and long-term semantic relationships in the hippocampal formation</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampal-entorhinal system uses cognitive maps to represent spatial knowledge and other types of relational information, such as the transition probabilities between objects. However, objects can often be characterized in terms of different types of relations simultaneously, e.g. semantic similarities learned over the course of a lifetime as well as transitions experienced over a brief timeframe in an experimental setting. Here we ask how the hippocampal formation handles the embedding of stimuli in multiple relational structures that differ vastly in terms of their mode and timescale of acquisition: Does it integrate the different stimulus dimensions into one conjunctive map, or is each dimension represented in a parallel map? To this end, we reanalyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from Garvert et al. (2017) that had previously revealed an entorhinal map which coded for newly learnt statistical regularities. We used a triplet odd-one-out task to construct a semantic distance matrix for presented items and applied fMRI adaptation analysis to show that the degree of similarity of representations in bilateral hippocampus decreases as a function of semantic distance between presented objects. Importantly, while both maps localize to the hippocampal formation, this semantic map is anatomically distinct from the originally described entorhinal map. This finding supports the idea that the hippocampal-entorhinal system forms parallel cognitive maps reflecting the embedding of objects in diverse relational structures.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Locus Coeruleus firing patterns selectively modulate brain activity and dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Noradrenaline (NA) release from the brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) changes activity and connectivity in neuronal networks across the brain, thus modulating multiple behavioural states. NA release is mediated by both tonic and burst-like neuronal LC activity. However, it remains unknown whether the functional changes in downstream projection areas depend on these firing patterns. Using optogenetics, pupillometry, photometry, and functional MRI in mice, we show that tonic and burst LC firing patterns elicit brain responses that are specific to the activation frequency and temporal pattern. Tonic activation of the LC evokes nonlinear responses in prefrontal, limbic, and cerebellar regions, in line with the proposed inverted-U relationship between LC activity and behaviour. We further demonstrate that LC activity enhances network integration and acts as a facilitator of brain state transitions, hence increasing brain flexibility. Together, these findings reveal how the LC-NA system achieves a nuanced regulation of global circuit operations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The neural signature of magnitude integration between time and numerosity</a></h4>

              
                Magnitude dimensions such as time and numerosity are fundamental components of our visual experience, allowing us to understand the environment and interact with it. Different magnitudes are however not processed independently from each other, but show a relationship whereby the perception of one dimension depends on the others (magnitude integration). In this study, we use electroencephalography (EEG) to address whether such integration may arise from a shared brain processing stage where different dimensions are integrated together, or from independent parallel processes interfering with each other. In the experiment, participants judged either the average numerosity or duration of dynamic dot-array stimuli concurrently modulated in both dimensions. First, the behavioural results show a magnitude integration effect in both tasks, with duration affecting the judgement of numerosity and vice versa. The EEG results further show that both numerosity and duration significantly modulate event-related potentials at several distinct latencies. Crucially, however, we identified a significant interaction between numerosity and duration emerging in a specific latency window (360-460 ms) irrespective of the task performed by participants. In this latency window, the modulation of ERPs provided by the interfering magnitude dimension can be predicted by the strength of the behavioural bias. Our results thus support the idea of different magnitude dimensions converging onto a shared perceptual processing stage mediating their integration. Overall, our results demonstrate a clear electrophysiological signature of magnitude integration between numerosity and time, and provide new evidence for a shared representational system encompassing different magnitude dimensions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parallel streams of raphe VGLUT3-positive inputs target the dorsal and ventral hippocampus in each hemisphere.</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus (HP) receives neurochemically diverse inputs from the raphe nuclei, including glutamatergic fibers characterized by the expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3. These raphe-HP VGLUT3 (VGLUT3HP) projections have been suggested to play a critical role in HP functions, yet a complete anatomical overview of raphe VGLUT3 projections to the forebrain, and in particular the HP, is lacking. Using anterograde viral tracing, we describe largely non-overlapping VGLUT3-positive projections from the dorsal raphe (DR) and median raphe (MnR) to the forebrain, with the HP receiving inputs from the MnR. A limited subset of forebrain regions such as the amygdaloid complex, claustrum and hypothalamus receive projections from both the DR and MnR that remain largely segregated. This highly complementary anatomical pattern suggests contrasting roles for DR and MnR VGLUT3 neurons. To further analyse the topography of VGLUT3 raphe projections to the HP, we used retrograde tracing and found that VGLUT3HP neurons distribute over several raphe sub-regions (including the MnR, paramedian raphe and B9 nucleus) and lack co-expression of serotonergic markers. Strikingly, two-color retrograde tracing unraveled two parallel streams of VGLUT3-positive projections targeting the dorsal and ventral poles of the HP. These results demonstrate highly organized and segregated VGLUT3-positive projections to the HP, suggesting independent modulation of HP functions such as spatial memory and emotion-related behavior.

                Cellular inclusions of hyperphosphorylated TAR-DNA-Binding Protein 43 (TDP-43) are a key hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). ALS is characterised by a loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord that is preceded by early-stage changes in synaptic function that may be associated with TDP-43 pathology. However, there has been little characterisation of the synaptic expression of TDP-43 in spinal cord synapses. This study utilises a range of high-resolution and super-resolution microscopy techniques with immunolabelling, as well as an aptamer-based TDP-43 labelling strategy visualised with single-molecule localisation microscopy, to characterise and quantify the presence of phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) in spinal cord synapses. We observe that TDP-43 is expressed in the majority of spinal cord synapses as nanoscale clusters as small as 60 nm in diameter. Synaptic TDP-43 expression is more frequently associated with presynaptic terminals than postsynaptic densities, and is more enriched in VGLUT1-associated synapses, compared to VGLUT2-associated synapses. Our nanoscopy techniques showed no difference in the subsynaptic expression of pTDP-43 in the ALS mouse model, SOD1G93a compared to healthy controls. This research characterizes the basic synaptic expression of TDP-43 with nanoscale precision and provides a framework with which to investigate the potential relationship between TDP-43 pathology and synaptic pathology in neurodegenerative diseases.

                In aging cells and animal models of premature aging, heterochromatin loss coincides with the transcriptional activation of normally silenced endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Here we show that loss of heterochromatin maintenance and de-repression of ERVs results in neurodegeneration via the Complement cascade in an age dependent manner. We discovered differential contributions of HP1 proteins to ERV silencing where HP1{gamma} is necessary and sufficient for H4K20me3 deposition and HP1{beta} deficiency is detrimental to DNA maintenance methylation. Progressive ERV de-repression in HP1{beta}/{gamma} DKO mice was followed by stimulation of the integrated stress response, the induction of Complement 3+ reactive astrocytes and increased infiltration and activation of microglia. This chronic inflammatory state coincided with age-dependent reductions in dendrite complexity and cognition. Our results demonstrate the importance of preventing loss of epigenetic maintenance, as this will be the only way postmitotic neuronal genomes can be protected and/or renewed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Circadian distribution of epileptiform discharges in epilepsy: candidate mechanisms of variability</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder characterised by a tendency to have recurrent, spontaneous, seizures. Classically, seizures are assumed to occur at random. However, recent research has uncovered underlying rhythms both in seizures and in key signatures of epilepsy - so-called interictal epileptiform activity - with timescales that vary from hours and days through to months. Understanding the physiological mechanisms that determine these rhythmic patterns of epileptiform discharges remains an open question. Many people with epilepsy identify precipitants of their seizures, the most common of which include stress, sleep deprivation and fatigue. To quantify the impact of these physiological factors, we analysed 24-hour EEG recordings from a cohort of 107 people with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. We found two subgroups with distinct distributions of epileptiform discharges: one with highest incidence during sleep and the other during day-time. We interrogated these data using a mathematical model that describes the transitions between background and epileptiform activity in large-scale brain networks. This model was extended to include a time-dependent forcing term, where the excitability of nodes within the network could be modulated by other factors. We calibrated this forcing term using independently-collected human cortisol (the primary stress-responsive hormone characterised by circadian and ultradian patterns of secretion) data and sleep-staged EEG from healthy human participants. We found that either the dynamics of cortisol or sleep stage transition, or a combination of both, could explain most of the observed distributions of epileptiform discharges. Our findings provide conceptual evidence for the existence of underlying physiological drivers of rhythms of epileptiform discharges. These findings should motivate future research to explore these mechanisms in carefully designed experiments using animal models or people with epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Small Training Dataset Convolutional Neural Networks for Application Specific Super-Resolution Microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Machine learning (ML) models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to significantly increase microscopy resolution, speed (signal-to-noise ratio), and data interpretation. The bottleneck in developing effective ML systems is often the need to acquire large datasets to train the neural network. This paper demonstrates how adding a dense encoder-decoder block can be useful to effectively train a CNN that provides super-resolution images from conventional diffraction-limited microscopy images when trained using a small dataset containing 15 field-of-views (FOVs). DenseED blocks use a dense layer that concatenates features from the previous convolutional layer to the next convolutional layer. Demonstrate using DenseED blocks in fully convolutional networks (FCNs) to estimate the super-resolution images when trained with a small training dataset (15 FOVs) of human cells from the Widefield2SIM dataset and the fluorescent-labeled fixed bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAE samples). Conventional ML models without DenseED blocks trained on small datasets fail to accurately estimate super-resolution images while models, including the DenseED blocks can. The average resolution and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) improvements achieved using DenseED blocks in FCNs when trained with 15 FOVs are 2 times and ~3.2 dB, respectively. In addition, we evaluated various configurations of target image generation methods (experimentally captured target and computationally generated target) that are used to train the FCNs with and without DenseED blocks and showed with DenseED blocks outperform compared to simple FCNs without DenseED blocks. Hence, the proposed approach indicates that microscopy applications can use DenseED blocks to train on smaller datasets that are application specific/experimental modality specific imaging platforms such as MRI/X-ray and other in vivo imaging modalities.

                The sense of body ownership, defined as the sensation that one's body belongs to oneself, is a fundamental component of bodily self-consciousness. Several studies have shown the importance of multisensory integration for the emergence of the sense of body ownership, together with the involvement of the parieto-premotor and extrastriate cortices in bodily awareness. However, whether the sense of body ownership elicited by different sources of signal, especially visuotactile and visuomotor inputs, is represented by common neural patterns remains to be elucidated. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the existence of neural correlates of the sense of body ownership independent of the sensory modalities. Participants received tactile stimulation or executed finger movements while given synchronous and asynchronous visual feedback of their hand. We used multi-voxel patterns analysis (MVPA) to decode the synchronous and asynchronous conditions with cross-classification between two modalities: the classifier was first trained in the visuotactile sessions and then tested in the visuomotor sessions and vice versa. Regions of interest-based and searchlight analyses revealed significant above-chance cross-classification accuracies in the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS), the bilateral ventral premotor cortex (PMv), and the left extrastriate body area (EBA). Moreover, we observed a significant positive correlation between the cross-classification accuracy in the left PMv and the difference in subjective ratings of the sense of body ownership between the synchronous and asynchronous conditions. Our findings revealed the neural representations of the sense of body ownership in the IPS, PMv, and EBA that is invariant to the sensory modalities.

                Many mental illnesses are accompanied by abnormal risk-avoidance behavior, yet we have only a limited understanding of the neuronal regulatory mechanisms involved. We previously established an inducible DISC1-N terminal fragment transgenic mouse (DISC1-NTM) model which has exhibited risk-avoidance deficiency. Using this model, we analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using snRNA-seq and the results indicate impaired neuron-astrocyte interactions. We used optogenetic tools to modulate astrocytes in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and found that ChR2-expressing astrocytes were able to rescue risk-avoidance impairment in DISC1-NTM mice. Using patch clamp recordings combined with signal-cell qPCR, we found impaired excitability of BLAWFS1 neurons in DISC1-NTM mice and that ChR2-expressing astrocytes can induce action potentials (APs) in WFS1 neurons, which restores WFS1 neuronal activity. WFS1 neurons are necessary for BLA astrocytes to modulate impaired risk-avoidance behavior. These finding provide new insights into mechanisms of astrocyte-neuron interactions and suggest that BLA astrocytes may be a promising target for impaired risk avoidance in mental illness.

                Recent work indicates that pupil-linked phasic arousal signals reduce the impact of prior expectations and biases on decision formation. It has remained unclear whether phasic arousal (i) causes the bias reduction, if (ii) choosing against one's bias causes phasic arousal, or if (iii) a third variable is driving both. Here, using an auditory accessory stimulus, we found evidence for the first scenario: on accessory stimulus vs normal trials, pupil-linked phasic arousal was robustly elevated and choice bias was reduced. With computational modeling of behavior, we established that the bias reduction was not due to a change in response caution (i.e., speed-accuracy tradeoff), but due to a change in a bias in the accumulation of evidence leading up to a choice. Thus, pupil-linked phasic arousal shapes choice behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">LSD-induced increase of Ising temperature and algorithmic complexity of brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                A topic of growing interest in computational neuroscience is the discovery of fundamental principles underlying global dynamics and self-organization of the brain. Statistical physics offers powerful tools to analyze complex many-body systems and has delivered computational models such as the generalized Ising model, one of the simplest known systems displaying phase transitions. Prior work has shown that different brain states may be mapped into pairwise maximum entropy Ising models at varying distances from the critical temperature. Here, we use this framework to analyze resting state fMRI BOLD data collected in an earlier study from fifteen subjects in a control condition (placebo) and during psychedelic ingestion (LSD). We first parcellate the data in AAL space and, to address the limited quantity of data available from typical fMRI BOLD studies, we create an "archetype" pairwise maximum entropy or Ising model representative of the entire dataset. The archetype model is then personalized for each individual and condition through an adjustment of the system temperature. We analyze the resulting set of temperatures to show first that, at the group level and in both conditions, the model is near criticality but situated in the paramagnetic phase. Second, the individualized Ising temperature increases significantly under the effects of LSD compared with the placebo condition (p = 9 x 10-5). That is, LSD ingestion shifts the system away from the critical point between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases to a more disordered state. Next, we estimate the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) complexity of the binarized BOLD data (flattened along the spatial dimension first) for each participant and condition and of the synthetic data generated with the individualized model using the Metropolis algorithm. We find that the LZW complexity computed directly from experimental data reveals a weak statistical relationship with the condition (p = 0.04 one-tailed Wilcoxon test), and none with Ising temperature (r(13) = 0.13, p = 0.65), presumably due to the short length of the time series and group size. However, the LZW complexity computed using synthetic data from the personalized archetype model correlates strongly with individualized temperature (p = 2.7 x 10-6) and hence with condition (p = 9 x 10-5, one-tailed Wilcoxon test). We then explored the estimation of algorithmic complexity using the block decomposition method (BDM). The BDM complexity of the experimental data displayed a robust correlation with Ising temperature (r(13) = 0.56, p = 0.03) and a weak but significant correlation with condition (p = 0.04, one-tailed Wilcoxon test). We also calculated the BDM complexity of the synthetic data generated by the model, and it correlates strongly with Ising temperature (r(13) = 0.97, p = 8.9 x 10-10) and hence condition (p = 2 x 10-4, one-tailed Wilcoxon test). This study suggests, together with prior ones, that the effects of LSD increase the complexity of brain dynamics. In agreement with earlier work using the Ising formalism, we find the brain state in the placebo condition is already above the critical point, with LSD resulting in a shift away from criticality into a more disordered state.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A computational framework linking synaptic adaptation to circuit behaviors in the early visual system</a></h4>

              
                Retina ribbon synapses are the first synapses in the visual system. Unlike the conventional synapses in the central nervous system triggered by action potentials, ribbon synapses are uniquely driven by graded membrane potentials and are thought to transfer early sensory information faithfully. However, how ribbon synapses compress the visual signals and contribute to visual adaptation in retina circuits is less understood. To this end, we introduce a physiologically constrained module for the ribbon synapse, termed Ribbon Adaptive Block (RAB), and an extended "hierarchical Linear-Nonlinear-Synapse" (hLNS) framework for the retina circuit. Our models can elegantly reproduce a wide range of experimental recordings on synaptic and circuit-level adaptive behaviors across different cell types and species. In particular, it shows strong robustness to unseen stimulus protocols. Intriguingly, when using the hLNS framework to fit intra-cellular recordings from the retina circuit under stimuli similar to natural conditions, we revealed rich and diverse adaptive time constants of ribbon synapses. Furthermore, we predicted a frequency-sensitive gain-control strategy for the synapse between the photoreceptor and the CX bipolar cell, which differ from the classic contrast-based strategy in retina circuits. Overall, our framework provides a powerful analytical tool for exploring synaptic adaptation mechanisms in early sensory coding.

                Grid cells play a principal role in enabling mammalian cognitive representations of ambient environments. The key property of these cells---the regular arrangement of their firing fields---is commonly viewed as means for establishing spatial scales or encoding specific locations. However, using grid cells' spiking outputs for deducing spatial orderliness proves to be a strenuous task, due to fairly irregular activation patterns triggered by the animal's sporadic visits to the grid fields. The following discussion addresses statistical mechanisms enabling emergent regularity of grid cell firing activity, from the perspective of percolation theory. In particular, it is shown that the range of neurophysiological parameters required for spiking percolation phenomena matches experimental data, which points at biological viability of the percolation approach and casts a new light on the role of grid cells in organizing the hippocampal map.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Large-Scale ENIGMA Multisite Replication Study of Brain Age in Depression</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several studies have evaluated whether depressed persons have older appearing brains than their nondepressed peers. However, the estimated neuroimaging derived brain age gap has varied from study to study, likely driven by differences in training and testing sample (size), age range, and used modality/features. To validate our previously developed ENIGMA brain age model and the identified brain age gap, we aim to replicate the presence and effect size estimate previously found in the largest study in depression to date (N=2,126 controls & N=2,675 cases; +1.08 years [SE 0.22], Cohen's d=0.14, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.20), in independent cohorts that were not part of the original study. Methods: A previously trained brain age model (www.photon-ai.com/enigma_brainage) based on 77 FreeSurfer brain regions of interest was used to obtain unbiased brain age predictions in 751 controls and 766 persons with depression (18-75 years) from 13 new cohorts collected from 20 different scanners. Results: Our ENIGMA MDD brain age model generalized reasonably well to controls from the new cohorts (predicted age vs. age: r = 0.73, R2=0.47, MAE=7.50 years), although the performance varied from cohort to cohort. In these new cohorts, on average, depressed persons showed a significantly higher brain age gap of +1 year (SE 0.35) (Cohen's d=0.15, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.25) compared with controls, highly similar to our previous finding. Conclusions: This study further validates our previously developed ENIGMA brain age algorithm. Importantly, we replicated the brain age gap in depression with a comparable effect size. Thus, two large-scale independent mega-analyses across in total 32 cohorts and >3,400 patients and >2,800 controls worldwide show reliable but subtle effects of brain aging in adult depression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A low dimensional cognitive-network space in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia</a></h4>

              
                Network neuroscience is a promising approach to explore cognitive processes in neurological disorders. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) show network dysfunctions linked with cognitive deficits. Within this framework, network abnormalities between AD and FTD show both convergent and divergent patterns. However, these functional patterns are far from being established and their relevance to cognitive processes remains to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between cognition and functional connectivity of major cognitive networks in these diseases. Twenty-three bvFTD, 22 AD and 20 controls underwent cognitive evaluation and resting-state functional MRI. Principal component analysis was used to describe cognitive variance across participants. Brain network connectivity was estimated with connectome analysis. Connectivity matrices were created assessing correlations between parcels within each functional network. The following cognitive networks were considered: default mode (DMN), dorsal attention (DAN), ventral attention (VAN) and frontoparietal (FPN) networks. The relationship between cognition and connectivity was assessed using a robust convergent correlation-wise and interaction analyses. Three principal cognitive components explained more than 80% of the cognitive variance: the first component (cogPC1) loaded on memory, the second component (cogPC2) loaded on emotion and language, the third component (cogPC3) loaded on the visuo-spatial and attentional domains. Compared to HC, AD and bvFTD showed impairment in all cogPCs (p<0.002), and bvFTD scored worse than AD in cogPC2 (p=0.031). At the network level, the DMN showed a robust association in the whole group with cogPC1 and cogPC2, and the VAN with cogPC2. By contrast, DAN and FPN showed a divergent pattern between diagnosis and connectivity for cogPC2. We confirmed these results by means of a multivariate analysis (canonical correlation). These results suggest that a low-dimensional representation can account for a large variance in cognitive scores in the continuum from normal to pathological aging. Moreover, cognitive components showed both convergent and divergent patterns with connectivity across AD and bvFTD. The convergent pattern was observed across the networks primarily involved in these diseases (i.e., the DMN and VAN), while a divergent FC-cognitive pattern was mainly observed between attention/executive networks and the language/emotion cognitive component, suggesting the co-existence of compensatory and detrimental mechanisms underlying these components.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Local Field Potentials, Spiking Activity, and Receptive Fields in Human Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The concept of receptive field (RF) is central to sensory neuroscience. Neuronal RF properties have been substantially studied in animals, while those in humans remain nearly unexplored. Here, we measured neuronal RFs with intracranial local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity in human visual cortex (V1/V2/V3). We recorded LFPs via macro-contacts and discovered that RF sizes estimated from low-frequency activity (LFA, 0.5 to 30 Hz) were larger than those estimated from low-gamma activity (LGA, 30 to 60 Hz) and high-gamma activity (HGA, 60 to 150 Hz). We then took a rare opportunity to record LFPs and spiking activity via microwires in V1 simultaneously. We found that RF sizes and temporal profiles measured from LGA and HGA closely matched those from spiking activity. In sum, this study reveals that spiking activity of neurons in human visual cortex could be well approximated by LGA and HGA in RF estimation and temporal profile measurement, implying the pivotal functions of LGA and HGA in early visual information processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inflammation-induced mitochondrial and metabolic disturbances in sensory neurons control the switch from acute to chronic pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain often persists in patients with inflammatory diseases, even when the inflammation has subsided. The molecular mechanisms leading to this failure in resolution of inflammatory pain and the transition to chronic pain are poorly understood. Mitochondrial dysfunction in sensory neurons has been linked to chronic pain, but its role in resolution of inflammatory pain is unclear. Transient inflammation causes neuronal plasticity, called hyperalgesic priming, which impairs resolution of hyperalgesia induced by a subsequent inflammatory stimulus. We identified that hyperalgesic priming in mice caused disturbances in mitochondrial respiration, oxidative stress, and redox balance in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. Preventing these priming-induced disturbances restored resolution of inflammatory hyperalgesia. Concurrent with these mitochondrial and metabolic changes, the expression of ATPSc-KMT, a mitochondrial methyltransferase, was increased in DRG neurons in primed mice. ATPSc-KMT overexpression in DRG neurons of naive mice induced similar mitochondrial and metabolic changes as observed after priming, leading to failure in pain resolution. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, knockdown of ATPSCKMT expression, or NAD+ supplementation were sufficient to restore resolution of inflammatory pain and prevent chronic pain development. Thus, inflammation-induced mitochondrial-dependent disturbances in DRG neurons promote failure in inflammatory pain resolution and drive the transition to chronic pain.

	<p>Inflammatory reaction after ischemia-reperfusion contributes significantly to a worsened prognosis, and microglia activation is the main resource of inflammation in the nervous system. Targeting STAT5 has been shown to be a highly effective anti-inflammatory therapy; however, the mechanism by which the STAT5 signaling pathway regulates neuroinflammation following brain injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion remains unclear. Dauricine is an effective agent in anti-inflammation and neuroprotection, but the mechanism by which dauricine acts in ischemia-reperfusion remained unknown. This study is the first to find that the anti-inflammation mechanism of dauricine mainly occurs through the STAT5-NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B pathway and that it might act as a STAT5 inhibitor. Dauricine suppresses the inflammation caused by cytokines Eotaxin, KC, TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, IL-1&amp;amp;alpha;, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-6, IL-12&amp;amp;beta;, and IL-17&amp;amp;alpha;, as well as inhibiting microglia activation. The STAT5b mutant at Tyr-699 reverses the protective effect of dauricine on the oxygen-glucose deprivation-reperfusion injury of neurons and reactivates the P-NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B expression in microglia. These results suggest that dauricine might be able to suppress the neuroinflammation and protect the neurons from the injury of post-ischemia-reperfusion injury via mediating the microglia activation through the STAT5-NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B pathway. As a potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammation, STAT5 needs to be given further attention regarding its role in ischemic stroke.</p>

	<p>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide novel hands-free interaction strategies. However, the performance of BCIs is affected by the user&amp;amp;rsquo;s mental energy to some extent. In this study, we aimed to analyze the combined effects of decreased mental energy and lack of sleep on BCI performance and how to reduce these effects. We defined the low-mental-energy (LME) condition as a combined condition of decreased mental energy and lack of sleep. We used a long period of work (&amp;amp;gt;=18 h) to induce the LME condition, and then P300- and SSVEP-based BCI tasks were conducted in LME or normal conditions. Ten subjects were recruited in this study. Each subject participated in the LME- and normal-condition experiments within one week. For the P300-based BCI, we used two decoding algorithms: stepwise linear discriminant (SWLDA) and least square regression (LSR). For the SSVEP-based BCI, we used two decoding algorithms: canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and filter bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA). Accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR) were used as performance metrics. The experimental results showed that for the P300-based BCI, the average accuracy was reduced by approximately 35% (with a SWLDA classifier) and approximately 40% (with a LSR classifier); the average ITR was reduced by approximately 6 bits/min (with a SWLDA classifier) and approximately 7 bits/min (with an LSR classifier). For the SSVEP-based BCI, the average accuracy was reduced by approximately 40% (with a CCA classifier) and approximately 40% (with a FBCCA classifier); the average ITR was reduced by approximately 20 bits/min (with a CCA classifier) and approximately 19 bits/min (with a FBCCA classifier). Additionally, the amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio of the evoked electroencephalogram signals were lower in the LME condition, while the degree of fatigue and the task load of each subject were higher. Further experiments suggested that increasing stimulus size, flash duration, and flash number could improve BCI performance in LME conditions to some extent. Our experiments showed that the LME condition reduced BCI performance, the effects of LME on BCI did not rely on specific BCI types and specific decoding algorithms, and optimizing BCI parameters (e.g., stimulus size) can reduce these effects.</p>

	<p>Background: Mental disorders linked with dysfunction in the temporal cortex, such as anxiety and depression, can increase the morbidity and mortality of people living with HIV (PLWHA). Expressions of both nucleobindin 1 (NUCB1) and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) in the neurons have been found to alter in patients with depressive disorder, but whether it is involved in the development of depression in the context of HIV infection is unknown. Objectives To investigate the effects of NUCB1 on depressive disorder among PLWHA and preliminarily explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods: Individuals who were newly HIV diagnosed were assessed on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). Then SHIV-infected rhesus monkeys were used to investigate the possible involvement of the NUCB1 and the CNR1 protein in depression-like behavior. Results: The prevalence rate of depression among PLWHA was 27.33% (41/150). The mechanism results showing elevated NUCB1 levels in cerebrospinal fluid from HIV-infected patients suffering from depression were confirmed compared to those of HIV-infected patients. Moreover, the immunohistochemical analysis indicated the expression of NUCB1 in the temporal cortex neurons of SHIV-infected monkeys was higher than that of the healthy control. Conversely, CNR1 expression was down-regulated at protein levels. Conclusions: Depression symptoms are common among PLWHA and associate with NUCB1 expression increases, and NUCB1 may be a potential target for depression.</p>

                SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is known to be attenuated in laboratory animals. Liu et.al. here report that the Omicron variant spike protein enables virus to infect laboratory mice via its interaction with mouse ACE2. The attenuation of Omicron in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, however, is attributed to mutations outside the spike region.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Linking neuronal and hemodynamic network signatures in the resting human brain</a></h4>

              
                Despite several studies investigating the relationship between blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) and neuroelectric activity, our understanding is rather incomplete. For instance, the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) is commonly used, regardless of brain region, frequency of electric activity and functional networks. We studied this relationship between BOLD-fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG) signal of the human brain in detail using simultaneous fMRI and EEG in healthy awake human subjects at rest. Signals from EEG sensors were filtered into different frequency bands and projected into three-dimensional source space. The correlation of the time courses of the two modalities were quantified on a voxel-by-voxel basis on full-brain level as well as separately for each resting state network, with different temporal shifts and EEG frequency bands. We found highly significant correlations between the BOLD-fMRI signal and simultaneously measured EEG, yet with varying time-lags for different frequency bands and different resting state networks. Additionally, we found significant negative correlations with a much longer delay in the fMRI BOLD signal. The positive correlations were mostly around 6-8 seconds delayed in the BOLD time course while the negative correlations were noticed with a BOLD offset of around 20 to 26 seconds. These positive and negative correlation patterns included the commonly reported alpha and gamma bands but also extend in other frequency bands giving characteristic profiles for different resting state networks. Our results confirm recent works that suggest that the relationship between the two modalities is rather brain region / network-specific than a global function and suggest that applying a global canonical HRF for electrophysiological data is probably insufficient to account for the different spatial and temporal dynamics of different brain networks. Moreover, our results suggest that the HRF also varies in different frequency bands giving way to further studies investigating cross-frequency coupling and its interplay with resting state networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Boosting of neural circuit chaos at the onset of collective oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Cortical networks exhibit highly irregular spiking activity to repeated stimuli. One source of such variability is network chaos, ever-present in spiking network models. In order to reliably and robustly represent and transmit information, cortical networks must implement active mechanisms to quench undesired changes in spiking patterns. Neuronal oscillations have been proposed as a mechanism to flexibly gate information flow across the cortex, but whether these collective rhythms would actually contribute to quenching spiking unreliability and tame network chaos by synchronizing activity, or on the contrary, intensify chaos by acting as a common drive to the network, is not easily predictable. Here we investigate the dynamical properties of network models with respect to two known control parameters regulating collective oscillatory activity: delayed recurrent inhibition and an external periodic drive. To do so, we advanced the tractability of large spiking networks of exactly solvable neuronal models by developing a strategy that allows for exact characterization of the dynamics on the attractor of effectively delayed network models in a system with fixed and finite degrees of freedom. We find that, below the transition to collective oscillations, neuronal networks have a stereotypical dependence on the delay so far only described for scalar systems and low-dimensional maps. We demonstrate that the emergence of internally generated oscillations induces a complete dynamical reconfiguration, by increasing the dimensionality of the chaotic attractor, the speed at which nearby trajectories separate from one another, and the rate at which the network produces entropy. Our results suggest that simple temporal dynamics of the mean activity can have a profound effect on the structure of the spiking patterns and therefore on the information processing capability of neuronal networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Aging Differentially Affects Axonal Autophagosome Formation and Maturation</a></h4>

              
                Misregulation of neuronal autophagy has been implicated in age-related neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinsons disease and Huntingtons disease. We compared autophagosome formation and maturation in primary murine neurons during development and through aging to elucidate how aging affects neuronal autophagy. We observed an age-related decrease in the rate of formation of LC3B-positive autophagosomes leading to a significant decrease in the density of autophagosomes along the axon. Next, we assessed the maturation of autophagic vesicles and identified a surprising increase in their maturation in neurons from aged mice. While we did not detect notable changes in endolysosomal content in the distal axon during aging, we found that autophagic vesicles were transported more efficiently in neurons from adult mice than in neurons from young mice. This efficient transport of autophagic vesicles in both the distal and proximal axon is maintained in neurons from aged mice and indicates that aging alone does not impair transport nor negatively impact the later stages of autophagy. However, the pronounced deficit in autophagosome biogenesis in aged neurons may contribute to a decreased capacity to clear aggregated proteins or dysfunctional organelles and thus contribute to age-related degeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors in the gustatory cortex influence food intake</a></h4>

              
                The gustatory region of the insular cortex (GC) processes taste information in manners important for taste-guided behaviors, including food intake itself. In addition to oral gustatory stimuli, GC activity is also influenced by physiological states including hunger. The specific cell-types and molecular mechanisms that afford with GC with such influences on food intake are unclear. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is produced by neurons in the brain whereafter it can act upon GLP-1 receptor-expressing (GLP-1R+) neurons found in several brain regions. In these brain regions, GLP-1R agonism suppresses homeostatic food intake and dampens the hedonic value of food. Here, we report in mice of both sexes that cells within the GC express GLP-1R mRNA and further, by ex vivo brain slice recordings, that GC GLP-1R+ neurons are depolarized by the selective GLP-1R agonist, exendin-4 (Ex-4). Next we found that chemogenetic stimulation of GLP-1R+ neurons, and also pharmacological stimulation of GC-GLP-1Rs themselves, both reduced homeostatic food intake. When maintained on a high-fat diet, obese mice exhibited impaired food intake responses when Ex-4 was administered into the GC. Yet, when obese mice were switched to a low-fat diet, the effect of GC Ex-4 was restored, indicating that GC GLP-1R influences may depend upon palatability of the food. Together, these results provide evidence for a specific cell population in the GC which may hold roles in both homeostatic and hedonic food intake.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intrinsic neural excitability induces time-dependent overlap of memory engrams</a></h4>

              
                Memories are thought to be stored in neural ensembles known as engrams that are specifically reactivated during memory recall. Recent studies have found that memory engrams of two events that happened close in time tend to overlap in the hippocampus and the amygdala, and these overlaps have been shown to support memory linking. It has been hypothesised that engram overlaps arise from the mechanisms that regulate memory allocation itself, involving neural excitability, but the exact process remains unclear. Indeed, most theoretical studies focus on synaptic plasticity and little is known about the role of intrinsic plasticity, which could be mediated by neural excitability and serve as a complementary mechanism for forming memory engrams. Here, we developed a rate-based recurrent neural network that includes both synaptic plasticity and neural excitability. We obtained structural and functional overlap of memory engrams for contexts that are presented close in time, consistent with experimental studies. Moreover, we showed that enhancing the initial excitability of a subset of neurons just before presenting a context biases the memory allocation to these neurons. We then explored the role of inhibition as a way of controlling competition among neurons from two ensembles. This work suggests mechanisms underlying the role of intrinsic excitability in memory allocation and linking, and yields predictions regarding the dynamics of memory engrams.

	<p>Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between normal aging and probable Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. It is of great value to screen for MCI in the community. A novel machine learning (ML) model is composed of electroencephalography (EEG), eye tracking (ET), and neuropsychological assessments. This study has been proposed to identify MCI subjects from normal controls (NC). Methods: Two cohorts were used in this study. Cohort 1 as the training and validation group, includes184 MCI patients and 152 NC subjects. Cohort 2 as an independent test group, includes 44 MCI and 48 NC individuals. EEG, ET, Neuropsychological Tests Battery (NTB), and clinical variables with age, gender, educational level, MoCA-B, and ACE-R were selected for all subjects. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were adopted to evaluate the capabilities of this tool to classify MCI from NC. The clinical model, the EEG and ET model, and the neuropsychological model were compared. Results: We found that the classification accuracy of the proposed model achieved 84.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.43% and 88.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.59% in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively. The area under curve (AUC) of the proposed tool achieved 0.941 (0.893&amp;amp;ndash;0.982) in Cohort 1 and 0.966 (0.921&amp;amp;ndash;0.988) in Cohort 2, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed model incorporation of EEG, ET, and neuropsychological assessments yielded excellent classification performances, suggesting its potential for future application in cognitive decline prediction.</p>

	<p>A cochlear implant (CI) is currently the only FDA-approved biomedical device that can restore hearing for the majority of patients with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). While prelingually and postlingually deaf individuals benefit substantially from CI, the outcomes after implantation vary greatly. Numerous studies have attempted to study the variables that affect CI outcomes, including the personal characteristics of CI candidates, environmental variables, and device-related variables. Up to 80% of the results remained unexplainable because all these variables could only roughly predict auditory performance with a CI. Brain structure/function differences after hearing deprivation, that is, cortical reorganization, has gradually attracted the attention of neuroscientists. The cross-modal reorganization in the auditory cortex following deafness is thought to be a key factor in the success of CI. In recent years, the adaptive and maladaptive effects of this reorganization on CI rehabilitation have been argued because the neural mechanisms of how this reorganization impacts CI learning and rehabilitation have not been revealed. Due to the lack of brain processes describing how this plasticity affects CI learning and rehabilitation, the adaptive and deleterious consequences of this reorganization on CI outcomes have recently been the subject of debate. This review describes the evidence for different roles of cross-modal reorganization in CI performance and attempts to explore the possible reasons. Additionally, understanding the core influencing mechanism requires taking into account the cortical changes from deafness to hearing restoration. However, methodological issues have restricted longitudinal research on cortical function in CI. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been increasingly used for the study of brain function and language assessment in CI because of its unique advantages, which are considered to have great potential. Here, we review studies on auditory cortex reorganization in deaf patients and CI recipients, and then we try to illustrate the feasibility of fNIRS as a neuroimaging tool in predicting and assessing speech performance in CI recipients. Here, we review research on the cross-modal reorganization of the auditory cortex in deaf patients and CI recipients and seek to demonstrate the viability of using fNIRS as a neuroimaging technique to predict and evaluate speech function in CI recipients.</p>

	<p>It has been well established that very-high-altitude (&amp;amp;gt;4000 m) environments can affect human cognitive function and brain activity. However, the effects of long-term exposure to moderate altitudes (2000&amp;amp;ndash;3000 m) on cognitive function and brain activity are not well understood. In the present cross-sectional study, we utilized an N-back working memory task and resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy to examine the effects of two years of exposure to 2260 m altitude on working memory and resting-state brain activity in 208 college students, compared with a control group at the sea level. The results showed that there was no significant change in spatial working memory performance after two years of exposure to 2260 m altitude. In contrast, the analysis of resting-state brain activity revealed changes in functional connectivity patterns in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), with the global efficiency increased and the local efficiency decreased after two years of exposure to 2260 m altitude. These results suggest that long-term exposure to moderate altitudes has no observable effect on spatial working memory performance, while significant changes in functional connectivity and brain network properties could possibly occur to compensate for the effects of mild hypoxic environments. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the resting state activity in the PFC associated with working memory in people exposed to moderate altitudes.</p>

	<p>Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are complex disorders which can be associated with many comorbidities and exhibit multifactorial-dependent phenotypes. An important characteristic is represented by the early onset of the symptoms, during childhood or young adulthood, with a great impact on the socio-cognitive functioning of the affected individuals. Thus, the aim of our review is to describe and to argue the necessity of early developmental stages zebrafish models, focusing on NDDs, especially autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and also on schizophrenia. The utility of the animal models in NDDs or schizophrenia research remains quite controversial. Relevant discussions can be opened regarding the specific characteristics of the animal models and the relationship with the etiologies, physiopathology, and development of these disorders. The zebrafish models behaviors displayed as early as during the pre-hatching embryo stage (locomotor activity prone to repetitive behavior), and post-hatching embryo stage, such as memory, perception, affective-like, and social behaviors can be relevant in ASD and schizophrenia research. The neurophysiological processes impaired in both ASD and schizophrenia are generally highly conserved across all vertebrates. However, the relatively late individual development and conscious social behavior exhibited later in the larval stage are some of the most important limitations of these model animal species.</p>

                <h2>Background and Objectives</h2>
<p>We sought to determine clinical significance of neuronal septin autoimmunity and evaluate for potential IgG effects.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Septin-IgGs were detected by indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFAs; mouse tissue and cell based) or Western blot. IgG binding to (and internalization of) extracellular septin epitopes were evaluated for by live rat hippocampal neuron assay. The impact of purified patient IgGs on murine cortical neuron function was determined by recording extracellular field potentials in a multielectrode array platform.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Septin-IgGs were identified in 23 patients. All 8 patients with septin-5-IgG detected had cerebellar ataxia, and 7 had prominent eye movement disorders. One of 2 patients with co-existing septin-7-IgG had additional psychiatric phenotype (apathy, emotional blunting, and poor insight). Fifteen patients had septin-7 autoimmunity, without septin-5-IgG detected. Disorders included encephalopathy (11; 2 patients with accompanying myelopathy, and 2 were relapsing), myelopathy (3), and episodic ataxia (1). Psychiatric symptoms (≥1 of agitation, apathy, catatonia, disorganized thinking, and paranoia) were prominent in 6 of 11 patients with encephalopathic symptoms. Eight of 10 patients with data available (from 23 total) improved after immunotherapy, and a further 2 patients improved spontaneously. Staining of plasma membranes of live hippocampal neurons produced by patient IgGs (subclasses 1 and 2) colocalized with pre- and post-synaptic markers. Decreased spiking and bursting behavior in mixed cultures of murine glutamatergic and GABAergic cortical neurons produced by patient IgGs were attributable to neither antigenic crosslinking and internalization nor complement activation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Septin-IgGs are predictive of distinct treatment-responsive autoimmune central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Live neuron binding and induced electrophysiologic effects by patient IgGs may support septin-specific pathophysiology. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We assessed whether hematoma expansion (HE) and favorable outcome differ according to type of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Among participants with ICH enrolled in the TICH-2 (Tranexamic Acid for Hyperacute Primary Intracerebral Haemorrhage) trial, we assessed baseline scans for hematoma location and presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) using computed tomography (CT, simplified Edinburgh criteria) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; Boston criteria) and categorized ICH as lobar CAA, lobar non-CAA, and nonlobar. The main outcomes were HE and favorable functional outcome. We constructed multivariate regression models and assessed treatment effects using interaction terms.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 2,298 out of 2,325 participants were included with available CT (98.8%; median age = 71 years, interquartile range = 60-80 years; 1,014 female). Additional MRI was available in 219 patients (9.5%). Overall, 1,637 participants (71.2%) had nonlobar ICH; the remaining 661 participants (28.8%) had lobar ICH, of whom 202 patients had lobar CAA-ICH (8.8%, 173 participants according to Edinburgh and 29 participants according to Boston criteria) and 459 did not (lobar non-CAA, 20.0%). For HE, we found a significant interaction of lobar CAA ICH with time from onset to randomization (increasing risk with time, <i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> &lt; 0.001) and baseline ICH volume (constant risk regardless of volume, <i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> &lt; 0.001) but no association between type of ICH and risk of HE or favorable outcome. Tranexamic acid significantly reduced the risk of HE (adjusted odds ratio = 0.7, 95% confidence interval = 0.6–1.0, <i>p</i> = 0.020) without statistically significant interaction with type of ICH (<i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.058). Tranexamic acid was not associated with favorable outcome.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Risk of HE in patients with lobar CAA-ICH was not independently increased but seems to have different dynamics compared to other types of ICH. The time window for treatment of CAA-ICH to prevent HE may be longer. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural oscillations in the aging brain associated with interference control in word production</a></h4>

              
                Speaking is not only about retrieving words and structuring them into sentences, but it also requires top-down control to plan and execute speech. In previous electrophysiological research with young-adult speakers, mid-frontal theta oscillations have been observed using a picture-word interference paradigm. With this paradigm, participants name pictures while ignoring superimposed distractor words. In particular, mid-frontal theta power increases for categorically related distractors relative to other types of distractors, reflecting the top-down interference control in resolving the competition between processing streams during word production (Piai, Roelofs, Jensen, Schoffelen, & Bonnefond, 2014). In the present study, we conceptually replicated the magnetoencephalography study by Piai et al. (2014) with an older group of healthy adults (mean age of 60 years). Behaviorally, we replicated distractor semantic interference and Stroop-like interference effects usually observed in young adults. However, we did not find the corresponding theta modulation associated with these interference effects on the neural level. Instead, we found beta power decreases for both effects, mostly pronounced in the left posterior temporal and inferior parietal cortex. The distinct spectro-spatial-temporal profile of the oscillatory effects in the older population suggests different underlying dynamics relative to the midline frontal effect previously found in young-adult speakers. Our results indicate that the neural underpinnings of top-down interference control may be modified by aging, and that the mid-frontal theta cannot be the exclusive mechanism enabling interference control during spoken word production.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Role of mPFC DUSP1 in regulating the sensitivity to cocaine in adolescent cocaine-exposed mice of adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Cocaine abuse during adolescence increases the risk for developing drug addiction in later life, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, adolescent cocaine-exposed (ACE) male mice models were established by giving once-daily intraperitoneal injections of 15 mg/kg cocaine to mice during adolescence (P28-P42). We found that ACE mice exhibited a higher sensitivity to subthreshold dose of cocaine (1 mg/kg) in adulthood, accompanied with triggered activities and dendritic spine density of pyramidal neuron, increased Dusp1 gene, as well as reduced protein levels and activity of dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) in mPFC. Specific overexpression of DUSP1 on mPFC glutamatergic neurons efficiently blocked cocaine-preferred behaviors and reduced mPFC activity, while knockdown of DUSP1 maintained cocaine-preferred behaviors and increased mPFC activity in ACE mice. MAPK-related signals, especially ERK1/2, might underlie the mediating effects of DUSP1. Collectively, these findings suggested that targeting mPFC DUSP1 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment and attenuation of addiction susceptibility, particularly in addicts with a history of adolescent drugs exposure.

Significance statementCocaine-exposed experience during adolescence enhances the sensitivity of mice to drugs and triggers more activity of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in adulthood, which is rescued by specific overexpression of dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) on glutamatergic neurons of mPFC. MAPK-related signals, especially ERK1/2, might underlie the regulatory effects of DUSP1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Uman Type NF-L Antibodies Are Effective Reagents for the Imaging of Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Recent work shows that certain immunological assays for the neurofilament light chain NF-L detect informative signals in the CSF and blood of human and animals affected by a variety of CNS injury and disease states. Much of this work has been performed using two mouse monoclonal antibodies to NF-L, UD1 and UD2, also known as 2.1 and 47.3 respectively. These are the essential components of the Uman Diagnostics NF-Light ELISA kit, the Quanterix Simoa bead based NF-L assay and others. We show here that the antibodies bind to neighboring epitopes in a short, conserved and unusual peptide in the NF-L "rod" Coil 2 region. We also describe a surprising and useful feature of Uman and similar reagents. While other well characterized NF-L antibodies show robust staining of countless cells and processes in CNS sections from healthy rats, both Uman antibodies reveal only a minor subset of presumably spontaneously degenerating or degenerated neurons and their processes. However following experimental mid-cervical injuries to rat spinal cord both Uman antibodies recognize numerous profiles in tissue sections. The Uman positive material was associated with fiber tracts expected to be damaged by the injury administered and the profiles had the swollen, beaded, discontinuous and sinusoidal morphology expected for degenerating and degenerated processes. We also found that several antibodies to the C terminal "tail" region of NF-L stain undamaged axonal profiles but fail to recognize the Uman positive material. The unmasking of the Uman epitopes and the loss of the NF-L tail epitopes can be mimicked by treating sections from healthy animals with proteases suggesting that the immunological changes we have discovered are due to neurodegeneration induced proteolysis. We have also generated a novel panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibody reagents directed against the region of NF-L including the Uman epitopes which have staining properties identical to the Uman reagents. Using these we show that the NF-L region to which the Uman reagents bind contains further hidden epitopes distinct from those recognized by the two Uman reagents. We speculate that the Uman type epitopes are part of a binding region important for higher order neurofilament assembly. The work provides important insights into the properties of the NF-L biomarker, describes novel and useful properties of Uman type and NF-L tail binding antibodies and provides a hypothesis relevant to further understanding of neurofilament assembly.

                Accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) on biopolymers accompany cellular aging and drives poorly understood disease processes. Here, we studied how AGEs contribute to development of early on-set Parkinsons Disease (PD) caused by loss-of-function of DJ1, a protein deglycase. In induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived midbrain organoid models deficient for DJ1 activity, we find that lysosomal proteolysis is impaired, causing AGEs to accumulate, -synuclein (-syn) phosphorylation to increase, and proteins to aggregate. These processes are at least partly driven by astrocytes, as DJ1 loss reduces their capacity to provide metabolic support and triggers acquisition of a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Consistently, in co-cultures, we find that DJ1-expressing astrocytes are able to reverse the proteolysis deficits of DJ1 knockout midbrain neurons. In conclusion, astrocytes capacity to clear toxic damaged proteins is critical to preserve neuronal function and their dysfunction contributes to the neurodegeneration observed in PD.

                The ability of neurons to respond to external stimuli involves adaptations of gene expression. The transcription factor, {Delta}FOSB, is important for the development of drug addiction, however, its gene targets have not been identified. Here we use CUT&RUN to map the genome-wide enrichment of {Delta}FOSB binding in the two major neuronal cell types of the nucleus accumbens, a key brain reward region, after cocaine exposure. The binding landscape shows that the majority of {Delta}FOSB peaks occur outside of promoter regions, including intergenic regions, and are surrounded by epigenetic marks indicative of active enhancers. BRG1, the core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, overlaps with {Delta}FOSB peaks, consistent with earlier studies of {Delta}FOSBs interacting proteins. In addition, in silico analyses predict that {Delta}FOSB cooperatively regulates gene expression with homeobox and T-box transcription factors. These novel findings uncover key elements of {Delta}FOSBs molecular mechanisms in transcriptional regulation.

                BackgroundEstimates of "brain-predicted age" quantify apparent brain age compared to normative trajectories of neuroimaging features. The brain age gap (BAG) between predicted and chronological age is elevated in symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD), but has not been well explored in preclinical AD. Prior studies have typically modeled BAG with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but more recently other modalities, including functional connectivity (FC) and multimodal MRI, have been explored.

MethodsWe trained three models to predict age from FC, volumetric (Vol), or multimodal MRI (Vol+FC) in 390 control participants (18-89 years old). In independent samples of 144 older adult controls, 154 preclinical AD participants, and 154 cognitively impaired (CI; CDR > 0) participants, we tested relationships between BAG and AD biomarkers of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration, as well as a global cognitive composite.

ResultsAll models predicted age in the control training set, with the multimodal model outperforming the unimodal models. All three BAG estimates were significantly elevated in CI compared to controls. FC-BAG and Vol+FC-BAG were marginally reduced in preclinical AD participants compared to controls. In CI participants only, elevated Vol-BAG and Vol+FC-BAG were associated with more advanced AD pathology and lower cognitive performance.

ConclusionsBoth FC-BAG and Vol-BAG are elevated in CI participants. However, FC and volumetric MRI also capture complementary signals. Specifically, FC-BAG may capture a unique biphasic response to preclinical AD pathology, while Vol-BAG may capture pathological progression and cognitive decline in the symptomatic stage. A multimodal age-prediction model captures these modality-specific patterns, and further, improves sensitivity to healthy age differences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tracking neural correlates of prioritizing working memory representations through retrospective attentional strengthening</a></h4>

              
                Previous work has proposed two potentials benefits of retrospective attention on working memory (WM): target strengthening and non-target inhibition. It remains unknown which hypothesis contributes to the improved WM performance, yet the neural mechanisms responsible for this attentional benefit are unclear. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals while 33 participants performed a retrospective-cue WM task. Multivariate pattern classification analysis revealed that only representations of target features were enhanced by valid retrospective attention during the retention, supporting the target strengthening hypothesis. Further univariate analysis found that mid-frontal theta inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) and ERP components were modulated by valid retrospective attention and correlated with individual differences and moment-to-moment fluctuations on behavioral outcomes, suggesting that both trait- and state-level variability in attentional preparatory processes influence goal-directed behavior. Furthermore, task-irrelevant target spatial location could be decoded from EEG signals, indicating that enhanced spatial binding of target representation promotes high WM precision. Importantly, frontoparietal theta-alpha phase-amplitude-coupling was increased by valid retrospective attention and predicted the reduced randomly guessing rates. This long-range connection supported top-down information flow in engagement of frontoparietal networks, which might organize attentional states to integrate target features. Altogether, these results provide neurophysiological bases that retrospective attention improves WM precision through enhancing representation of target and emphasize the critical role of frontoparietal attentional network in the control of WM representations.

	<p>Purpose: To examine the optical coherence tomography (OCT) features of the retina in patients with chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION) and compare them with those of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with and without optic neuritis (ON), and healthy controls (HC). Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we used spectral domain OCT to evaluate the retinal structure of 14 participants with CRION, 22 with NMOSD, 40 with RRMS with unilateral ON, and 20 HC. The peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL), total macular volume (TMV), and papillomacular bundle (PMB) were measured, and intra-retinal segmentation was performed to obtain the retinal nerve fiber (RNFL), ganglion cell (GCL), inner plexiform (IPL), inner nuclear (INL), outer plexiform (OPL) and outer nuclear (ONL) layer volumes. Results: The global pRNFL [39.33(&amp;amp;plusmn;1.8) &amp;amp;micro;m] and all its quadrants are significantly thinner in CRION compared with all other groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). CRION patients have decreased volumes of TMV, RNFL, GCL, and IPL compared with all other groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Severe thinning in pRNFL and thinning in intra-retinal segments of IPL, GCL, RNFL, and TMV could be helpful in differentiating CRION from NMOSD and RRMS.</p>

	<p>Neurodegenerative parkinsonian disorders are characterized by a great diversity of clinical symptoms and underlying neuropathology, yet differential diagnosis during lifetime remains probabilistic. Molecular imaging is a powerful method to detect pathological changes in vivo on a cellular and molecular level with high specificity. Thereby, molecular imaging enables to investigate functional changes and pathological hallmarks in neurodegenerative disorders, thus allowing to better differentiate between different forms of degenerative parkinsonism, improve the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis and disentangle the pathophysiology of disease-related symptoms. The past decade led to significant progress in the field of molecular imaging, including the development of multiple new and promising radioactive tracers for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) as well as novel analytical methods. Here, we review the most recent advances in molecular imaging for the diagnosis, prognosis, and mechanistic understanding of parkinsonian disorders. First, advances in imaging of neurotransmission abnormalities, metabolism, synaptic density, inflammation, and pathological protein aggregation are reviewed, highlighting our renewed understanding regarding the multiplicity of neurodegenerative processes involved in parkinsonian disorders. Consequently, we review the role of molecular imaging in the context of disease-modifying interventions to follow neurodegeneration, ensure stratification, and target engagement in clinical trials.</p>

	<p>Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor, and median survival is relatively short despite aggressive standard treatment. Natural killer (NK) cell dysfunction is strongly associated with tumor recurrence and metastasis but is unclear in glioblastoma. NK activity (NKA) represents NK cell-secreted interferon-&amp;amp;gamma; (IFN-&amp;amp;gamma;), which modulates immunity and inhibits cancer progression. This study aimed to analyze NKA in glioblastoma patients to obtain a clearer overview of immunity surveillance. From 2020 to 2021, a total of 20 patients and six healthy controls were recruited. Peripheral blood samples were collected preoperatively and on postoperative days (POD) 3 and 30. Then, NKA was measured using the NK VUE kit. Although NKA decreased on POD3, it recovered and further significantly enhanced on POD30, with a nearly five-fold increase compared to baseline (p = 0.004). Furthermore, the percentage of CD56brightCD16&amp;amp;minus; NK cells decreased significantly on POD3 (p = 0.022) and further recovered on PO30. Subgroup analysis of extent surgical resection further revealed that the recovery of impaired NKA was attributable to gross total resection (GTR) rather than subtotal resection (STR). In conclusion, NKA is significantly impaired in glioblastoma, and GTR has demonstrated superior benefit in improving the suppressed NKA and increased CD56brightCD16&amp;amp;minus; NK subset in glioblastoma patients, which may be associated with subsequent patients&amp;amp;rsquo; prognosis. Therefore, the goal of performing GTR for glioblastoma should be achieved when possible since it appears to increase NKA cell immunity.</p>

	<p>Due to the complexity of medical imaging techniques and the high heterogeneity of glioma surfaces, image segmentation of human gliomas is one of the most challenging tasks in medical image analysis. Current methods based on convolutional neural networks concentrate on feature extraction while ignoring the correlation between local and global. In this paper, we propose a residual mix transformer fusion net, namely RMTF-Net, for brain tumor segmentation. In the feature encoder, a residual mix transformer encoder including a mix transformer and a residual convolutional neural network (RCNN) is proposed. The mix transformer gives an overlapping patch embedding mechanism to cope with the loss of patch boundary information. Moreover, a parallel fusion strategy based on RCNN is utilized to obtain local&amp;amp;ndash;global balanced information. In the feature decoder, a global feature integration (GFI) module is applied, which can enrich the context with the global attention feature. Extensive experiments on brain tumor segmentation from LGG, BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 demonstrated that our proposed RMTF-Net is superior to existing state-of-art methods in subjective visual performance and objective evaluation.</p>

	<p>Background: Moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise programs have proven to exert positive effects on the cognitive performance of older people. However, the specific effects sport-based exercise programs have on cognitive performance, upon executive functions, remain unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to clarify the effects of sport-based exercise programs on executive functions in older adults, through a systematic review protocol of the scientific literature, with a meta-analysis. Methods: The search was performed in the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and EBSCO electronic databases by combining keywords and different medical subject headings (MeSH) to identify and evaluate the relevant studies from inception up until June 2022. This study considers longitudinal studies with at least one experimental group and pre- and post-intervention measurements involving healthy older adults of 60 years of age or older. Studies have to consider one or more measures of executive function, including dimensions of working memory, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility, in order to meet the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this report. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale was used for methodological quality assessment studies. The DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used to compute the meta-analyses and report effect sizes (ES, i.e., Hedges&amp;amp;rsquo; g) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and a statistical significance set at p &amp;amp;le; 0.05. The ES values were calculated for executive function globally and for each dimension of executive function (e.g., working memory, inhibition, cognitive flexibility) in the experimental and control/comparator groups using the mean and standard deviation values before and after the intervention period. Conclusions: Our systematic review aims to clarify the effects of sport-based exercise programs on executive functions in older adults. The results may help practitioners and stakeholders to provide better evidence-based decisions regarding sport-based exercise program implementation for older adults, and to help them to optimize cognitive functions during the aging process. Ethical permission is not required for this study. Systematic review registration: this systematic review is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number: CRD42022284788).</p>

	<p>Brain-Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) expression is decreased in conditions associated with cognitive decline as well as metabolic diseases. One potential strategy to improve metabolic health and elevate BDNF is by increasing circulating ketones. Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) stimulates BDNF expression, but the association of circulating BHB and plasma BDNF in humans has not been widely studied. Here, we present results from three studies that evaluated how various methods of inducing ketosis influenced plasma BDNF in humans. Study 1 determined BDNF responses to a single bout of high-intensity cycling after ingestion of a dose of ketone salts in a group of healthy adults who were habitually consuming either a mixed diet or a ketogenic diet. Study 2 compared how a ketogenic diet versus a mixed diet impacts BDNF levels during a 12-week resistance training program in healthy adults. Study 3 examined the effects of a controlled hypocaloric ketogenic diet, with and without daily use of a ketone-salt, on BDNF levels in overweight/obese adults. We found that (1) fasting plasma BDNF concentrations were lower in keto-adapted versus non keto-adapted individuals, (2) intense cycling exercise was a strong stimulus to rapidly increase plasma BDNF independent of ketosis, and (3) clinically significant weight loss was a strong stimulus to decrease fasting plasma BDNF independent of diet composition or level of ketosis. These results highlight the plasticity of plasma BDNF in response to lifestyle factors but does not support a strong association with temporally matched BHB concentrations.</p>

	<p>Objective: Recently, many emotional diseases, such as anxiety and depression, have prevailed, and it is expected that emotional disease will be the leading cause of social and economic burden in 2030. These emotional diseases may be due to certain personality traits, which could be the reasons for the development of mental illness. Personality theories have been constantly developed over the past hundreds of years, and different dimensions of personality traits corresponding to different physiological bases and emotional feelings have been proposed. However, personality may be the least studied area in psychology. Methods: In this paper, we will give a short review on the development of personality theories as well as dimensional emotional theory. Then, we will compare the similarities between the emotional dimension and personality dimension. Furthermore, we will also investigate the neural mechanisms of personality and emotions, focusing on neuromodulators for anxiety-related personality traits, in order to provide a clear relationship between different neurotransmitters and anxiety-related personality traits. Results: The results of our study suggest that the emotional dimension and personality dimension may be somewhat related, for example, the extrovert/introvert dimension of personality might be related to the hedonic dimension, which includes happiness/sadness, and the neurotic dimensions might be related to emotional arousal. In addition, our study found that personality traits are also related to basic emotions, for instance, people who are too self-centered are prone to feeling a mood of disgust or depression, while anger and fear correspond to unstable personality traits. The analysis suggested that the neural substrates of both personality and emotions might be described as follows: extroverted&amp;amp;ndash;joy&amp;amp;ndash;dopamine (DA); introverted&amp;amp;ndash;disgust&amp;amp;ndash;5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT); unstable (neuroticism)&amp;amp;ndash;anger/fear&amp;amp;ndash;noradrenaline (NE); stable&amp;amp;ndash;calmness. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that there is a correlation between personality traits and emotions, and both depend on monoamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin). In addition, personality disorders can be interfered via the regulation of emotions and neurotransmitters. This paper opens up a whole new perspective for future research on personality traits and emotional diseases and has great clinical value and practical significance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dscam1 Has Diverse Neuron Type-Specific Functions in the Developing Drosophila CNS</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Two key features endow <I>Drosophila</I> Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule 1 (Dscam1) with the potential to provide a ubiquitous code for neuronal arbor self-avoidance. First, Dscam1 contains three large cassettes of alternative exons, so that stochastic alternative splicing yields 19,008 Dscam1 isoforms with different Ig ectodomains. Second, each neuron expresses a different subset of Dscam1 isoforms, and isoform-specific homophilic binding causes repulsion. This results in even spacing of self-arbors, while processes of other neurons can intermingle and share the same synaptic partners. In principle, this Dscam1 code could ensure arbor spacing of all neurons in <I>Drosophila</I>. This model is strongly supported by studies on dendrite spacing in the peripheral nervous system and studies on axonal branch segregation during brain development. However, the situation is less clear for central neuron dendrites, the major substrate for synaptic input in the CNS. We systematically tested the role of Dscam1 for dendrite growth and spacing in eight different types of identified central neurons. Knockdown of Dscam1 causes severe dendritic clumping and length reductions in efferent glutamatergic and aminergic neurons. The primary cause for these dendritic phenotypes could be impaired self-avoidance, a growth defect, or both. In peptidergic efferent neurons, many central arbors are not formed, arguing for a growth defect. By contrast, knockdown of Dscam1 does not affect dendrite growth or spacing in any of the five different types of interneurons tested. Axon arbor patterning is not affected in any neuron type tested. We conclude that Dscam1 mediates diverse, neuron type-specific functions during central neuron arbor differentiation.</p>

                Background: The replicative forms of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is found in several types of white blood cells within the host defense system. To determine the dimensionality of the extrahepatic manifestation of HBV in host white blood cells, it is important to understand the complete biology of its pathogenesis and lymphotropic nature. Methods: Deep curation of the literature from the PubMed database pertaining to the HBV manifestation in the human host white blood cells was conducted and then manually filtered to determine the behavioral trend of the virus within the human white blood cells. Results: The curation of 198 research articles identified 28 genes, 92 proteins, and 20 Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells involved in HBV pathogenesis, while 20 immune cells were found to be permissive for the viral penetration and replication. The presence of the replicative forms of HBV in the host immune cells led to the further elucidation of 28 genes and 92 proteins that interact with one or more viral genes and proteins. Conclusions: A multi-dimensional analysis using deep curation identified a possible lymphotropic character of HBV. Moreover, there are certain pathways that could aid in the propagation of viral infection by using immune cells to its advantage. Thus, instead of eliminating HBV, the immune system may contribute to the population expansion of the virus.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a brain region involved in critical cognitive functions including memory, planning, and spatial navigation and is commonly affected in neurodegenerative diseases. Subregions of RSC are typically described as Brodmann areas 29 and 30, which are defined by cytoarchitectural features. Using immunofluorescence, we studied the distributions of neurons immunoreactive for NeuN, latexin, and calcium binding proteins (calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin) in RSC of <i>Carollia perspicillata</i>, Seba's short-tailed fruit bat. We observed that latexin was specifically present in areas 29a and 29b but not 29c and 30. We further identified distribution patterns of calcium binding proteins that group areas 29a and 29b separately from areas 29c and 30. We conclude first that latexin is a useful marker to classify subregions of RSC and second that these subregions contain distinct patterns of neuronal immunoreactivity for calcium binding proteins. Given the long lifespan of <i>Carollia</i>, bat RSC may be a useful model in studying age-related neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Learning‐related changes in cellular activity within mouse dentate gyrus during trace eyeblink conditioning</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Because the dentate gyrus serves as the first site for information processing in the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit, it an important structure for the formation of associative memories. Previous findings in rabbit had recorded populations of cells within dentate gyrus that may bridge the temporal gap between stimuli to support memory formation during trace eyeblink conditioning, an associative learning task. However, this previous work was unable to identify the types of cells demonstrating this type of activity. To explore these changes further, we did in vivo single-neuron recording in conjunction with physiological determination of cell types to investigate the functional role of granule cells, mossy cells, and interneurons in dentate gyrus during learning. Tetrode recordings were performed in young-adult mice during training on trace eyeblink conditioning, a hippocampal-dependent temporal associative memory task. Conditioned mice were able to successfully learn the task, with male mice learning at a faster rate than female mice. In the conditioned group, granule cells tended to show an increase in firing rate during conditioned stimulus presentation while mossy cells showed a decrease in firing rate during the trace interval and the unconditioned stimulus. Interestingly, populations of interneurons demonstrated learning-related increases and decreases in activity that began at onset of the conditioned stimulus and persisted through the trace interval. The current study also found a significant increase in theta power during stimuli presentation in conditioned animals, and this change in theta decreased over time. Ultimately, these data suggest unique involvement of granule cells, mossy cells, and interneurons in dentate gyrus in the formation of a trace associative memory. This work expands our knowledge of dentate gyrus function, helping to discern how aging and disease might disrupt this process.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RAFFT: Efficient prediction of RNA folding pathways using the fast Fourier transform</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vaitea Opuu, Nono S. C. Merleau, Vincent Messow, Matteo Smerlak</p>

We propose a novel heuristic to predict RNA secondary structure formation pathways that has two components: (i) a folding algorithm and (ii) a kinetic ansatz. This heuristic is inspired by the kinetic partitioning mechanism, by which molecules follow alternative folding pathways to their native structure, some much faster than others. Similarly, our algorithm RAFFT starts by generating an ensemble of concurrent folding pathways ending in multiple metastable structures, which is in contrast with traditional thermodynamic approaches that find single structures with minimal free energies. When we constrained the algorithm to predict only 50 structures per sequence, near-native structures were found for RNA molecules of length ≤ 200 nucleotides. Our heuristic has been tested on the coronavirus frameshifting stimulation element (CFSE): an ensemble of 68 distinct structures allowed us to produce complete folding kinetic trajectories, whereas known methods require evaluating millions of sub-optimal structures to achieve this result. Thanks to the fast Fourier transform on which RAFFT (RNA folding Algorithm wih Fast Fourier Transform) is based, these computations are efficient, with complexity O ( L 2logL ).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Seasonal variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in temperate climates: A Bayesian modelling study in 143 European regions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tomáš Gavenčiak, Joshua Teperowski Monrad, Gavin Leech, Mrinank Sharma, Sören Mindermann, Samir Bhatt, Jan Brauner, Jan Kulveit</p>

Although seasonal variation has a known influence on the transmission of several respiratory viral infections, its role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains unclear. While there is a sizable and growing literature on environmental drivers of COVID-19 transmission, recent reviews have highlighted conflicting and inconclusive findings. This indeterminacy partly owes to the fact that seasonal variation relates to viral transmission by a complicated web of causal pathways, including many interacting biological and behavioural factors. Since analyses of specific factors cannot determine the aggregate strength of seasonal forcing, we sidestep the challenge of disentangling various possible causal paths in favor of a holistic approach. We model seasonality as a sinusoidal variation in transmission and infer a single Bayesian estimate of the overall seasonal effect. By extending two state-of-the-art models of non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) effects and their datasets covering 143 regions in temperate Europe, we are able to adjust our estimates for the role of both NPIs and mobility patterns in reducing transmission. We find strong seasonal patterns, consistent with a reduction in the time-varying reproduction number <i>R</i>(<i>t</i>) (the expected number of new infections generated by an infectious individual at time <i>t</i>) of 42.1% (95% CI: 24.7%—53.4%) from the peak of winter to the peak of summer. These results imply that the seasonality of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is comparable in magnitude to the most effective individual NPIs but less than the combined effect of multiple interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Integrative experimental/computational approach establishes active cellular protrusion as the primary driving force of phagocytic spreading by immune cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Emmet A. Francis, Volkmar Heinrich</p>

The dynamic interplay between cell adhesion and protrusion is a critical determinant of many forms of cell motility. When modeling cell spreading on adhesive surfaces, traditional mathematical treatments often consider passive cell adhesion as the primary, if not exclusive, mechanistic driving force of this cellular motion. To better assess the contribution of active cytoskeletal protrusion to immune-cell spreading during phagocytosis, we here develop a computational framework that allows us to optionally investigate both purely adhesive spreading (“Brownian zipper hypothesis”) as well as protrusion-dominated spreading (“protrusive zipper hypothesis”). We model the cell as an axisymmetric body of highly viscous fluid surrounded by a cortex with uniform surface tension and incorporate as potential driving forces of cell spreading an attractive stress due to receptor-ligand binding and an outward normal stress representing cytoskeletal protrusion, both acting on the cell boundary. We leverage various model predictions against the results of a directly related experimental companion study of human neutrophil phagocytic spreading on substrates coated with different densities of antibodies. We find that the concept of adhesion-driven spreading is incompatible with experimental results such as the independence of the cell-spreading speed on the density of immobilized antibodies. In contrast, the protrusive zipper model agrees well with experimental findings and, when adapted to simulate cell spreading on discrete adhesion sites, it also reproduces the observed positive correlation between antibody density and maximum cell-substrate contact area. Together, our integrative experimental/computational approach shows that phagocytic spreading is driven by cellular protrusion, and that the extent of spreading is limited by the density of adhesion sites.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Combining biomarker and virus phylogenetic models improves HIV-1 epidemiological source identification</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erik Lundgren, Ethan Romero-Severson, Jan Albert, Thomas Leitner</p>

To identify and stop active HIV transmission chains new epidemiological techniques are needed. Here, we describe the development of a multi-biomarker augmentation to phylogenetic inference of the underlying transmission history in a local population. HIV biomarkers are measurable biological quantities that have some relationship to the amount of time someone has been infected with HIV. To train our model, we used five biomarkers based on real data from serological assays, HIV sequence data, and target cell counts in longitudinally followed, untreated patients with known infection times. The biomarkers were modeled with a mixed effects framework to allow for patient specific variation and general trends, and fit to patient data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Subsequently, the density of the unobserved infection time conditional on observed biomarkers were obtained by integrating out the random effects from the model fit. This probabilistic information about infection times was incorporated into the likelihood function for the transmission history and phylogenetic tree reconstruction, informed by the HIV sequence data. To critically test our methodology, we developed a coalescent-based simulation framework that generates phylogenies and biomarkers given a specific or general transmission history. Testing on many epidemiological scenarios showed that biomarker augmented phylogenetics can reach 90% accuracy under idealized situations. Under realistic within-host HIV-1 evolution, involving substantial within-host diversification and frequent transmission of multiple lineages, the average accuracy was at about 50% in transmission clusters involving 5–50 hosts. Realistic biomarker data added on average 16 percentage points over using the phylogeny alone. Using more biomarkers improved the performance. Shorter temporal spacing between transmission events and increased transmission heterogeneity reduced reconstruction accuracy, but larger clusters were not harder to get right. More sequence data per infected host also improved accuracy. We show that the method is robust to incomplete sampling and that adding biomarkers improves reconstructions of real HIV-1 transmission histories. The technology presented here could allow for better prevention programs by providing data for locally informed and tailored strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Wnt5a–Vangl1/2 signaling regulates the position and direction of lung branching through the cytoskeleton and focal adhesions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kuan Zhang, Erica Yao, Ethan Chuang, Biao Chen, Evelyn Y. Chuang, Regan F. Volk, Katherine L. Hofmann, Balyn Zaro, Pao-Tien Chuang</p>

Lung branching morphogenesis requires reciprocal interactions between the epithelium and mesenchyme. How the lung branches are generated at a defined location and projected toward a specific direction remains a major unresolved issue. In this study, we investigated the function of Wnt signaling in lung branching in mice. We discovered that <i>Wnt5a</i> in both the epithelium and the mesenchyme plays an essential role in controlling the position and direction of lung branching. The <i>Wnt5a</i> signal is mediated by <i>Vangl1/2</i> to trigger a cascade of noncanonical or planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling. In response to noncanonical <i>Wnt</i> signaling, lung cells undergo cytoskeletal reorganization and change focal adhesions. Perturbed focal adhesions in lung explants are associated with defective branching. Moreover, we observed changes in the shape and orientation of the epithelial sheet and the underlying mesenchymal layer in regions of defective branching in the mutant lungs. Thus, PCP signaling helps define the position and orientation of the lung branches. We propose that mechanical force induced by noncanonical <i>Wnt</i> signaling mediates a coordinated alteration in the shape and orientation of a group of epithelial and mesenchymal cells. These results provide a new framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which a stereotypic branching pattern is generated.

Proline hydroxylation (Hyp) regulates protein structure, stability, and protein–protein interaction. It is widely involved in diverse metabolic and physiological pathways in cells and diseases. To reveal functional features of the Hyp proteome, we integrated various data sources for deep proteome profiling of the Hyp proteome in humans and developed HypDB (https://www.HypDB.site), an annotated database and web server for Hyp proteome. HypDB provides site-specific evidence of modification based on extensive LC-MS analysis and literature mining with 14,413 nonredundant Hyp sites on 5,165 human proteins including 3,383 Class I and 4,335 Class II sites. Annotation analysis revealed significant enrichment of Hyp on key functional domains and tissue-specific distribution of Hyp abundance across 26 types of human organs and fluids and 6 cell lines. The network connectivity analysis further revealed a critical role of Hyp in mediating protein–protein interactions. Moreover, the spectral library generated by HypDB enabled data-independent analysis (DIA) of clinical tissues and the identification of novel Hyp biomarkers in lung cancer and kidney cancer. Taken together, our integrated analysis of human proteome with publicly accessible HypDB revealed functional diversity of Hyp substrates and provides a quantitative data source to characterize Hyp in pathways and diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin drives development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice by affecting Th17 differentiation</a></h4>

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a highly prevalent demyelinating autoimmune condition; the mechanisms regulating its severity and progression are unclear. The IL-17-producing Th17 subset of T cells has been widely implicated in MS and in the mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the differentiation and regulation of Th17 cells during EAE remain incompletely understood. Although evidence is mounting that the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin profoundly affects early T cell differentiation, no studies have looked at its role in longer-term T cell responses. Now, we report that cathelicidin drives severe EAE disease. It is released from neutrophils, microglia, and endothelial cells throughout disease; its interaction with T cells potentiates Th17 differentiation in lymph nodes and Th17 to exTh17 plasticity and IFN-γ production in the spinal cord. As a consequence, mice lacking cathelicidin are protected from severe EAE. In addition, we show that cathelicidin is produced by the same cell types in the active brain lesions in human MS disease. We propose that cathelicidin exposure results in highly activated, cytokine-producing T cells, which drive autoimmunity; this is a mechanism through which neutrophils amplify inflammation in the central nervous system.

Triglycerides are carried in the bloodstream as part of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and chylomicrons, which represent the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants contribute to atherosclerosis, possibly by carrying remnant cholesterol and/or by exerting a proinflammatory effect on macrophages. Nevertheless, little is known about how macrophages process triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Here, using VLDL-sized triglyceride-rich emulsion particles, we aimed to study the mechanism by which VLDL triglycerides are taken up, processed, and stored in macrophages. Our results show that macrophage uptake of VLDL-sized emulsion particles is dependent on lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and requires the lipoprotein-binding C-terminal domain but not the catalytic N-terminal domain of LPL. Subsequent internalization of VLDL-sized emulsion particles by macrophages is carried out by caveolae-mediated endocytosis, followed by triglyceride hydrolysis catalyzed by lysosomal acid lipase. It is shown that STARD3 is required for the transfer of lysosomal fatty acids to the ER for subsequent storage as triglycerides, while NPC1 likely is involved in promoting the extracellular efflux of fatty acids from lysosomes. Our data provide novel insights into how macrophages process VLDL triglycerides and suggest that macrophages have the remarkable capacity to excrete part of the internalized triglycerides as fatty acids.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mitochondrial haplogroup association with fasting glucose response in African Americans treated with a thiazide diuretic [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hypertensive African Americans have a ~50% response rate to thiazide diuretic treatment. This contributes to a high prevalence of uncontrolled high blood pressure. Here, we examined the role of the mitochondrial genome on thiazide diuretic treatment response in hypertensive African Americans enrolled in a clinical trial. Methods: Participants from the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT, n= 4279) were genotyped using the Illumina Infinium Multi-Ethnic Beadchip. Haplotype groups were called using HaploGrep. We used a linear regression analysis to examine the association between mitochondrial haplogroups (L, M, and N) and changes in blood pressure and fasting glucose over six months and two years, respectively. Results: The analysis revealed a null association between mitochondrial haplogroups M and N versus L for each of the outcomes. In subgroup analysis, the L subclades L1, L2, and L3/L4 (versus L0) were each inversely associated with fasting glucose response (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This discovery analysis suggests the mitochondrial genome has a small effect on fasting glucose response, but not that of blood pressure, to thiazide diuretic treatment in African Americans.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Defeating the 21st century demon “Cybercrime” on corporate bodies in Nigeria: Is security intelligence a weapon? A quantitative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This paper unveils the role of security intelligence in facilitating the war against cybercrime in organizations. it introduces the term cybercrime and security intelligence with financial organizations in Nigeria. Since the invention of information and communication technology in Nigeria, citizens have become fascinated and engrossed. Unfortunately, this opened the door for people with malicious intent to attack individuals, organizations, and nations. Thus, this paper examines the problem of information vulnerability, identifies the level of cybercrime in financial entities, establishes the type of cybercrime, and assesses security intelligence awareness among staff and customers. Methods: The paper employed the simple-random sampling technique, using a primary and secondary source of information, analyzing frequency counts, percentages, and charts for the demographic variables, and used chi-square through SPSS data processing. Results: The results state the ubiquity of cybercrime among financial organizations and reveals that phishing scams, website spoofing, piracy, ransomware, and hacking are the top cyber-crime types commonly used. Conclusions: Thus, the administration of security intelligence can reduce internal and external threats in an organization. Furthermore, the paper states that security intelligence intervention is independent of the nature of cybercrime across the organization. However, the paper recommends that organizations need to enlighten their staff and customers with measures to safeguard information against cybercrime with the usage of security intelligence techniques and other proactive measures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A novel method for measuring sublingual temperature using conventional non-contact forehead thermometer [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sublingual temperature measurement is a quick and accurate representation of oral temperature and corresponds closely with core temperature. Sub-lingual temperature measurement using non-contact infrared thermometers has not been studied for this purpose and if accurate they would be a reliable and convenient way of recording temperature of a patient very quickly. The aim of the study was to evaluate the utility of recording sublingual temperature using an infrared non-contact thermometer and establish its accuracy by comparing the readings with tympanic thermometer recordings. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 29 patients (328 paired recordings from sublingual and tympanic sites simultaneously). Subjects were requested to keep their mouth closed for five minutes before recording the temperature. Sublingual recordings were performed for each patient at different times of the day using an infrared thermometer. The infrared thermometer was quickly brought 1cm away from the sublingual part of the tongue and the recordings were then done immediately. Readings were compared with the corresponding tympanic temperature. Results: The non-contact sublingual temperature correlated very closely with tympanic temperature (r=0.86, p<0.001). The mean difference between the infrared sublingual and tympanic temperature was 0.21°C (standard deviation [SD]:0.48°C, 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.16-0.27). The intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) between core and sublingual temperatures was 0.830 (95% CI: 0.794 to 0.861) p<0.001. The sensitivity of sublingual IR (infrared) temperature of 37.65°C was 90% and specificity was 89% for core temperature >38°C. Conclusions: This innovative modification of using the forehead infrared thermometer to measure the sublingual temperature offers an accurate, rapid and non-contact estimation of core temperature.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Generic model for biological regulation [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                A substantial portion of molecules in an organism are involved in regulation of a wide spectrum of biological processes. Several models have been presented for various forms of biological regulation, including gene expression regulation and physiological regulation; however, a generic model is missing. Recently a new unifying theory in biology, poikilosis, was presented.  Poikilosis indicates that all systems display intrinsic heterogeneity. The concept of poikilosis allowed development of a model for biological regulation applicable to all types of regulated systems. The perturbation-lagom-TATAR countermeasures-regulator (PLTR) model combines the effects of perturbation and lagom (allowed and sufficient extent of heterogeneity) in a system with tolerance, avoidance, repair, attenuation and resistance (TARAR) countermeasures, and possible regulators. There are three modes of regulation, two of which are lagom-related. In the first scenario, lagom is maintained, both intrinsic (passive) and active TARAR countermeasures can be involved. In the second mode, there is a shift from one lagom to another. In the third mode, reguland regulation, the regulated entity is the target of a regulatory shift, which is often irreversible or requires action of another regulator to return to original state. After the shift, the system enters to lagom maintenance mode, but at new lagom extent. The model is described and elaborated with examples and applications, including medicine and systems biology. Consequences of non-lagom extent of heterogeneity are introduced, along with a novel idea for therapy by reconstituting biological processes to lagom extent, even when the primary effect cannot be treated.

                Background: Following the surge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the epicenter of East Java Province, this study aimed to determine the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 at one of the emergency field hospitals in Indonesia. Methods: This was a single-centered, retrospective descriptive study of 763 patients admitted to the COVID-19 Emergency Field Hospital of Bangkalan from July 5 2021 to September 30 2021. The demographic data, clinical signs and symptoms, pre-existing comorbidities, therapy, and clinical outcomes of the patients were analyzed using SPSS. Results: The clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 at the emergency hospital were varied. A total of 763 patients were included. The most common age was between 40 and 49 years (31.1%), a slight majority were women (51.5%), and most had travelled abroad in the last 14 days (99.1%). Of the 763 patients, 70.9% had no comorbidities. Half of the patients were asymptomatic (49.4%), 46% were mild cases, 4.1% were moderate, and 0.5% severe. The most common symptoms were productive cough (15.7%) and headache (15.3%). Supportive and comorbidity therapy were given which showed excellent clinical outcomes. Conclusions: This study presents the description of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients during high surge cases of COVID-19 that are mostly dominated by Indonesian migrant workers in a field hospital. majority of COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic and therapy without antibiotics or antivirals showed positive outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Characterization of full-length CNBP expanded alleles in myotonic dystrophy type 2 patients by Cas9-mediated enrichment and nanopore sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is caused by CCTG repeat expansions in the <i>CNBP</i> gene, comprising 75 to &gt;11,000 units and featuring extensive mosaicism, making it challenging to sequence fully-expanded alleles. To overcome these limitations, we used PCR-free Cas9-mediated nanopore sequencing to characterize <i>CNBP</i> repeat expansions at the single-nucleotide level in nine DM2 patients. The length of normal and expanded alleles can be assessed precisely using this strategy, agreeing with traditional methods, and revealing the degree of mosaicism. We also sequenced an entire ~50 kbp expansion, which has not been achieved previously for DM2 or any other repeat-expansion disorders. Our approach precisely counted the repeats and identified the repeat pattern for both short interrupted and uninterrupted alleles. Interestingly, in the expanded alleles, only two DM2 samples featured the expected pure CCTG repeat pattern, while the other seven presented also TCTG blocks at the 3′ end, which have not been reported before in DM2 patients, but confirmed hereby with orthogonal methods. The demonstrated approach simultaneously determines repeat length, structure/motif and the extent of somatic mosaicism, promising to improve the molecular diagnosis of DM2 and achieve more accurate genotype-phenotype correlations for the better stratification of DM2 patients in clinical trials.

                Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) presents as a morbid jawbone lesion in patients exposed to a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (N-BP). Although it is rare, BRONJ has caused apprehension among patients and healthcare providers and decreased acceptance of this anti-resorptive drug class to treat osteoporosis and metastatic osteolysis. We report here a novel method to elucidate the pathological mechanism of BRONJ by the selective removal of legacy N-BP from the jawbone using an intra-oral application of hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (HMDP) formulated in liposome-based deformable nanoscale vesicles (DNV). After maxillary tooth extraction, zoledronate-treated mice developed delayed gingival wound closure, delayed tooth extraction socket healing and increased jawbone osteonecrosis consistent with human BRONJ lesion. Single cell RNA sequencing of mouse gingival cells revealed oral barrier immune dysregulation and unresolved pro-inflammatory reaction. HMDP-DNV topical applications to nascent mouse BRONJ lesions resulted in accelerated gingival wound closure and bone socket healing as well as attenuation of osteonecrosis development. The gingival single cell RNA sequencing demonstrated resolution of chronic inflammation by increased anti-inflammatory signature gene expression of lymphocytes and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. This study suggests that BRONJ pathology is related to N-BP levels in jawbones and demonstrates the potential of HMDP-DNV as an effective BRONJ therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural insight on the mechanism of an electron-bifurcating [FeFe] hydrogenase</a></h4>

              
                Electron-bifurcation is a fundamental energy conservation mechanism in nature in which two electrons from an intermediate potential electron donor are split so that one is sent along a high potential pathway to a high potential acceptor and the other is sent along a low potential pathway to a low potential acceptor. This process allows endergonic reactions to be driven by exergonic ones and is an alternative, less recognised, mechanism of energy coupling to the well-known chemiosmotic principle. The electron-bifurcating [FeFe] hydrogenase from <i>Thermotoga maritima</i> (HydABC) requires both NADH and ferredoxin to reduce protons generating hydrogen. The mechanism of electron-bifurcation in HydABC remains enigmatic in spite of intense research efforts over the last few years. Structural information may provide the basis for a better understanding of spectroscopic and functional information. Here, we present a 2.3 Å electron cryo-microscopy structure of HydABC. The structure shows a heterododecamer composed of two independent 'halves' each made of two strongly interacting HydABC heterotrimers connected via a [4Fe-4S] cluster. A central electron transfer pathway connects the active sites for NADH oxidation and for proton reduction. We identified two conformations of a flexible iron-sulfur cluster domain: a 'closed bridge' and an 'open bridge' conformation, where a Zn<sup>2+</sup> site may act as a 'hinge' allowing domain movement. Based on these structural revelations, we propose a possible mechanism of electron-bifurcation in HydABC where the flavin mononucleotide serves a dual role as both the electron bifurcation center and as the NAD<sup>+</sup> reduction/NADH oxidation site.

                Microorganisms growing in their habitat constitute a complex system. How the individual constituents of the environment contribute to microbial growth remains largely unknown. The present study focused on the contribution of environmental constituents to population dynamics via a high-throughput assay and data-driven analysis of a wild-type <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain. A large dataset constituting a total of 12,828 bacterial growth curves with 966 medium combinations, which were composed of 44 pure chemical compounds, was acquired. Machine learning analysis of the big data relating the growth parameters to the medium combinations revealed that the decision-making components for bacterial growth were distinct among various growth phases, e.g., glucose, sulfate, and serine for maximum growth, growth rate, and growth delay, respectively. Further analyses and simulations indicated that branched-chain amino acids functioned as global coordinators for population dynamics, as well as a survival strategy of risk diversification to prevent the bacterial population from undergoing extinction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Probabilistic axon targeting dynamics lead to individualized brain wiring</a></h4>

              
                Developmental variation in brain-wiring contributes to behavioural individuality1,2. However, how and when individualized wiring diagrams emerge and become stable during development remains largely unknown. Here, we explored axon targeting dynamics in individual brains using live-imaging of a developing Drosophila visual circuit and discovered that targeting choice is an algorithmic multi-step growth process with variable outcomes. Using optogenetics, we found that temporally restricted Notch lateral-inhibition defines a subset of neurons with a probabilistic potential to innervate distal targets. Next, axons from NotchOFF neurons amplify into long actin-rich multi-fibre structures necessary for distal growth. A subset of these NotchOFF neurons create distal targeting axons by stabilizing microtubule growth in one of their actin fibres. Amplified axons without tubulin-stabilized fibres retract, resulting in the stochastic selection of a different number of distal targeting axons in each brain. Pharmacological microtubule destabilization suffices to inhibit this targeting. We observed a similar axonal amplification-stabilization process in the developing chick spinal cord, suggesting a conserved mechanism. Finally, early microtubule patterns predict the adult brain- wiring of an individual in a target-independent manner prior to synapse formation3,4. Thus, we show that a temporal succession of genetically encoded stochastic processes explains the emergence of individual wiring variation.

                The relationship between brain areas based on neurotransmitter receptor and transporter molecule expression patterns may provide a link between brain structure and its function. Here, we studied the organization of the receptome, a measure of regional neurotransmitter receptor/transporter molecule (NTRM) similarity, derived from in vivo PET imaging studies of 19 different receptors and transporters. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction revealed three main spatial gradients of receptor similarity in the cortex. The first gradient differentiated the somato-motor network from the remaining cortex. The second gradient spanned between temporo-occipital and frontal anchors, differentiating visual and limbic networks from attention and control networks, and the third receptome gradient was anchored between the occipital and temporal cortices. In subcortical structures, the receptome delineated a striato-thalamic axis, separating functional communities. Moreover, we observed similar organizational principles underlying receptome differentiation in cortex and subcortex, indicating a link between subcortical and cortical NTRM patterning. Overall, we found that the cortical receptome shared key organizational traits with brain structure and function. Node-level correspondence of receptor similarity to functional, microstructural, and diffusion MRI-based measures decreased along a primary-to-transmodal gradient. Compared to primary and paralimbic regions, we observed higher receptomic diversification in unimodal and heteromodal regions, possibly supporting functional flexibility. In sum, we show how receptor similarity may form an additional organizational layer of human brain architecture, bridging brain structure and function.

                Huntington Disease (HD) has been linked to reduced synthesis of cholesterol in the brain. Its exogenous delivery to the brain has been shown to be beneficial in the rapidly progressing R6/2 mouse model. Here we used an advanced formulation of brain-permeable nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with cholesterol and called hybrid-g7-NPs-chol, to explore the long-term therapeutical potential of cholesterol administration to the brain of the slow-progressing zQ175DN knock-in HD mouse model. We show that one cycle treatment with hybrid-g7-NPs-chol, administered in the pre-symptomatic or symptomatic phases, is sufficient to completely normalize cognitive defects up to 5 months, as well as to improve other behavioral and neuropathological parameters. Instead, two cycles of hybrid-g7-NPs-chol are needed to achieve long-lasting therapeutic benefits for 12 months without severe inflammatory side-effects. Sustained cholesterol delivery to the brain of zQ175DN mice also reduces mutant Huntingtin aggregates both in striatum and cortex and completely normalizes glutamatergic communication in the striatal medium spiny neurons compared to saline-treated HD mice. These results show that cholesterol delivery via brain-permeable NPs is a safe and versatile therapeutic option for lastingly reversing HD-related behavioral decline and neuropathological signs, highlighting the translational potential of cholesterol-based strategies in HD patients.

                High-level alcohol consumption causes neuroplastic changes in the brain that lead to negative affective and somatic symptoms when alcohol is withdrawn, promoting relapse drinking. We have some understanding of these plastic changes in defined brain circuits and cell types, but unbiased approaches are needed to explore broader patterns of adaptations. Here, we employed whole-brain c-fos mapping and network analysis to assess how brain-wide patterns of neuronal activity are altered during acute alcohol abstinence and reaccess in a well-characterized model of alcohol dependence. Mice underwent four cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE) with alternating weeks of voluntary alcohol drinking, and a subset of mice underwent forced swim stress (FSS) prior to drinking sessions to further escalate alcohol consumption. After four CIE cycles, brains were collected from mice in each group either 24 hours (abstinence) or immediately following a one-hour period of alcohol reaccess. Brains from CIE mice during acute abstinence displayed widespread neuronal activation relative to those from AIR mice, independent of FSS, and this increase in c-fos was reversed by reaccess drinking. For network analysis, mice were then classified as high or low drinkers (HD or LD). We computed Pearson correlations for all pairs of brain regions and used graph theoretical methods to identify changes in network properties associated with high-drinking behavior. Network modularity, a measure of network segregation into communities, was increased in HD mice after alcohol reaccess relative to abstinence. Within-community strength and diversity measures were computed for each region and condition, and highly coactive regions were identified. One high-diversity region, the cortical amygdala (COA), was further interrogated using a chemogenetic approach. COA silencing in CIE mice reduced voluntary drinking, validating our network analysis and indicating that this region may play an important but underappreciated role in alcohol dependence.

                Precise targeting of deep brain structures in humans and large animal models has been a challenge for neuroscientists. Conventional protocols used in animal models typically require large access chambers which are prone to infection and involve assembly and implantation of complex microdrives for semi-chronic applications. Here we present a methodology for improving targeting of subcortical structures in large animals such as macaque monkeys, using image guided neuronavigation. Design of custom cranial caps allowed for incorporation of stable fiducial markers, required for increased targeting accuracy in neuronavigation procedures, resulting in an average targeting error of 1.6 mm over three implantations. Incorporation of anchor bolt chambers, commonly used in human neurosurgery, provided a minimally invasive entrance to the brain parenchyma, allowing for chronic recordings. By leveraging existing 3D printing technology, we fabricated an anchor bolt-mounted microdrive for semi-chronic applications. Our protocol leverages commercially available tools for implantation, decreases the risk of infection and complications of open craniotomies, and improves the accuracy and precision of chronic electrode implantations targeting deep brain structures in large animal models.

                Preclinical models of neurodevelopmental disorders typically use single inbred strains which fail to capture human genetic and symptom heterogeneity that is common clinically. We tested if systematically modeling human genetic diversity in mouse genetic reference panels would recapitulate population and individual differences in responses to a syndromic mutation in the high-confidence autism risk gene, CHD8. Trait disruptions mimicked those seen in human populations, including high penetrance of macrocephaly and disrupted behavior, but with robust strain and sex differences. For every trait, some strains exhibited a range of large effect size disruptions, sometimes in opposite directions, and remarkably others expressed resilience. Thus, systematically introducing genetic diversity into mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders provides a better framework for discovering individual differences in symptom etiologies and improved treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mutation in the TRKB cholesterol recognition site that blocks antidepressant binding does not influence the basal or BDNF-stimulated activation of TRKB</a></h4>

              
                Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) acting upon its receptor Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 2 (NTRK2, TRKB) plays a central role in the development and maintenance of synaptic function and activity- or drug-induced plasticity. TRKB possesses an inverted cholesterol-recognition and alignment consensus sequence (CARC), suggesting this receptor can act as a cholesterol sensor. We have recently shown that antidepressants drugs directly bind to the CARC domain of TRKB dimers, and that this binding as well as biochemical and behavioral responses to antidepressants are lost with a mutation in the TRKB CARC motif (Y433F). However, it is not clear if this mutation can also compromise the receptor function and lead to behavioral alterations. Here, we observed that Y433F mutation does not alter BDNF binding to TRKB, or BDNF-induced dimerization of TRKB. In this line, primary cultures from embryos of heterozygous Y433F mutant mice (hTRKB.Y433F) are responsive to BDNF-induced activation of TRKB, and samples from adult mice do not show any difference on TRKB activation compared to wild-type littermates (TRKB.wt). The behavioral phenotype of hTRKB.Y433F mice is indistinguishable from the wild-type mice in cued fear conditioning, contextual discrimination task or the elevated plus maze, whereas mice heterozygous to BDNF null allele show a phenotype in context discrimination task. Taken together, our results indicate that Y433F mutation in the TRKB CARC motif does not show signs of loss-of-function of BDNF responses, while antidepressant binding to TRKB and responses to antidepressants are lost in Y433F mutants, making them an interesting mouse model for antidepressant research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Input variability taps on invariant representations to enable generalization in visual perceptual learning</a></h4>

              
                Stimulus and location specificity are long considered hallmarks of visual perceptual learning. This renders visual perceptual learning distinct from other forms of learning, where generalization can be more easily attained, and unsuitable for practical applications, where generalization is key. Based on hypotheses derived from the structure of the visual system, we test here whether stimulus variability can unlock generalization in perceptual learning. We train subjects in orientation discrimination, while we vary the amount of variability in a task-irrelevant feature, spatial frequency. We find that independently of task difficulty, this manipulation enables generalization of learning to new stimuli and locations, while not negatively affecting the overall amount of learning on the task. We then use deep neural networks which recapitulate our findings in humans to investigate how variability unlocks generalization. We find that networks develop invariance to the task-irrelevant feature when trained with variable inputs. The degree of learned invariance strongly predicts generalization. A reliance on invariant representations can explain variability-induced generalization in visual perceptual learning, suggests new targets for understanding the neural basis of perceptual learning in high-order visual cortex, and presents an easy to implement modification of common training paradigms that may benefit practical applications.

                The auditory nerve (AN) compound action potential (CAP) is an important tool for assessing auditory disorders and monitoring the health of the auditory periphery during surgical procedures. The CAP has been mathematically conceptualized as the convolution of a unit response (UR) waveform with the firing rate of a population of AN fibers. Here, an approach for predicting experimentally recorded CAPs in humans is proposed, which involves the use of human-based computational models to simulate AN activity. CAPs elicited by clicks, chirps, and amplitude-modulated carriers were simulated and compared with empirically recorded CAPs from human subjects. In addition, narrowband CAPs derived from noise-masked clicks and tone bursts were simulated. Many morphological, temporal, and spectral aspects of human CAPs were captured by the simulations for all stimuli tested. These findings support the use of model simulations of the human CAP to refine existing human-based models of the auditory periphery, aid in the design and analysis of auditory experiments, and predict the effects of hearing loss, synaptopathy, and other auditory disorders on the human CAP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Impact of Task Context on Predicting Finger Movements in a Brain-Machine Interface</a></h4>

              
                A key factor in the clinical translation of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) for restoring hand motor function will be their robustness to changes in a task. With functional electrical stimulation (FES) for example, the patient's own hand will be used to produce a wide range of forces in otherwise similar movements. To investigate the impact of task changes on BMI performance, we trained two rhesus macaques to control a virtual hand with their physical hand while we added springs to each finger group (index or middle-ring-small) or altered their wrist posture. Using simultaneously recorded intracortical neural activity, finger positions, and electromyography, we found that predicting finger kinematics and finger-related muscle activations across contexts led to significant increases in prediction error, especially for muscle activations. However, with respect to online BMI control of the virtual hand, changing either training task context or the hand's physical context during online control had little effect on online performance. We explain this dichotomy by showing that the structure of neural population activity remained similar in new contexts, which could allow for fast adjustment online. Additionally, we found that neural activity shifted trajectories proportional to the required muscle activation in new contexts, possibly explaining biased kinematic predictions and suggesting a feature that could help predict different magnitude muscle activations while producing similar kinematics.

                Existing intracortical brain computer interfaces (iBCIs) transform neural activity into control signals capable of restoring movement to persons with paralysis. However, the accuracy of the "decoder" at the heart of the iBCI typically degrades over time due to turnover of recorded neurons. To compensate, decoders can be recalibrated, but this requires the user to spend extra time and effort to provide the necessary data, then learn the new dynamics. As the recorded neurons change, one can think of the underlying movement intent signal being expressed in changing coordinates. If a mapping can be computed between the different coordinate systems, it may be possible to stabilize the original decoder's mapping from brain to behavior without recalibration. We previously proposed a method based on Generalized Adversarial Networks (GANs), called "Adversarial Domain Adaptation Network" (ADAN), which aligns the distributions of latent signals within underlying low-dimensional neural manifolds. However, ADAN was tested on only a very limited dataset. Here we propose a method based on Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (Cycle-GAN), which aligns the distributions of the full-dimensional neural recordings. We tested both Cycle-GAN and ADAN on data from multiple monkeys and behaviors and compared them to a linear method based on Procrustes Alignment of axes provided by Factor Analysis (PAF). Both GAN-based methods outperformed PAF. Cycle-GAN and ADAN (like PAF) are unsupervised and require little data, making them practical in real life. Overall, Cycle-GAN had the best performance and was easier to train and more robust than ADAN, making it ideal for stabilizing iBCI systems over time.

                Sensory processing consists in the integration and interpretation of somatosensory information. It builds upon proprioception but is a distinct function requiring complex processing by the brain over time. Currently little is known about the effect of aging on sensory processing ability, nor the influence of other covariates such as motor function, proprioception, or cognition. In this study, we measured upper limb passive and active sensory processing, motor function, proprioception, and cognition in 40 healthy younger adults and 54 older adults. We analyzed age differences across all measures and evaluated the influence of covariates on sensory processing through regression. Our results showed larger effect sizes for age differences in sensory processing (r=0.39-0.40) compared to motor function (r=0.18-0.22) and proprioception (r=0.10-0.27), but smaller than for cognition (r=0.56-0.63). Aside from age, we found no evidence that sensory processing performance was influenced by motor function or proprioception, but active sensory processing was influenced by cognition ({beta}=0.32-0.46). In conclusion, sensory processing showed an age-related decline, while some proprioceptive and motor abilities were preserved across age.

                The brains state of arousal influences cognitive functioning and mental well-being. It is controlled by several neuromodulatory nuclei in the brainstem and, particularly, by the locus coeruleus (LC). The LC is the main source of noradrenaline (NA) in the central nervous system where it exerts powerful effects on neural processing and autonomic function. Here, we investigate whether human participants can gain volitional control of their brains arousal state using a new neurofeedback approach which exploits the mechanism that the eyes pupil diameter provides an indirect readout of arousal if light conditions are controlled. We show that pupil-based neurofeedback training is essential for learning how to self-regulate pupil size. Once acquired, pupil self-regulation significantly modulates neuromodulatory brainstem centers involved in arousal control and particularly the LC-NA system when carefully measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Further, it modulates heart rate, a cardiovascular marker of autonomic function, and it has a significant effect on behavior and specific psychophysiological responses during an oddball task, an attention task that has been shown to be evoke stimulus-dependent LC-NA activity. Considering the modulatory effects of the LC-NA system and other arousal-regulating centers on cognitive functioning and various behaviors including stress-related responses, pupil-based neurofeedback has a tremendous potential to be translated to behavioral and clinical applications across various domains.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of stimulus timing on the acquisition of an olfactory working memory task in head-fixed mice</a></h4>

              
                Knowing what factors affect the acquisition of a behavioural task is central to understanding the mechanisms of learning and memory. It also has practical implications, as animal behavioural experiments used to probe cognitive functions often require long training durations. Delayed Match (or Non-Match)-to-Sample (DMS/DNMS) tasks are relatively complex tasks used to study working memory and sensory perception, but their use in the mouse remains hampered by the lengthy training involved. In this study, we assessed two aspects of stimulus timing on the acquisition of an olfactory DNMS task: how the sample-test odour delay durations and the reward timing affect the acquisition rate. We demonstrate that head-fixed mice learn to perform an olfactory DNMS task more quickly when the initial training uses a shorter sample-test odour delay without detectable loss of generalisability. Unexpectedly, we observed a slower task acquisition when the odour-reward interval was shorter. This effect was accompanied by a shortening of reaction times and more frequent sporadic licking. Analysis of this result using a drift-diffusion model indicated that a primary consequence of early reward delivery is a lower decision bound. Since an accurate performance with a lower decision bound requires greater discriminability in the sensory representations, this may underlie the slower learning rate with early reward arrival. Together, our results reflect the possible effects of stimulus timing on stimulus encoding and its consequence on the acquisition of a complex task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia antagonistically influence cortical activity and perceptual decisions</a></h4>

              
                The striatum, input nucleus of the basal ganglia, receives topographically organized input from the cortex and gives rise to the direct and indirect pathways with antagonistic effects on the output of the basal ganglia. We optogenetically stimulated the direct and indirect pathways in mice and measured their influence on perceptual decisions and neuronal activity in the cortex. In a task in which mice had to detect a visual stimulus, unilateral direct-pathway stimulation increased the probability of lick responses to the non-stimulated side and increased cortical activity globally. In contrast, indirect-pathway stimulation increased the probability of licks to the stimulated side and decreased activity in visual cortical areas. To probe the possible role of the two pathways in working memory, we trained the mice to report the location of a stimulus with licking one of two spouts, after a memory delay. Direct-pathway stimulation prior to and during the memory delay enhanced both the neural representation of a contralateral visual stimulus and the number of contraversive choices, whereas indirect-pathway stimulation had the opposite effects, in accordance with an antagonistic influence of the direct and indirect pathways on licking direction. Our results demonstrate how these two pathways influence perceptual decisions and working memories, and modify activity in the cerebral cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cognitive effects of thalamostriatal degeneration are ameliorated by normalizing striatal cholinergic activity</a></h4>

              
                The loss of neurons in parafascicular thalamus (Pf) and of their inputs to dorsomedial striatum (DMS) are associated with Lewy body disease (LBD) and Parkinsons disease dementia (PDD) and have been linked to the effects of neuroinflammation. In rats, these inputs regulate the function of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) that are necessary for the flexible encoding of the action-outcome (AO) associations for goal-directed action. We found that these inputs modify the encoding, not retrieval, of new AO associations and cause burst-pause firing of CINs in the DMS during AO remapping. These adaptive effects were abolished by neuroinflammation in the Pf, resulting in the loss of goal-directed control when the rats were required to update AO associations after a change in contingency. We found that the neuronal and behavioral deficits induced by inflammation in the Pf were rescued by administration of selegiline, a MAO-B inhibitor that we found also enhances ATPase activity in CINs, suggesting a potential treatment for cognitive deficits associated with inflammation affecting the function of midline thalamic nuclei and related structures.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stimulation of the muscarinic receptor M4 activates quiescent neural precursor cells and ameliorates medial septum cholinergic lesion-induced impairments in adult hippocampal neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Cholinergic signaling plays a crucial role in the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent cognitive and mood-related functions. However, the contribution of basal forebrain medial septum (MS) and diagonal band of Broca (DBB) cholinergic neurons that innervate the hippocampus and the identity of the cholinergic receptor(s) that regulate the production and maturation of new neurons are not completely understood. Using a targeted, selective ablation approach, we show that MS/DBB cholinergic neurons support both the survival and morphological maturation of adult-born neurons in the mouse hippocampus. We demonstrate that the muscarinic acetycholine receptor subtype M4 (M4 mAChR) is expressed on a population of quiescent neural precursor cells (NPCs) and that its pharmacological stimulation via intra-hippocampal or systemic administration of M4-selective modulators leads to their activation, thereby enhancing neurogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the activation of M4 mAChR-expressing quiescent NPCs ameliorates the MS/DBB cholinergic lesion-induced decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis. In contrast, the impairment in the morphological maturation of adult-born neurons due to MS/DBB cholinergic neuron loss is further exacerbated by the systemic administration of an M4-selective allosteric potentiator. These findings reveal novel and stage-specific roles of cholinergic signaling in regulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis. They also uncouple the positive role of selective M4 potentiators in enhancing the production of new neurons from the M4-induced inhibition of their morphological maturation, at least in the context of cholinergic dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fan cells in lateral entorhinal cortex directly influence medial entorhinal cortex through synaptic connections in layer 1</a></h4>

              
                Standard models for spatial and episodic memory suggest that the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) send parallel independent inputs to the hippocampus, each carrying different types of information. Here, we evaluate the possibility that information is integrated between divisions of the entorhinal cortex prior to reaching the hippocampus. We demonstrate that fan cells in layer 2 (L2) of LEC that receive neocortical inputs, and that project to the hippocampal dentate gyrus, also send axon collaterals to layer 1 (L1) of the MEC. Activation of fan cell inputs evokes monosynaptic glutamatergic excitation of stellate and pyramidal cells in L2 of the MEC, typically followed by inhibition that contains fast and slow components mediated by GABAA and GABAB receptors, respectively. Fan cell inputs also directly activate interneurons in L1 and L2 of MEC, with synaptic connections from L1 interneurons accounting for slow feedforward inhibition of L2 principal cell populations. The relative strength of excitation and inhibition following fan cell activation differs substantially between neurons and is largely independent of anatomical location. Our results demonstrate that the LEC, in addition to directly influencing the hippocampus, can activate or inhibit major hippocampal inputs arising from the MEC. Thus, local circuits in the superficial MEC may combine spatial information with sensory and higher order signals from the LEC, providing a substrate for integration of what and where components of episodic memories.

                Aims: Attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by dopaminergic dysfunction. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the link between dopaminergic deficit and neuroinflammation underlying ADHD symptoms. Subjects and Treatment: We used a validated ADHD mice model, that involves perinatal 6-OHDA lesion. Animals were treated with 20mg/L (drinking water) of Abscisic acid (ABA) for one month. We tested behaviour (learning and memory, anxiety, social interactions, and pain) in both females and male mice, in all eight groups (control and lesioned, with/without ABA). Postmortem, we analyzed microglia morphology and Ape1 expression in specific brain areas related to the descending pain inhibitory pathway. Results: In females, dopaminergic deficit increased pain sensitivity, but not hyperactivity, in contrast to males. This behaviour was associated with inflammatory microglia and lower Ape1 levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and posterior insula cortex (IC). ABA treatment reduced inflammation and alleviated pain. In males, ABA reduced hyperactivity, but had no significant effect on inflammation. Conclusions: This is the first study proving a sex-dependent association between dopamine dysfunction and inflammation in specific brain areas, leading to different behavior outcomes in a mouse model of ADHD. These findings provide new clues for potential treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deep neural network algorithms for noise reduction and their application to cochlear implants</a></h4>

              
                Despite excellent performance in quiet, cochlear implants (CIs) only partially restore normal levels of intelligibility in noisy settings. Recent developments in machine learning have resulted in deep neural network (DNN) models that achieve noteworthy performance in speech enhancement and separation tasks. However, there are no commercially available CI audio processors that utilize DNN models for noise reduction. We implemented two DNN models intended for applications in CIs: (1) a recurrent neural network (RNN), which is a lightweight template model, and (2) SepFormer, which is the current top-performing speech separation model in the literature. The models were trained with a custom training dataset (30 hours) that included four configurations: speech in non-speech noise and speech in 1-talker, 2-talker, and 4-talker speech babble backgrounds. The enhancement of the target speech (or the suppression of the noise) by the models was evaluated by commonly used acoustic evaluation metrics of quality and intelligibility, including (1) signal-to-distortion ratio, (2) ``perceptual'' evaluation of speech quality, and (3) short-time objective intelligibility. Both DNN models yielded significant improvements in all acoustic metrics tested. The two DNN models were also evaluated with thirteen CI users using two types of background noise: (1) CCITT noise (speech-shaped stationary noise) and (2) 2-talker babble. Significant improvements in speech intelligibility were observed when the noisy speech was processed by the models, compared to the unprocessed conditions. This work serves as a proof of concept for the application of DNN technology in CIs for improved listening experience and speech comprehension in noisy environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning-dependent evolution of odor mixture representations in piriform cortex</a></h4>

              
                Rodents can learn from exposure to rewarding odors to make better and quicker decisions. The piriform cortex is thought to be important for learning complex odor associations, however it is not understood exactly how it learns to remember discriminations between many, sometimes overlapping, odor mixtures. We investigated how odor mixtures are represented in the posterior piriform cortex (pPC) of mice while they learn to discriminate a unique target odor mixture against hundreds of nontarget mixtures. We find that a significant proportion of pPC neurons discriminate between the target and all other nontarget odor mixtures. Neurons that prefer the target odor mixture tend to respond with brief increases in firing rate at odor onset compared to other neurons, which exhibit sustained and/or decreased firing. We allowed mice to continue training after they had reached high levels of performance and find that pPC neurons become more selective for target odor mixtures as well as for randomly chosen repeated nontarget odor mixtures that mice did not have to discriminate from other nontargets. These single unit changes during overtraining are accompanied by better categorization decoding at the population level, even though behavioral metrics of mice such as reward rate and latency to respond do not change. However, when difficult ambiguous trial types are introduced, the robustness of the target selectivity is correlated with better performance on the difficult trials. Taken together, these data reveal pPC as a dynamic and robust system that can optimize for both current and possible future task demands at once.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Classification of Human Chronotype Based on fMRINetwork-Based Statistics</a></h4>

              
                Chronotype - the relationship between the internal circadian physiology of an individual and the external 24-hour light-dark cycle - is increasingly implicated in mental health and cognition. Individuals presenting with a late chronotype have an increased likelihood of developing depression, and can display reduced cognitive performance during the societal 9-5 day. However, the interplay between physiological rhythms and the brain networks that underpin cognition and mental health are not well understood. To address this issue, we use resting state fMRI collected from 16 people with an early chronotype and 22 people with a late chronotype to study if differentiable information about chronotype is embedded in functional brain networks. We develop a classifier utilising the Network Based-Statistic (NBS) methodology, using rigorous selection criteria to select t-statistic thresholds within the NBS approach. We find significant differences in functional networks measured in early and late chronotypes and describe conditions under which the classifier achieves 97.3% accuracy. Revealing differences in functional brain networks based on extreme chronotype suggests future avenues of research that may ultimately better characterise the relationship between internal physiology, external perturbations, brain networks and disease.

                In contrast to mammals, the avian cochlea, specifically the basilar papilla, can regenerate sensory hair cells, which involves fate conversion of supporting cells to hair cells. To determine the mechanisms for converting supporting cells to hair cells, we used single-cell RNA sequencing during hair cell regeneration in explant cultures of chick basilar papillae. We identified dynamic changes in the gene expression of supporting cells, and the pseudotime trajectory analysis demonstrated the stepwise fate conversion from supporting cells to hair cells. Initially, supporting cell identity was erased and transition to the precursor state occurred. A subsequent gain in hair cell identity progressed together with downregulation of precursor-state genes. Transforming growth factor beta receptor 1-mediated signaling was involved in induction of the initial step, and its inhibition resulted in suppression of hair cell regeneration. Our data provide new insights for understanding fate conversion from supporting cells to hair cells in avian basilar papillae.

Recent studies have identified the possibility to extract these brain signatures from the temporal rich dynamics of resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. However, to what extent MEG signatures constitute a marker of human identifiability when engaged in task-related behavior remains an open question. Here, using MEG data from naturalistic and neurophysiological tasks, we show that identification improves in tasks relative to resting-state, providing compelling evidence for a task dependent axis of MEG signatures. Notably, improvements in identifiability were more prominent in strictly controlled tasks. Lastly, the brain regions contributing most towards individual identification were also modified when engaged in task activities. We hope that this investigation advances our understanding of the driving factors behind brain identification from MEG signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulation of motor vigour by expectation of reward probability trial-by-trial is preserved in healthy ageing and Parkinson's disease patients</a></h4>

              
                Motor improvements, such as faster movement times or increased velocity, have been consistently associated with reward magnitude in deterministic contexts. Yet whether individual inferences on reward probability influence motor vigour dynamically remains undetermined. Here we investigated how dynamically inferring volatile action-reward contingencies modulated motor performance trial-by-trial in healthy younger (HYA, 37) and older adults (HOA, 37), and in medicated Parkinson's Disease patients (PD, 20). We conducted an online study that coupled a standard one-armed bandit decision-making paradigm with a motor sequence task and used a validated hierarchical Bayesian model to fit trial-by-trial data. Our results showed that stronger predictions about the tendency of the action-reward contingency led to faster performance tempo on a trial-by-trial basis without modulating reaction times (RT). Using Bayesian linear mixed models, we demonstrated in HYA, HOA and PD a similar sensitivity (slope) of execution tempo to inferences about the reward probabilities, despite HOA and PD being generally slower than HYA (intercept). In a second experiment in HYA (39), we additionally showed that subjective inferences about credit assignment - whether lack of reward is associated with an incorrect decision or execution error - led to a similar modulation of motor vigour by reward expectation. Our study is the first to reveal that the dynamic updating of beliefs about volatile action-reward contingencies positively biases motor performance through faster execution tempo, without affecting RT. We also provide novel evidence for a preserved sensitivity of motor vigour to inferences about the action-reward mapping in ageing and medicated PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural diversity quenches the dynamic volatility of balanced neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Heterogeneity is the norm in biology. The brain is no different: neuronal cell-types are myriad, reflected through their cellular morphology, type, excitability, connectivity motifs and ion channel distributions. While this biophysical diversity enriches neural systems' dynamical repertoire, it remains challenging to reconcile with the robustness and persistence of brain function over time. To better understand the relationship between heterogeneity and resilience, we analyzed both analytically and numerically a non-linear sparse neural network with balanced excitatory and inhibitory connections evolving over long time scales. We examined how neural diversity expressed as excitability heterogeneity in this network influences its dynamic volatility (i.e., its susceptibility to critical transitions). We exposed this network to slowly-varying modulatory fluctuations, continuously interrogating its stability and resilience. Our results show that excitability heterogeneity implements a homeostatic control mechanism tuning network stability in a context-dependent way. Such diversity was also found to enhance network resilience, quenching the volatility of its dynamics, effectively making the system independent of changes in many control parameters, such as population size, connection probability, strength and variability of synaptic weights as well as modulatory drive. Taken together, these results highlight the fundamental role played by cell-type heterogeneity in the robustness of brain function in the face of change.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid specification of human pluripotent stem cells to functional astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are essential for the formation and maintenance of neural networks through metabolic support, facilitation of synaptic function, and optimization of electrophysiological activity. However, a major technical challenge for investigating astrocyte function and disease-related pathophysiology has been the limited ability to obtain functional human astrocytes. Here we present a novel method to efficiently differentiate human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neural progenitors to functional astrocytes in 28 days using a culture medium containing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). This approach yields highly pure populations of astrocytes expressing canonical astrocyte markers, which we confirmed by immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and RNA sequencing. Human PSC-derived astrocytes efficiently buffer glutamate and robustly support neural network activity. Co-cultures of hPSC-derived astrocytes and neurons on multi-electrode arrays generated robust network activity within 2 days and synchronous network bursts after 6 days. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings revealed an increased frequency of postsynaptic currents in human hPSC-derived neurons co-cultured with hPSC-derived versus primary rodent astrocytes, consistent with a corresponding increase in synapse density. Furthermore, hPSC-derived astrocytes retained their hominid morphology when transplanted into a mouse brain. In conclusion, we present a novel protocol to obtain functional astrocytes from human pluripotent stem cells, providing a platform for investigating human astrocyte function and neuronal-glial interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Relating local connectivity and global dynamics in recurrent excitatory-inhibitory networks</a></h4>

              
                How the connectivity of cortical networks determines the neural dynamics and the resulting computations is one of the key questions in neuroscience. Previous works have pursued two complementary strategies to quantify the structure in connectivity, by specifying either the local statistics of connectivity motifs between small groups of neurons, or by defining network-wide low-rank patterns of connectivity that determine the resulting low-dimensional dynamics. A direct relationship between these two approaches is however currently missing, and in particular it remains to be clarified how local connectivity statistics are related to the global connectivity structure and shape the low-dimensional activity. To bridge this gap, here we develop a method for mapping local connectivity statistics onto an approximate global low-rank structure. Our method rests on approximating the global connectivity matrix using dominant eigenvectors, which we compute using perturbation theory for random matrices. This approach demonstrates that multi-population networks defined from local connectivity properties can in general be approximated by low-rank connectivity with Gaussian-mixture statistics. We specifically apply this method to excitatory-inhibitory networks, and show that it leads to accurate predictions for both the low-dimensional dynamics, and for the activity of individual neurons. Altogether, our approach allows us to disentangle the effects of mean connectivity and reciprocal motifs on the global recurrent feedback, and provides an intuitive picture of how local connectivity shapes global network dynamics.

                Ischemic stroke results in sudden blood flow cessation, thus, unmet energy requirements. Although the clotted artery can be recanalized and blood flow is restored, brain perfusion may not be fully attained due to microvascular constrictions. Under glucose-deprived and hypoxic conditions, glucose derived from the glycogen stored around peri-microvascular astrocyte end-feet may serve as an emergency fuel to meet the metabolic demand during the acute period of ischemic stroke. To elucidate the impact of glycogen utilization on brain microcirculation, we administered glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-arabinitol (DAB) intracerebroventricularly. Transgenic mice in which glycogen synthase-1 expression was selectively knocked out in central nervous system (GYS1Nestin-KO) were also used. Both approaches caused microvascular constrictions mediated by CD13-positive pericyte contractions. When mice with disrupted glycogen utilization were subjected to MCA ischemia, pericyte-mediated microvascular constrictions and the infarct volumes were further increased compared to untreated controls or wild-type littermates. Peri-microvascular glycogen depletions were highly correlated with microvascular constrictions as shown by Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining and immunolabeling with anti-glycogen antibodies. Imaging of regional cortical blood flow changes during ischemia disclosed severely compromised blood flow dynamics in mice with disrupted glycogen metabolism. In conclusion, disrupting glycogen utilization causes ischemic-like microvascular constrictions under non-ischemic circumstances and increases susceptibility to brain ischemia. Understanding the role of glycogen at neurogliovascular level in brain may provide novel insight to the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke and therapeutic opportunities.

	<p>Mind wandering (MW) is a common feature of the human experience occurring when our attention shifts from the task at hand to inner thoughts. MW seems to be often future-oriented and could be used to help people to carry out their planned actions (Prospective Memory PM). Here, we tested the link between MW and the ability to perform PM intentions. We assessed MW and PM over 15 days using experience-sampling probes via mobile phone (226 participants) associated with a naturalistic PM task. We confirmed that MW occupies a significant proportion of our mental activity (40%). This time seems to be mainly used to project ourselves into the future (64%), whether to anticipate and imagine the long term (20%) or to plan daily obligations (44%). Intriguingly, only past-oriented thoughts (9%) predict the PM performance. We discuss the possible functional role played by MW in maintaining intentions in mind.</p>

	<p>Background: Glioma is one of the major health problems worldwide. Biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of Glioma are still needed. Methods: The transcriptome data and clinic information on Glioma were obtained from the CGGA, TCGA, GDC, and GEO databases. The immune infiltration status in the clusters was compared. The genes with differential expression were identified, and a prognostic model was developed. Several assays were used to detect RPH3A&amp;amp;rsquo;s role in Glioma cells, including CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, and transwell migration assay. Results: Lower Grade Glioma (LGG) was divided into two clusters. The immune infiltration difference was observed between the two clusters. We screened for genes that differed between the two groups. WGCNA was used to construct a co-expressed network using the DEGs, and four co-expressed modules were identified, which are blue, green, grey, and yellow modules. High-risk patients have a lower overall survival rate than low-risk patients. In addition, the risk score is associated with histological subtypes. Finally, the role of RPH3A was detected. The overexpression of RPH3A in LGG cells can significantly inhibit cell proliferation and migration and regulate EMT-regulated proteins. Conclusion: Our study developed a metabolic-related model for the prognosis of Glioma cells. RPH3A is a potential therapeutic target for Glioma.</p>

	<p>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) causes the release of several neuromodulators, leading to cortical activation and deactivation. The resulting preparatory cortical plasticity can be used to increase learning and memory in both rats and humans. The effects of VNS on cognition have mostly been studied either in animal models of different pathologies, and/or after extended VNS. Considerably less is known about the effects of acute VNS. Here, we examined the effects of acute VNS on short-term memory and cognitive flexibility in na&amp;amp;iuml;ve rats, using three cognitive tasks that require comparatively brief (single session) training periods. In all tasks, VNS was delivered immediately before or during the testing phase. We used a rule-shifting task to test cognitive flexibility, a novel object recognition task to measure short-term object memory, and a delayed spontaneous alternation task to measure spatial short-term memory. We also analyzed exploratory behavior in an elevated plus maze to determine the effects of acute VNS on anxiety. Our results indicate that acute VNS can improve memory and cognitive flexibility relative to Sham-stimulation, and these effects are independent of unspecific VNS-induced changes in locomotion or anxiety.</p>

	<p>Deficits in social cognition and function are characteristic of dementia, commonly accompanied by a loss of awareness of the presence or extent of these deficits. This lack of awareness can impair social relationships, increase patients&amp;amp;rsquo; and carers&amp;amp;rsquo; burden, and contribute to increased rates of institutionalization. Despite clinical importance, neural correlates of this complex phenomenon remain unclear. We conducted a systematic search of five electronic databases to identify functional and structural neuroimaging studies investigating the neural correlates of impaired awareness of social cognition and function in any dementia type. We rated study quality and conducted a narrative synthesis of the results of the eight studies that met the predefined eligibility criteria. Across these studies, deficits in awareness of impairments in social cognition and function were associated with structural or functional abnormalities in the frontal pole, orbitofrontal cortex, temporal pole, middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and insula. Several identified regions overlap with established neural correlates of social cognition. More research is needed to understand awareness of social cognition and function and how this becomes impaired in dementia to improve neuroscientific understanding, aid the identification of this problematic symptom, and target interventions to reduce burden and improve care.</p>

	<p>Cognitive effort is intrinsically linked to task difficulty, intelligence, and mental toughness. Intelligence reflects an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive aptitude, whereas mental toughness (MT) reflects an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s resilience in pursuing success. Research shows that parietal alpha oscillations are associated with changes in task difficulty. Critically, it remains unclear whether parietal alpha oscillations are modulated by intelligence and MT as a personality trait. We examined event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) of alpha oscillations associated with encoding, retention, and recognition in the Sternberg task in relation to intelligence and mental toughness. Eighty participants completed the Sternberg task with 3, 4, 5 and 6 digits, Raven Standard Progressive Matrices test and an MT questionnaire. A positive dependence on difficulty was observed for all studied oscillatory effects (t = &amp;amp;minus;8.497, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; t = 2.806, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.005; t = &amp;amp;minus;2.103, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The influence of Raven intelligence was observed for encoding-related alpha ERD (t = &amp;amp;minus;2.02, p = 0.049). The influence of MT was observed only for difficult conditions in recognition-related alpha ERD (t = &amp;amp;minus;3.282, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.005). Findings indicate that the modulation of alpha rhythm related to encoding, retention and recognition may be interpreted as correlates of cognitive effort modulation. Specifically, results suggest that effort related to encoding depends on intelligence, whereas recognition-related effort level depends on mental toughness.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Increased levels of inflammatory proteins have been observed in brain and plasma samples of AD patients; however, it is not clear if other serum proteins correlate to the development or disease progression of AD. (2) Methods: Micro-Western Array (MWA) is a high-throughput antibody-based proteomics system which allows detection of the expression levels of 24&amp;amp;ndash;96 different proteins within 6&amp;amp;ndash;30 samples simultaneously. We applied MWA to explore potential serum protein biomarkers correlated to the development and progression of AD by examining the difference in serum protein profile of 31 healthy control (HC), 30 patients with AD and 30 patients&amp;amp;rsquo; adult children (ACS). (3) Results: Compared to HC, AD and ACS express similar pattern of serum proteins, including higher protein levels of ABCA1, ABCG1, SREBP1 and LXR&amp;amp;beta; but lower protein levels of ApoD, ApoE, ApoH, c_Myc, COX2 and Hippo-YAP signaling proteins. AD patients had higher serum levels of ABCG1, ApoD, ApoH, COX2, LXR&amp;amp;alpha; and YAP, but lower levels of ABCA1, ApoE, c_Myc, LATS1, MST1, MST2, Nanog, NF&amp;amp;kappa;B_p50, PPAR&amp;amp;gamma; and SREBP2, as compared to ACS. Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analysis revealed that the protein expression level of ApoE, c_Myc, LATS1, MST2, NF&amp;amp;kappa;B p50, PPAR&amp;amp;gamma; and SREBP1 was negatively correlated to age, while that of ApoE, c_Myc, LATS1, MST1, MST2, Nanog, NF&amp;amp;kappa;B p50 and PPAR&amp;amp;gamma; was positively correlated to age. (4) Conclusions: We identified a group of serum proteins which may correlate to disease progression of AD and can be potential diagnostic serum protein biomarkers.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Breastfeeding confers robust benefits to offspring development in terms of growth, immunity, and neurophysiology. Similarly, improving environmental complexity, i.e., environmental enrichment (EE), contributes developmental advantages to both humans and laboratory animal models. However, the impact of environmental context on maternal care and milk quality has not been thoroughly evaluated, nor are the biological underpinnings of EE on offspring development understood. Here, Sprague Dawley rats were housed and bred in either EE or standard-housed (SD) conditions. EE dams gave birth to a larger number of pups, and litters were standardized and cross-fostered across groups on postnatal day (P)1. Maternal milk samples were then collected on P1 (transitional milk phase) and P10 (mature milk phase) for analysis. While EE dams spent less time nursing, postnatal enrichment exposure was associated with heavier offspring bodyweights. Milk from EE mothers had increased triglyceride levels, a greater microbiome diversity, and a significantly higher abundance of bacterial families related to bodyweight and energy metabolism. These differences reflected comparable transcriptomic changes at the genome-wide level. In addition to changes in lactational quality, we observed elevated levels of cannabinoid receptor 1 in the hypothalamus of EE dams, and sex-dependent and time-dependent effects of EE on offspring social behavior. Together, these results underscore the multidimensional impact of the combined neonatal and maternal environments on offspring development and maternal health. Moreover, they highlight potential deficiencies in the use of "gold standard" laboratory housing in the attempt to design translationally relevant animal models in biomedical research.</p>

                Education collaboration is important to increase the quality of human capital. South-South cooperation is conducted to exchange resources, technology, skills, and knowledge between southern countries. The purpose of this research is to investigate the collaboration between Indonesia and South Africa toward advancing South-South Cooperation in education. The data collection used in this qualitative research is an interview and literature study with 9 purposive informants from the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Indonesia Ministry of Education and Culture, and the Embassy of South Africa. The data were obtained within six months. The interview was primarily used to explore the roles and practices of government institutions and universities in fostering education collaboration and human resources development. In this study, the South-South Cooperation helps Indonesia address its educational needs. The result showed that most international education cooperation between both countries is agreed upon at the University-to-University level through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), facing less sustainable challenges and low impact. Therefore, an investment-led model, multi-stakeholder collaboration, and a tool to monitor and evaluate this process are needed to improve South-South Cooperation to achieve its goals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Neuro-immunological complications post COVID-19 vaccination: two case reports [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To add to the growing literature regarding the possible link between the onset of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BBE) and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines. Case reports: The first patient is a 38-year-old man that presented muscle weakness and an unsteady gait for a duration of one week. Initially, he developed an unsteady gait, then gradually worsening generalized muscle fatigue and ascending weakness in all limbs. He tested positive for GM1 and GQ1D antibodies, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine with contrast and nerve conduction study (NCS) results were both suggestive of acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). The second patient is a 54-year-old man that developed generalized fatigue and subjective fever associated with headache and blurry vision followed by bulbar dysfunction. During hospitalization, his consciousness level started to be affected and he developed ataxia with ophthalmoparesis. A diagnosis of BBE was made based on clinical, imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings. Conclusion: Since temporal relationships do not signify causation, we cannot draw any conclusions regarding the association between COVID-19 vaccines and these neurological disorders. However, it is vital that new cases are reported so that the knowledge base is built upon, and to increase healthcare workers’ vigilance for early signs of GBS or BBE.

                Background: The standardization and mechanism of action of Caesalpinia sappan as an anticancer agent are still lacking. This study aimed to understand the mechanism of action of  C,sappan extract as an anticancer agent. Methods: This study was conducted using the A549 lung cancer cell line to understand the mechanism of action of C. sappan extract as an anticancer agent. The cytotoxicity activity, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, protein-related apoptosis (i.e., BCL-2and BAX protein) assays, and RNA sequencing were performed level were measured. Moreover, the antioxidant activity, total flavonoids, and phenolics of C.sappan were also assessed. Results: C.sappan has strong antioxidant activity (22.14 ± 0.93 ppm) total flavonoid content of (529.3 ± 4.56 mgQE/g), and phenolics content of (923.37 ± 5 mgGAE/g). The C.sappan ethanol extract inhibited cancer cell growth and arrested at G0/G1 phase of cell cycle, inducing apoptosis by increasing BAX/BCL-2 protein ratio in A549 lung cancer cell line. Furthermore, results from RNA sequencing analysis showed that C.sappan ethanol extract caused downregulation of genes acting on mitochondrial function including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and respiration. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that C.sappan has the ability to inhibit cancer cell growth by inducing apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in A549 cells.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Practical identifiability analysis of a mechanistic model for the time to distant metastatic relapse and its application to renal cell carcinoma</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arturo Álvarez-Arenas, Wilfried Souleyreau, Andrea Emanuelli, Lindsay S. Cooley, Jean-Christophe Bernhard, Andreas Bikfalvi, Sebastien Benzekry</p>

Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) curves are widely used in oncology. They are classically analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator or agnostic statistical models from survival analysis. Here we report on a method to extract more information from DMFS curves using a mathematical model of primary tumor growth and metastatic dissemination. The model depends on two parameters, <i>α</i> and <i>μ</i>, respectively quantifying tumor growth and dissemination. We assumed these to be lognormally distributed in a patient population. We propose a method for identification of the parameters of these distributions based on least-squares minimization between the data and the simulated survival curve. We studied the practical identifiability of these parameters and found that including the percentage of patients with metastasis at diagnosis was critical to ensure robust estimation. We also studied the impact and identifiability of covariates and their coefficients in <i>α</i> and <i>μ</i>, either categorical or continuous, including various functional forms for the latter (threshold, linear or a combination of both). We found that both the functional form and the coefficients could be determined from DMFS curves. We then applied our model to a clinical dataset of metastatic relapse from kidney cancer with individual data of 105 patients. We show that the model was able to describe the data and illustrate our method to disentangle the impact of three covariates on DMFS: a categorical one (Führman grade) and two continuous ones (gene expressions of the macrophage mannose receptor 1 (MMR) and the G Protein-Coupled Receptor Class C Group 5 Member A (GPRC5a)gene). We found that all had an influence in metastasis dissemination (<i>μ</i>), but not on growth (<i>α</i>).

Special sessions are important parts of scientific meetings and conferences: They gather together researchers and students interested in a specific topic and can strongly contribute to the success of the conference itself. Moreover, they can be the first step for trainees and students to the organization of a scientific event. Organizing a special session, however, can be uneasy for beginners and students. Here, we provide ten simple rules to follow to organize a special session at a scientific conference.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Constructive connectomics: How neuronal axons get from here to there using gene-expression maps derived from their family trees</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stan Kerstjens, Gabriela Michel, Rodney J. Douglas</p>

During brain development, billions of axons must navigate over multiple spatial scales to reach specific neuronal targets, and so build the processing circuits that generate the intelligent behavior of animals. However, the limited information capacity of the zygotic genome puts a strong constraint on how, and which, axonal routes can be encoded. We propose and validate a mechanism of development that can provide an efficient encoding of this global wiring task. The key principle, confirmed through simulation, is that basic constraints on mitoses of neural stem cells—that mitotic daughters have similar gene expression to their parent and do not stray far from one another—induce a global hierarchical map of nested regions, each marked by the expression profile of its common progenitor population. Thus, a traversal of the lineal hierarchy generates a systematic sequence of expression profiles that traces a staged route, which growth cones can follow to their remote targets. We have analyzed gene expression data of developing and adult mouse brains published by the Allen Institute for Brain Science, and found them consistent with our simulations: gene expression indeed partitions the brain into a global spatial hierarchy of nested contiguous regions that is stable at least from embryonic day 11.5 to postnatal day 56. We use this experimental data to demonstrate that our axonal guidance algorithm is able to robustly extend arbors over long distances to specific targets, and that these connections result in a qualitatively plausible connectome. We conclude that, paradoxically, cell division may be the key to uniting the neurons of the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Archetypal Analysis for population genetics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Julia Gimbernat-Mayol, Albert Dominguez Mantes, Carlos D. Bustamante, Daniel Mas Montserrat, Alexander G. Ioannidis</p>

The estimation of genetic clusters using genomic data has application from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to demographic history to polygenic risk scores (PRS) and is expected to play an important role in the analyses of increasingly diverse, large-scale cohorts. However, existing methods are computationally-intensive, prohibitively so in the case of nationwide biobanks. Here we explore Archetypal Analysis as an efficient, unsupervised approach for identifying genetic clusters and for associating individuals with them. Such unsupervised approaches help avoid conflating socially constructed ethnic labels with genetic clusters by eliminating the need for exogenous training labels. We show that Archetypal Analysis yields similar cluster structure to existing unsupervised methods such as ADMIXTURE and provides interpretative advantages. More importantly, we show that since Archetypal Analysis can be used with lower-dimensional representations of genetic data, significant reductions in computational time and memory requirements are possible. When Archetypal Analysis is run in such a fashion, it takes several orders of magnitude less compute time than the current standard, ADMIXTURE. Finally, we demonstrate uses ranging across datasets from humans to canids.
