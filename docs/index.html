              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Oxytocin‐like receptor expression in evolutionarily conserved nodes of a vocal network associated with male courtship in a teleost fish</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptides, including oxytocin-like peptides, are a conserved group of hormones that regulate a wide range of social behaviors, including vocal communication. In the current study, we evaluate whether putative brain sites for the actions of isotocin (IT), the oxytocin (OT) homolog of teleost fishes, are associated with vocal courtship and circuitry in the plainfin midshipman fish (<i>Porichthys notatus</i>). During the breeding season, nesting males produce advertisement calls known as ‘hums’ to acoustically court females at night and attract them to nests. We first identify IT receptor (ITR) mRNA in evolutionarily conserved regions of the forebrain preoptic area (POA), anterior hypothalamus (AH), and midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), and in two topographically separate populations within the hindbrain vocal pattern generator– duration-coding vocal prepacemaker (VPP) and amplitude-coding vocal motor (VMN) nuclei that also innervate vocal muscles. We also verify that ITR expression overlaps known distribution sites of OT-like immunoreactive fibers. Next, using phosphorylated ribosomal subunit 6 (pS6) as a marker for activated neurons, we demonstrate that ITR-containing neurons in the anterior parvocellular POA, AH, PAG, VPP, and VMN are activated in humming males. Posterior parvocellular and magno/gigantocellular divisions of the POA remain constitutively active in non-humming males that are also in a reproductive state. Together with prior studies of midshipman fish and other vertebrates, our findings suggest that IT-signaling influences male courtship behavior, in part, by acting on brain regions that broadly influence behavioral state (POA) as well as the initiation (POA, PAG) and temporal structure (VPP, VMN) of advertisement hums.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) proteins (GSK3&alpha; and GSK3&beta;) are key mediators of signaling pathways, with crucial roles in coordinating fundamental biological processes during neural development. Here we show that the complete loss of GSK3 signaling in mouse retinal progenitors leads to microphthalmia with broad morphologic defects. A single wild-type allele of either <I>Gsk3&alpha;</I> or <I>Gsk3&beta;</I> is able to rescue this phenotype. In this genetic context, all cell types are present in a functional retina. However, we unexpectedly detected a large number of cells in the inner nuclear layer expressing retinal ganglion cell (RGC)-specific markers (called displaced RGCs, dRGCs) when at least one allele of <I>Gsk3&alpha;</I> is expressed. The excess of dRGCs leads to an increased number of axons projecting into the ipsilateral medial terminal nucleus, an area of the brain belonging to the non-image-forming visual circuit and poorly targeted by RGCs in wild-type retina. Transcriptome analysis and optomotor response assay suggest that at least a subset of dRGCs in <I>Gsk3</I> mutant mice are direction-selective RGCs. Our study thus uncovers a unique role of GSK3 in controlling the production of ganglion cells in the inner nuclear layer, which correspond to dRGCs, a rare and poorly characterized retinal cell type.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Type 2 Diabetes Factor Methylglyoxal Mediates Axon Initial Segment Shortening and Alters Neuronal Function at the Cellular and Network Levels</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Recent evidence suggests that alteration of axon initial segment (AIS) geometry (i.e., length or location along the axon) contributes to CNS dysfunction in neurological diseases. For example, AIS length is shorter in the prefrontal cortex of type 2 diabetic mice with cognitive impairment. To determine the key type 2 diabetes-related factor that produces AIS shortening we modified levels of insulin, glucose, or the reactive glucose metabolite methylglyoxal in cultures of dissociated cortices from male and female mice and quantified AIS geometry using immunofluorescent imaging of the AIS proteins AnkyrinG and &beta;IV spectrin. Neither insulin nor glucose modification altered AIS length. Exposure to 100 but not 1 or 10 &mu;<scp>m</scp> methylglyoxal for 24 h resulted in accumulation of the methylglyoxal-derived advanced glycation end-product hydroimidazolone and produced reversible AIS shortening without cell death. Methylglyoxal-evoked AIS shortening occurred in both excitatory and putative inhibitory neuron populations and in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX). In single-cell recordings resting membrane potential was depolarized at 0.5&ndash;3 h and returned to normal at 24 h. In multielectrode array (MEA) recordings methylglyoxal produced an immediate ~300% increase in spiking and bursting rates that returned to normal within 2 min, followed by a ~20% reduction of network activity at 0.5&ndash;3 h and restoration of activity to baseline levels at 24 h. AIS length was unchanged at 0.5&ndash;3 h despite the presence of depolarization and network activity reduction. Nevertheless, these results suggest that methylglyoxal could be a key mediator of AIS shortening and disruptor of neuronal function during type 2 diabetes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">3D-Printed Pacifier-Shaped Mouthpiece for fMRI-Compatible Gustometers</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Gustometers have made it possible to deliver liquids in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) settings for decades, and mouthpieces are a critical part of these taste delivery systems. Here, we propose an innovative 3D-printed fMRI mouthpiece inspired by children&rsquo;s pacifiers, allowing human participants to swallow while lying down in an MRI scanner. We used a large sample to validate the effectiveness of our method. The results suggest that the mouthpiece can be used to deliver taste stimuli by showing significant clusters of activation in the insular and piriform cortex, which are regions that have been consistently identified in taste processing. This mouthpiece fulfills several criteria guaranteeing a gustatory stimulus of quality, making the delivery precise and reliable. Moreover, this new pacifier-shaped design is simple and cheap to manufacture, hygienic, comfortable to keep in the mouth, and flexible to use in diverse cases. We hope that this new method will promote and facilitate the study of taste and flavor perception in the context of reward processing in affective neuroscience, and thus, help provide an integrative approach to the study of the emotional nature of rewards.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Photoreceptor cKO of OTX2 Enhances OTX2 Intercellular Transfer in the Retina and Causes Photophobia</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In the mature mouse retina, <I>Otx2</I> is expressed in both retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor (PR) cells, and <I>Otx2</I> knock-out (KO) in the RPE alone results in PR degeneration. To study the cell-autonomous function of OTX2 in PRs, we performed PR-specific <I>Otx2</I> KO (cKO) in adults. As expected, the protein disappears completely from PR nuclei but is still observed in PR inner and outer segments while its level concomitantly decreases in the RPE, suggesting a transfer of OTX2 from RPE to PRs in response to <I>Otx2</I> ablation in PRs. The ability of OTX2 to transfer from RPE to PRs was verified by viral expression of tagged-OTX2 in the RPE. Transferred OTX2 distributed across the PR cytoplasm, suggesting functions distinct from nuclear transcription regulation. PR-specific <I>Otx2</I> cKO did not alter the structure of the retina but impaired the translocation of PR arrestin-1 on illumination changes, making mice photophobic. RNA-seq analyses following <I>Otx2</I> KO revealed downregulation of genes involved in the cytoskeleton that might account for the arrestin-1 translocation defect, and of genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) and signaling factors that may participate in the enhanced transfer of OTX2. Interestingly, several RPE-specific OTX2 target genes involved in melanogenesis were downregulated, lending weight to a decrease of OTX2 levels in the RPE following PR-specific <I>Otx2</I> cKO. Our study reveals a new role of endogenous OTX2 in PR light adaptation and demonstrates the existence of OTX2 transfer from RPE to PR cells, which is increased on PR-specific <I>Otx2</I> ablation and might participate in PR neuroprotection.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Axonal CB1 Receptors Mediate Inhibitory Bouton Formation via cAMP Increase and PKA</a></h4>

              
                <p>Experience-dependent formation and removal of inhibitory synapses are essential throughout life. For instance, GABAergic synapses are removed to facilitate learning, and strong excitatory activity is accompanied by the formation of inhibitory synapses to maintain coordination between excitation and inhibition. We recently discovered that active dendrites trigger the growth of inhibitory synapses via CB1 receptor-mediated endocannabinoid signaling, but the underlying mechanism remained unclear. Using two-photon microscopy to monitor the formation of individual inhibitory boutons in hippocampal organotypic slices from mice (both sexes), we found that CB1 receptor activation mediated the formation of inhibitory boutons and promoted their subsequent stabilization. Inhibitory bouton formation did not require neuronal activity and was independent of G<SUB>i/o</SUB>-protein signaling, but was directly induced by elevating cAMP levels using forskolin and by activating G<SUB>s</SUB>-proteins using DREADDs. Blocking PKA activity prevented CB1 receptor-mediated inhibitory bouton formation. Our findings reveal that axonal CB1 receptors signal via unconventional downstream pathways and that inhibitory bouton formation is triggered by an increase in axonal cAMP levels. Our results demonstrate an unexpected role for axonal CB1 receptors in axon-specific, and context-dependent, inhibitory synapse formation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Coordination between excitation and inhibition is required for proper brain function throughout life. It was previously shown that new inhibitory synapses can be formed in response to strong excitation to maintain this coordination, and this was mediated by endocannabinoid signaling via CB1 receptors. As activation of CB1 receptors generally results in the suppression of synaptic transmission, it remained unclear how CB1 receptors can mediate the formation of inhibitory synapses. Here we show that CB1 receptors on inhibitory axons signal via unconventional intracellular pathways and that inhibitory bouton formation is triggered by an increase in axonal cAMP levels and requires PKA activity. Our findings point to a central role for axonal cAMP signaling in activity-dependent inhibitory synapse formation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">MicroRNA-Dependent Control of Sensory Neuron Function Regulates Posture Behavior in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>All what we see, touch, hear, taste, or smell must first be detected by the sensory elements of our nervous system. Sensory neurons, therefore, represent a critical component in all neural circuits and their correct function is essential for the generation of behavior and adaptation to the environment. Here, we report that the evolutionarily-conserved microRNA (miRNA) <I>miR-263b</I> plays a key behavioral role in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> through effects on the function of larval sensory neurons. Several independent experiments (in 50:50 male:female populations) support this finding: first, miRNA expression analysis, via reporter expression and fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis, demonstrate <I>miR-263b</I> expression in larval sensory neurons. Second, behavioral tests in <I>miR-263b</I> null mutants show defects in self-righting, an innate and evolutionarily conserved posture-control behavior that allows larvae to rectify their position if turned upside-down. Third, competitive inhibition of <I>miR-263b</I> in sensory neurons using a <I>miR-263b</I> "sponge" leads to self-righting defects. Fourth, systematic analysis of sensory neurons in <I>miR-263b</I> mutants shows no detectable morphologic defects in their stereotypic pattern, while genetically-encoded calcium sensors expressed in the sensory domain reveal a reduction in neural activity in <I>miR-263b</I> mutants. Fifth, <I>miR-263b</I> null mutants show reduced "touch-response" behavior and a compromised response to sound, both characteristic of larval sensory deficits. Furthermore, bioinformatic miRNA target analysis, gene expression assays, and behavioral phenocopy experiments suggest that <I>miR-263b</I> might exert its effects, at least in part, through repression of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor <I>Atonal</I>. Altogether, our study suggests a model in which miRNA-dependent control of transcription factor expression affects sensory function and behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sensory neurons are key to neural circuit function, but how these neurons acquire their specific properties is not well understood. Here, we examine this problem, focusing on the roles played by microRNAs (miRNAs). Using <I>Drosophila</I>, we demonstrate that the evolutionarily-conserved miRNA <I>miR-263b</I> controls sensory neuron function allowing the animal to perform an adaptive, elaborate three-dimensional movement. Our work thus shows that microRNAs can control complex motor behaviors by modulating sensory neuron physiology, and suggests that similar miRNA-dependent mechanisms may operate in other species. The work contributes to advance the understanding of the molecular basis of behavior and the biological roles of microRNAs within the nervous system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">CDK14 Promotes Axon Regeneration by Regulating the Noncanonical Wnt Signaling Pathway in a Kinase-Independent Manner</a></h4>

              
                <p>The postinjury regenerative capacity of neurons is known to be mediated by a complex interaction of intrinsic regenerative pathways and external cues. In <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>, the initiation of axon regeneration is regulated by the nonmuscle myosin light chain-4 (MLC-4) phosphorylation signaling pathway. In this study, we have identified <I>svh-16</I>/<I>cdk-14</I>, a mammalian CDK14 homolog, as a positive regulator of axon regeneration in motor neurons. We then isolated the CDK-14-binding protein MIG-5/Disheveled (Dsh) and found that EGL-20/Wnt and the MIG-1/Frizzled receptor (Fz) are required for efficient axon regeneration. Further, we demonstrate that CDK-14 activates EPHX-1, the <I>C. elegans</I> homolog of the mammalian ephexin Rho-type GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), in a kinase-independent manner. EPHX-1 functions as a GEF for the CDC-42 GTPase, inhibiting myosin phosphatase, which maintains MLC-4 phosphorylation. These results suggest that CDK14 activates the RhoGEF&ndash;CDC42&ndash;MLC phosphorylation axis in a noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway that promotes axon regeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Noncanonical Wnt signaling is mediated by Frizzled receptor (Fz), Disheveled (Dsh), Rho-type GTPase, and nonmuscle myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. This study identified <I>svh-16</I>/<I>cdk-14</I>, which encodes a mammalian CDK14 homolog, as a regulator of axon regeneration in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> motor neurons. We show that CDK-14 binds to MIG-5/Dsh, and that EGL-20/Wnt, MIG-1/Fz, and EPHX-1/RhoGEF are required for axon regeneration. The phosphorylation-mimetic MLC-4 suppressed axon regeneration defects in <I>mig-1</I>, <I>cdk-14</I>, and <I>ephx-1</I> mutants. CDK-14 mediates kinase-independent activation of EPHX-1, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for CDC-42 GTPase. Activated CDC-42 inactivates myosin phosphatase and thereby maintains MLC phosphorylation. Thus, the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway controls axon regeneration via the CDK-14&ndash;EPHX-1&ndash;CDC-42&ndash;MLC phosphorylation axis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">mTOR Signaling Regulates Metabolic Function in Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells and Promotes Efficient Brain Remyelination in the Cuprizone Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>In demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, primary loss of myelin and subsequent neuronal degeneration throughout the CNS impair patient functionality. While the importance of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling during developmental myelination is known, no studies have yet directly examined the function of mTOR signaling specifically in the oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage during remyelination. Here, we conditionally deleted <I>Mtor</I> from adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) using <I>Ng2-Cre<sup>ERT</sup></I> in male adult mice to test its function in new OLs responsible for remyelination. During early remyelination after cuprizone-induced demyelination, mice lacking mTOR in adult OPCs had unchanged OL numbers but thinner myelin. Myelin thickness recovered by late-stage repair, suggesting a delay in myelin production when <I>Mtor</I> is deleted from adult OPCs. Surprisingly, loss of mTOR in OPCs had no effect on efficiency of remyelination after lysophosphatidylcholine lesions in either the spinal cord or corpus callosum, suggesting that mTOR signaling functions specifically in a pathway dysregulated by cuprizone to promote remyelination efficiency. We further determined that cuprizone and inhibition of mTOR cooperatively compromise metabolic function in primary rat OLs undergoing differentiation. Together, our results support the conclusion that mTOR signaling in OPCs is required to overcome the metabolic dysfunction in the cuprizone-demyelinated adult brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Impaired remyelination by oligodendrocytes contributes to the progressive pathology in multiple sclerosis, so it is critical to identify mechanisms of improving remyelination. The goal of this study was to examine mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in remyelination. Here, we provide evidence that mTOR signaling promotes efficient remyelination of the brain after cuprizone-mediated demyelination but has no effect on remyelination after lysophosphatidylcholine demyelination in the spinal cord or brain. We also present novel data revealing that mTOR inhibition and cuprizone treatment additively affect the metabolic profile of differentiating oligodendrocytes, supporting a mechanism for the observed remyelination delay. These data suggest that altered metabolic function may underlie failure of remyelination in multiple sclerosis lesions and that mTOR signaling may be of therapeutic potential for promoting remyelination.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Decapentaplegic Acutely Defines the Connectivity of Central Pacemaker Neurons in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rhythmic rest-activity cycles are controlled by an endogenous clock. In <I>Drosophila</I>, this clock resides in ~150 neurons organized in clusters whose hierarchy changes in response to environmental conditions. The concerted activity of the circadian network is necessary for the adaptive responses to synchronizing environmental stimuli. Thus far, work was devoted to unravel the logic of the coordination of different clusters focusing on neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. We further explored communication in the adult male brain through ligands belonging to the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway. Herein we show that the lateral ventral neurons (LNvs) express the small morphogen decapentaplegic (DPP). DPP expression in the large LNvs triggered a period lengthening phenotype, the downregulation of which caused reduced rhythmicity and affected anticipation at dawn and dusk, underscoring DPP per se conveys time-of-day relevant information. Surprisingly, DPP expression in the large LNvs impaired circadian remodeling of the small LNv axonal terminals, likely through local modulation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Trio. These findings open the provocative possibility that the BMP pathway is recruited to strengthen/reduce the connectivity among specific clusters along the day and thus modulate the contribution of the clusters to the circadian network.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The circadian clock relies on the communication between groups of so-called clock neurons to coordinate physiology and behavior to the optimal times across the day, predicting and adapting to a changing environment. The circadian network relies on neurotransmitters and neuropeptides to fine-tune connectivity among clock neurons and thus give rise to a coherent output. Herein we show that decapentaplegic, a ligand belonging to the BMP retrograde signaling pathway required for coordinated growth during development, is recruited by a group of circadian neurons in the adult brain to trigger structural remodeling of terminals on a daily basis.</p>

                <p>The connectome of the brain has a great impact on the function of the brain as the structure of the connectome affects the speed and efficiency of information transfer. As a highly energy-consuming organ, an efficient network structure is essential. A previous study has shown consistent overall brain connectivity across a large variety of species. This connectivity conservation was explained by a balance between interhemispheric and intrahemispheric connections; that is, spices with highly connected hemispheres appear to have weaker interhemisphere connections. This study examines this connectivity trade-off in the human brain using diffusion-based tractography and network analysis in the Human Connectome Project (970 subjects, 527 female). We explore the biological origins of this phenomenon, heritability, and the effect on cognitive measures.</p>
<p>The proportion of commissural fibers in the brain had a negative correlation to hemispheric efficiency, pointing to a trade-off between inner hemispheric and interhemispheric connectivity. Network hubs including anterior and middle cingulate cortex, superior frontal areas, medial occipital areas, the parahippocampal gyrus, post- and precentral gyri, and the precuneus had the strongest contribution to this phenomenon. Other results show a high heritability as well as a strong connection to crystalized intelligence. This work presents cohort-based network analysis research, spanning a large variety of samples and exploring the overall architecture of the human connectome. Our results show a connectivity conservation phenomenon at the base of the overall brain network architecture. This network structure may explain much of the functional, behavioral, and cognitive variability among different brains.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The network structure of the brain is at the basis of every brain function as it dictates the characteristics of information transfer. Understanding the patterns and mechanisms that guide the connectome structure is crucial to understanding the brain itself. Here we unravel the mechanism at the base of the connectivity conservation phenomenon by exploring the interaction between hemispheric and commissural connectivity in a large-scale cohort-based connectivity study. We describe the trade-off between the two components and examine the origins of the trade-off and observe the effect on cognitive abilities and behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Ultra-High-Field Neuroimaging Reveals Fine-Scale Processing for 3D Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Binocular disparity provides critical information about three-dimensional (3D) structures to support perception and action. In the past decade significant progress has been made in uncovering human brain areas engaged in the processing of binocular disparity signals. Yet, the fine-scale brain processing underlying 3D perception remains unknown. Here, we use ultra-high-field (7T) functional imaging at submillimeter resolution to examine fine-scale BOLD fMRI signals involved in 3D perception. In particular, we sought to interrogate the local circuitry involved in disparity processing by sampling fMRI responses at different positions relative to the cortical surface (i.e., across cortical depths corresponding to layers). We tested for representations related to 3D perception by presenting participants (male and female, <I>N</I> = 8) with stimuli that enable stable stereoscopic perception [i.e., correlated random dot stereograms (RDS)] versus those that do not (i.e., anticorrelated RDS). Using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we demonstrate cortical depth-specific representations in areas V3A and V7 as indicated by stronger pattern responses for correlated than for anticorrelated stimuli in upper rather than deeper layers. Examining informational connectivity, we find higher feedforward layer-to-layer connectivity for correlated than anticorrelated stimuli between V3A and V7. Further, we observe disparity-specific feedback from V3A to V1 and from V7 to V3A. Our findings provide evidence for the role of V3A as a key nexus for disparity processing, which is implicated in feedforward and feedback signals related to the perceptual estimation of 3D structures.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Binocular vision plays a significant role in supporting our interactions with the surrounding environment. The fine-scale neural mechanisms that underlie the brain's skill in extracting 3D structures from binocular signals are poorly understood. Here, we capitalize on recent advances in ultra-high-field functional imaging to interrogate human brain circuits involved in 3D perception at submillimeter resolution. We provide evidence for the role of area V3A as a key nexus for disparity processing, which is implicated in feedforward and feedback signals related to the perceptual estimation of 3D structures from binocular signals. These fine-scale measurements help bridge the gap between animal neurophysiology and human fMRI studies investigating cross-scale circuits, from micro circuits to global brain networks for 3D perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Perceptual and Semantic Representations at Encoding Contribute to True and False Recognition of Objects</a></h4>

              
                <p>When encoding new episodic memories, visual and semantic processing is proposed to make distinct contributions to accurate memory and memory distortions. Here, we used fMRI and preregistered representational similarity analysis to uncover the representations that predict true and false recognition of unfamiliar objects. Two semantic models captured coarse-grained taxonomic categories and specific object features, respectively, while two perceptual models embodied low-level visual properties. Twenty-eight female and male participants encoded images of objects during fMRI scanning, and later had to discriminate studied objects from similar lures and novel objects in a recognition memory test. Both perceptual and semantic models predicted true memory. When studied objects were later identified correctly, neural patterns corresponded to low-level visual representations of these object images in the early visual cortex, lingual, and fusiform gyri. In a similar fashion, alignment of neural patterns with fine-grained semantic feature representations in the fusiform gyrus also predicted true recognition. However, emphasis on coarser taxonomic representations predicted forgetting more anteriorly in the anterior ventral temporal cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus and, in an exploratory analysis, left perirhinal cortex. In contrast, false recognition of similar lure objects was associated with weaker visual analysis posteriorly in early visual and left occipitotemporal cortex. The results implicate multiple perceptual and semantic representations in successful memory encoding and suggest that fine-grained semantic as well as visual analysis contributes to accurate later recognition, while processing visual image detail is critical for avoiding false recognition errors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> People are able to store detailed memories of many similar objects. We offer new insights into the encoding of these specific memories by combining fMRI with explicit models of how image properties and object knowledge are represented in the brain. When people processed fine-grained visual properties in occipital and posterior temporal cortex, they were more likely to recognize the objects later and less likely to falsely recognize similar objects. In contrast, while object-specific feature representations in fusiform gyrus predicted accurate memory, coarse-grained categorical representations in frontal and temporal regions predicted forgetting. The data provide the first direct tests of theoretical assumptions about encoding true and false memories, suggesting that semantic representations contribute to specific memories as well as errors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Gait-Phase Modulates Alpha and Beta Oscillations in the Pedunculopontine Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is a reticular collection of neurons at the junction of the midbrain and pons, playing an important role in modulating posture and locomotion. Deep brain stimulation of the PPN has been proposed as an emerging treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) or multiple system atrophy (MSA) who have gait-related atypical parkinsonian syndromes. In this study, we investigated PPN activities during gait to better understand its functional role in locomotion. Specifically, we investigated whether PPN activity is rhythmically modulated by gait cycles during locomotion. PPN local field potential (LFP) activities were recorded from PD or MSA patients with gait difficulties during stepping in place or free walking. Simultaneous measurements from force plates or accelerometers were used to determine the phase within each gait cycle at each time point. Our results showed that activities in the alpha and beta frequency bands in the PPN LFPs were rhythmically modulated by the gait phase within gait cycles, with a higher modulation index when the stepping rhythm was more regular. Meanwhile, the PPN&ndash;cortical coherence was most prominent in the alpha band. Both gait phase-related modulation in the alpha/beta power and the PPN&ndash;cortical coherence in the alpha frequency band were spatially specific to the PPN and did not extend to surrounding regions. These results suggest that alternating PPN modulation may support gait control. Whether enhancing alternating PPN modulation by stimulating in an alternating fashion could positively affect gait control remains to be tested.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The therapeutic efficacy of pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) and the extent to which it can improve quality of life are still inconclusive. Understanding how PPN activity is modulated by stepping or walking may offer insight into how to improve the efficacy of PPN DBS in ameliorating gait difficulties. Our study shows that PPN alpha and beta activity was modulated by the gait phase, and that this was most pronounced when the stepping rhythm was regular. It remains to be tested whether enhancing alternating PPN modulation by stimulating in an alternating fashion could positively affect gait control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Medial Frontal Cortex Activity Predicts Information Sampling in Economic Choice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Decision-making not only requires agents to decide what to choose but also how much information to sample before committing to a choice. Previously established frameworks for economic choice argue for a deliberative process of evidence accumulation across time. These tacitly acknowledge a role of information sampling in that decisions are only made once sufficient evidence is acquired, yet few experiments have explicitly placed information sampling under the participant's control. Here, we use fMRI to investigate the neural basis of information sampling in economic choice by allowing participants (<I>n</I> = 30, sex not recorded) to actively sample information in a multistep decision task. We show that medial frontal cortex (MFC) activity is predictive of further information sampling before choice. Choice difficulty (inverse value difference, keeping sensory difficulty constant) was also encoded in MFC, but this effect was explained away by the inclusion of information sampling as a coregressor in the general linear model. A distributed network of regions across the prefrontal cortex encoded key features of the sampled information at the time it was presented. We propose that MFC is an important controller of the extent to which information is gathered before committing to an economic choice. This role may explain why MFC activity has been associated with evidence accumulation in previous studies in which information sampling was an implicit rather than explicit feature of the decision.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The decisions we make are determined by the information we have sampled before committing to a choice. Accumulator frameworks of decision-making tacitly acknowledge the need to sample further information during the evidence accumulation process until a decision boundary is reached. However, relatively few studies explicitly place this decision to sample further information under the participant's control. In this fMRI study, we find that MFC activity is related to information sampling decisions in a multistep economic choice task. This suggests that an important role of evidence representations within MFC may be to guide adaptive sequential decisions to sample further information before committing to a final decision.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">PI3K{gamma}/AKT Signaling in High Molecular Weight Hyaluronan (HMWH)-Induced Anti-Hyperalgesia and Reversal of Nociceptor Sensitization</a></h4>

              
                <p>High molecular weight hyaluronan (HMWH), a well-established treatment for osteoarthritis pain, is anti-hyperalgesic in preclinical models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. HMWH-induced anti-hyperalgesia is mediated by its action at cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), the cognate hyaluronan receptor, which can signal via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), a large family of kinases involved in diverse cell functions. We demonstrate that intrathecal administration of an oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) antisense to mRNA for PI3K (a Class I PI3K isoform) expressed in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), and intradermal administration of a PI3K-selective inhibitor (AS605240), markedly attenuates HMWH-induced anti-prostaglandin E<SUB>2</SUB> (PGE<SUB>2</SUB>) hyperalgesia, in male and female rats. Intradermal administration of inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; rapamycin) and protein kinase B (AKT; AKT Inhibitor IV), signaling molecules downstream of PI3K, also attenuates HMWH-induced anti-hyperalgesia. <I>In vitro</I> patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments on cultured nociceptors from male rats demonstrate that some HMWH-induced changes in generation of action potentials (APs) in nociceptors sensitized by PGE<SUB>2</SUB> are PI3K dependent (reduction in AP firing rate, increase in latency to first AP and increase in slope of current ramp required to induce AP) and some are PI3K independent [reduction in recovery rate of AP afterhyperpolarization (AHP)]. Our demonstration of a role of PI3K in HMWH-induced anti-hyperalgesia and reversal of nociceptor sensitization opens a novel line of research into molecular targets for the treatment of diverse pain syndromes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We have previously demonstrated that high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMWH) attenuates inflammatory hyperalgesia, an effect mediated by its action at cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), the cognate hyaluronan receptor, and activation of its downstream signaling pathway, in nociceptors. In the present study, we demonstrate that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and downstream signaling pathway, protein kinase B (AKT) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), are crucial for HMWH to induce anti-hyperalgesia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Asymmetric Frequency-Specific Feedforward and Feedback Information Flow between Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex during Verbal Memory Encoding and Recall</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuits are thought to play a prominent role in human episodic memory, but the precise nature, and electrophysiological basis, of directed information flow between these regions and their role in verbal memory formation has remained elusive. Here we investigate nonlinear causal interactions between hippocampus and lateral PFC using intracranial EEG recordings (26 participants, 16 females) during verbal memory encoding and recall tasks. Direction-specific information theoretic analysis revealed higher causal information flow from the hippocampus to PFC than in the reverse direction. Crucially, this pattern was observed during both memory encoding and recall, and the strength of causal interactions was significantly greater during memory task performance than resting baseline. Further analyses revealed frequency specificity of interactions with greater causal information flow from hippocampus to the PFC in the delta-theta frequency band (0.5-8 Hz); in contrast, PFC to hippocampus causal information flow were stronger in the beta band (12-30 Hz). Across all hippocampus-PFC electrode pairs, propagation delay between the source and target signals was estimated to be 17.7 ms, which is physiologically meaningful and corresponds to directional signal interactions on a timescale consistent with monosynaptic influence. Our findings identify distinct asymmetric feedforward and feedback signaling mechanisms between the hippocampus and PFC and their dissociable roles in memory recall, demonstrate that these regions preferentially use different frequency channels, and provide novel insights into the electrophysiological basis of directed information flow during episodic memory formation in the human brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hippocampal-PFC circuits play a critical role in episodic memory in rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans. Investigations using noninvasive fMRI techniques have provided insights into coactivation of the hippocampus and PFC during memory formation; however, the electrophysiological basis of dynamic causal hippocampal-PFC interactions in the human brain is poorly understood. Here, we use data from a large cohort of intracranial EEG recordings to investigate the neurophysiological underpinnings of asymmetric feedforward and feedback hippocampal-PFC interactions and their nonlinear causal dynamics during both episodic memory encoding and recall. Our findings provide novel insights into the electrophysiological basis of directed bottom-up and top-down information flow during episodic memory formation in the human brain.</p>

                <p>Microglia are resident myeloid cells of the CNS. Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has enabled description of a disease-associated microglia (DAM) with a role in neurodegeneration and demyelination. In this study, we use scRNAseq to investigate the temporal dynamics of immune cells harvested from the epicenter of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) induced in female mice. We find that as a consequence of SCI, baseline microglia undergo permanent transcriptional reprogramming into a previously uncharacterized subtype of microglia with striking similarities to previously reported DAM as well as a distinct microglial state found during development. Using a microglia depletion model we showed that DAM in SCI are derived from baseline microglia and strongly enhance recovery of hindlimb locomotor function following injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although disease-associated microglia (DAM) have been the subject of strong research interest during recent years (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B14">Keren-Shaul, 2017</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B13">Jord&atilde;o, 2019</cross-ref>), their cellular origin and their role in "normal" acute injury processes is not well understood. Our work directly addresses the origin and the role of DAM in traumatic injury response. Further, we use a microglia depletion model to prove that DAM in spinal cord injury (SCI) are indeed derived from homeostatic microglia, and that they strongly enhance recovery. Thus, in this work we significantly expand the knowledge of immune response to traumatic injury, demonstrate the applicability to human injury via our unique access to injured human spinal cord tissue, and provide the community with a comprehensive dataset for further exploration.</p>

                Background: Linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) applies to sharp cracks, although crack sites such as holes and slots are often blunt cracks with nonzero widths. The advancement in finite element method (FEM) has enabled the calculation of stress intensity factor (SIF) for unstable crack growth prediction, regardless of crack shape and size, but the calculations often differ from contour to contour. Hence, the purpose of this work is to determine if SIFs computed using commercial FEM have experimentally verifiable advantages over the traditional stress-based modelling approaches in predicting Mode I brittle failure at blunt crack tip. Methods: Experiments and simulations were conducted on brittle Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) plastic to compare the actual and predicted strain fields and SIFs at crack tip, and the critical force at which unstable crack growth initiates. A centrally straight cracked Brazilian disc made of PMMA was subjected to purely Mode I fracture. Its strain fields were measured from deformed speckle patterns using digital image correlation software. The same disc was modelled using plane stress model in FEM. By applying the critical force, SIFs were then computed using ANSYS pre-meshed crack method at different contours away from the crack tip. The effects of element type, mesh size and crack width on the simulated SIFs were investigated. Results: It was found that the experimental critical load agreed well with LEFM prediction based on PMMA fracture toughness in published literature. Disc failure happened at the first sign of tensile yield at the crack tip in the finite element model with a triangle mesh. Digital image correlation clearly shows the occurrence of unstable crack growth at critical force. It also shows comparable far field strain responses to the FEM model. Conclusions: The computed SIFs were inconsistent, and their usefulness in predicting unstable crack growth requires further investigation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comprehensive analysis of lectin-glycan interactions reveals determinants of lectin specificity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel E. Mattox, Chris Bailey-Kellogg</p>

Lectin-glycan interactions facilitate inter- and intracellular communication in many processes including protein trafficking, host-pathogen recognition, and tumorigenesis promotion. Specific recognition of glycans by lectins is also the basis for a wide range of applications in areas including glycobiology research, cancer screening, and antiviral therapeutics. To provide a better understanding of the determinants of lectin-glycan interaction specificity and support such applications, this study comprehensively investigates specificity-conferring features of all available lectin-glycan complex structures. Systematic characterization, comparison, and predictive modeling of a set of 221 complementary physicochemical and geometric features representing these interactions highlighted specificity-conferring features with potential mechanistic insight. Univariable comparative analyses with weighted Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests revealed strong statistical associations between binding site features and specificity that are conserved across unrelated lectin binding sites. Multivariable modeling with random forests demonstrated the utility of these features for predicting the identity of bound glycans based on generalized patterns learned from non-homologous lectins. These analyses revealed <i>global</i> determinants of lectin specificity, such as sialic acid glycan recognition in deep, concave binding sites enriched for positively charged residues, in contrast to high mannose glycan recognition in fairly shallow but well-defined pockets enriched for non-polar residues. Focused <i>fine specificity</i> analysis of hemagglutinin interactions with human-like and avian-like glycans uncovered features representing both known and novel mutations related to shifts in influenza tropism from avian to human tissues. As the approach presented here relies on co-crystallized lectin-glycan pairs for studying specificity, it is limited in its inferences by the quantity, quality, and diversity of the structural data available. Regardless, the systematic characterization of lectin binding sites presented here provides a novel approach to studying lectin specificity and is a step towards confidently predicting new lectin-glycan interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A metric for evaluating biological information in gene sets and its application to identify co-expressed gene clusters in PBMC</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jason Bennett, Mikhail Pomaznoy, Akul Singhania, Bjoern Peters</p>

Recent technological advances have made the gathering of comprehensive gene expression datasets a commodity. This has shifted the limiting step of transcriptomic studies from the accumulation of data to their analyses and interpretation. The main problem in analyzing transcriptomics data is that the number of independent samples is typically much lower (<100) than the number of genes whose expression is quantified (typically >14,000). To address this, it would be desirable to reduce the gathered data’s dimensionality without losing information. Clustering genes into discrete modules is one of the most commonly used tools to accomplish this task. While there are multiple clustering approaches, there is a lack of informative metrics available to evaluate the resultant clusters’ biological quality. Here we present a metric that incorporates known ground truth gene sets to quantify gene clusters’ biological quality derived from standard clustering techniques. The GECO (Ground truth Evaluation of Clustering Outcomes) metric demonstrates that quantitative and repeatable scoring of gene clusters is not only possible but computationally lightweight and robust. Unlike current methods, it allows direct comparison between gene clusters generated by different clustering techniques. It also reveals that current cluster analysis techniques often underestimate the number of clusters that should be formed from a dataset, which leads to fewer clusters of lower quality. As a test case, we applied GECO combined with k-means clustering to derive an optimal set of co-expressed gene modules derived from PBMC, which we show to be superior to previously generated modules generated on whole-blood. Overall, GECO provides a rational metric to test and compare different clustering approaches to analyze high-dimensional transcriptomic data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Molecular mechanism of proton-coupled ligand translocation by the bacterial efflux pump EmrE</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jakub Jurasz, Maciej Bagiński, Jacek Czub, Miłosz Wieczór</p>

The current surge in bacterial multi-drug resistance (MDR) is one of the largest challenges to public health, threatening to render ineffective many therapies we rely on for treatment of serious infections. Understanding different factors that contribute to MDR is hence crucial from the global “one health” perspective. In this contribution, we focus on the prototypical broad-selectivity proton-coupled antiporter EmrE, one of the smallest known ligand transporters that confers resistance to aromatic cations in a number of clinically relevant species. As an asymmetric homodimer undergoing an “alternating access” protomer-swap conformational change, it serves as a model for the mechanistic understanding of more complex drug transporters. Here, we present a free energy and solvent accessibility analysis that indicates the presence of two complementary ligand translocation pathways that remain operative in a broad range of conditions. Our simulations show a previously undescribed desolvated apo state and anticorrelated accessibility in the ligand-bound state, explaining on a structural level why EmrE does not disrupt the pH gradient through futile proton transfer. By comparing the behavior of a number of model charged and/or aromatic ligands, we also explain the origin of selectivity of EmrE towards a broad class of aromatic cations. Finally, we explore unbiased pathways of ligand entry and exit to identify correlated structural changes implicated in ligand binding and release, as well as characterize key intermediates of occupancy changes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sarc-Graph: Automated segmentation, tracking, and analysis of sarcomeres in hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bill Zhao, Kehan Zhang, Christopher S. Chen, Emma Lejeune</p>

A better fundamental understanding of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) has the potential to advance applications ranging from drug discovery to cardiac repair. Automated quantitative analysis of beating hiPSC-CMs is an important and fast developing component of the hiPSC-CM research pipeline. Here we introduce “Sarc-Graph,” a computational framework to segment, track, and analyze sarcomeres in fluorescently tagged hiPSC-CMs. Our framework includes functions to segment z-discs and sarcomeres, track z-discs and sarcomeres in beating cells, and perform automated spatiotemporal analysis and data visualization. In addition to reporting good performance for sarcomere segmentation and tracking with little to no parameter tuning and a short runtime, we introduce two novel analysis approaches. First, we construct spatial graphs where z-discs correspond to nodes and sarcomeres correspond to edges. This makes measuring the network distance between each sarcomere (i.e., the number of connecting sarcomeres separating each sarcomere pair) straightforward. Second, we treat tracked and segmented components as fiducial markers and use them to compute the approximate deformation gradient of the entire tracked population. This represents a new quantitative descriptor of hiPSC-CM function. We showcase and validate our approach with both synthetic and experimental movies of beating hiPSC-CMs. By publishing Sarc-Graph, we aim to make automated quantitative analysis of hiPSC-CM behavior more accessible to the broader research community.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Grey-box modeling and hypothesis testing of functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based cerebrovascular reactivity to anodal high-definition tDCS in healthy humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yashika Arora, Pushpinder Walia, Mitsuhiro Hayashibe, Makii Muthalib, Shubhajit Roy Chowdhury, Stephane Perrey, Anirban Dutta</p>

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to evoke hemodynamics response; however, the mechanisms have not been investigated systematically using systems biology approaches. Our study presents a grey-box linear model that was developed from a physiologically detailed multi-compartmental neurovascular unit model consisting of the vascular smooth muscle, perivascular space, synaptic space, and astrocyte glial cell. Then, model linearization was performed on the physiologically detailed nonlinear model to find appropriate complexity (Akaike information criterion) to fit functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) based measure of blood volume changes, called cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), to high-definition (HD) tDCS. The grey-box linear model was applied on the fNIRS-based CVR during the first 150 seconds of anodal HD-tDCS in eleven healthy humans. The grey-box linear models for each of the four nested pathways starting from tDCS scalp current density that perturbed synaptic potassium released from active neurons for Pathway 1, astrocytic transmembrane current for Pathway 2, perivascular potassium concentration for Pathway 3, and voltage-gated ion channel current on the smooth muscle cell for Pathway 4 were fitted to the total hemoglobin concentration (tHb) changes from optodes in the vicinity of 4x1 HD-tDCS electrodes as well as on the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. We found that the tDCS perturbation Pathway 3 presented the least mean square error (MSE, median <2.5%) and the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC, median -1.726) from the individual grey-box linear model fitting at the targeted-region. Then, minimal realization transfer function with reduced-order approximations of the grey-box model pathways was fitted to the ensemble average tHb time series. Again, Pathway 3 with nine poles and two zeros (all free parameters), provided the best Goodness of Fit of 0.0078 for Chi-Square difference test of nested pathways. Therefore, our study provided a systems biology approach to investigate the initial transient hemodynamic response to tDCS based on fNIRS tHb data. Future studies need to investigate the steady-state responses, including steady-state oscillations found to be driven by calcium dynamics, where transcranial alternating current stimulation may provide frequency-dependent physiological entrainment for system identification. We postulate that such a mechanistic understanding from system identification of the hemodynamics response to transcranial electrical stimulation can facilitate adequate delivery of the current density to the neurovascular tissue under simultaneous portable imaging in various cerebrovascular diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Recursive MAGUS: Scalable and accurate multiple sequence alignment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vladimir Smirnov</p>

Multiple sequence alignment tools struggle to keep pace with rapidly growing sequence data, as few methods can handle large datasets while maintaining alignment accuracy. We recently introduced MAGUS, a new state-of-the-art method for aligning large numbers of sequences. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of enhancements that allow MAGUS to align vastly larger datasets with greater speed. We compare MAGUS to other leading alignment methods on datasets of up to one million sequences. Our results demonstrate the advantages of MAGUS over other alignment software in both accuracy and speed. MAGUS is freely available in open-source form at https://github.com/vlasmirnov/MAGUS.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Dopamine, sleep, and neuronal excitability modulate amyloid-β–mediated forgetting in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jenifer C. Kaldun, Shahnaz R. Lone, Ana M. Humbert Camps, Cornelia Fritsch, Yves F. Widmer, Jens V. Stein, Seth M. Tomchik, Simon G. Sprecher</p>

Alzheimer disease (AD) is one of the main causes of age-related dementia and neurodegeneration. However, the onset of the disease and the mechanisms causing cognitive defects are not well understood. Aggregation of amyloidogenic peptides is a pathological hallmark of AD and is assumed to be a central component of the molecular disease pathways. Pan-neuronal expression of <i>Aβ</i><sub>42</sub><sup>Arctic</sup> peptides in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> results in learning and memory defects. Surprisingly, targeted expression to the mushroom bodies, a center for olfactory memories in the fly brain, does not interfere with learning but accelerates forgetting. We show here that reducing neuronal excitability either by feeding Levetiracetam or silencing of neurons in the involved circuitry ameliorates the phenotype. Furthermore, inhibition of the Rac-regulated forgetting pathway could rescue the <i>Aβ</i><sub>42</sub><sup>Arctic</sup>-mediated accelerated forgetting phenotype. Similar effects are achieved by increasing sleep, a critical regulator of neuronal homeostasis. Our results provide a functional framework connecting forgetting signaling and sleep, which are critical for regulating neuronal excitability and homeostasis and are therefore a promising mechanism to modulate forgetting caused by toxic <i>Aβ</i> peptides.

                Background: COVID19 vaccine rejection is a global issue that most developing countries face. A study of COVID-19 vaccine preference among Al-Zahraa University female students will pave the way to resolving the issue of vaccine rejection among students. Students' preferences and refusals of the COVID19 vaccine were evaluated to determine the reasons for their decisions.  Methods: This study involved 198 students from Al-Zahraa University for women. An observational cross-sectional study was conducted at Al-Zahraa University in Karbala, Iraq, to find out which Health and Medical Technology students preferred the COVID19 vaccine. Tests based on statistics made use of frequency and rate data.  Results: Most students (95%) were over the age of 19. The COVID-19 vaccine was rejected by 138 people (70.4%).  A total of 43 students (28.5%) believed that the COVID19 vaccine may not be completely safe. 49.3% of students were not aware of the differences between the various types of vaccines.  Pfizer was the most preferred by 64 (34.8%), AstraZeneca by 17 (9.2%), and Chinse-Sinovac by only 11 (6%). 20 students (16.4%) believed that with the vaccine they could return to life as it was before the COVID-19 pandemic. Covid-19 vaccine acceptance among Al-Zahara University students may be low in part because of myths, and partly because of the fear of side-effects associated with the vaccine.  Conclusion:  Information about COVID-19 vaccines should be transparently communicated to the media by health authorities to help the public make informed decisions.

                The United Nations estimates that the global population will total 9.7 billion in 2050. Rapid population growth pose a significant obstacle to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly eradicating hunger and poverty. In view of the expanding population growth, food production ideally should triple to prevent massive food shortages. Sustainable food and nutrition security is the focal point of the dairy industry. Dairy production plays a pivotal role in addressing and advancing global food and nutrition security. It serves as a major source of protein, calcium, and phosphorus in many families in developing countries with a fast-growing population. Consequently, the dairy industry is expected to grow by approximately 26% in the next 10 years and produce an estimated 1077 million tonnes of milk by 2050. However, the growth and distribution of the dairy industry is limited by many factors such as culling and mortality of dairy cows. Several studies highlight reproduction failures, old age, poor milk yield, diseases (mastitis, lameness, and dystocia), and heat stress as some reasons for culling of dairy cows. Hence, this review highlights the factors influencing culling and mortality in dairy production farms, and discusses mitigating measures to limit culling.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Improvement of Cardiac Fibrosis Biomarkers through Inflammation Inhibition by Green Tea and Decaffeinated Light Roasted Green Coffee Extract Combination Administration in Metabolic Syndrome Rat Model [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Metabolic syndrome is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Green tea and green coffee extracts, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents may participate in metabolic syndrome-induced cardiac fibrosis alleviation. However, the effect of combination of those extracts still needs exploration. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of green tea and decaffeinated light roasted green coffee extracts and their combination in metabolic syndrome-induced cardiac fibrosis rats. Methods: Metabolic syndrome rat model was i1nduced through high-fat high sucrose diets feeding for 8 weeks and injection of low dose streptozotocin at the 2nd week. The metabolic syndrome rats were divided into 4 experimental groups metabolic syndrome rats (MS); metabolic syndrome rats treated with 300 mg/ kg b.w green tea extract (GT); metabolic syndrome rats treated with 200 mg/ kg b.w decaffeinated light roasted green coffee extract (GC); metabolic syndrome rats treated with the combination of the two extracts (CE); and a normal control (NC) group was added. Angiotensin 2 level was analyzed by ELISA method. Gene expression of NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, Tgf-β1, Rac-1, and α-sma were analyzed by touchdown polymerase chain reaction methods. Results: Metabolic syndrome rats treated with green tea and decaffeinated light roasted green coffee significantly decreased angiotensin-2 serum level and cardiac inflammation and fibrosis gene expression level (NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, Tgf-β1, Rac-1, and α-sma). More significant alleviation was observed in the combination group. Conclusion: This study suggested that combination of green tea and decaffeinated light roasted green coffee extracts showed better improvement in metabolic syndrome-induced cardiac fibrosis rat model compared to that of single extract administration through inflammation inhibition

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Developmental refinement of visual callosal inputs to ferret area 17</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Corticocortical connections link visual cortical areas in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. We studied the postnatal refinement of callosal connections linking multiple cortical areas with ferret area 17 during the period from just before eye opening (4 weeks) to 10 weeks of age. We aimed to determine (a) whether callosal projections from multiple visual cortical areas to area 17 refine with a similar rate and (b) whether the refinement of callosal projections parallels that of intrahemispheric cortical circuits. We injected the bidirectional tracer CTb into area 17, and mapped the areal and laminar distribution of labeled cells in visual areas of the contralateral hemisphere. Like intrahemispheric projections, callosal inputs to area 17 before eye opening are dominated by Suprasylvian area Ssy (with lesser and comparable input from areas 17, 18, 19, and 21), but within two weeks of eye opening are jointly dominated by area 18 Ssy inputs; however, there are fewer labeled cells in the contralateral hemisphere. Unlike intrahemispheric projections, there is no laminar reorganization of callosal inputs; in all visual areas and at all ages studied the greatest proportion of callosal projections arises from the infragranular layers. Also unlike intrahemispheric projections, the peak density of callosal cells in each area projecting to area 17 declines more modestly. These results reveal important similarities and differences in the postnatal reorganization of inter- and intrahemispheric projections to area 17.</p>

                Neuron traditionally publishes a themed collection of reviews to coincide with the Society for Neuroscience’s (SfN) annual meeting. When we were brainstorming potential topics in the spring of 2021, with COVID-19 vaccinations rolling out in many parts of the world offering hope for safely seeing colleagues and friends in person, we envisioned a celebratory reunion at SfN in the fall. We wished to symbolically mark the event with a “Welcome back!” collection, even for those not attending SfN in person.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/current.rss">Rnf43 is “lord of the ring” finger proteins in remyelination</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation into myelinating oligodendrocytes is critical for remyelination in the central nervous system after injury. In this issue of Neuron, Niu et al. (2021) detail a novel role for ring finger protein Rnf43, which is expressed in response to injury and is essential to promote remyelination in vivo.

                Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) have been proposed to support memory-based decision-making. A new study by Gillespie et al. (in this issue of Neuron) provides important new insights on how past experiences and future choices are reflected in neuronal activity during SWRs.

                Cholvin et al. imaged MEC input and principal cell activity in all three hippocampal subfields of mice navigating two different virtual environments. MEC projections more strongly discriminated between environments, whereas hippocampal principal cell activity was more stable and reliable, deriving a faster and more accurate readout of space and context.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">AKAP79 enables calcineurin to directly suppress protein kinase A activity</a></h4>

              
                Interplay between the second messengers cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a hallmark of dynamic cellular processes. A common motif is the opposition of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive phosphatase calcineurin and the major cAMP receptor, protein kinase A (PKA). Calcineurin dephosphorylates sites primed by PKA to bring about changes including synaptic long-term depression (LTD). AKAP79 supports signaling of this type by anchoring PKA and calcineurin in tandem. In this study, we discovered that AKAP79 increases the rate of calcineurin dephosphorylation of type II PKA regulatory subunits by an order of magnitude. Fluorescent PKA activity reporter assays, supported by kinetic modeling, show how AKAP79-enhanced calcineurin activity enables suppression of PKA without altering cAMP levels by increasing PKA catalytic subunit capture rate. Experiments with hippocampal neurons indicate that this mechanism contributes towards LTD. This non-canonical mode of PKA regulation may underlie many other cellular processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Two different cell-cycle processes determine the timing of cell division in Escherichia coli</a></h4>

              
                Cells must control the cell cycle to ensure that key processes are brought to completion. In Escherichia coli, it is controversial whether cell division is tied to chromosome replication or to a replication-independent inter-division process. A recent model suggests instead that both processes may limit cell division with comparable odds in single cells. Here, we tested this possibility experimentally by monitoring single-cell division and replication over multiple generations at slow growth. We then perturbed cell width, causing an increase of the time between replication termination and division. As a consequence, replication became decreasingly limiting for cell division, while correlations between birth and division and between subsequent replication-initiation events were maintained. Our experiments support the hypothesis that both chromosome replication and a replication-independent inter-division process can limit cell division: the two processes have balanced contributions in non-perturbed cells, while our width perturbations increase the odds of the replication-independent process being limiting.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A functional genetic toolbox for human tissue-derived organoids</a></h4>

              
                Human organoid systems recapitulate key features of organs offering platforms for modelling developmental biology and disease. Tissue-derived organoids have been widely used to study the impact of extrinsic niche factors on stem cells. However, they are rarely used to study endogenous gene function due to the lack of efficient gene manipulation tools. Previously, we established a human foetal lung organoid system (Nikolić et al., 2017). Here, using this organoid system as an example we have systematically developed and optimised a complete genetic toolbox for use in tissue-derived organoids. This includes 'Organoid Easytag' our efficient workflow for targeting all types of gene loci through CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination followed by flow cytometry for enriching correctly-targeted cells. Our toolbox also incorporates conditional gene knock-down or overexpression using tightly-inducible CRISPR interference and CRISPR activation which is the first efficient application of these techniques to tissue-derived organoids. These tools will facilitate gene perturbation studies in tissue-derived organoids facilitating human disease modelling and providing a functional counterpart to many on-going descriptive studies, such as the Human Cell Atlas Project.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Closed-loop auditory stimulation method to modulate sleep slow waves and motor learning performance in rats</a></h4>

              
                Slow waves and cognitive output have been modulated in humans by phase-targeted auditory stimulation. However, to advance its technical development and further our understanding, implementation of the method in animal models is indispensable. Here, we report the successful employment of slow waves' phase-targeted closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS) in rats. To validate this new tool both conceptually and functionally, we tested the effects of up- and down‑phase CLAS on proportions and spectral characteristics of sleep, and on learning performance in the single-pellet reaching task, respectively. Without affecting 24-h sleep-wake behavior, CLAS specifically altered delta (slow waves) and sigma (sleep spindles) power persistently over chronic periods of stimulation. While up-phase CLAS does not elicit a significant change in behavioral performance, down-phase CLAS exerted a detrimental effect on overall engagement and success rate in the behavioral test. Overall CLAS-dependent spectral changes were positively correlated with learning performance. Altogether, our results provide proof-of-principle evidence that phase-targeted CLAS of slow waves in rodents is efficient, safe and stable over chronic experimental periods, enabling the use of this high‑specificity tool for basic and preclinical translational sleep research.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Divergent acyl carrier protein decouples mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis from fatty acid synthesis in malaria parasites</a></h4>

              
                Most eukaryotic cells retain a mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (FASII) pathway whose acyl carrier protein (mACP) and 4-phosphopantetheine (Ppant) prosthetic group provide a soluble scaffold for acyl chain synthesis and biochemically couple FASII activity to mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) assembly and Fe-S cluster biogenesis. In contrast, the mitochondrion of <i>Plasmodium falciparum </i>malaria parasites lacks FASII enzymes yet curiously retains a divergent mACP lacking a Ppant group. We report that ligand-dependent knockdown of mACP is lethal to parasites, indicating an essential FASII-independent function. Decyl-ubiquinone rescues parasites temporarily from death, suggesting a dominant dysfunction of the mitochondrial ETC. Biochemical studies reveal that <i>Plasmodium </i>mACP binds and stabilizes the Isd11-Nfs1 complex required for Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, despite lacking the Ppant group required for this association in other eukaryotes, and knockdown of parasite mACP causes loss of Nfs1 and the Rieske Fe-S protein in ETC Complex III. This work reveals that <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites have evolved to decouple mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis from FASII activity, and this adaptation is a shared metabolic feature of other apicomplexan pathogens, including <i>Toxoplasma</i> and <i>Babesia</i>. This discovery unveils an evolutionary driving force to retain interaction of mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis with ACP independent of its eponymous function in FASII.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Calcium dependence of neurotransmitter release at a high fidelity synapse</a></h4>

              
                The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of the priming, fusion, and replenishment of synaptic vesicles are fundamental parameters controlling neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. Despite intense efforts, these important steps in the synaptic vesicles’ cycle remain poorly understood due to the technical challenge in disentangling vesicle priming, fusion, and replenishment. Here, we investigated the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of these steps at mossy fiber synapses in the rodent cerebellum, which are characterized by fast vesicle replenishment mediating high-frequency signaling. We found that the basal free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (&lt;200 nM) critically controls action potential-evoked release, indicating a high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for vesicle priming. Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging experiments revealed a surprisingly shallow and non-saturating relationship between release rate and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration up to 50 μM. The rate of vesicle replenishment during sustained elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration exhibited little Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence. Finally, quantitative mechanistic release schemes with five Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding steps incorporating rapid vesicle replenishment via parallel or sequential vesicle pools could explain our data. We thus show that co-existing high- and low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors mediate priming, fusion, and replenishment of synaptic vesicles at a high-fidelity synapse.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bayesian inference of population prevalence</a></h4>

              
                Within neuroscience, psychology, and neuroimaging, the most frequently used statistical approach is null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) of the population mean. An alternative approach is to perform NHST within individual participants and then infer, from the proportion of participants showing an effect, the prevalence of that effect in the population. We propose a novel Bayesian method to estimate such population prevalence that offers several advantages over population mean NHST. This method provides a population-level inference that is currently missing from study designs with small participant numbers, such as in traditional psychophysics and in precision imaging. Bayesian prevalence delivers a quantitative population estimate with associated uncertainty instead of reducing an experiment to a binary inference. Bayesian prevalence is widely applicable to a broad range of studies in neuroscience, psychology, and neuroimaging. Its emphasis on detecting effects within individual participants can also help address replicability issues in these fields.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A spiking neural network model of the Superior Colliculus that is robust to changes in the spatial-temporal input</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have indicated that the location of a large neural population in the Superior Colliculus (SC) motor map specifies the amplitude and direction of the saccadic eye-movement vector, while the saccade trajectory and velocity profile are encoded by the population firing rates. We recently proposed a simple spiking neural network model of the SC motor map, based on linear summation of individual spike effects of each recruited neuron, which accounts for many of the observed properties of SC cells in relation to the ensuing eye movement. However, in the model, the cortical input was kept invariant across different saccades. Electrical microstimulation and reversible lesion studies have demonstrated that the saccade properties are quite robust against large changes in supra-threshold SC activation, but that saccade amplitude and peak eye-velocity systematically decrease at low input strengths. These features are not accounted for by the linear spike-vector summation model. Here we show that the models input projection strengths and intra-collicular lateral connections can be tuned to generate saccades that follow the experimental results.

                Approximately 70% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have co-morbid vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID); this highly prevalent overlap of dementia subtypes is known as mixed dementia (MxD). AD is more prevalent in women, while VCID is slightly more prevalent in men. Sex differences in risk factors may contribute to sex differences in dementia subtypes. Unlike metabolically healthy women, diabetic women are more likely to develop VCID than diabetic men. Prediabetes is 3x more prevalent than diabetes and is linked to earlier onset of dementia in women, but not men. How prediabetes influences underlying pathology and cognitive outcomes across different dementia subtypes is unknown. To fill this gap in knowledge, we investigated the impact of diet-induced prediabetes and biological sex on cognitive function and neuropathology in mouse models of AD and MxD. Male and female 3xTg-AD mice received a sham (AD model) or unilateral common carotid artery occlusion surgery to induce chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (MxD model). Mice were fed a control or high fat (HF; 60% fat) diet for 3 months prior to behavior assessment. In both sexes, HF diet elicited a prediabetic phenotype (impaired glucose tolerance) and weight gain. In females, but not males, metabolic consequences of a HF diet were more severe in AD or MxD mice compared to WT. In both sexes, HF-fed AD or MxD mice displayed deficits in spatial memory in the Morris water maze (MWM). In females, but not males, HF-fed AD and MxD mice also displayed impaired spatial learning in the MWM. In females, but not males, AD or MxD caused deficits in activities of daily living, regardless of diet. Astrogliosis was more severe in AD and MxD females compared to males. Further, HF diet caused greater accumulation of amyloid beta in MxD females compared to MxD males. In females, but not males, more severe glucose intolerance (prediabetes) was correlated with increased hippocampal microgliosis. In conclusion, high fat diet had a wider array of metabolic, cognitive, and neuropathological consequences in AD and MxD females compared to males. These findings shed light on potential underlying mechanisms by which prediabetes may lead to earlier dementia onset in women.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fusion of quantitative susceptibility maps and T1-weighted images improve braintissue contrast in primates</a></h4>

              
                Recent progress in quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has enabled the accurate delineation of submillimeter scale subcortical brain structures in humans. QSM reflects the magnetic susceptibility arising from the spatial distribution of iron, myelin, and calcium in the brain. The simultaneous visualization of cortical, subcortical, and white matter structure remains, however, challenging, utilizing QSM data solely. Here we present TQ-SILiCON, a fusion method that enhances the contrast of cortical and subcortical structures and provides an excellent white matter delineation by combining QSM and conventional T1-weighted (T1w) images. In this study, we first established QSM in the macaque monkey to map iron-rich subcortical structures. Implementing the same QSM acquisition and analyses methods allowed a similar accurate delineation of subcortical structures in humans. Moreover, applying automatic brain tissue segmentation to TQ-SILiCON images of the macaque improved the classification of the brain tissue types as compared to the single T1 contrast. Furthermore, we validate our dual-contrast fusion approach in humans and similarly demonstrate improvements in automated segmentation of cortical and subcortical structures. We believe the proposed contrast will facilitate translational studies in non-human primates to investigate the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases that affect the subcortical structures of the basal ganglia in humans.

                Glutamate is the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters (EAATs) regulate extracellular glutamate by transporting it into cells, mostly glia, to terminate neurotransmission and to avoid neurotoxicity. EAATs are also chloride (Cl-) channels, but the physiological role of Cl- conductance through EAATs is poorly understood. Mutations of human EAAT1 (hEAAT1) have been identified in patients with episodic ataxia type 6 (EA6). One mutation showed increased Cl- channel activity and decreased glutamate transport, but the relative contributions of each function of hEAAT1 to mechanisms underlying the pathology of EA6 remain unclear. Here we investigated the effects of five additional EA6-related mutations on hEAAT1 function in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and on CNS function in a Drosophila melanogaster model of locomotor behavior. Our results indicate that mutations with decreased hEAAT1 Cl- channel activity and functional glutamate transport can also contribute to the pathology of EA6, highlighting the importance of Cl- homeostasis in glial cells for proper CNS function. We also identified a novel mechanism involving an ectopic sodium (Na+) leak conductance in glial cells. Together, these results strongly support the idea that EA6 is primarily an ion channelopathy of CNS glia.

	<p>Background: Numerous data show a role for genetic polymorphisms in the development of epilepsy. Previously, the TT genotype of the MTHFR 677C&amp;amp;gt;T polymorphism was found to be associated with a decreased leucocyte DNA methylation status. Polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene could modify the pharmacodynamics of many drugs. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the relationship between MTHFR 677C&amp;amp;gt;T polymorphism and susceptibility to epilepsy in young patients. Methods: Available databases (PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, SciELO, and Medline) were searched using specific keywords. Eight studies, published between 1999 and 2019, with 1678 young patients with epilepsy and 1784 controls, met the inclusion criteria. Apart from the total groups, additional analyses in age subgroups (i.e., young adults and children) were conducted. Statistical analyses were conducted using the RevMan 5.4 and MedCalc software. The pooled odds ratio (OR) was estimated with a random- or fixed-effects model depending on the heterogeneity. Analyses were performed for five genetic models, i.e., dominant (CT + TT vs. CC), recessive (TT vs. CC + CT), additive (TT vs. CC), heterozygous (CT vs. CC), and allelic (T vs. C). The publication bias was assessed with the use of Egger’s and Begg’s tests. Results: Both the MTHFR TT genotype (in the additive model) and the T allele (in the allelic model) significantly increased the risk of epilepsy when the total groups were compared (OR = 1.44, p = 0.002, and OR = 1.183, p = 0.001, respectively). The sensitivity analysis for these models indicated the stability of the results. Similarly, significant results were obtained among young adults for all the genetic models (dominant model: OR = 1.28, p = 0.002; recessive model: OR = 1.48, p = 0.003; additive model: OR = 1.63, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; heterozygous model: OR = 1.21, p = 0.028; and allelic model: OR = 1.256, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Those results were also stable and reliable. In the group of children, no relation between 677C&amp;amp;gt;T polymorphism and epilepsy was observed; however, the analysis was based only on three studies, and one study also comprised young adults. No publication bias was demonstrated. Conclusions: The meta-analysis revealed that the carrier state for the T allele as well as the TT genotype of the MTHFR 677C&amp;amp;gt;T polymorphism increases the risk of epilepsy in young adults but not in children.</p>

	<p>Sleep-related Rhythmic Movement Disorder (RMD) affects around 1% of UK pre-school children. Little is known about RMD in Down syndrome (DS). We aimed to determine: (a) the prevalence of RMD in children with DS aged 1.5–8 years; (b) phenotypic and sleep quality differences between children with DS and RMD and sex- and age-matched DS controls; and (c) night-to-night variability in rhythmic movements (RMs). Parents who previously reported RMs from a DS research registry of 202 children were contacted. If clinical history suggested RMD, home videosomnography (3 nights) was used to confirm RMs and actigraphy (5 nights) was used to assess sleep quality. Phenotype was explored by demographic, strengths and difficulties, Q-CHAT-10/social communication and life events questionnaires. Eight children had confirmed RMD. Minimal and estimated maximal prevalence were 4.10% and 15.38%, respectively. Sleep efficiency was significantly lower in RMD-cases (69.1%) versus controls (85.2%), but there were no other phenotypic differences. There was considerable intra-individual night-to-night variability in RMs. In conclusion, RMD has a high prevalence in children with DS, varies from night to night and is associated with poor sleep quality but, in this small sample, no daytime phenotypic differences were found compared to controls. Children with DS should be screened for RMD, which is amenable to treatment.</p>

	<p>The timing of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is essential for enhancing motor skill learning. Previously, tDCS, before or concurrently, with motor training was evaluated in healthy volunteers or elderly patients, but the optimal timing of stimulation has not been determined. In this study, we aimed to optimize the existing tDCS protocols by exploring the timing-dependent stimulation effects on finger movements in healthy individuals. We conducted a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial. The study participants (n = 39) were randomly assigned into three groups: tDCS concurrently with finger tapping training (CON), tDCS prior to finger tapping training (PRI), and SHAM-tDCS simultaneously with finger tapping training (SHAM). In all groups, the subjects participated in five 40-min training sessions for one week. Motor performance was measured before and after treatment using the finger-tapping task (FTT), the grooved pegboard test (GPT), and hand strength tests. tDCS treatment prior to finger tapping training significantly improved motor skill learning, as indicated by the GPT and hand strength measurements. In all groups, the treatment improved the FTT performance. Our results indicate that applying tDCS before training could be optimal for enhancing motor skill learning. Further research is required to confirm these findings.</p>

	<p>Yogic and meditative traditions have long held that the fluctuations of the breath and the mind are intimately related. While respiratory modulation of cortical activity and attentional switching are established, the extent to which electrophysiological markers of attention exhibit synchronization with respiration is unknown. To this end, we examined (1) frontal midline theta-beta ratio (TBR), an indicator of attentional control state known to correlate with mind wandering episodes and functional connectivity of the executive control network; (2) pupil diameter (PD), a known proxy measure of locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic activity; and (3) respiration for evidence of phase synchronization and information transfer (multivariate Granger causality) during quiet restful breathing. Our results indicate that both TBR and PD are simultaneously synchronized with the breath, suggesting an underlying oscillation of an attentionally relevant electrophysiological index that is phase-locked to the respiratory cycle which could have the potential to bias the attentional system into switching states. We highlight the LC’s pivotal role as a coupling mechanism between respiration and TBR, and elaborate on its dual functions as both a chemosensitive respiratory nucleus and a pacemaker of the attentional system. We further suggest that an appreciation of the dynamics of this weakly coupled oscillatory system could help deepen our understanding of the traditional claim of a relationship between breathing and attention.</p>

                Introduction: Necrotizing enterocolitis is an acute inflammatory disease of the intestine that can lead to necrosis and bowel perforation. It is a severe complication of preterm birth. It’s mortality rate is up to 50% and survival after necrotizing enterocolitis leads to long-term complications. The current treatment is supportive and includes bowel rest and decompression and antibiotics. Thus, new treatments are necessary to reduce mortality and morbidity. Mesenchymal stromal cells are known to have anti-inflammatory properties and might be a promising option for treatment. Here we present a protocol for a systematic review with the aim to explore the efficacy of cell therapies with mesenchymal stromal cells in animal models of necrotizing enterocolitis. The primary outcome is histological signs of necrotizing enterocolitis. Additional outcomes include survival, bowel perforation, gut permeability, gut motility, levels of inflammatory markers, cytokine levels and adverse events. Methods: We will conduct a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The retrieved records will be screened individually by two investigators. We will include all preclinical in vivo animal models of experimentally induced necrotizing enterocolitis that evaluate the efficacy of mesenchymal stromal cells or other cell therapy treatments. Outcome data will be extracted from each article and risk of bias assessment performed. Funnel plots and SYRCLE’s risk of bias tool for animal studies will be used. Data will be reported as ratios, divided in predefined subgroups where relevant. Conclusions: This systematic review aims to examine the efficacy of mesenchymal stromal cells in preclinical models of necrotizing enterocolitis and whether there is sufficient evidence to support a clinical trial of efficacy and safety of the treatment with mesenchymal stromal cells in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Spatio-temporal deep learning model for distortion classification in laparoscopic video [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Laparoscopy is a surgery performed in the abdomen without making large incisions in the skin and with the aid of a video camera, resulting in laparoscopic videos. The laparoscopic video is prone to various distortions such as noise, smoke, uneven illumination, defocus blur, and motion blur. One of the main components in the feedback loop of video enhancement systems is distortion identification, which automatically classifies the distortions affecting the videos and selects the video enhancement algorithm accordingly. This paper aims to address the laparoscopic video distortion identification problem by developing fast and accurate multi-label distortion classification using a deep learning model. Current deep learning solutions based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can address laparoscopic video distortion classification, but they learn only spatial information. Methods: In this paper, utilization of both spatial and temporal features in a CNN-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) model is proposed as a novel solution to enhance the classification. First, pre-trained ResNet50 CNN was used to extract spatial features from each video frame by transferring representation from large-scale natural images to laparoscopic images. Next, LSTM was utilized to consider the temporal relation between the features extracted from the laparoscopic video frames to produce multi-label categories. A novel laparoscopic video dataset proposed in the ICIP2020 challenge was used for training and evaluation of the proposed method. Results: The experiments conducted show that the proposed CNN-LSTM outperforms the existing solutions in terms of accuracy (85%), and F1-score (94.2%). Additionally, the proposed distortion identification model is able to run in real-time with low inference time (0.15 sec). Conclusions: The proposed CNN-LSTM model is a feasible solution to be utilized in laparoscopic videos for distortion identification.

                Determining a Hofstee cut-off point in medical education student assessment is problematic: traditional methods can be time-consuming, inaccurate, and inflexible.  To counter this, we developed a simple Android app that receives raw, unsorted student assessment data in .csv format, allows for multiple judges’ inputs, mean or median inputs, calculates the Hofstee cut-off mathematically, and outputs the results with other guiding information. The app contains a detailed description of its functionality.

                Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that has infected in a year more than 200 million people and has killed almost 4.5 million people worldwide. This infection affects mainly certain groups of people that have high susceptibility to present severe COVID-19 due to comorbidities. Moreover, the long-COVID-19 comprises a series of symptoms that may remain in some patients for months after infection that further compromises health of individuals. Therefore, this pandemic poses a serious emergency worldwide. Thus, since this pandemic is profoundly affecting economic and social life of societies, a deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle could help to envisage novel therapeutic alternatives that limit or stop COVID-19. Several recent findings have unexpectedly found that mitochondria play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. Indeed, it has been suggested that this organelle could be the origin of its replication niches, the double membrane vesicles (DMV), as its been observed with another virus. In this regard, mitochondria derived vesicles (MDV), involved in mitochondria quality control, were discovered more than 10 years ago and interestingly there is a population characterized by a double membrane. MDV shedding is induced by mitochondrial stress and it has a fast assembly dynamic, reason that perhaps has precluded their identification in electron microscopy or tomography studies. These and other features of MDV together with recent SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome with the host and other findings linking SARS-CoV-2 to mitochondria, support that these vesicles are the precursors of SARS-CoV-2 induced DMV. In this work, the celular, molecular, phenotypical and biochemical evidence that supports this hypothesis is reviewed and integrated into the current model of SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. In this scheme, some relevant questions are raised as pending topics for research that would help in the near future to test this hypothesis. The intention (abstract truncated).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">DeepCellState: An autoencoder-based framework for predicting cell type specific transcriptional states induced by drug treatment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ramzan Umarov, Yu Li, Erik Arner</p>

Drug treatment induces cell type specific transcriptional programs, and as the number of combinations of drugs and cell types grows, the cost for exhaustive screens measuring the transcriptional drug response becomes intractable. We developed DeepCellState, a deep learning autoencoder-based framework, for predicting the induced transcriptional state in a cell type after drug treatment, based on the drug response in another cell type. Training the method on a large collection of transcriptional drug perturbation profiles, prediction accuracy improves significantly over baseline and alternative deep learning approaches when applying the method to two cell types, with improved accuracy when generalizing the framework to additional cell types. Treatments with drugs or whole drug families not seen during training are predicted with similar accuracy, and the same framework can be used for predicting the results from other interventions, such as gene knock-downs. Finally, analysis of the trained model shows that the internal representation is able to learn regulatory relationships between genes in a fully data-driven manner.

                <p>by Bikash K. Bhandari, Chun Shen Lim, Daniela M. Remus, Augustine Chen, Craig van Dolleweerd, Paul P. Gardner</p>

Recombinant protein production is a key process in generating proteins of interest in the pharmaceutical industry and biomedical research. However, about 50% of recombinant proteins fail to be expressed in a variety of host cells. Here we show that the accessibility of translation initiation sites modelled using the mRNA base-unpairing across the Boltzmann’s ensemble significantly outperforms alternative features. This approach accurately predicts the successes or failures of expression experiments, which utilised <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells to express 11,430 recombinant proteins from over 189 diverse species. On this basis, we develop TIsigner that uses simulated annealing to modify up to the first nine codons of mRNAs with synonymous substitutions. We show that accessibility captures the key propensity beyond the target region (initiation sites in this case), as a modest number of synonymous changes is sufficient to tune the recombinant protein expression levels. We build a stochastic simulation model and show that higher accessibility leads to higher protein production and slower cell growth, supporting the idea of protein cost, where cell growth is constrained by protein circuits during over expression.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the highly dynamic metabolic landscape of a neuron, mitochondrial membrane architectures can provide critical insight into the unique energy balance of the cell. Current theoretical calculations of functional outputs like ATP and heat often represent mitochondria as idealized geometries and therefore can miscalculate the metabolic uxes. To analyze mitochondrial morphology in neurons of mouse cerebellum neuropil, 3D tracings of complete synaptic and axonal mitochondria were constructed using a database of serial TEM tomography images and converted to watertight meshes with minimal distortion of the original microscopy volumes with a granularity of 1.64 nanometer isotropic voxels. The resulting in silico representations were subsequently quanti ed by di erential geometry methods in terms of the mean and Gaussian curvatures, surface areas, volumes, and membrane motifs, all of which can alter the metabolic output of the organelle. Finally, we identify structural motifs present across this population of mitochondria, which may contribute to future modeling studies of mitochondrial physiology and metabolism in neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Relation of Pre‐Stroke Aspirin Use With Cerebral Infarct Volume and Functional Outcomes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We investigated (1) the associations between pre-stroke aspirin use and thrombus burden, infarct volume, hemorrhagic transformation, early neurological deterioration (END), and functional outcome, and (2) whether stroke subtypes modify these associations in first-ever ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based study included 5,700 consecutive patients with acute first-ever ischemic stroke, who did not undergo intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular thrombectomy, from May 2011 through February 2014. Propensity score-based augmented inverse probability weighting was performed to estimate adjusted effects of pre-stroke aspirin use.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The mean age was 67 years (41% women), and 15.9% (n = 907) were taking aspirin before stroke. Pre-stroke aspirin use (vs nonuse) was significantly related to a reduced infarct volume (by 30%), particularly in large artery atherosclerosis stroke (by 45%). In cardioembolic stroke, pre-stroke aspirin use was associated with a ~50% lower incidence of END (adjusted difference = −5.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = −8.9 to −1.9). Thus, pre-stroke aspirin use was associated with ~30% higher likelihood of favorable outcome (3-month modified Rankin Scale score &lt; 3), particularly in large artery atherosclerosis stroke and cardioembolic stroke (adjusted difference = 7.2%, 95% CI = 1.8 to 12.5 and adjusted difference = 6.4%, 95% CI = 1.7 to 11.1, respectively). Pre-stroke aspirin use (vs nonuse) was associated with 85% less frequent cerebral thrombus-related susceptibility vessel sign (SVS) in large artery atherosclerosis stroke (adjusted difference = −1.4%, 95% CI = −2.1 to −0.8, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and was associated with ~40% lower SVS volumes, particularly in cardioembolic stroke (adjusted difference = −0.16 cm<sup>3</sup>, 95% CI = −0.29 to −0.02, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Moreover, pre-stroke aspirin use was not significantly associated with hemorrhagic transformation (adjusted difference = −1.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.09).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pre-stroke aspirin use associates with improved functional independence in patients with first-ever ischemic large arterial stroke by reducing infarct volume and/or END, likely by decreasing thrombus burden, without increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The implications of Industry 4.0 on supply chains amid the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: COVID-19 has caused significant disruptions in supply chains. It has increased the demand for products and decreased the supply of raw materials. This has interrupted many production processes. The emerging technologies of Industry 4.0 have the potential to streamline supply chains by improving time-sensitive customized solutions during this emergency. Purpose: This research examines the effects of the epidemic on supply chains and how these effects are reduced through Industry 4.0 technology. Design/methodology/approach: An extensive literature review using the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis” method was carried out on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains and Industry 4.0 technologies. The study was undertaken by selecting keywords validated by experts and a search was conducted in the Scopus, ProQuest, and Google Scholar databases. Publications from the leading journals on these topics were selected. The bibliographical search resulted in 1484 articles followed by multiple layers of filtering. Finally, the most pertinent articles were selected for reviewing, and a total of 53 articles were analysed. Findings: This study discusses the impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain and how the emerging technologies of Industry 4.0 can help manufacturers to ease the impact. These technologies will enhance the production system through the automation and optimization of production flow convergence, enabling efficiencies and improvements among the suppliers, manufacturers, and consumers in the COVID-19 situation. Originality/value: The study summarizes the impact of the COVID-19 on supply chains and shows the potential of Industry 4.0 technologies to lessen the impact on manufacturing supply chains. This is valuable information for policymakers and practitioners so that they can get insights and take necessary actions.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">PTEN mutations in autism spectrum disorder and congenital hydrocephalus: developmental pleiotropy and therapeutic targets</a></h4>

              
                The lack of effective treatments for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and congenital hydrocephalus (CH) reflects the limited understanding of the biology underlying these common neurodevelopmental disorders. Although ASD and CH have been extensively studied as independent entities, recent human genomic and preclinical animal studies have uncovered shared molecular pathophysiology. Here, we review and discuss phenotypic, genomic, and molecular similarities between ASD and CH, and identify the PTEN–PI3K–mTOR (phosphatase and tensin homolog–phosphoinositide 3-kinase–mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway as a common underlying mechanism that holds diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic promise for individuals with ASD and CH.

                Duan et al. reveal a key role of mitophagy in anxiety induced by chronic psychogenic stress. Mitophagy is enhanced by stress to cause mitochondrial loss, leading to synaptic weakening in the anxiolytic pathway mediated by the extended amygdala. Mitochondria and mitophagy, therefore, may be targeted to ameliorate anxiety.

                Hyperactive epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is believed to contribute to excessive Na+ and fluid reabsorption in cystic fibrosis airways. This hypothesis has been challenged by studies in CFTR−/− swine showing no increased Na+ reabsorption. Luan et al. report that cAMP-stimulated distal airways of CFTR−/− swine suffer from ENaC-mediated Na+ reabsorption.

                Muzzu and Saleem find neurons in the mouse visual cortex responding to stops or perturbations of open-loop visual flow. Perturbation responses are enhanced by running, and responsive neurons prefer low visual speeds. These results suggest concurrent selectivity for low visual speeds and running can explain sensorimotor mismatch signals in the visual cortex.

                In postmitotic brain cells, histones lost during transcription must be replenished by replication-independent mechanisms. Schoberleitner et al. show that the chromatin remodeling factor CHD1 is involved in this process. CHD1 loss results in reduced histone H3.3 levels, global chromatin perturbation, transcriptional dysregulation, and defects in feeding behavior, metabolism, and lifespan.
