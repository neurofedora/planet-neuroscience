              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23030">Place-cell heterogeneity underlies power-laws in hippocampal activity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.23030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power-law scaling in coarse-grained data suggests critical dynamics, but the true source of this scaling often remains unclear. Here, we analyze neural activity recorded during spatial navigation, reproducing power-law scaling under a phenomenological renormalization group (PRG) procedure that clusters units by activity similarity. Such scaling was previously linked to criticality. Here, we show that the iterative nature of the procedure itself leads to the emergence of power laws when applied to heterogeneous, non-interacting units obeying spatially structured activity without requiring critical interactions. Furthermore, the scaling exponents produced by heteregeneous non-interacting units match the observed exponents in recorded neural data. A simplified version of the PRG further reveals how heterogeneity smooths transitions across scales, mimicking critical behavior. The resulting exponents depend systematically on system and population size, predictions confirmed by subsampling the data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23116">Alpha-Z divergence unveils further distinct phenotypic traits of human brain connectivity fingerprint</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.23116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate identification of individuals from functional connectomes (FCs) is critical for advancing individualized assessments in neuropsychiatric research. Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have limitations in capturing the complex, non-Euclidean geometry of FC data, leading to suboptimal performance in identification performance. Recent developments have introduced geodesic distance as a more robust metric; however, its performance is highly sensitive to regularization choices, which vary by spatial scale and task condition. To address these challenges, we propose a novel divergence-based distance metric, the Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence, which provides a more flexible and geometry-aware framework for FC comparison. Unlike prior methods, our approach does not require meticulous parameter tuning and maintains strong identification performance across multiple task conditions and spatial resolutions. We evaluate our approach against both traditional (e.g., Euclidean, Pearson) and state-of-the-art manifold-based distances (e.g., affine-invariant, log-Euclidean, Bures-Wasserstein), and systematically investigate how varying regularization strengths affect geodesic distance performance on the Human Connectome Project dataset. Our results show that the proposed method significantly improves identification rates over traditional and geodesic distances, particularly when optimized regularization is applied, and especially in high-dimensional settings where matrix rank deficiencies degrade existing metrics. We further validate its generalizability across resting-state and task-based fMRI, using multiple parcellation schemes. These findings suggest that the new divergence provides a more reliable and generalizable framework for functional connectivity analysis, offering enhanced sensitivity in linking FC patterns to cognitive and behavioral outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23678">A complex network perspective on brain disease</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.23678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If brain anatomy and dynamics have a genuine complex network structure as it has become standard to posit, it is also reasonable to assume that such a structure should play a key role not only in brain function but also in brain dysfunction. However, exactly how network structure is implicated in brain damage and whether at least some pathologies can be thought of as "network diseases" is not entirely clear. Here we discuss ways in which a complex network representation can help characterising brain pathology, but also subjects' vulnerability to and likelihood of recovery from disease. We show how the way disease is defined is related to the way function is defined and this, in turn, determines which network property may be functionally relevant to brain disease. Thus, addressing brain disease "networkness" may shed light not only on brain pathology, with potential clinical implications, but also on functional brain activity, and what is functional in it.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22954">Neural Autoregressive Modeling of Brain Aging</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.22954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges, we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns. NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23057">Neural Energy Landscapes Predict Working Memory Decline After Brain Tumor Resection</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.23057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients, but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models. Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts. Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1 score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.

                arXiv:2507.23359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic segmentation of neuronal topology is critical for handling large scale neuroimaging data, as it can greatly accelerate neuron annotation and analysis. However, the intricate morphology of neuronal branches and the occlusions among fibers pose significant challenges for deep learning based segmentation. To address these issues, we propose an improved framework: First, we introduce a deep network that outputs pixel level embedding vectors and design a corresponding loss function, enabling the learned features to effectively distinguish different neuronal connections within occluded regions. Second, building on this model, we develop an end to end pipeline that directly maps raw neuronal images to SWC formatted neuron structure trees. Finally, recognizing that existing evaluation metrics fail to fully capture segmentation accuracy, we propose a novel topological assessment metric to more appropriately quantify the quality of neuron segmentation and reconstruction. Experiments on our fMOST imaging dataset demonstrate that, compared to several classical methods, our approach significantly reduces the error rate in neuronal topology reconstruction.

Abstract: This article explores a critical gap in Mixed Reality (MR) technology: while advances have been made, MR still struggles to authentically replicate human embodiment and socio-motor interaction. For MR to enable truly meaningful social experiences, it needs to incorporate multi-modal data streams and multi-agent interaction capabilities. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive glossary covering key topics such as Virtual Characters and Autonomisation, Responsible AI, Ethics by Design, and the Scientific Challenges of Social MR within Neuroscience, Embodiment, and Technology. Our aim is to drive the transformative evolution of MR technologies that prioritize human-centric innovation, fostering richer digital connections. We advocate for MR systems that enhance social interaction and collaboration between humans and virtual autonomous agents, ensuring inclusivity, ethical design and psychological safety in the process.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08184">Unable to Forget: Proactive Interference Reveals Working Memory Limits in LLMs Beyond Context Length</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.08184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information retrieval in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly recognized as intertwined with generation capabilities rather than mere lookup. While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs' ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information, suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content during retrieval.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22916">From Propagator to Oscillator: The Dual Role of Symmetric Differential Equations in Neural Systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.22916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work, we proposed a novel neuron model based on symmetric differential equations and demonstrated its potential as an efficient signal propagator. Building upon that foundation, the present study delves deeper into the intrinsic dynamics and functional diversity of this model. By systematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of mathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core property of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct trajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable signal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained self-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable effective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we introduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation results confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be induced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection structure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by introducing external signals. These findings draw a compelling parallel to the dual roles of biological neurons in both information transmission and rhythm generation, thereby establishing a solid theoretical basis and a clear functional roadmap for the broader application of this model in neuromorphic engineering.

This study evaluates four popular global optimization algorithms: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Fireworks Algorithm (FWA), for extracting parameters from FDTR measurements of a GaN/Si heterostructure. However, none achieve reliable convergence within 60 seconds. To improve convergence speed and accuracy, we propose an AI-driven hybrid optimization framework that combines each global algorithm with a Quasi-Newton local refinement method, resulting in four hybrid variants: HGA, HQGA, HPSO, and HFWA. Among these, HPSO outperforms all other methods, with 80% of trials reaching the target fitness value within 60 seconds, showing greater robustness and a lower risk of premature convergence. In contrast, only 30% of HGA and HQGA trials and 20% of HFWA trials achieve this threshold. We then evaluate the worst-case performance across 100 independent trials for each algorithm when the time is extended to 1000 seconds. Only HPSO, PSO, and HGA consistently reach the target accuracy, with HPSO converging five times faster than the others. HPSO provides a general-purpose solution for inverse problems in thermal metrology and can be readily extended to other model-fitting techniques.

                arXiv:2507.23474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate finger force estimation is critical for next-generation human-machine interfaces. Traditional electromyography (EMG)-based decoding methods using deep learning require large datasets and high computational resources, limiting their use in real-time, embedded systems. Here, we propose a novel approach that performs finger force regression using spike trains from individual motor neurons, extracted from high-density EMG. These biologically grounded signals drive a spiking neural network implemented on a mixed-signal neuromorphic processor. Unlike prior work that encodes EMG into events, our method exploits spike timing on motor units to perform low-power, real-time inference. This is the first demonstration of motor neuron-based continuous regression computed directly on neuromorphic hardware. Our results confirm accurate finger-specific force prediction with minimal energy use, opening new possibilities for embedded decoding in prosthetics and wearable neurotechnology.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23033">Adaptive Time-step Training for Enhancing Spike-Based Neural Radiance Fields</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.23033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process. Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running power by 61.55\%.

                arXiv:2506.05588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) has attracted attention as an efficient recurrent neural network architecture due to its simplified training, requiring only its last perceptron readout layer to be trained. When implemented with memristors, RC systems benefit from their dynamic properties, which make them ideal for reservoir construction. However, achieving high performance in memristor-based RC remains challenging, as it critically depends on the input preprocessing method and reservoir size. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive evaluation that quantifies the impact of these factors is still lacking. This paper systematically compares various preprocessing methods for memristive RC systems, assessing their effects on accuracy and energy consumption. We also propose a parity-based preprocessing method that improves accuracy by 2-6% while requiring only a modest increase in device count compared to other methods. Our findings highlight the importance of informed preprocessing strategies to improve the efficiency and scalability of memristive RC systems.

Agent-based models of malaria transmission are useful tools for understanding disease dynamics and planning interventions, but they can be computationally intensive to calibrate. We present a multitask deep learning approach for emulating and calibrating a complex agent-based model of malaria transmission. Our neural network emulator was trained on a large suite of simulations from the EMOD malaria model, an agent-based model of malaria transmission dynamics, capturing relationships between immunological parameters and epidemiological outcomes such as age-stratified incidence and prevalence across eight sub-Saharan African study sites. We then use the trained emulator in conjunction with parameter estimation techniques to calibrate the underlying model to reference data. Taken together, this analysis shows the potential of machine learning-guided emulator design for complex scientific processes and their comparison to field data.

                <p>by Sofie Verhees, Chandrasekhar Venkataraman, Mariya Ptashnyk</p>

We derive and simulate a mathematical model for mechanotransduction related to the Rho GTPase signalling pathway. The model addresses the bidirectional coupling between signalling processes and cell mechanics. A numerical method based on bulk-surface finite elements is proposed for the approximation of the coupled system of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations, defined inside the cell and on the cell membrane, and the equations of elasticity. Our simulation results illustrate novel emergent features such as the strong dependence of the dynamics on cell shape, a threshold-like response to changes in substrate stiffness, and the fact that coupling mechanics and signalling can lead to the robustness of cell deformation to larger changes in substrate stiffness, ensuring mechanical homeostasis in agreement with experiments.

                <p>by Chloe Herman, Evan Bolyen, Anthony Simard, Liz Gehret, J. Gregory Caporaso</p>

We present q2-fmt, a QIIME 2 plugin that provides diverse methods for assessing the extent of microbiome engraftment following fecal microbiota transplant. The methods implemented here were informed by a recent literature review on approaches for assessing FMT engraftment, and cover aspects of engraftment including Community Coalescence, Indicator Features, and Resilience. q2-fmt is free for all use, and detailed documentation illustrating worked examples on a real-world data set are provided in the project’s documentation.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Among all upper extremity nerves, the ulnar nerve is both the most commonly injured and notoriously difficult to regenerate. Despite this, ulnar nerve injuries remain understudied. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) offer an ideal model for the human upper extremity, but existing NHP nerve trauma literature is biased towards median and radial injury models. To address this, a nonhuman primate ulnar nerve injury model was developed and regeneration assessed following sural nerve autografting using electrophysiological and histological techniques. Unilateral 4 cm ulnar nerve injuries were created at the mid-forearm level, sural nerve autografts were sutured into resulting defects (<i>n</i> = 3), and animals were survived for 6 months. At the terminal time point, intraoperative electrophysiological testing, tissue harvest, and tissue processing were performed. Naïve nerves (<i>n</i> = 5) served as controls. Animals appeared clinically normal throughout the study period, other than an expected decrease in fine hand muscle function. After 6 months, histological and electrophysiological evidence suggested that axons crossed the graft and reached distal muscle targets. However, regenerating nerves exhibited a reduced motor nerve conduction velocity, reduced compound action muscle potential (CMAP) amplitude and area under the curve, increased latency, and increased duration versus naïve controls as expected. Histological analysis revealed reduced axon diameters, thinner myelin sheaths, and smaller muscle fiber cross-sectional areas as compared to controls. At 6 months post-injury, 4 cm ulnar defects bridged with sural autografts show signs of ongoing regeneration and nascent reinnervation. Specific electrophysiological and histological benchmarks for ulnar nerve recovery following clinically relevant autografting are presented.</p>

                In the brain, maintaining the appropriate levels of excitation and inhibition is required for proper cognitive function. Inhibitory neurons, essential for maintaining this balance and implicated in various neurodevelopmental diseases, are generated during embryonic development from the ganglionic eminences (GEs). This review discusses the importance of inhibitory neuronal subtypes generated from the most posterior GE subregion, the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE), highlighting what is known about their developmental origins, diversity, and functions in mice, humans, and non-human primates. By reviewing the molecular composition and patterning of the CGE, we discuss how technological advances have provided insights into the spatial heterogeneity of progenitor populations and the distinctive molecular characteristics and functions of CGE-derived neurons.

                Acosta et al. find that ADP-ribosylation of the lipoic acid carrier protein GcvH-L promotes Staphylococcus aureus resistance to oxidative burst and facilitates infection. ADP-ribosylation leads to a structural shift within GcvH-L that safeguards lipoic acid sulfhydryls from detrimental oxidation and regulates its transfer to enzyme complexes required for growth.

                Santiago-Borges et al. test a FimH-based mucosal vaccine to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) by targeting uropathogenic Escherichia coli reservoirs in the gut. Microbial competition plays a significant role in vaccine effectiveness, emphasizing the need to consider host-microbe interactions. This approach offers a promising antibiotic-free strategy to combat UTIs.

                Understanding how a single genome creates distinct phenotypes remains a fundamental challenge for biologists. Social insects provide a striking example of polyphenism, with queen and worker castes exhibiting morphological, behavioral, and reproductive differences. Here, we show that trophic eggs, which do not contain an embryo and are primarily regarded as a source of food, play a role in the process of caste determination in the harvester ant <i>Pogonomyrmex rugosus</i>. When first instar larvae were given access to trophic eggs, they mostly developed into workers. By contrast, larvae without access to trophic eggs developed into queens. We found that trophic eggs differ in many ways from viable eggs, including texture, morphology, and their contents of protein, triglycerides, glycogen, sugar, and small RNAs. Moreover, comparison of miRNA fragment size distributions suggests differences in the composition of miRNAs between the two egg types. This is the first demonstration of trophic eggs playing a role in caste determination in social insects.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103945">Elevated ubiquitin phosphorylation by PINK1 contributes to proteasomal impairment and promotes neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Ubiquitin (Ub), a central regulator of protein turnover, can be phosphorylated by PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) to generate S65-phosphorylated ubiquitin (pUb). Elevated pUb levels have been observed in aged human brains and in Parkinson’s disease, but the mechanistic link between pUb elevation and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that pUb elevation is a common feature under neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, aging, and ischemic injury. We show that impaired proteasomal activity leads to the accumulation of sPINK1, the cytosolic form of PINK1 that is normally proteasome-degraded rapidly. This accumulation increases ubiquitin phosphorylation, which then inhibits ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal activity by interfering with both ubiquitin chain elongation and proteasome-substrate interactions. Specific expression of sPINK1 in mouse hippocampal neurons induced progressive pUb accumulation, accompanied by protein aggregation, proteostasis disruption, neuronal injury, neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline. Conversely, Pink1 knockout mitigated protein aggregation in both mouse brains and HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the detrimental effects of sPINK1 could be counteracted by co-expressing Ub/S65A phospho-null mutant but exacerbated by over-expressing Ub/S65E phospho-mimic mutant. Together, these findings reveal that pUb elevation, triggered by reduced proteasomal activity, inhibits proteasomal activity and forms a feedforward loop that drives progressive neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103331">Effects of parental care on skin microbial community composition in poison frogs</a></h4>

              
                 Parent-offspring interactions constitute the first contact of many newborns with their environment, priming community assembly of microbes through priority effects and shaping host health and disease. Microbe acquisition during parental care is well studied in humans and agriculturally relevant species but remains poorly understood in other vertebrate groups, such as amphibians. Here, we investigate vertical transmission of skin microbiota in poison frogs (<i>Dendrobatidae</i>), where fathers transport tadpoles piggyback-style from terrestrial clutches to aquatic nurseries. We found that substantial bacterial colonization of embryos begins after hatching, suggesting that the vitelline envelope acts as a microbial barrier. A cross-foster experiment demonstrated that poison frogs performing tadpole transport serve as a source of skin microbes for tadpoles on their back. To study how transport impacts skin communities of tadpoles in an ecologically relevant setting, we sampled sympatric species that do or do not exhibit tadpole transport in their natural habitat. We did not find a higher degree of similarity between microbial communities of tadpoles and adults in species that transport their offspring compared to those that do not. Similarly, communities of tadpoles were no more similar to their caregiver than to unrelated adults, indicating that most caregiver-associated microbes do not remain in tadpole communities long-term. Nonetheless, some taxa persisted on tadpoles over development. This study is the first to demonstrate that offspring transport facilitates transmission of parental skin microbes in anurans.

">Blood and Neuronal Extracellular Vesicle Mitochondrial Disruptions in Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                The high energy demand of the human brain obligates robust mitochondrial energy metabolism, while mitochondrial dysfunctions have been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). However, in vivo assessments that can directly inform brain mitochondrial functioning and its etiopathophysiological path to SSD remain difficult to obtain. We hypothesized that system and brain mitochondrial dysfunctions in SSD may be indexed by elevated cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA) levels in the blood and in neuronal extracellular vesicles (nEVs). We also explored if these mtDNA marker elevations were associated brain metabolites as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). We examined blood cf-mtDNA in 58 SSD patients and 33 healthy controls, followed by assessing nEV mtDNA and metabolite levels using MRS in a subgroup of patients and controls. We found that people with SSD had significantly elevated cf-mtDNA levels in both the blood (p=0.0002) and neuronal EVs (p=0.003) compared to controls. These mtDNA abnormalities can be linked back to brain lactate+ levels such that higher blood and nEV mtDNA levels were significantly associated with higher lactate+ levels measured at the anterior cingulate cortex (r=0.53, 0.53; p=0.008, 0.03, respectively) in SSD patients. Furthermore, higher developmental stress and trauma were significantly associated with higher cf-mtDNA levels in both the blood and neuronal EVs in SSD patients (r=0.29, 0.49; p=0.01, 0.03, respectively). In conclusion, if replicated and fully developed, blood and neuronal EV-based cell free mtDNA may provide a clinically accessible biomarker to more directly evaluate the mitochondrial hypothesis and the abnormal bioenergetics pathways in schizophrenia.

">An anterior-posterior gradient in hippocampal subfield volumes linking sleep health to cognition in young adults</a></h4>

              
                Sleep plays a critical role in maintaining hippocampal integrity and supporting cognitive function. However, it remains unclear how variations in sleep are associated with the structurally heterogeneous subfields of the hippocampus and how this association relates to cognition in healthy young adults. This study aimed to elucidate the multivariate relationships among sleep duration, quality, and timing, the specific hippocampal subfield volumes, and cognitive functions in a large sample of healthy young adults. We applied multiset canonical correlation analysis to data from 942 young adults (ages 22-37) from the Human Connectome Project. We examined relationships among self-reported sleep parameters (via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), high-resolution hippocampal subfield volumes, and a broad set of cognitive performance measures. We identified a single significant mode of covariation, wherein better sleep health-characterized by a moderate sleep duration (reflecting a nonlinear, inverted U-shaped relationship), higher sleep quality (e.g., fewer awakenings, less discomfort), and optimal sleep timing-was robustly associated with larger hippocampal volumes, particularly in the anterior subfields. This sleep-hippocampus pattern was also associated with enhanced cognitive performance. Our findings reveal a specific link among sleep, an anterior-dominant pattern of hippocampal structure, and cognition in healthy young adulthood. The anterior hippocampus may serve as a key neural hub through which the cognitive benefits of healthy sleep are manifested early in life.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) involves progressive neurodegeneration and distinctive structural and functional alterations in cortico-basal ganglia circuits. This study proposes bridging the gap between structural and functional biomarkers to uncover fundamental mechanisms underlying PD pathophysiology and support more comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. We examined 50 PD patients using high-resolution MRI to quantify cortical thickness, surface area, and volume in sensorimotor regions, alongside intraoperative neurophysiological recordings of spectral power, burst parameters, and coherence. Pairwise correlation and Sparse Partial Least Squares analyses revealed significant low-dimensional latent relationships, particularly linking cortical atrophy in Brodmann areas BA1-BA6 with alpha and low-beta burst abnormalities. These associations remained robust after controlling for age, disease duration, and symptom severity, and were absent in a control cohort with essential tremor. These findings highlight value of multimodal approaches for uncovering structure-function interactions in PD, and the potential of integrated biomarkers for improving diagnosis, and treatment strategies.

">Extracellular vesicles released from endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier mediate brain Iron accumulation during LPS-induced brain Inflammation</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Brain inflammation leads to an increase in the amount of iron in brain tissue; however, studies do not address the source of the iron that could lead to the accumulation. Most of the brain iron uptake is mediated through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), but studies have not examined whether inflammation increases or decreases iron flux across the BBB. Our recent in vitro study discovered a novel alternate mechanism that iron transport across the BBB is mediated via the extracellular vesicles (EVs). Herein, we investigated the impact of brain inflammation on iron release and iron transport via EVs from the brain microvasculature (BMV). Methods: For this study, we developed an in vivo brain inflammation model. We induced brain inflammation in three-month-old C57BL/6 by intracerebroventricular injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS,12 microgram/mice). For in vitro, we used human blood-brain barrier endothelial cells derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). We separated the BMV from brain parenchyma by using density gradient centrifugation. To inhibit the EVs synthesis, we injected intraperitoneally for 21 days GW4869 (60 microgram/mice), an inhibitor of neutral sphingomyelinase 2, a key regulatory enzyme necessary for EV formation. The brain EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation. We measured the BMV and parenchyma iron concentration by Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Furthermore, we performed immunoblotting to measure the protein expression in BMV and EVs. Results: The LPS injection activated microglia and astrocytes as well as increased the brain proinflammatory cytokines compared to the control mice. Furthermore, brain inflammation increased the iron levels in the brain parenchyma but decreased the iron levels in BMV. Brain inflammation was associated with the degradation of ferroportin (FPN1), an iron exporter, in the BMV. CD63, an EVs membrane protein, was increased in the BMV and associated with increased FTH1-iron release via EVs from BMVs to the brain. Moreover, brain inflammation induced iron deficiency in BMV as evidenced by an increase in the transferrin receptor and decreased FTH1, suggestive of increased iron uptake. Pharmacological reduction of EVs by GW4869 reduced iron accumulation in the inflamed brain parenchyma compared to control mice. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate that EV inhibition decreases iron in the brain. Degradation of FPN1 in the BMV during inflammation did not limit iron accumulation but there was an increase in FTH1-iron-enriched EVs indicating these are responsible for brain iron accumulation during inflammation. Thus, in summary, we have discovered a novel mechanism that involves BMV-released EVs enriched with iron that is the mechanism for brain iron accumulation during inflammation.

">Cytoplasmic TDP-43 leads to early functional impairments without neurodegeneration in a Serotonergic Neuron-Specific C. elegans Model</a></h4>

              
                TDP-43 proteinopathies, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), are marked by the pathological cytoplasmic accumulation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), leading to progressive neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. To investigate the early functional consequences of TDP-43 mislocalization, we generated Caenorhabditis elegans models expressing either wild-type human TDP-43 or a variant with a mutated nuclear localization signal ({Delta}NLS), specifically in serotonergic neurons. These neurons were chosen because i) serotonin deficits are a feature of ALS/FTD and ii) in C. elegans, they regulate well-characterized behaviors, providing a straightforward readout of neuronal function. We found that expression of either TDP-43 variant impaired serotonin-dependent behaviors, including pharyngeal pumping, egg-laying, and locomotion slowing upon food encounter, with the cytoplasmic {Delta}NLS form causing more severe deficits. Serotonergic neurons remained i) morphologically intact, indicating that neuronal dysfunction precedes overt neurodegeneration; and ii) partially responsive to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, suggesting that neurotransmitter release is still partially functional. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that cytoplasmic TDP-43 disrupts neuronal signaling and behavior early in disease progression. This C. elegans model provides a genetically tractable system to dissect early mechanisms of TDP-43-mediated dysfunction and to identify therapeutic strategies targeting predegenerative stages of ALS/FTD.

">Comparative transcriptomics of lateral hypothalamic cell types reveals conserved growth hormone-tachykinin dynamics in feeding</a></h4>

              
                The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is a highly heterogeneous brain region regulating hunger and motivated behaviors. In zebrafish, the LH shows distinct neural activity across hunger, feeding, and satiety states. However, the functional and evolutionary conservation of relevant neural circuits remain unclear. Using integrative transcriptomics of zebrafish and mouse LH, we identify conserved cellular clusters with shared molecular markers, particularly within GABAergic neurons. We highlight a conserved GABAergic population expressing tachykinin and growth hormone receptors, which is responsive to food cues and modulated by hunger and feeding states. This cluster may mediate acute appetite-enhancing effects of growth hormone. In both species, feeding elevates growth hormone receptor and tachykinin expression and activates these neurons, while human growth hormone increases their activity and food intake in zebrafish. These findings suggest a conserved neural mechanism by which metabolic hormones influence feeding behavior. Our comparative LH atlas highlights the evolutionary biology of appetite regulation and the integration of hormonal and neural signals driving energy homeostasis.

                Neurogenic bladder is a debilitating consequence of spinal cord injury (SCI), with few treatment options that restore voluntary voiding. Here, we show that SOX2-mediated in vivo reprogramming of NG2 glia improves bladder function in a clinically relevant mouse model of contusive SCI. NG2 glia reprogramming induces adult neurogenesis, reduces glial scarring, and significantly improves urinary performance, as measured by voiding assays and conscious cystometry. Functional recovery correlates positively with neurogenesis and negatively with glial scarring. These findings demonstrate that SOX2-mediated glial reprogramming promotes autonomic repair and offers a regenerative strategy for neurogenic bladder after SCI.

">Representation Transfer via Invariant Input-driven Neural Manifolds for Brain-inspired Computations</a></h4>

              
                Domain adaptation is a core challenge for embodied AI deployed in unpredictable, noisy environments. Conventional deep models degrade under domain shifts and require costly retraining. Inspired by biological brains, we propose a modular framework where each module is a recurrent neural network pretrained via a simple, task-agnostic protocol to learn robust, transferable features. This shapes stable yet flexible representations as invariant input-driven continuous attractor manifolds embedded in high-dimensional latent space, supporting robust transfer and resilience to noise. At deployment, only a lightweight adapter needs training, enabling rapid few-shot adaptation. Evaluated on the DVS Gesture benchmark and a custom RGB rehabilitation dataset, our framework matches or surpasses leading C3D and ViViT models while using ten times fewer parameters and only one training epoch. By unifying biologically inspired attractor dynamics with cortical-like modular composition, our approach offers a practical path toward robust, continual adaptation for real-world embodied AI.

">Targeting Tmem63b and Piezo2 in C-fiber low threshold mechanoreceptor: limitation of Vglut3-IRES-Cre</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral somatosensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) transduce mechanical force in the skin and other organs into electrical signals using specialized mechanically activated (MA) ion channels that initiate neuronal activation in response to force. Increasing evidence highlights PIEZO2 as the primary transducer of low-threshold mechanical force in DRG neurons. However, in the absence of Piezo2, mice and humans still respond to noxious painful stimuli like pinch, suggesting that additional MA channel(s) likely exist in DRG neurons. Strategies to identify Cre lines and DRG subpopulations that select for non-PIEZO2 expressing neurons is therefore an ongoing effort in the field to discover unknown mechanosensors. Here, we investigated a Vglut3 labeled mouse line as a candidate to identify non-PIEZO2 MA channels in a subtype of DRG neurons called C-fiber low threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs). Our study carefully demonstrates that the Vglut3-IRES-Cre mouse line specifically and efficiently labels C-LTMR neurons of the DRG. Electrophysiological recordings using two different in vitro mechanical stimulation assays show that the genetically labelled Vglut3 neurons have robust indentation- and stretch-activated MA currents that are exclusively slowly or ultra-slowly adapting. To determine whether the Vglut3-IRES-Cre mouse line can be used to delete genes of interest and identify the underlying MA ion channels in C-LTMRs we attempted to generate a Tmem63b conditional knockout using this Cre-line but detected incomplete loss of Tmem63b transcript and lack of TMEM63B-dependent effect on C-LTMR MA currents. Together, our results emphasize that although the Vglut3-IRES-Cre line is robust in driving expression of a conditional reporter gene, it is inefficient in deleting genes like Tmem63b as well as Piezo2.

">In Vivo Network-Level Cerebrovascular Mapping Reveals the Impact of Flow Topology on Capillary Stalls After Stroke</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral microvasculature is essential for brain function, but how flow and large-scale connectivity contribute to its resilience or failure remains poorly understood. To address this, we developed OMNIMap, a framework for mesoscale in vivo mapping of functional microvascular networks, capturing flow dynamics and connectivity across thousands of capillaries. OMNIMap integrates extended-focus optical coherence microscopy and learning-based segmentation with global vessel-graph optimization to resolve artery-vein classification and branching order, linking capillary flow and stalls to broader network context. Applied to over 40,000 capillaries in the mouse cortex before and after ischemic stroke, we observe heterogeneous vulnerability patterns: while most capillaries stall or reduce flow after arterial occlusion, some experience accelerated flow. Further analysis revealed that stall-prone flow topology subtypes were less prevalent than their robust counterparts. Notably, the overall distribution of these subtypes remains largely preserved after stroke, revealing a previously unrecognized, system-level organizing principle that alleviates the impact of individual capillary stalls to maintain network-level perfusion.

">Resolving the Brain Energy Paradox: The Neuron as a Coupled Thermodynamic System</a></h4>

              
                Traditional models of neural excitability, such as the Hodgkin-Huxley framework, treat the action potential as a purely electrical phenomenon. While its thermodynamic footprint -including heat and entropy generation- is experimentally known, it is typically regarded as a passive consequence of signal propagation. This work explores the hypothesis that this thermodynamic output is not passive, but instead plays an active role in modulating neural function. To investigate this, we developed a novel, fully coupled electro-thermo-entropic model where the entropy generated by an action potential directly feeds back to influence the kinetics of ion channels. Our simulations demonstrate a profound consequence of this coupling: the action potential undergoes progressive self-amplification, driven by a massive acceleration of its underlying kinetics. As the signal propagates, its peak amplitude grows significantly while its temporal duration remains remarkably stable. Furthermore, a statistical analysis reveals that this mechanism relies on the system operating as a robust thermodynamic switch, transitioning between a low-entropy quiescent state and a high-dissipation active state. Finally, we show that achieving this high-performance, amplifying state requires a disproportionately high energetic cost, a finding we term the Intelligence Premium. These results suggest that the action potential is a coupled electro-thermodynamic process that actively enhances its own strength and reliability. Our model offers a candidate mechanism for how waste energy is repurposed into a functional signal, providing a physical explanation for the brain's high energy consumption and opening new perspectives on the link between thermodynamics and computation.

">Integration of sensory and cortical information in the brainstem during mastication in mice</a></h4>

              
                Mastication is a vital function that relies on precise synchronization among multiple brainstem regions, known as being part of a central pattern generator (CPG). Movements can be triggered either by stimulating a sensory-motor region called the cortical masticatory area (CMA), well-documented in various species but not yet formally identified in mice, or by stimulating the oro-facial sensory primary afferents which fibers form the trigeminal tract (Vtr). However, it's unclear whether these different inputs activate distinct components of the CPG or converge on the same. This study aims at mapping brainstem areas activated by cortical and sensory inputs using immunohistochemistry against the cellular activity marker, c-Fos and Ca2+-imaging, respectively. Optogenetic stimulation of the cortical masticatory area (CMA) in awake, head-fixed mice reliably induced rhythmic jaw movements (RJMs) and increased c-Fos expression in multiple brainstem regions, with strongest activation in the peritrigeminal area (PeriV) and parvocellular reticular formation (PCRt) ventral to the trigeminal motor nucleus (NVmt). In contrast, in vitro electrical stimulation of trigeminal sensory afferents (Vtr) predominantly activated neurons and astrocytes in the main sensory nucleus (NVsnpr), the dorsal area of PeriV, adjacent to it, and PCRt. The areas containing the highest numbers of activated cells differed clearly according to the type of inputs and overlapped only in the PCRt, ventral and slightly medial to the trigeminal motor nucleus and the most dorso-medial part of PeriV. These findings demonstrate that cortical and sensory inputs take part in distinct components of the brainstem masticatory circuitry, with PCRt emerging as a point of convergence and provide new insights into the components of the CPG of mastication.

">Maternal Thyroid Supplementation Prevents Autistic-relevant Social Behavior and Hypothalamic Oxytocin Depletion Produced by Developmental Exposure to Environmental Toxicants</a></h4>

              
                Environmental toxicants that target the developing brain are suspected of contributing to autism spectrum disorder risk but causative evidence is lacking. We and others have shown that the indoor flame retardants, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), reduce prosocial behavior, however, few studies have assessed the central targets and underlying mechanisms. PBDEs are well established endocrine disruptors of the expanded thyroid system, which also regulates the prosocial neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin (AVP) and their hypothalamic signaling. The potential role of PBDE-induced thyroid hormone (TH) deregulation in mediating disruption of central OXT and ASD-like social behavior deficits remains unmapped. To address this gap, we conducted a study in C57BL6/N mice that examined behavioral and neuromolecular reprogramming after developmental exposure to the commercial PBDE mixture, DE-71, and evaluated the therapeutic potential of TH supplementation. Dams were exposed daily during gestation and lactation to corn oil vehicle, low dose (0.1 mg/kg) and high dose (0.4 mg/kg) of DE-71 with or without concurrent L-thyroxine (+mT4). In offspring, dose-dependent ASD-relevant behavioral responses and central neuroendocrine OXT neuron depletion after developmental PBDE exposure was prevented with mT4. mRNA transcripts for the TH transporter Mct8, deiodinase (Dio3) and estrogen receptor beta (Esr2) expressed on OXT neurons in PVH were upregulated in low dose females. In contrast, Mct8 and Dio3 were downregulated in low dose males. These findings uncover sex-specific mechanisms of PBDE-induced reprogramming of TH-regulated pathways in hypothalamic neuroendocrine cells leading to depleted central OXT signaling and ultimately ASD-relevant phenotypes. Importantly, we provide novel evidence of the therapeutic potential of maternal thyroid supplementation against toxicant-induced neurodevelopmental disorders.

                We examined whether preparatory cortical activity indexed by the contingent negative variation (CNV) scales with postural complexity during step initiation. Participants performed straight and diagonal stepping in a Warning-Go paradigm while EEG was recorded; CNV epochs spanned the 2s fore period and were summarized into eight 0.25 s bins for electrode and eLORETA source level analyses using linear mixed effects models (n=31). Diagonal stepping produced greater early CNV negativity at the scalp (bin 1: C1, CP3, CP1, P1, FC4; bin 2: F1, F3, FC1, Fz, F2, F4, FC2, FCz), with no electrodes favouring straight stepping. Source analysis showed stronger engagement for diagonal stepping in bins 1-3 (0-0.75 s) across fronto parietal sensorimotor regions, including paracentral, transverse frontopolar, superior frontal (gyrus/sulcus), supramarginal, superior parietal, intraparietal, and precentral sulcus; no regions were greater for straight stepping. These effects concentrated in the early CNV suggest enhanced anticipatory selective attention and sensory up weighting under higher postural demands, providing a richer state estimate for scaling anticipatory postural adjustments.

">A multimodal approach for visualization and identification of electrophysiological cell types in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Neurons of different types perform diverse computations and coordinate their activity during sensation, perception, and action. While electrophysiological recordings can measure the activity of many neurons simultaneously, identifying cell types during these experiments remains difficult. To identify cell types, we developed PhysMAP, a framework that weighs multiple electrophysiological modalities simultaneously to obtain interpretable multimodal representations. We apply PhysMAP to seven datasets and demonstrate that these multimodal representations are better aligned with known transcriptomically-defined cell types than any single modality alone. We then show that such alignment allows PhysMAP to better identify putative cell types in the absence of ground truth. We also demonstrate how annotated datasets can be used to infer multiple cell types simultaneously in unannotated datasets and show that the properties of inferred types are consistent with the known properties of these cell types. Finally, we provide a first-of-its-kind demonstration of how PhysMAP can help understand how multiple cell types interact to drive circuit dynamics. Collectively, these results demonstrate that multimodal representations from PhysMAP enable the study of multiple cell types simultaneously, thus providing insight into neural circuit dynamics.

">Structural Effects of Low Social Status and Obesogenic Diet on Social and Emotional Neurocircuits in Female Macaques: A Longitudinal Study from Infancy to Adulthood</a></h4>

              
                A substantial body of literature has demonstrated a consistent link between psychosocial stress and obesity in children, particularly in those from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Despite evidence indicating a complex interplay between stress, diet and obesity, there is a limited understanding of the specific versus potentially synergistic effects of obesity and stress on brain structural and functional development. This study investigates the developmental and long-term brain structural alterations resulting from exposure to chronic social stress due to low (subordinate -SUB-) social status and postnatal obesogenic diets. Forty-one female rhesus macaques (Dominants -DOM-, n=21; Subordinates -SUB-, n=20) were assigned to either only low-calorie diet (LCD) or to both high-calorie diet (HCD) and LCD (Choice diet) from birth through the juvenile period. After menarche, all subjects were maintained on a LCD-only diet through adulthood. Twenty-seven animals (DOM: n=13, SUB: n=14) were studied again in adulthood to investigate the long-term effects of early diet and social rank on brain structure. Cumulative Kcal consumption was measured from birth through 16 months and body weights were measured at all time points. Overall, the findings show specific effects of obesogenic diet and psychosocial stress on cortical and corticolimbic brain regions. Animals with access to the obesogenic diet had larger overall brain size (measured as intracranial volume -ICV-) and larger overall volumes of prefrontal cortex, insula, superior temporal sulcus (defined as temporo-parieto-occipital area rostral and caudal regions (TPOr and TPOc)) than those in the low-calorie diet. Most of these regional diet effects, except for the insula, were driven by general effects of the diet on brain size. The diet effects were lost when adding the adult data to the longitudinal analysis, suggesting transient effects of obesogenic diets while the animals were consuming it, but not long-term, persistent effects. These findings highlight the potential of brain rescue mechanisms that could offset lasting developmental effects of early-life obesogenic diet consumption. With respect to social rank, SUB exhibited larger volumes in brain regions related to social cognition and emotional processing than DOM animals. When the adult data was added to the longitudinal analysis, the effects of social rank were prominent in the hippocampus, superior temporal sulcus, temporo-parieto-occipital rostral region, and the temporal auditory cortices after ICV data correction, suggesting long-term, persistent and cumulative effects of these social experiences, in contrast to the transient diet effects.

">Structural Eigenmodes of the Brain to Improve the Source Localisation of EEG: Application to Epileptiform Activity</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental view of neuroscience is that, in addition to neuronal activity, the structure of the brain constrains and explains brain function. An alluring formalism in computational neuroscience has been the generation of structural eigenmodes of neural activity from a matrix representing the anatomy of the brain. Traditionally, brain connectomics has been the gold standard for the coupling between structure and function. However, it has recently been suggested that simpler brain geometry can provide more explanatory power in fMRI. An adjacent modality is the source localisation problem of EEG, which aims to identify the underlying generators of EEG recordings. The underdetermined nature of the problem requires sufficient constraints to produce realistic and unique solutions of source activity. In this work, we presented a simple framework for incorporating different forms of structural brain eigenmodes to constrain the source localisation problem in epilepsy. We found that geometric eigenmodes were able to reconstruct the spread of a seizure through the brain slightly better than connectome eigenmodes, and both types of structural modes significantly outperformed commonly used approaches.

">Dynamic updating of spatial working memory across eye movements: a computational investigation of transsaccadic integration</a></h4>

              
                The brain continuously integrates rapidly changing visual input across eye movements to maintain stable perception, yet the precise mechanisms underpinning dynamic working memory and how these break down in brain diseases remain unclear. We developed a novel eye-tracking paradigm and computational models to investigate how spatial and colour information are updated across saccades. Our findings reveal that saccades selectively impair spatial but not colour memory. Computational modelling identified that spatial representations are maintained in a dual eye-centred frame of reference which is actively updated by a noisy memory of saccades but is vulnerable to interference. Using this model, we found that specific mechanistic failures in initial encoding and memory decay, rather than the saccadic updating process itself, account for spatial working memory deficits in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of how dynamic spatial memory operates in health and its disruption in neurodegenerative disorders.

">Tau conveys intrinsic hyperactivity of VTA dopamine neurons but an inability to sustain burst firing</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine has been implicated in neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Dopaminergic dysfunction and aberrant firing are observed in mouse AD models, but the specific roles of A{beta}; and tau have not been determined. METHODS: We performed electrophysiological recordings of single VTA dopamine neuron firing in the 3xTg-AD model, followed by recordings in amyloid (APPNL-G-F)- and human tau (hTau)-based models to determine the pathological triggers of impaired firing. RESULTS: In vivo dopamine neuron recordings showed fewer spikes in defined bursts in 3xTg-AD mice versus controls. Ex vivo studies showed an impaired ability to sustain firing during depolarization, which was mimicked with depolarized current in wild type neurons. Dopamine neurons transduced with hTau reflected firing aberrations and impaired bursting, but the effects were not recapitulated in the APPNL-G-F model, DISCUSSION: These results suggest that hTau specifically induces hyperexcitable states within individual dopamine neurons, disrupting burst firing. This dopaminergic dysfunction could compromise reward learning and contribute to the psychiatric symptoms observed in AD.

">Spatial specificity of the functional gradient echo and spin echo BOLD signal across cortical depth at 7 T</a></h4>

              
                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at high magnetic field strengths ([&ge;] 7 T) is a promising technique to study the functioning of the human brain at the spatial scale of cortical columns and layers. However, measurements most often rely on the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response sampled with a gradient echo (GE) sequence, which is known to be most sensitive to macrovascular contributions that limit their effective spatial resolution. Alternatively, a spin echo (SE) sequence can be used to increase the weighting toward the microvasculature and, therefore, the location of neural activation. In addition, due to the heterogeneous structure of the cortical cerebrovascular system, the effective spatial resolution can change across cortical depth. For high-resolution fMRI applications, it is hence important to know how much the effective spatial resolution varies across cortical depth. In this study, we used flickering rotating wedge stimuli to induce traveling waves with varying spatial frequencies in the retinotopically organized primary visual cortex (V1), which allowed us to infer the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the BOLD response that characterizes the spatial specificity of the measured signal. We acquired GE- and SE-BOLD data at 7 T and compared the MTF between acquisition techniques at different cortical depths. Our results show a small but consistent increase in spatial specificity when using SE-BOLD. But across cortical depth, both acquisition techniques generally show a similar decrease of specificity toward the pial surface demonstrating the dependence on macrovascular contributions, which needs to be carefully considered when interpreting the results of high-resolution fMRI studies.

">The respiratory phase causally modulates the readiness potential amplitude</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has shown that the respiratory phase correlates with both voluntary action timing and readiness potential (RP) amplitude, but whether this relationship is causal or merely correlational remains unclear. Here, we experimentally manipulated breathing patterns to test if the respiratory phase causally influences the neural preparation for voluntary movement. Participants performed self-initiated button presses under four conditions: breathing in (BI), breathing out (BO), normal breathing (NB), and breath-holding (BH). Electroencephalographic recordings revealed that RP amplitude was significantly more negative during exhalation compared to inhalation and during breath-holding compared to normal breathing. These neural differences occurred without corresponding changes in behavioral measures (e.g., waiting times or retrospective timing judgments), indicating that respiratory effects on RP were not associated with altered action timing. These findings demonstrate that the respiratory phase causally modulates cortical motor preparation. We further propose that the brain optimizes voluntary action execution during respiratory phases when breathing-related motor activity is minimal, thereby revealing respiration as a fundamental organizing rhythm for voluntary behavior.

">Neural correlates of emotional responses to self-selected music: evidence from multivariate pattern analysis</a></h4>

              
                Music is a uniquely powerful stimulus for evoking complex and deeply felt emotions. While previous research has identified neural correlates of music-evoked emotional responses, less is known about how these felt emotions are represented in the brain, particularly when elicited by familiar, personally meaningful music. Here, we used a personalized fMRI paradigm in which participants (N = 20) each selected musical excerpts corresponding to the nine emotion categories defined by the Geneva Emotional Music Scale. These self-selected excerpts were presented during functional MRI scanning. We first examined the neural correlates of music-evoked emotion by comparing brain activity during music listening to that during exposure to white noise. The maps were consistent with previous research, highlighting clusters in sensory and limbic regions. We then used multivoxel pattern analysis to decode emotion categories from whole-brain activation patterns. The results revealed that music-evoked emotions could be reliably discriminated based on distributed neural activity, with consistent involvement of the superior temporal gyrus, supplementary motor area, amygdala, and cerebellum, among other auditory, motor, and interoceptive regions. These findings provide new insight into the neural encoding of musical emotions and highlight the value of personalized, music-based paradigms for research in auditory and affective neuroscience.

">Intracranial Insights into the Developing Neural Basis of Moral Punishment</a></h4>

              
                Third-party punishment (TPP) is a critical component of social regulation and justice, integrating moral reasoning and emotional salience. However, the neural developmental basis underpinning this complex process remains largely unknown. Using rare intracranial stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) in 14 children and 17 adults, we investigated the developing neural circuits of TPP. We found that broadband gamma activity in the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) encodes inferred intentions, with different patterns across age groups. Furthermore, the vmPFC, insula, and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) integrate punishment efficacy, also showing significant developmental differences. Combining task and resting state functional connectivity analyses, we further found age-dependent interactions among the amygdala-insula and IPL-vmPFC neural couplings during decision-making. These findings provide valuable intracranial evidence that the maturation of moral decisionmaking stems from the developmental refinement of subcortical-cortical circuits that integrate emotional and cognitive evaluations, explaining the shift from intuitive decisions in children to context-sensitive judgments in adults.

">CD33-CD45 Interaction Reveals a Mechanistic Link to Alzheimer's Disease Susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                The innate immune gene CD33, encoding a myeloid inhibitory sialic acid-binding receptor, is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility. The AD-associated rs3865444CC risk variant reduces splicing of the sialic acid-binding domain and increases expression of the full-length (sialic acid-binding) CD33 isoform seven-fold compared to the rs3865444AA protective genotype. Here, we identify CD45 as an immune cell-specific sialic acid-dependent cis CD33 binding partner, whose phosphatase activity is inhibited by CD33. Overexpression of CD33 or loss of CD45 contributes to impaired microglial clearance of amyloid beta and amyloid beta-induced loss of dendritic spines in microglial-neuronal co-cultures, aligning with a detrimental effect of CD33-mediated inhibition of CD45. CD33-CD45 interaction frequency was increased in monocytes from individuals with the rs3865444CC risk variant compared to rs3865444AA, as well as in AD compared to controls, independent of genotype. Furthermore, an interaction between CD33 and PTPRC (encoding CD45) gene expression in human brain tissue was associated with a pathological diagnosis of AD and global burden of AD pathology. Our findings thus establish a functional interaction between CD33 and CD45 relevant to AD susceptibility and systemic myeloid dysfunction in disease.

">CD33 and Clusterin Interact Biophysically and Genetically to Modulate Alzheimer Risk</a></h4>

              
                We report the results of structural, functional and genetic studies on the CD33 sialic acid-binding receptor that reveal how non-coding variants in CD33 alter risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The full-length CD33M isoform, whose expression is upregulated by non-coding AD-risk alleles, preferentially forms dimers at the cell surface, where they interact with AD-related proteins (clusterin and amyloid beta). This interaction induces CD33M inhibitory signalling and downregulates protective microglial functions including phagocytic removal of amyloid plaques. Human brain expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and causal mediation analyses confirm that quantitative interactions between CLU and CD33 genotypes modulate AD phenotypes and suggest that genotypes at these loci might be used to personalise future therapeutic approaches. Our work also highlights several other unexpected aspects of CD33 biology, including a soluble shed extracellular fragment of CD33M and a similar soluble secreted product arising from a truncating mutation in the CD33 extracellular domain.

">Is the cortical dynamics ergodic? A numerical study in partially symmetric networks of spiking neurons</a></h4>

              
                Cortical activity in-vivo displays relaxational time scales much longer than the membrane time constant of the neurons or the deactivation time of ionotropic synaptic conductances. The mechanisms responsible for such slow dynamics are not understood. Here, we show that slow dynamics naturally and robustly emerges in dynamically-balanced networks of spiking neurons. This requires only partial symmetry in the synaptic connectivity, a feature of local cortical networks observed in experiments. The symmetry generates an effective, excitatory self-coupling of the neurons that leads to long-lived fluctuations in the network activity, without destroying the dynamical balance. When the excitatory self-coupling is suitably strong, the same mechanism leads to multiple equilibrium states of the network dynamics. Our results reveal a novel dynamical regime of the collective activity in spiking networks, where the memory of the initial state persists for very long times and ergodicity is broken.

">Arm position estimates derived from motor biases</a></h4>

              
                Proprioception, including position sense, is critically important for normal sensorimotor and perceptual functioning but remains poorly understood. In the laboratory and clinic, arm position sense is typically assessed using perceptual tasks, e.g., via arm position matching or reporting the arm's current position against a previously sensed one. Although such assessments provide important information about position sensing, they are incomplete in that they do not directly address the role of position sense in motor planning and control. Here, we used a combination of human psychophysical experiments, forward dynamic simulations, and mathematical optimization to reverse engineer arm positions ('REAP') used during motor planning. Subjects performed arm movements in a virtual environment under conditions where visual arm position cues were either aligned with corresponding somatosensory cues or were shifted prior to reach onset in one of four directions. Under shifted conditions, subjects exhibited characteristic 'motor biases', i.e., systematic deviations from ideal trajectories to the visually-cued targets. The arm positions used to plan movements under shifted conditions were obtained by minimizing differences between the experimentally induced motor biases and simulated motor biases. These REAP estimates largely conformed to predictions derived from previous perceptual experiments in that they were strongly influenced by the visual cues, and in a manner that was axially dependent. The results suggest that assessments of position sense derived from motor biases can be used to augment perceptual assessments or be used in lieu of them when perceptual reporting isn't possible. In addition, the observed similarities between position estimates and weights derived from motor and perceptual tasks suggest that the brain's perceptual and action systems use similar mechanisms to deduce arm position from somatosensory and visual cues.

">Extracellular spike waveform analysis reveals cell type-specific changes in the superior colliculus of fragile X mice</a></h4>

              
                A long-standing goal of neuroscience has been to elucidate the diverse complement of neurons in the brain, which can be defined by several criteria. Analysis of action potential shape in extracellular recordings has revealed subpopulations in several regions of the brain, allowing for insights into neuronal subtype-specific function in the intact brain. The superior colliculus (SC) is a critical sensorimotor region, integrating visual, somatosensory, auditory, and nociceptive inputs to direct complex behaviors. Recent work suggests that the SC may be adversely impacted in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), underscoring its importance. However, our understanding of cellular diversity in the SC lags in comparison to other regions, limiting our ability to parse circuit changes in NDDs. Here, we utilized semi-automated clustering methods to classify neurons in the mouse SC based on multiple features of extracellularly recorded waveforms to identify five putative cell types. Secondary analysis of firing statistics and visual tuning properties supported the cluster segregation. Interestingly, the proportions of units assigned to each cluster differed in the SC of a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS, Fmr1-/y), with only four of five types identified. Furthermore, we observed changes in waveform properties and firing statistics, but not visual tuning properties, between genotypes in a subtype-specific manner. Taken together, these data add to our understanding of neuronal diversity in the SC and alterations of visual circuit organization and function in NDDs.

">Foot Sole Cutaneous Somatosensory Modulation Based on Balance Demands</a></h4>

              
                Postural complexity may shape how the nervous system processes plantar cutaneous input. We tested whether somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) elicited by foot sole stimulation scale with balance demands, hypothesizing larger responses for more complex tasks. Thirty one healthy adults performed standing, straight step, and diagonal step conditions while receiving brief electrical stimulation to the stance foot sole; SEPs (P50, N90, peak to peak) were analyzed at Cz using pooled and order specific approaches. In the pooled analysis, peak to peak SEP amplitude was greater for both stepping conditions than standing (Standing vs. Straight, P=0.041; Standing vs. Diagonal, P=0.026). Order specific analysis showed an early amplification: the first SEP (0.5s after the warning cue) was larger for diagonal than straight stepping (peak to peak, P=0.009; N90, P=0.027). Source localization at N90 revealed greater activation during stepping than standing in paracentral gyrus & sulcus, inferior parietal angular gyrus, and superior parietal gyrus, consistent with enhanced sensorimotor processing under higher postural demands. Moreover, right paracentral gyrus & sulcus activity was higher for diagonal vs. straight stepping for the first and fourth SEPs. Together, these findings indicate that increasing balance demands up weight plantar afferent processing and recruit contralateral sensorimotor/parietal regions, particularly early in preparation, supporting the view that cortical sensory gain is tuned to postural complexity.

">A Drosophila Tonic Motor Neuron Reinnervates Ectopic Muscles Fully Deprived of Native Tonic and Phasic Inputs</a></h4>

              
                Motor neurons (MNs) form precise neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) during development, but the extent to which individual MNs can reinnervate fully denervated muscles in vivo remains poorly understood. In the Drosophila larva, each muscle is co-innervated by a tonic and a phasic glutamatergic MN. Here, we show that the tonic MN1 undergoes robust heterosynaptic sprouting and forms ectopic NMJs when neighboring muscles are deprived of both their native tonic and phasic inputs. This structural plasticity is not induced by silencing, but instead requires the physical ablation of adjacent MNs. Live imaging of the same MN1 axons in individual animals reveals that sprouting initiates early and expands progressively across larval stages. In contrast, phasic MNs show minimal remodeling, indicating that tonic MNs possess a greater intrinsic capacity for neuroplasticity. Notably, as MN1 establishes new synapses on targets it does not normally innervate, it redistributes pre-synaptic territory across both native and ectopic muscles. These findings identify a subtype-specific, injury-induced rewiring program in an intact motor circuit.

Neuroimaging studies suggest that this process engages dynamic interactions across canonical brain networks. However, the precise dynamic brain mechanisms underlying inhibitory control and their relationship to individual differences remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we applied a novel state-space model to a large-scale fMRI dataset to investigate latent brain states and their dynamics during a gender-Stroop task. Our study revealed four distinct latent brain states, each characterized by unique functional connectivity patterns. Temporal properties of latent brain states, such as occupancy rates (OR) and mean lifetimes (ML), were significant predictors of the Stroop effect. Specifically, the ML of state S1 showed negative association with the Stroop effect, suggesting that prolonged engagement in this state facilitated inhibitory control. State-specific connectivity patterns also predicted Stroop effects. Compared to S2, S1 showed stronger within- and between-network connectivity. These findings suggest that S1 represents an optimal brain state for resolving conflicts and promoting inhibitory control. Together, our findings shed light on the neural dynamics involved in overcoming sensory-motor conflicts triggered by automatic responses and highlight their potential implications for cognitive interventions.</span>

                <p>Accurate perception of the direction of gravity relies on the integration of multisensory information, particularly from the visual and vestibular systems, within the brain. Although a recent study of patients with cerebellar degeneration suggested a cerebellar role in visuo-vestibular interaction in the perception of gravitational direction, direct evidence remains limited. To address this gap, we conducted two experiments with 42 healthy participants to evaluate the impact of repetitive 1&nbsp;Hz transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the posterior cerebellar vermis on visual dependency, quantified by the subjective visual vertical bias induced by rotating optokinetic stimulation (OKS). Electric field simulations in high-resolution generic head models were used to ensure focal stimulation of the cerebellum at the group level. The results demonstrated that the rTMS applied to the vermis significantly attenuated the OKS-induced shift in visual vertical (SVV) bias. This effect was not observed when stimulation was applied to the early visual cortex (V1&ndash;2) or the cerebellar hemisphere. Also, the vermis rTMS had no effect on the judgment precision in the absence of visual motion cues, suggesting that the rTMS may reduce visual weight in visuo-vestibular processing by increasing visual motion noise rather than affecting vestibular function. These findings suggest a direct involvement of the cerebellar vermis in the visuo-vestibular interaction underlying the perception of gravitational direction, providing new insights into cerebellar contributions in human spatial orientation.</p>

                <p>Early childhood is a critical period showing experience-dependent changes in brain structure and function. The complex link between the structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) of the brain is of particular interest. However, its relationship with both age and attention in early childhood is not well understood. In this study, children between the ages of 4 and 7, and at a 1&nbsp;year follow-up visit, underwent neuroimaging (diffusion-weighted and passive-viewing functional magnetic resonance imaging) and assessments for selective, sustained, and executive attention. We examined regional graph metrics and SC&ndash;FC coupling of the structural and functional networks. Partial least squares was used to investigate longitudinal brain measure changes and cross-sectional associations with age and attention. We observed longitudinal changes in functional graph metrics and age-related decreases in SC modularity. Region-wise graph analyses revealed variable brain&ndash;behavior relationships across the brain, highlighting regions where structural topology is linked to age and attentional performance. Furthermore, we identified SC as a dominant predictor of age when compared with FC and SC&ndash;FC coupling. The findings emphasize how early childhood is a dynamic period where cognitive functioning is intricately and predominantly linked to structural network features.</p>

                <p>Recent evidence highlights the importance of glutamatergic neurons in the basal forebrain (BF) in promoting cortical activity; however, whether BF glutamatergic neurons are involved in regulating general anesthesia and the underlying neural circuits remains unclear. Here, we showed that the activity of BF glutamatergic neurons decreased during the induction of isoflurane anesthesia and restored during the emergence in mice. Optogenetic activation of these neurons significantly enhanced cortical activation, accelerated behavioral emergence, and improved physiological indicators in both male and female mice under isoflurane anesthesia. Specifically, activation of BF glutamatergic neurons shortened emergence time from isoflurane anesthesia, decreased isoflurane sensitivity, and increased arousal scores of mice. Moreover, optogenetic activation of BF glutamatergic neurons decreased EEG delta power and burst suppression ratio, while increasing pupil size and respiration rate in mice during isoflurane anesthesia. Similar results were observed during the optogenetic activation of BF glutamatergic terminals in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Additionally, we found that the activity of BF glutamatergic neurons and VTA glutamatergic neurons synchronously fluctuated during isoflurane anesthesia, and optogenetic activation of BF glutamatergic terminals in the VTA potently increased the calcium signals in VTA glutamatergic neurons during isoflurane anesthesia. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that BF glutamatergic neurons promote emergence from isoflurane anesthesia by activating VTA glutamatergic neurons.</p>

                <p>In daily life, we frequently encounter items within emotional contexts through repeated exposure. However, it remains unclear how emotion influences the memory of items learned across multiple repetitions and how neural representations during repeated learning are associated with subsequent memory performance.

After a 24&nbsp;h delay, a recognition memory test for the squiggles was performed. The results indicated that behaviorally squiggles were more accurately retrieved in the positive condition compared with the negative condition. An old/new ERP effect was observed between 400 and 1,200&nbsp;ms at the midparietal cluster, specific to the positive condition, and correlated with memory performance. Notably, greater EEG representational similarity of neural patterns across repeated learning was observed for subsequently remembered items compared with forgotten items in the positive condition, specifically at the right frontal region between 380 and 600&nbsp;ms. These findings suggest that positive emotion enhances memory of neutral items across repeated learning through neural representational reinstatement, offering insights into how emotional differences in episodic memory retrieval are linked to neural patterns established during repeated learning.</p>

                <p>When we encounter people in real life, increased visual experience with their face is accompanied by an accumulation of conceptual knowledge about them. This conceptual knowledge has been shown to play an important role in face recognition. However, the extent to which conceptual knowledge influences neural responses to faces in visual or non-visual regions of the brain is not clear. To address this question, participants (male and female) learned faces in a naturalistic viewing paradigm in which conceptual information was modulated by presenting a movie to participants in either its original sequence or a scrambled sequence. Although participants in both groups had the same overall perceptual experience, this manipulation had a significant effect on the conceptual understanding of events. After a delay, participants viewed a new movie featuring the previously learned faces while neural activity was measured using fMRI. No significant differences were observed between the Original and Scrambled groups in core face-selective regions of the visual brain. This aligns with the fact that overall exposure to faces was consistent across groups, ensuring that our manipulation did not impact visual processing of faces. In contrast, differences between the groups were evident within a network of regions that are typically associated with processing person knowledge. This network of regions was also able to discriminate the identity of the key characters based on the response to the faces. These findings provide important insights into the level of neural processing at which conceptual knowledge influences familiar face recognition during natural viewing.</p>

                <p>Music can effectively induce emotional arousal, which is associated with the release of stress hormones that are important for the emotional modulation of memory. Thus, music may serve as a powerful modulator of memory and mood, making it a promising therapeutic tool for memory and mood disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or depression. However, music's impact on memory depends on its features, timing, and ability to elicit emotional arousal. In the current study, we manipulated various features of music played during post-encoding memory consolidation to elicit emotional arousal and impact subsequent memory in men and women. We found that larger increases and moderate decreases in post-encoding music-induced emotional arousal from baseline resulted in gist versus detail trade-offs in memory, with improved general memory but impaired detailed memory, while moderate increases in arousal from baseline corresponded to improved detailed memory, but impaired general memory. Importantly, relative to controls, music-induced emotional arousal demonstrated unique impacts on detailed memory that are crucial in supporting episodic memory. These findings suggest that music intervention does not uniformly impact memory and has important implications in developing personalized music-related interventions for those with memory and mood impairments.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/31/e0453252025?rss=1">Projection of Cortical Beta Band Oscillations to a Motor Neuron Pool across the Full Range of Recruitment</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical beta band oscillations (13&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) are associated with sensorimotor control, but their precise role remains unclear. Evidence suggests that for low-threshold motor neurons (MNs), these oscillations are conveyed to muscles via the fastest corticospinal fibers. However, their transmission to MNs of different sizes may vary due to differences in the relative strength of corticospinal and reticulospinal projections across the MN pool. Consequently, it remains uncertain whether corticospinal beta transmission follows similar pathways and maintains consistent strength across the entire MN pool. To investigate this, we examined beta activity in MNs innervating the tibialis anterior muscle across the full range of recruitment thresholds in a study involving 12 participants of both sexes. We characterized beta activity at both the cortical and motor unit (MU) levels, while participants performed contractions from mild to submaximal levels. Corticomuscular coherence remained unchanged across contraction forces after normalizing for the net MU spike rate, suggesting that beta oscillations are transmitted with similar strength to MNs, regardless of size. To further explore beta transmission, we estimated corticospinal delays using the cumulant density function, identifying peak correlations between cortical and muscular activity. Once compensated for variable peripheral axonal propagation delay across MNs, the corticospinal delay remained stable, and its value (~14&nbsp;ms) indicated projections through the fastest corticospinal fibers for all MNs. These findings demonstrate that corticospinal beta band transmission is determined by the fastest pathway connecting in the corticospinal tract, projecting similarly across the entire MN pool.</p>

                <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by death of lower and upper motor neurons. Although the mechanism behind the selective neuron loss is still unclear, several heterogeneous genes have been causally linked to ALS. <I>KIF5A</I> encodes for a neuronally enriched kinesin involved in protein transport, and mutations within this gene have been causally linked to different motor neuron diseases. The mutations identified in ALS patients are mostly predicted to alter its mRNA splicing, leading to a frameshift mutation and an aberrant 39-aa-long sequence in the C-terminal domain of KIF5A. Here we found that ALS-related KIF5A mutations induce the accumulation of the mutant form of the protein in human motoneurons, which are also characterized by the cytosolic mislocalization of TDP-43. This ALS hallmark was even exacerbated upon overexpression of the ALS-KIF5A protein in cells differentiated from healthy controls and primary neurons, suggesting a pathological connection between the cellular load of the mutant protein and TDP-43 pathology. While the terminal domain of the WT isoform is characterized by an acid isoelectric point (pI), the ALS variant presents a basic pI due to the altered aminoacidic composition of this sequence. We thus generated a KIF5A-ALS isoform that retained part of the aberrant sequence but with lower pI. The overexpression of this mutated variant led to significantly lower protein aggregation and TDP-43 mislocalization than the ALS mutant. Our data show that re-establishing the correct pI rescues KIFA aggregation and significantly reduces the cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP-43.</p>

                <p>Patients with idiopathic/isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) are in the prodromal stage of alpha-synucleinopathies. Neurodegeneration early affects subcortical structures, including the substantia nigra, in iRBD patients. However, it remains unclear whether there is also an early neurodegeneration process affecting the cerebral cortex. We investigated whether EEG-derived metrics for aberrant cortical dynamics and imbalanced excitation&ndash;inhibition (E/I) correlate with disease severity in iRBD patients, aiming to better understand the pathophysiology progression from the prodromal to the overt stage of alpha-synucleinopathies. We retrospectively analyzed resting-state EEG recordings, as a marker of cortical function, and presynaptic dopaminergic imaging, a marker of subcortical function from 59 iRBD patients (9 female) who underwent longitudinal clinical evaluation alongside 46 age-matched healthy controls (22 female). We assessed power-law scaling in long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs), neuronal bistability, and functional E/I balance from the resting-state sensor EEG data and then correlated these to large-scale synchrony, nigrostriatal dopaminergic function, and clinical data. Compared with the control group, patients showed higher LRTCs and bistability in 2&ndash;7&nbsp;Hz oscillations. Patients who developed parkinsonism/dementia exhibited hyperexcitability in 5&ndash;7&nbsp;Hz compared with those who did not. This was also correlated with stronger phase synchrony. Both hyperexcitability in 5&ndash;7&nbsp;Hz and bistability in 2&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz negatively associated with nigrostriatal dopaminergic impairment. The iRBD patients, especially those closer to phenoconversion to parkinsonism or dementia, show clear aberrant cortical dynamics and hyperexcitability alongside substantia nigra impairment, suggesting that neurodegeneration in the prodromal stages affects both subcortical structures and cortical dynamics.</p>

                <p>From navigating a crowded hallway to skiing down a treacherous hill, humans are constantly making decisions while moving. Insightful past work has provided a glimpse of decision deliberation at the moment of movement onset. Yet it is unknown whether ongoing deliberation can be expressed during movement, following movement onset and prior to any decision. Here we tested the idea that an ongoing deliberation continually influences motor processes&mdash;prior to a decision&mdash;directing online movements. The deliberation process was manipulated by having humans of either sex observe tokens that moved into a left or right target. Supporting our hypothesis, we found that lateral hand movements reflected deliberation, prior to a decision. We also found that a deliberation urgency signal, which more heavily weighs later evidence, was fundamental to predicting decisions and explains past movement behavior in a new light. Our paradigm promotes the expression of ongoing deliberation through movement, providing a powerful new window to understand the interplay between decision and action.</p>

                <p>Repeated social defeat (RSD) in mice causes sensitization of hippocampal neurons associated with enhanced contextual fear memory. Because enhanced fear memory is an integral component of posttraumatic stress disorder, the physiological basis of neuronal sensitization in the hippocampus after social defeat was investigated in male mice using two interventions: microglia depletion (CSF1R antagonist, PLX5622) and neuronal (Vglut2<sup>+</sup>) IL-1R1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Here, two single-nuclei (sn) RNAseq data sets using these interventions were integrated and compared. Social defeat altered the transcriptional profiles of CA1 (Satb2<sup>+</sup>), dentate gyrus (DG, Prox1<sup>+</sup>), and inhibitory (Pval<sup>+</sup>) neurons, and these stress profiles were influenced by nIL-1R1, microglia, or both. In DG neurons, differentially expressed genes and canonical pathways related to cAMP response element (CREB), calcium/calmodulin kinases, bassoon, and glutamatergic signaling were robustly increased by RSD, and these were selectively dependent on nIL-1R1. Based on the snRNAseq data, neuronal stability and plasticity within the hippocampus were assessed. For instance, social defeat increased perineuronal nets around inhibitory (Pval<sup>+</sup>) neurons in the DG, and these were influenced by both nIL-1R1 and microglia. In addition, RNAscope confirmed that bassoon RNA was amplified after social defeat in the CA1 and DG, and these increases were selectively dependent on nIL-1R1. Last, electrophysiological analyses showed that both spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitudes in the DG were influenced by social defeat in a nIL-1R1-dependent manner. Collectively, sensitization of dentate gyrus neurons after social defeat requires neuronal IL-1R1 and is associated with enhanced CREB-bassoon signaling and disruption of the excitatory/inhibitory input balance.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/31/e2426242025?rss=1">Incorporation of a Cost of Deliberation Time in Perceptual Decision Making</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many decisions benefit from the accumulation of evidence obtained sequentially over time. In such circumstances, the decision-maker must balance speed against accuracy, while considering the cost associated with the passage of time. A neural mechanism to achieve this balance is to accumulate evidence and to terminate the deliberation when enough evidence has accrued. To accommodate time costs, it has been hypothesized that the criterion to terminate a decision may become lax as a function of time. Here we tested this hypothesis by manipulating the cost of time in a perceptual choice&ndash;reaction time (RT) task. Human participants (both sexes) discriminated the direction of motion in a dynamic random-dot display, which varied in difficulty across trials. Unbeknownst to the participants, halfway through the experiment, we increased the time pressure by canceling a small fraction of trials, mimicking a broken fixation, if they had not made a decision by a provisional deadline. This subtle manipulation led participants to make faster but less accurate decisions. Choice and RT were well explained by a bounded evidence-accumulation process. We developed a novel computational method to estimate the time-dependent changes in the stopping bounds directly from the participants&rsquo; RT and choice data. Our analysis revealed that the bounds decline as a function of time, and that this decline is steeper following the time&ndash;cost manipulation. The time-varying decision bounds approximate an optimal stopping policy, although the specific bound shape is idiosyncratic across individuals.</p>

                <p>by Sophie Theis, Mario A. Mendieta-Serrano, Bernardo Chapa-y-Lazo, Juliet Chen, Timothy E. Saunders</p>

During development and tissue repair, cells reshape and reconfigure to ensure organs take specific shapes. This process is inherently three-dimensional (3D). Yet, in part due to limitations in imaging and data analysis, cell shape analysis within tissues has largely been studied in two-dimensions (2D), e.g., the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc. With recent advances in imaging and machine learning, there has been significant progress in our understanding of 3D cell and tissue shape <i>in vivo</i>. However, even after gaining 3D segmentation of cells, it remains challenging to extract cell shape metrics beyond volume and surface area for cells within densely packed tissues. To address the challenge of extracting 3D cell shape metrics from dense tissues, we have developed the Python package CellMet. This user-friendly tool enables extraction of quantitative shape information from 3D cell and tissue segmentations, including cell face properties, cell twist, and cell rearrangements in 3D. Our method will improve the analysis of 3D cell shape and the understanding of cell organisation within tissues. Our tool is open source, available at https://github.com/TimSaundersLab/CellMet.

The ventricular zone (VZ) harbors the largest neurogenic niche in the adult mammalian brain and is consisted of neural stem cells (NSCs) and multiciliated ependymal cells (EPCs). Previous lineage tracing studies showed that both NSCs and EPCs were derived from radial glial cells (RGCs). However, the transcriptomic dynamics and the molecular mechanisms guiding the cell fate commitment during the differentiation remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the developing VZ of mice at single-cell resolution and identified three distinct cellular states of RGCs: bipotent glial progenitor cells (bGPCs), neonatal NSC-neuroblasts (nNSC-NBs) and neonatal EPCs (nEPCs). The differentiation from bGPCs to nNSC-NBs and nEPCs forms a continuous bifurcating trajectory. Analysis along the NSC branch unveiled a novel intermediate state of cells expressing oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) and neuroblast (NB) marker genes simultaneously. Several transcription factors (TFs) were found to be essential for the EPC-lineage differentiation. Notably, we uncovered that TFEB can tune NSC/EPC bifurcation, independent of its canonical function as a master regulator of the lysosome biogenesis. TFEB activation prevents the overproduction of EPCs by cooperating with LHX2 to balance the expressions of many multicilia-related genes while promotes the diﬀerentiation into NSC-NBs. Our results resolve the dynamic repertoire of divergent RGCs during VZ development and offer novel insights into the potential application of TFEB-targeted clinical drugs in VZ-related disorders, such as hydrocephalus and neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs).

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), representing antemortem indicators of AD pathophysiology, have greatly improved the accuracy of diagnosis. However, these biomarkers may not capture a frequent coincident pathology, such as cerebrovascular disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured plasma amyloid-<i>β</i>40, amyloid-<i>β</i>42, total tau, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, tau phosphorylated at threonine 217, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and neurofilament light chain in 685 multiancestral individuals who had clinical assessments and brain magnetic resonance imaging. The cohort was represented by individuals of European, African American, and Caribbean Hispanic ancestry. Participants were then classified as biomarker-positive or -negative for AD based on previously established cutoffs: 2.65 pg/mL for, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 and 0.39 pg/mL for tau phosphorylated at threonine 217. We used magnetic resonance images to compare white matter hyperintensity volume (WMH), silent brain infarcts, microhemorrhages, and hippocampus volume across groups by their clinical diagnosis and biomarker status.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the P-tau181 group (<i>n</i> = 685), 70 individuals (10.2%) had dementia or amnestic mild cognitive impairment. A total of 40 (57%) were biomarker-positive for AD, and 30 were classified as other dementia. Among 615 without dementia, 265 (40.3%) were preclinical AD, and 348 (50.8%) were biomarker-negative controls. In the tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 group (<i>n</i> = 535), 54 (10.1%) had dementia or amnestic mild cognitive impairment, including 33 biomarker-positive for AD and 21 with other dementia, whereas 183 (38.0%) were preclinical AD and 298 (61.9%) were biomarker-negative controls. Across both classifications, biomarker-positive for AD and other dementia individuals showed greater WMH volumes, more infarcts, and smaller hippocampus. However, P-tau217 positivity was more sensitive to WMH volume differences, whereas tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 better captured hippocampal atrophy and silent brain infarcts. Interestingly, ethnic differences may also influence detection of changes in WMH volumes, hippocampal volume, and infarcts in relation to specific biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results indicate that cerebrovascular disease is consistently involved in dementia either directly or as a coincident pathology in AD. These results underscore the need to incorporate both blood-based biomarkers and structural imaging in the evaluation of patients with dementia. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70027?af=R">Developing an Anatomically Valid Segmentation Protocol for Anterior Regions of the Medial Temporal Lobe for Neurodegenerative Diseases</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The anterior portion of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is one of the first regions targeted by pathology in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) indicating a potential for metrics from this region to serve as imaging biomarkers. Leveraging a unique post-mortem dataset of histology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, we aimed to (1) develop an anatomically valid segmentation protocol for anterior entorhinal cortex (ERC), Brodmann area (BA) 35, and BA36 for in vivo 3 T MRI and (2) incorporate this protocol in an automated approach. We included 20 cases (61–97 years old, 50% females) with and without neurodegenerative diseases (11 vs. 9 cases) to ensure generalizability of the developed protocol. Digitized MTL Nissl-stained coronal histology sections from these cases were annotated and registered to same-subject post-mortem MRI. The protocol was developed by determining the location of histological borders of the MTL cortices in relation to anatomical landmarks. Subsequently, the protocol was applied to 15 cases twice, with a 2-week interval, to assess intra-rater reliability with the Dice Similarity Index (DSI). Thereafter, it was implemented in our in-house Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS)-T1 approach and evaluated with DSIs. The anterior histological border distances of ERC, BA35 and BA36 were evaluated with respect to various anatomical landmarks, and the distance relative to the beginning of the hippocampus was chosen. To formulate segmentation rules, we examined the histological sections for the location of borders in relationship to anatomical landmarks in the coronal sections. The DSI for the anterior MTL cortices for the intra-rater reliability was 0.85–0.88, and for the ASHS-T1 against the manual segmentation, it was 0.62–0.65. We developed a reliable segmentation protocol and incorporated it in an automated approach. Given the vulnerability of the anterior MTL cortices to tau deposition in AD and LATE, the updated approach is expected to improve imaging biomarkers for these diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70029?af=R">Differential Astrocyte‐Supplied NMDAR Co‐Agonist for CA1 Versus Dentate Gyrus Long‐Term Potentiation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In the hippocampus, there is a region- and synapse-specific N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) co-agonist preference for induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA1 synapses, enriched in GluN2A-containing NMDARs, favor D-serine, while medial perforant path (MPP) to dentate gyrus (DG) synapses that are rich in GluN2B-containing NMDARs prefer glycine for LTP induction. This study investigated the role of astrocytes in providing these co-agonists. We confirmed in rat hippocampal slices that exogenous D-serine (10 μM) is sufficient to restore LTP at SC-CA1 synapses blocked under astrocyte calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) -clamp conditions, consistent with previous findings. However, exogenous glycine (10 μM) also rescued the LTP. In contrast, at MPP-DG synapses, 100 μM exogenous glycine, but not 10 μM nor 100 μM D-serine, restored the LTP blocked by astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup>-clamping. Our findings support the view that, as for serine in CA1, astrocytes are the cellular source of the glycine required for LTP induction at MPP-DG synapses.</p>

                In long-lived mammals, including humans, brain cell homeostasis is critical for maintaining brain function throughout life. Most neurons are generated during development and must maintain their cellular identity and plasticity to preserve brain function. Although extensive studies indicate the importance of recycling and regenerating cellular molecules to maintain cellular homeostasis, recent evidence has shown that some proteins and RNAs do not turn over for months and even years. We propose that these long-lived cellular molecules may be the basis for maintaining brain function in the long term, but also a potential convergent target of brain aging. We highlight key discoveries and challenges, and propose potential directions to unravel the mystery of brain cell longevity.

                Tangled molecular, cellular, and dynamic undercurrents shape brain organization. An emerging paradigm across neuroscience domains is to comprehensively measure the spatial patterning of multiple biological features, yielding precise brain maps. How can these features be conceptually integrated into a coherent understanding of brain structure and function? Here we review the methodology and practice of interpreting relationships between maps of biological features. We demonstrate how neuroscience can increasingly be approached as a data science, complete with detailed multiomic datasets, tools for representing diverse data types, and an extensive repertoire of analytics. We also outline methodological and conceptual challenges for disentangling relationships among brain maps. Ultimately, studying the brain from an integrative perspective changes the nature of scientific questions that can be asked, as well as the culture and conduct of scientific inquiry.

                The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) controls emotional response to environmental cues, yet the mechanisms are unclear. Biane et al. examine how positive and negative experiences are encoded by vHPC ensembles, showing that vCA1 does not contain generalized representations of valence but rather discriminates salient stimuli based on their identity and sensory features.

                Zheng et al. demonstrate that hematopoietic stem cells harboring the Ptpn11E76K mutation show de novo activation of the myeloid transcriptional program, resulting in high production of innate immunity-associated proteins, particularly S100a9 and S100a8. These pro-inflammatory proteins confer a selective advantage to the leukemia-initiating cells and contribute to immune evasion.

                Cellular plasticity, which involves massive changes to a cell’s architecture and organellar organization, can be harnessed following injury to repair damaged tissue. Brown et al. describe cathartocytosis, a process that large, differentiated cells can use to rapidly downscale their cellular machinery.

                Using DERET to analyze mGlu receptor internalization kinetics, Cimadevila et al. demonstrate that only mGlu1, mGlu5, mGlu3, and mGlu2-3 dimers undergo agonist-induced internalization even in the absence of β-arrestins or GRKs. However, β-arrestins emerge as key players in constitutive internalization of mGlu receptors.

These findings provide a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing the progression from AKI to CKD.

                p53 signaling is frequently dampened in cancer. 53BP1 binds p53 and enhances p53 target gene expression. Galarreta et al. identify CNOT1 of the CCR4-NOT complex as a regulator of 53BP1-p53 signaling and show that CNOT1 depletion boosts p53 target gene expression, selectively compromises cancer cell survival, and rescues mutant p53 functions.

                Yang et al. demonstrate that lactate lactylates TRIM65 at K206, impairing its ubiquitin ligase activity. This blocks degradation of the iron regulator IREB2 and glycolytic gene PDK4, driving ferroptosis and glycolysis in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The non-lactylatable K206R mutant enhances anti-DKD efficacy, identifying TRIM65 lactylation as a therapeutic target.
