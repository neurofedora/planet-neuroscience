              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A functional network target for tic reduction during thalamic stimulation for Tourette Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the medial thalamus is an evolving therapy for severe, treatment-refractory Tourette syndrome (TS). It remains unanswered which functionally connected networks need to be modulated to obtain optimal treatment results. Methods: We assessed treatment response of 15 patients with TS untergoing thalamic DBS six and twelve months postoperatively using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) tic score. For each time point, functional connectivity maps seeding from stimulation sites were calculated based on a normative functional connectome derived from 1000 healthy subjects. Resulting maps were analyzed in a voxel-wise mixed model for repeated measurements to identify patterns of connectivity associated with tic reduction. Results: Connectivity of stimulation to the medial frontal cortex, bilateral insulae and sensorimotor cortex was associated with tic reduction. Connectivity with the temporal lobe, cerebellum, ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex was negatively associated. The overall connectivity pattern was robust to leave-one-out cross-validation, explaining 25 % of outcome variance (R = 0.500; p = 0.005). Conclusions: We delineated a functional connectivity profile seeding from stimulation sites associated with TS-DBS outcome. This pattern comprised areas linked to the processing of premonitory urges and tic execution, thereby extending our current understanding of effective neuromodulation for TS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The brain tunes to unfamiliar voices during sleeping</a></h4>

              
                The brain continues to respond selectively to environmental stimuli even during sleep. However, the functional role of such responses, and whether they reflect information processing or rather sensory inhibition is not fully understood. Here, we presented 17 human sleepers (14 females) with their own name and two unfamiliar first names, spoken by either a familiar voice (FV) or an unfamiliar voice (UFV), while recording polysomnography during a full night of sleep. We detected K-complexes, sleep spindles, and micro-arousals, and then assessed event-related potentials, oscillatory power as well as inter-trial phase synchronization in response to the different stimuli presented during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. We show that UFVs evoke more K-complexes and micro-arousals than FVs. When both stimuli evoke a K-complex, we observed larger evoked potentials, higher oscillatory power in the high beta (>16Hz) frequency range, and stronger time-locking in the delta band (1-4 Hz) in response to UFVs relative to FVs. Crucially, these differences in brain responses disappear when no K-complexes are evoked by the auditory stimuli. Our findings highlight discrepancies in brain responses to auditory stimuli based on their relevance to the sleeper and propose a key role for K-complexes in the modulation of sensory processing during sleep. We argue that such content-specific, dynamic reactivity to external sensory information enables the brain to enter a sentinel processing mode in which it engages in the many important processes that are ongoing during sleep while still maintaining the ability to process vital information in the surrounding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissociating the Neural Correlates of Planning and Executing Hierarchical Task Sets</a></h4>

              
                Task processing and task representation, two facets of cognitive control, are both supported by lateral frontal cortex (LFC). However, processing and representation have largely been investigated separately, so it is unknown if they are distinguishable aspects of control or if they are complementary descriptions of the same mechanism. Here, we explored this by combining a hierarchical task mapping with a pre-cueing procedure. Participants made match/non-match judgments on features of pairs of stimuli. Cues presented at the start of each trial indicated the judgment domain (spatial/non-spatial), the response hand, both, or neither, giving variable amounts of information to the subject at each time point in the trial. Our results demonstrated that regions throughout LFC supported task processing, indicated by an influence of time point on their BOLD activity levels. A subset of regions in left caudal LFC also supported task representation, indicated by an interaction between time point and cue information; we termed this subgroup the "CuexTime" group. This interaction effect was not seen in the remaining LFC regions, which only showed a main effect of time consistent with involvement in task processing; we termed this subgroup the "Time" group. These results suggest that task representation is one component of task processing, confined to the "CuexTime group" in left caudal LFC, while other regions in our task support other aspects of task processing. We further conducted an exploratory investigation of connectivity between regions in the "CuexTime" and "Time" groups and their potential relationship to networks that support distinct cognitive control functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Large-Scale Investigation of White Matter Microstructural Associations with Reading Ability</a></h4>

              
                Reading involves the functioning of a widely distributed brain network, and white matter tracts are responsible for sending information between constituent network nodes. Several studies have analyzed fiber bundle microstructural properties to shed insights into the neural basis of reading abilities and disabilities. Findings have been inconsistent, potentially due to small sample sizes and varying methodology. To address this, we analyzed a large data set of 690 children ages 5-18 using state-of-the-art neuroimaging acquisitions and processing techniques. We searched for associations between fractional anisotropy (FA) and single-word and nonword reading skills in both typical and poor readers across multiple tracts previously thought to contribute to reading. Consistent with prior studies, FA increased with age across all tracts. There were significant correlations between better reading skills and higher FA in several fiber bundles among poor readers, but fewer and occasionally negative associations among proficient readers. The left superior longitudinal fasciculus and arcuate fasciculus unexpectedly exhibited higher FA within those diagnosed with reading disabilities compared to those without a diagnosis, while their right-hemisphere homologs exhibited higher FA in those with higher reading scores, regardless of diagnostic status. These results suggest a different relation between white matter pathways in children with typical reading ability versus those with reading disabilities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Goal-Dependent Hippocampal Representations Facilitate Self-Control</a></h4>

              
                Mnemonic influences on decision-making processes are important for linking past experiences and simulations of the future with current goals. The ways in which mnemonic information is represented may be especially critical in situations where one needs to overcome past rewarding experiences and exert self-control. We propose that self-control success or failure may depend on how information is retrieved from memory and how effectively this memory retrieval process can be modified to achieve a specific goal. We test our hypothesis using representational similarity analyses of human neuroimaging data during a dietary self-control task in which individuals must overcome taste temptations to choose healthy foods. We find that self-control is indeed associated with the way individuals represent taste information in the brain and how taste representations adapt to align with different goals. These results provide new insights into the processes leading to self-control success and indicate the need to update the classical view of self-control to continue to advance our understanding of its behavioral and neural underpinnings.

	<p>Episodic buffer (EB), a key component of working memory, seems to have a rather complicated function as part of binding processes. Recent papers on the field claim that binding processes of working memory (WM) are assisted by attention and executive functions. On the same page, vascular pathology is gaining more ground as the main underlying cause for many brain pathologies. Hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, lack of exercise and smoking are the most common risk factors that people of all ages suffer from and constitute the main vascular risk factors responsible for a possible decline in executive functions and attention. Thus, this research is an attempt to examine the relation between the binding functions of WM and the existence of vascular risk factors via a computerized test focusing on feature binding. The study comprised adults (n = 229) with and without vascular risk factors. The main tools used were a biomarker questionnaire and a feature binding test (FBT). The results showed that participants who report suffering from one or more vascular risk factors had significantly lower performance on specific subtasks of the FBT in comparison to the participants who were healthy. This allows us to assume that there might be a positive association between feature binding and a vascular risk profile in adults, and such a test could be a useful diagnostic tool for early cognitive impairment due to incipient vascular pathology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Lamin B1 sequesters 53BP1 to control its recruitment to DNA damage</a></h4>

              
                <p>Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are harmful lesions and a major cause of genome instability. Studies have suggested a link between the nuclear envelope and the DNA damage response. Here, we show that lamin B1, a major component of the nuclear envelope, interacts directly with 53BP1 protein, which plays a pivotal role in the DSB repair. This interaction is dissociated after DNA damage. Lamin B1 overexpression impedes 53BP1 recruitment to DNA damage sites and leads to a persistence of DNA damage, a defect in nonhomologous end joining and an increased sensitivity to DSBs. The identification of interactions domains between lamin B1 and 53BP1 allows us to demonstrate that the defect of 53BP1 recruitment and the DSB persistence upon lamin B1 overexpression are due to sequestration of 53BP1 by lamin B1. This study highlights lamin B1 as a factor controlling the recruitment of 53BP1 to DNA damage sites upon injury.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Histone citrullination by PADI4 is required for HIF-dependent transcriptional responses to hypoxia and tumor vascularization</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) activate transcription of target genes by recruiting coactivators and chromatin-modifying enzymes. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PADI4) catalyzes the deimination of histone arginine residues to citrulline. Here, we demonstrate that PADI4 expression is induced by hypoxia in a HIF-dependent manner in breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. PADI4, in turn, is recruited by HIFs to hypoxia response elements (HREs) and is required for HIF target gene transcription. Hypoxia induces histone citrullination at HREs that is PADI4 and HIF dependent. RNA sequencing revealed that almost all HIF target genes in breast cancer cells are PADI4 dependent. PADI4 is required for breast and liver tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice. PADI4 expression is correlated with HIF-1&alpha; expression and vascularization in human breast cancer biopsies. Thus, HIF-dependent recruitment of PADI4 to target genes and local histone citrullination are required for transcriptional responses to hypoxia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Environmental vulnerability of the global ocean epipelagic plankton community interactome</a></h4>

              
                <p>Marine plankton form complex communities of interacting organisms at the base of the food web, which sustain oceanic biogeochemical cycles and help regulate climate. Although global surveys are starting to reveal ecological drivers underlying planktonic community structure and predicted climate change responses, it is unclear how community-scale species interactions will be affected by climate change. Here, we leveraged <I>Tara</I> Oceans sampling to infer a global ocean cross-domain plankton co-occurrence network&mdash;the community interactome&mdash;and used niche modeling to assess its vulnerabilities to environmental change. Globally, this revealed a plankton interactome self-organized latitudinally into marine biomes (Trades, Westerlies, Polar) and more connected poleward. Integrated niche modeling revealed biome-specific community interactome responses to environmental change and forecasted the most affected lineages for each community. These results provide baseline approaches to assess community structure and organismal interactions under climate scenarios while identifying plausible plankton bioindicators for ocean monitoring of climate change.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">High-purity production and precise editing of DNA base editing ribonucleoproteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex&ndash;mediated base editing is expected to be greatly beneficial because of its reduced off-target effects compared to plasmid- or viral vector&ndash;mediated gene editing, especially in therapeutic applications. However, production of recombinant cytosine base editors (CBEs) or adenine base editors (ABEs) with ample yield and high purity in bacterial systems is challenging. Here, we obtained highly purified CBE/ABE proteins from a human cell expression system and showed that CBE/ABE RNPs exhibited different editing patterns (i.e., less conversion ratio of multiple bases to single base) compared to plasmid-encoded CBE/ABE, mainly because of the limited life span of RNPs in cells. Furthermore, we found that off-target effects in both DNA and RNA were greatly reduced for ABE RNPs compared to plasmid-encoded ABE. We ultimately applied NG PAM&ndash;targetable ABE RNPs to in vivo gene correction in retinal degeneration 12 (<I>rd12</I>) model mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">No ordinary proteins: Adsorption and molecular orientation of monoclonal antibodies</a></h4>

              
                <p>The interaction of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with air/water interfaces plays a crucial role in their overall stability in solution. We aim to understand this behavior using pendant bubble measurements to track the dynamic tension reduction and x-ray reflectivity to obtain the electron density profiles (EDPs) at the surface. Native immunoglobulin G mAb is a rigid molecule with a flat, "Y" shape, and simulated EDPs are obtained by rotating a homology construct at the surface. Comparing simulations with experimental EDPs, we obtain surface orientation probability maps showing mAbs transition from flat-on Y-shape configurations to side-on or end-on configurations with increasing concentration. The modeling also shows the presence of &beta; sheets at the surface. Overall, the experiments and the homology modeling elucidate the orientational phase space during different stages of adsorption of mAbs at the air/water interface. These finding will help define new strategies for the manufacture and storage of antibody-based therapeutics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">An epigenetic basis of inbreeding depression in maize</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inbreeding depression is widespread across plant and animal kingdoms and may arise from the exposure of deleterious alleles and/or loss of overdominant alleles resulting from increased homozygosity, but these genetic models cannot fully explain the phenomenon. Here, we report epigenetic links to inbreeding depression in maize. Teosinte branched1/cycloidea/proliferating cell factor (TCP) transcription factors control plant development. During successive inbreeding among inbred lines, thousands of genomic regions across TCP-binding sites (TBS) are hypermethylated through the H3K9me2-mediated pathway. These hypermethylated regions are accompanied by decreased chromatin accessibility, increased levels of the repressive histone marks H3K27me2 and H3K27me3, and reduced binding affinity of maize TCP-proteins to TBS. Consequently, hundreds of TCP-target genes involved in mitochondrion, chloroplast, and ribosome functions are down-regulated, leading to reduced growth vigor. Conversely, random mating can reverse corresponding hypermethylation sites and TCP-target gene expression, restoring growth vigor. These results support a unique role of reversible epigenetic modifications in inbreeding depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Synchronous and opponent thermosensors use flexible cross-inhibition to orchestrate thermal homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Body temperature homeostasis is essential and reliant upon the integration of outputs from multiple classes of cooling- and warming-responsive cells. The computations that integrate these outputs are not understood. Here, we discover a set of warming cells (WCs) and show that the outputs of these WCs combine with previously described cooling cells (CCs) in a cross-inhibition computation to drive thermal homeostasis in larval <I>Drosophila</I>. WCs and CCs detect temperature changes using overlapping combinations of ionotropic receptors: Ir68a, Ir93a, and Ir25a for WCs and Ir21a, Ir93a, and Ir25a for CCs. WCs mediate avoidance to warming while cross-inhibiting avoidance to cooling, and CCs mediate avoidance to cooling while cross-inhibiting avoidance to warming. Ambient temperature&ndash;dependent regulation of the strength of WC- and CC-mediated cross-inhibition keeps larvae near their homeostatic set point. Using neurophysiology, quantitative behavioral analysis, and connectomics, we demonstrate how flexible integration between warming and cooling pathways can orchestrate homeostatic thermoregulation.</p>

                <p>A critical challenge for microbiology and medicine is how to cure infections by bacteria that survive antibiotic treatment by persistence or tolerance. Seeking mechanisms behind such high survival, we developed a forward-genetic method for efficient isolation of high-survival mutants in any culturable bacterial species. We found that perturbation of an essential biosynthetic pathway (arginine biosynthesis) in a mycobacterium generated three distinct forms of resistance to diverse antibiotics, each mediated by induction of WhiB7: high persistence and tolerance to kanamycin, high survival upon exposure to rifampicin, and minimum inhibitory concentration&ndash;shifted resistance to clarithromycin. As little as one base change in a gene that encodes, a metabolic pathway component conferred multiple forms of resistance to multiple antibiotics with different targets. This extraordinary resilience may help explain how substerilizing exposure to one antibiotic in a regimen can induce resistance to others and invites development of drugs targeting the mediator of multiform resistance, WhiB7.</p>

                <p>Earthquake swarms are ubiquitous in volcanic systems, being manifestations of underlying nontectonic processes such as magma intrusions or volatile fluid transport. The Long Valley caldera, California, is one such setting where episodic earthquake swarms and persistent uplift suggest the presence of active magmatism. We quantify the long-term spatial and temporal characteristics of seismicity in the region using cluster analysis on a 25-year high-resolution earthquake catalog derived using leading-edge deep-learning algorithms. Our results show that earthquake swarms beneath the caldera exhibit enlarged families with statistically significant tendency for upward migration patterns. The ascending swarms tend to nucleate at the base of the seismogenic zone with a spatial footprint that is laterally constrained by the southern rim of the caldera. We suggest that these swarms are driven by the transport of volatile-rich fluids released from deep volcanic processes. The observations highlight the potential for extreme spatial segmentation of earthquake triggering processes in magmatic systems.</p>

                <p>Nonhealing diabetic wounds are common complications for diabetic patients. Because chronic hypoxia prominently delays wound healing, sustained oxygenation to alleviate hypoxia is hypothesized to promote diabetic wound healing. However, sustained oxygenation cannot be achieved by current clinical approaches, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Here, we present a sustained oxygenation system consisting of oxygen-release microspheres and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&ndash;scavenging hydrogel. The hydrogel captures the naturally elevated ROS in diabetic wounds, which may be further elevated by the oxygen released from the administered microspheres. The sustained release of oxygen augmented the survival and migration of keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts, promoted angiogenic growth factor expression and angiogenesis in diabetic wounds, and decreased the proinflammatory cytokine expression. These effects significantly increased the wound closure rate. Our findings demonstrate that sustained oxygenation alone, without using drugs, can heal diabetic wounds.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Genome-wide synthetic lethal screen unveils novel CAIX-NFS1/xCT axis as a targetable vulnerability in hypoxic solid tumors</a></h4>

              
                <p>The metabolic mechanisms involved in the survival of tumor cells within the hypoxic niche remain unclear. We carried out a synthetic lethal CRISPR screen to identify survival mechanisms governed by the tumor hypoxia&ndash;induced pH regulator carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX). We identified a redox homeostasis network containing the iron-sulfur cluster enzyme, NFS1. Depletion of NFS1 or blocking cyst(e)ine availability by inhibiting xCT, while targeting CAIX, enhanced ferroptosis and significantly inhibited tumor growth. Suppression of CAIX activity acidified intracellular pH, increased cellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, and induced susceptibility to alterations in iron homeostasis. Mechanistically, inhibiting bicarbonate production by CAIX or sodium-driven bicarbonate transport, while targeting xCT, decreased adenosine 5'-monophosphate&ndash;activated protein kinase activation and increased acetyl&ndash;coenzyme A carboxylase 1 activation. Thus, an alkaline intracellular pH plays a critical role in suppressing ferroptosis, a finding that may lead to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for solid tumors to overcome hypoxia- and acidosis-mediated tumor progression and therapeutic resistance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Myths and facts about getting an academic faculty position in neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                <p>We at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke routinely receive questions and statements from trainees and faculty that suggest widespread beliefs about the necessity of a National Institutes of Health K99/R00 award, other prior funding, and/or specific types of publications for obtaining one&rsquo;s first tenure-track position in neuroscience. To address these beliefs, we examined the funding and publication history of a cohort of investigators who began their first academic faculty position between 2009 and 2019, and we interviewed several senior academic leaders with extensive experience in hiring new faculty. Our data show that &lt;11% of newly hired faculty had a K99/R00 award and that neither prior funding nor papers in prestigious journals were necessary to obtain a tenure-track faculty position. Interviews with academic leaders almost uniformly referred to critically important factors that were considered to be more important in the hiring process than funding or publishing in high-profile journals.</p>

                <p>Debilitating chronic pain resulting from genetic predisposition, injury, or acquired neuropathy is becoming increasingly pervasive. Opioid analgesics remain the gold standard for intractable pain, but overprescription of increasingly powerful and addictive opioids has contributed to the current prescription drug abuse epidemic. There is a pressing need to screen experimental compounds more efficiently for analgesic potential that remains unmet by conventional research models. The spinal cord dorsal horn is a common target for analgesic intervention, where peripheral nociceptive signals are relayed to the central nervous system through synaptic transmission. Here, we demonstrate that coculturing peripheral and dorsal spinal cord nerve cells in a novel bioengineered microphysiological system facilitates self-directed emergence of native nerve tissue macrostructure and concerted synaptic function. The mechanistically distinct analgesics&mdash;morphine, lidocaine, and clonidine&mdash;differentially and predictably modulate this microphysiological synaptic transmission. Screening drug candidates for similar microphysiological profiles will efficiently identify therapeutics with analgesic potential.</p>

                <p>The class IB phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), PI3K, is a master regulator of immune cell function and a promising drug target for both cancer and inflammatory diseases. Critical to PI3K function is the association of the p110 catalytic subunit to either a p101 or p84 regulatory subunit, which mediates activation by G protein&ndash;coupled receptors. Here, we report the cryo&ndash;electron microscopy structure of a heterodimeric PI3K complex, p110-p101. This structure reveals a unique assembly of catalytic and regulatory subunits that is distinct from other class I PI3K complexes. p101 mediates activation through its G&beta;-binding domain, recruiting the heterodimer to the membrane and allowing for engagement of a secondary G&beta;-binding site in p110. Mutations at the p110-p101 and p110&ndash;adaptor binding domain interfaces enhanced G&beta; activation. A nanobody that specifically binds to the p101-G&beta; interface blocks activation, providing a novel tool to study and target p110-p101&ndash;specific signaling events in vivo.</p>

                Background: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the postoperative pain between root canal instrumentation with unconnected electronic apex locator and instrumentation with connected electronic apex locator. Methods: Forty-two patients were randomly divided into two groups (n=21). Group 1 was treated using the traditional endodontic motor with unconnected electronic apex locator (EAL) and group 2 was treated using the endodontic motor with connected EAL. All teeth were treated in single-visit endodontic therapy. Postoperative pain levels at 6, 24, 48, 72 h and 1 week were recorded by patients. The data were collected and analyzed using the χ2, and Mann-Whitney U tests with significance at 0.05. Results: Postoperative pain levels were significantly reduced by half at 6 hours in both experimental groups; however, no significant differences were found in postoperative pain levels between the two groups at all considered times. The postoperative pain levels using a percussion test were reduced on day 7 in both groups, and there was no significant difference in this variable between two groups. Conclusions: Both groups have a similar effect on reduction of the postoperative pain for endodontic patients undergoing root canal.

                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about many changes in all sectors of life, especially in the field of education. These changes aim to make the learning process more effective in the pandemic environment. However, it can be challenging, as some students do not give positive responses to these changes, especially those in remote areas. This article aims to identify and report students' perceptions about the effectiveness of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic in the remote North Tapanuli region of Indonesia. Methods: In this study, data were obtained using an online survey involving 30 students from three levels of education, namely junior high school, senior high school, and college. The data gathered from the survey were analyzed using quantitative descriptive methods. Results: Results show that online learning is considered less effective by students in remote areas; this happens because communication networks and infrastructure do not adequately support them to follow online learning. Conclusion: Teachers need to evaluate how to teach as well as re-design models and approaches to be applied in learning. This can be achieved by adjusting to the student’s current situation to generate interest and willingness to learn online.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">AIM: A network model of attention in auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kenny F. Chou, Kamal Sen</p>

Attentional modulation of cortical networks is critical for the cognitive flexibility required to process complex scenes. Current theoretical frameworks for attention are based almost exclusively on studies in visual cortex, where attentional effects are typically modest and excitatory. In contrast, attentional effects in auditory cortex can be large and suppressive. A theoretical framework for explaining attentional effects in auditory cortex is lacking, preventing a broader understanding of cortical mechanisms underlying attention. Here, we present a cortical network model of attention in primary auditory cortex (A1). A key mechanism in our network is attentional inhibitory modulation (AIM) of cortical inhibitory neurons. In this mechanism, top-down inhibitory neurons disinhibit bottom-up cortical circuits, a prominent circuit motif observed in sensory cortex. Our results reveal that the same underlying mechanisms in the AIM network can explain diverse attentional effects on both spatial and frequency tuning in A1. We find that a dominant effect of disinhibition on cortical tuning is suppressive, consistent with experimental observations. Functionally, the AIM network may play a key role in solving the cocktail party problem. We demonstrate how attention can guide the AIM network to monitor an acoustic scene, select a specific target, or switch to a different target, providing flexible outputs for solving the cocktail party problem.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interspike interval correlations in neuron models with adaptation and correlated noise</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lukas Ramlow, Benjamin Lindner</p>

The generation of neural action potentials (spikes) is random but nevertheless may result in a rich statistical structure of the spike sequence. In particular, contrary to the popular renewal assumption of theoreticians, the intervals between adjacent spikes are often correlated. Experimentally, different patterns of interspike-interval correlations have been observed and computational studies have identified spike-frequency adaptation and correlated noise as the two main mechanisms that can lead to such correlations. Analytical studies have focused on the single cases of either correlated (colored) noise or adaptation currents in combination with uncorrelated (white) noise. For low-pass filtered noise or adaptation, the serial correlation coefficient can be approximated as a single geometric sequence of the lag between the intervals, providing an explanation for some of the experimentally observed patterns. Here we address the problem of interval correlations for a widely used class of models, multidimensional integrate-and-fire neurons subject to a combination of colored and white noise sources and a spike-triggered adaptation current. Assuming weak noise, we derive a simple formula for the serial correlation coefficient, a sum of two geometric sequences, which accounts for a large class of correlation patterns. The theory is confirmed by means of numerical simulations in a number of special cases including the leaky, quadratic, and generalized integrate-and-fire models with colored noise and spike-frequency adaptation. Furthermore we study the case in which the adaptation current and the colored noise share the same time scale, corresponding to a slow stochastic population of adaptation channels; we demonstrate that our theory can account for a nonmonotonic dependence of the correlation coefficient on the channel’s time scale. Another application of the theory is a neuron driven by network-noise-like fluctuations (green noise). We also discuss the range of validity of our weak-noise theory and show that by changing the relative strength of white and colored noise sources, we can change the sign of the correlation coefficient. Finally, we apply our theory to a conductance-based model which demonstrates its broad applicability.

                Overweight and obesity in adolescents are associated with high consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF). UPF are industrially manufactured foods that contain large amounts of calories, trans fats, sugars, sodium, and chemical additives. It is also associated with lower intake of vitamins, milk, fruits and vegetables. Through adolescence, good nutrition is essential during neurodevelopment for optimal brain health. However, the relationship between UPF and educational variables are not clear; therefore, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the effect of UPF on variables such as cognition and learning processes. So, our aim was to evaluate the effects of UPF on cognition and learning of adolescents through systematic review. Understanding these effects is important because it may provide information for public health and educational policies mainly targeted at schools to ensure a healthy food environment. The results from the study showed that no study had met our eligibility criteria; however, we considered it relevant to share the findings.

     alt="A sex-specific feedback projection from aromatase-expressing neurons in the medial amygdala to the accessory olfactory bulb"/>
<p>Aromatase neurons are distributed in clustered populations primarily in a network of brain regions (red) devoted to social behavior. Out of all potential sources of aromatase neurons, only the ventral medial amygdala projects back to the accessory olfactory bulb. The population of aromatase-expressing neurons in the ventral medial amygdala also expresses ERα and displays two sex differences: (1) aromatase-expressing neurons are larger in females; (2) there are more aromatase-expressing neurons in male mice.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) plays a critical role in classifying pheromonal signals. Here we identify two previously undescribed sources of aromatase signaling in the AOB: (1) a population of aromatase-expressing neurons in the AOB itself; (2) a tract of aromatase-expressing axons which originate in the ventral medial amygdala (MEA) and terminate in the AOB. Using a retrograde tracer in conjunction with a transgenic strategy to label aromatase-expressing neurons throughout the brain, we found that a single contiguous population of neurons in the ventral MEA provides the only significant feedback by aromatase-expressing neurons to the AOB. This population expresses the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and displayed anatomical sex differences in the number of neurons (higher in male mice) and the size of cell bodies (larger in females). Given the previously established relationship between aromatase expression, estrogen signaling, and the function of sexually dimorphic circuits, we suggest that this feedback population is well-positioned to provide neuroendocrine feedback to modulate sensory processing of social stimuli in the AOB.</p>

Children typically report coarse-grained memories narratives lacking specificity and detail. This lack of memory specificity is illustrative of an immature or impaired PS. Despite its importance for the ontogeny of memory, data regarding the maturation of PS during childhood is still scarce. PS is known to rely on the hippocampus, particularly on hippocampal subfields DG and CA3. In this study, we used a memory discrimination task, a behavioral proxy for PS, and manually segmented hippocampal subfields volumes in the hippocampal body in a cohort of 26 children aged from 5 to 12 years. We examined the association between subfields volumes and memory discrimination performance. The main results were: (1) we showed age-related differences of memory discrimination suggesting a continuous increase of memory performance during early to late childhood. (2) We evidenced distinct associations between age and the volumes of hippocampal subfield, suggesting distinct developmental trajectories. (3) We showed a relationship between memory discrimination performance and the volumes of CA3 and subiculum. Our results further confirm the role of CA3 in memory discrimination, and suggest to scrutinize more closely the role of the subiculum. Overall, we showed that hippocampal subfields contribute distinctively to PS during development.</p>

                <p>The early differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease and atypical parkinsonism is a major challenge. The use of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/positron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging to investigate parkinsonism is a fast-developing field. Imaging biomarker research may potentially lead to more accurate disease detection, enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment. This review summarizes recent SPECT/PET advances in radiopharmaceuticals and imaging technologies/analyses that improve the diagnosis of neurodegenerative parkinsonism. We are currently witnessing a turning point in the field. Integrating molecular imaging as a diagnostic technique represents an opportunity to reassess the strategies for diagnosing neurodegenerative parkinsonism. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">What are the long-term symptoms and complications of COVID-19: a protocol for a living systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Although the majority of people with Covid-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and will recover fully, there is now increasing evidence that a significant proportion will experience persistent symptoms for months after the acute phase of the illness. These symptoms include, among others, fatigue, problems breathing, lack of smell and taste, headaches, and depression and anxiety. It is also clear the virus has lasting fluctuating multiorgan sequelae, including affecting not only the respiratory system but also the heart, liver, and nervous system. We present a protocol for a living systematic review that aims to synthesize the evidence on the prevalence and characteristics of post-acute COVID-19. The living systematic review will be updated regularly, approximately every 6 months, as new evidence emerges. We will include studies that follow up at least 100 people with Covid-19 at 12 or more weeks post Covid-19 onset, with no restrictions regarding country, setting, or language. We will use descriptive statistics and, for outcomes reported in two or more studies, we will use meta-analyses to estimate prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the exact method. Heterogeneity between estimates will be assessed using the I2 statistic.Our findings will also be presented as infographics to facilitate transcription to lay audiences. Ultimately, we aim to support the work of policy makers, practitioners, and patients when planning rehabilitation for those recovering from Covid-19. The protocol has been registered with PROSPERO ( CRD42020211131, 25/09/2020).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Limitations of care and comorbidities are associated with increased mortality in patients treated with non-invasive ventilation: A retrospective observational study in a single-center ICU. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a common treatment for acute respiratory failure in intensive care units (ICU). While there is increasing data on outcomes after NIV treatment, there are large variations in staffing and monitoring where NIV is provided, making results hard to generalize. The aim of this study was to characterize patients treated with NIV, describe outcomes, and identify factors associated with outcome in an ICU at a Swedish county hospital. Methods: A single-centre retrospective observational study during 2018 of patients treated with NIV in a six-bed ICU at a Swedish county hospital. Patient characteristics, including comorbidities, details of ICU stay, simplified acute physiology score (SAPS-3), details of NIV treatment and 30-day mortality were collected, and the Charlson co-morbidity index (CCI) was calculated. Primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and associated factors. Results: 92 patients with mean age (71,3, SD 12,1) were treated with NIV during the study period. 42 (46%) were women. Median CCI was 3 (25th-75th percentiles 1.4)) and median SAPS-3 score was 66 (25th-75th percentiles 58). The 30-day mortality was 37% and in the univariate analysis, SAPS-3 score >66, Charlson comorbidity index, CCI>=3, pCO2 <5.5 and limitation of care were factors associated with increased 30-day mortality. pH <7.35 and pO2<8 at admission showed no associations with 30-day mortality. Conclusions: We found that patients treated with NIV in ICU were a diverse population where comorbidities and presence of limitations of care might be considered as better predictors of 30-day mortality, rather than physiological parameters.

                Background: The effect of solid retention time (SRT) over cheese whey substrates in a fermentation process drives changes in the composition of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) obtained. Volatile fatty acids produced in the first step of an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor were used as substrates to produce PHA using mixed microbial cultures under aerobic dynamic feeding conditions. Methods: Analytical methods were used for the standard analysis of parameters of interest including measuring the amount of ammonium and phosphate, chemical oxygen demand, among others. Results: The SRT increasing from 4 to 6 and 10 days produced changes in the distribution of volatile fatty acids produced. The polyhydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate copolymers formed in the accumulation stage gave the following results: 58:42, 68:32 and 81:19 (%), referred to SRTs of 10, 6 and 4 days, respectively. The maximum PHA accumulation obtained at 10 days of SRT was 52% of the dry cell weight within 7 h, reaching a PHA productivity of 0.62 g L−1 h−1 and a storage yield of 0.37. Conclusion: The SRT variation impact on the distribution of volatile fatty acids in the acidogenic reactor and consequently on the PHA production and composition formed in the accumulation stage.

                Background: An e-wallet is a digital equivalent of a physical wallet which plays an essential role in payment system transformation. To embrace the concept of a cashless society, the Malaysian Government and central bank have taken various steps to encourage the adoption of e-wallets. Despite the seamless services offered by the e-wallet, it is yet to reach high-scale adoption in Malaysia. This study aims to investigate Malaysians’ readiness towards the e-wallet and their perceptions of it by employing the UTAUT2 model. Methods: A total of 309 valid data were gathered and analysed with partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Results: The findings revealed that the respondents were confident about the new technology and tended to believe that e-wallet was somehow useful for them. The results also disclosed that e-wallet adoption intention was significantly influenced by performance expectancy, price value, facilitating conditions, and followed closely by social influence. Nonetheless, insecurity did not present significant impact on both performance expectancy and effort expectancy of e-wallet. Conclusions: This study provides a substantial contribution to the knowledge domain by combining system-specific and individual-specific models in an e-wallet context. The outcomes of this study would also benefit e-wallet service providers and policymakers by delivering holistic insight into Malaysians’ readiness and adoption behaviour of the e-wallet.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Patient delay impact on breast cancer survival at Khartoum Referral Hospital: a retrospective study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Breast cancer can be invasive and advanced at diagnosis causing enormous suffering and premature death. Delay to stage diagnosis and treatment is related to survival evaluation and several factors determine delay. The aim of the study was to examine predictor covariates associated with breast cancer delay and its impact on patient prognosis and survival. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional hospital-based study was carried out at Khartoum Oncology Hospital. Participants were 411 breast cancer patients diagnosed and treated during the period 2016. Patients’ pathological and socio-demographic data were extracted from their medical files and delay data from telephone questionnaire survey and survival times calculated from follow-up. Fisher exact test, Cox and Logistic regression models were used to examine relationships between demographic, clinical and delay variables and survival outcome. Results: The mean age of the study subjects was 50.07 years old and the majority were ≥45 years. Cancer delay analysis showed that there were different reasons for different types of delay but the majority of participants (86.2%) claimed fear of the disease and treatment and lack of information were real drivers of delay. The study confirmed the majority of participants expressed  long delay estimated at 28.3 weeks and patient delay had a significant association with the advanced stage (P-value<0.05). The hazard ratio was four times for risk of dying from cancer for long delay compared to the short one. Conclusion: The results of the study suggest delays at diagnosis and treatment are more common steps leading to advanced stage at diagnosis and poor survival. Early detection of the disease provides tremendous opportunities for early diagnosis, effective treatment and high chances of survival.

     alt="The Organization of Cholinergic Projections in the Visual Thalamus of the Mouse"/>
<p>We used retrograde and anterograde tracing techniques, along with immunocytochemistry, to delineate the sources of cholinergic brainstem projections to the dorsal thalamus of the mouse. Shown are the pattern of cholinergic projections from the parabigeminal nucleus (PBG; red), pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPTg; blue), and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDTg; brown) to contralateral and ipsilateral dorsal thalamic nuclei, including dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), pulvinar (PUL), ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN), ventrobasal complex (VB), and posterior nucleus (Po). Brainstem nuclei are depicted as boxes, and indicate immunoreactivity to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and brain nitric oxide synthase (BNOS).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cholinergic projections from the brainstem serve as important modulators of activity in visual thalamic nuclei such as the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). While these projections have been studied in several mammals, a comprehensive examination of their organization in the mouse is lacking. We used the retrograde transport of viruses or cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) injected in the dLGN, immunocytochemical labeling with antibodies against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), brain nitric oxide synthase (BNOS), and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), ChAT-Cre mice crossed with a reporter line (Ai9), as well as brainstem virus injections in ChAT-Cre mice to examine the pattern of thalamic innervation from cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, LDTg, and the parabigeminal nucleus (PBG). Retrograde tracing demonstrated that the dLGN receives input from the PPTg, LDTg, and PBG. Viral tracing in ChAT-Cre mice and retrograde tracing combined with immunocytochemistry revealed that many of these inputs originate from cholinergic neurons in the PBG and PPTg. Most notable was an extensive cholinergic projection from the PBG which innervated most of the contralateral dLGN, with an especially dense concentration in the dorsolateral shell, as well as a small region in the dorsomedial pole of the ipsilateral dLGN. The PPTg was found to provide a sparse somewhat diffuse innervation of the ipsilateral dLGN. Neurons in the PPTg co-expressed ChAT, BNOS and VAChT, whereas PBG neurons expressed ChAT, but not BNOS or VAChT. These results highlight the presence of distinct cholinergic populations that innervate the mouse dLGN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Unsettling realities of Nazism and the legacy of the German Neurological Society</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>On behalf of the German Neurological Society (DGN), a study was conducted into how far former chairmen, honorary chairmen, and honorary members could be regarded as incriminated from the National Socialist period. While an online supplement of this journal presents seven individual biographies (in six papers) by way of example, this paper offers an overview summarizing the project results and introducing the biographies.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The first part and the methodological section discuss the difficulties of retrospectively identifying neurologists involved in the Nazi movement. Formal characteristics (e.g., membership of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) or other Nazi organizations or participation in Nazi crimes) and content-related clues (e.g., statements reflecting Nazi ideology, personal contacts with Nazi officials or active support of the system) can be helpful.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The second part summarizes the principal results of a study of 28 German and Austrian neuroscientists with regard to their involvement and their post-war careers. Six of the seven “founding fathers” of the DGN were former NSDAP members; 10 of the 13 presidents in office until 1976 had belonged to Nazi organizations—the NSDAP, the SA (“Brownshirts”) or the SS (“Blackshirts”). Moreover, seven out of 10 honorary presidents had formal or substantive links to National Socialism. Of the German and Austrian honorary members appointed up to 1985, two-thirds had leanings to Nazi ideology or the National Socialist system.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This paper concludes by outlining how the DGN and its members are currently addressing this historical legacy in order to establish a responsible culture of remembrance.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">MACF1 controls skeletal muscle function through the microtubule-dependent localization of extra-synaptic myonuclei and mitochondria biogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Skeletal muscles are composed of hundreds of multinucleated muscle fibers (myofibers) whose myonuclei are regularly positioned all along the myofiber's periphery except the few ones clustered underneath the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) at the synaptic zone. This precise myonuclei organization is altered in different types of muscle disease, including centronuclear myopathies (CNMs). However, the molecular machinery regulating myonuclei position and organization in mature myofibers remains largely unknown. Conversely, it is also unclear how peripheral myonuclei positioning is lost in the related muscle diseases. Here, we describe the microtubule-associated protein, MACF1, as an essential and evolutionary conserved regulator of myonuclei positioning and maintenance, in cultured mammalian myotubes, in <i>Drosophila </i>muscle, and in adult mammalian muscle using a conditional muscle-specific knockout mouse model. <i>In vitro</i>, we show that MACF1 controls microtubules dynamics and contributes to microtubule stabilization during myofiber's maturation. In addition, we demonstrate that MACF1 regulates the microtubules density specifically around myonuclei, and, as a consequence, governs myonuclei motion. Our <i>in vivo</i> studies show that MACF1 deficiency is associated with alteration of extra-synaptic myonuclei positioning and microtubules network organization, both preceding NMJ fragmentation. Accordingly, MACF1 deficiency results in reduced muscle excitability and disorganized triads, leaving voltage-activated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and maximal muscle force unchanged. Finally, adult MACF1-KO mice present an improved resistance to fatigue correlated with a strong increase in mitochondria biogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">NHR-8 and P-glycoproteins uncouple xenobiotic resistance from longevity in chemosensory C. elegans mutants</a></h4>

              
                Longevity is often associated with stress resistance, but whether they are causally linked is incompletely understood. Here we investigate chemosensory defective <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> mutants that are long-lived and stress resistant. We find that mutants in the intraflagellar transport protein gene <i>osm-3</i> were significantly protected from tunicamycin-induced ER stress. While <i>osm-3</i> lifespan extension is dependent on the key longevity factor DAF-16/FOXO, tunicamycin resistance was not. <i>osm-3</i> mutants are protected from bacterial pathogens, which is <i>pmk-1</i> p38 MAP kinase dependent while TM resistance was <i>pmk-1</i> independent. Expression of P-glycoprotein (PGP) xenobiotic detoxification genes was elevated in <i>osm-3</i> mutants and their knockdown or inhibition with verapamil suppressed tunicamycin resistance. The nuclear hormone receptor <i>nhr-8</i> was necessary to regulate a subset of PGPs. We thus identify a cell-nonautonomous regulation of xenobiotic detoxification and show that separate pathways are engaged to mediate longevity, pathogen resistance, and xenobiotic detoxification in <i>osm-3</i> mutants.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Parallel evolution between genomic segments of seasonal human influenza viruses reveals RNA-RNA relationships</a></h4>

              
                The influenza A virus (IAV) genome consists of eight negative-sense viral RNA (vRNA) segments that are selectively assembled into progeny virus particles through RNA-RNA interactions. To explore putative intersegmental RNA-RNA relationships, we quantified similarity between phylogenetic trees comprising each vRNA segment from seasonal human IAV. Intersegmental tree similarity differed between subtype and lineage. While intersegmental relationships were largely conserved over time in H3N2 viruses,  they diverged in H1N1 strains isolated before and after the 2009 pandemic. Surprisingly, intersegmental relationships were not driven solely by protein sequence, suggesting that IAV evolution could also be driven by RNA-RNA interactions. Finally, we used confocal microscopy to determine that colocalization of highly coevolved vRNA segments is enriched over other assembly intermediates at the nuclear periphery during productive viral infection. This study illustrates how putative RNA interactions underlying selective assembly of IAV can be interrogated with phylogenetics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Apical contacts stemming from incomplete delamination guide progenitor cell allocation through a dragging mechanism</a></h4>

              
                The developmental strategies used by progenitor cells to allow a safe journey from their induction place towards the site of terminal differentiation are still poorly understood. Here we uncovered a mechanism of progenitor cell allocation that stems from an incomplete process of epithelial delamination that allows progenitors to coordinate their movement with adjacent extra-embryonic tissues. Progenitors of the zebrafish laterality organ originate from the superficial epithelial enveloping layer by an apical constriction process of cell delamination. During this process, progenitors retain long-lasting apical contacts that enable the epithelial layer to pull a subset of progenitors on their way to the vegetal pole. The remaining delaminated cells follow the movement of apically attached progenitors by a protrusion-dependent cell-cell contact mechanism, avoiding sequestration by the adjacent endoderm, ensuring their collective fate and allocation at the site of differentiation. Thus, we reveal that incomplete delamination serves as a cellular platform for coordinated tissue movements during development.

                Sleep slow waves are studied for their role in brain plasticity, homeostatic regulation and their changes during aging. Here, we address the possibility that two types of slow waves co-exist in humans. Thirty young and 29 older adults underwent a night of polysomnographic recordings. Using the <i>Transition frequency,</i> slow waves with a slow transition (slow switchers) and with a fast transition (fast switchers) were discovered. Slow switchers had a high EEG connectivity along their depolarization transition while fast switchers had a lower connectivity dynamic and dissipated faster during the night. Aging was associated with lower temporal dissipation of sleep pressure in slow and fast switchers and lower EEG connectivity at the microscale of the oscillations, suggesting a decreased flexibility in the connectivity network of older individuals. Our findings show that two different types of slow waves with possible distinct underlying functions, coexist in the slow wave spectrum.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">PRMT5&gt;regulates ovarian follicle development by facilitating Wt1 translation</a></h4>

              
                Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (<i>Prmt5</i>) is the major type II enzyme responsible for symmetric dimethylation of arginine. Here, we found PRMT5 was expressed at high level in ovarian granulosa cells of growing follicles. Inactivation of <i>Prmt5</i> in granulosa cells resulted in aberrant follicle development and female infertility. In <i>Prmt5-</i>knockout mice, follicle development was arrested with disorganized granulosa cells in which WT1 expression was dramatically reduced and the expression of steroidogenesis-related genes was significantly increased. The premature differentiated granulosa cells were detached from oocytes and follicle structure was disrupted. Mechanism studies revealed that <i>Wt1</i> expression was regulated by PRMT5 at the protein level. PRMT5 facilitated IRES-dependent translation of <i>Wt1</i> mRNA by methylating HnRNPA1. Moreover, the upregulation of steroidogenic genes in <i>Prmt5</i>-deficient granulosa cells was repressed by <i>Wt1 </i>overexpression. These results demonstrate PRMT5 participates in granulosa cell lineage maintenance by inducing <i>Wt1</i> expression. Our study uncovers a new role of post-translational arginine methylation in granulosa cell differentiation and follicle development.

                Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) remains an incurable neurodegenerative disease. The most frequent missense mutations in familial PD occur in the highly conserved LRRK2/PARK8 gene. Both fly and mouse models of PD carrying the LRRK2 transgene with a dominant G2019S mutation exhibit locomotion defects and loss of dopaminergic neurons. Gastrodia elata Blume (GE) is an herbal medicine traditionally used to treat neurological diseases and has been reported to have neuroprotective effects in toxin-induced PD models. However, the underpinning molecular mechanisms of GE beneficiary to G2019S-induced PD remain unclear. Methods: We pharmacologically treated the Drosophila G2019S model with water extract of GE (WGE) to evaluate the neuroprotective and locomotion-improving effects. The biochemical analyses and genetic manipulations were further applied to dissect the potential molecular pathways involved in WGE treatment. We also validated the effects and mechanisms of WGE in a G2019S transgenic mouse model. Results: We show that these G2019S mutant flies fed with WGE showed improved locomotion and stable dopaminergic neurons. WGE suppressed the accumulation and hyperactivation of G2019S mutant protein in dopaminergic neurons, and activated the antioxidation and detoxification factor Nrf2 in glia. Activated Nrf2 antagonizes G2019S-induced Mad/Smad signaling in glia. The effects of WGE on the Drosophila G2019S model were recapitulated in a G2019S transgenic mouse. Conclusion: We conclude that WGE prevents locomotion defects and the neuronal loss induced by G2019S mutation via glial Nrf2 upregulation, unveiling a potential therapeutic avenue for PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Amphetamine alters the Reward Positivity in humans and mice</a></h4>

              
                The development of pro-cognitive therapeutics for psychiatric disorders has been beset with difficulties. This is in part due to the absence of pharmacologically-sensitive cognitive biomarkers common to humans and rodents. Here, we describe a cross-species translational measure of reward processing that is sensitive to the dopamine agonist, d-amphetamine. Motivated by human electroencephalographic (EEG) findings, we recently reported that frontal midline delta-band power is also an electrophysiological biomarker of reward surprise in mice. Here, we determined the impact on this reward-related EEG response from humans (n=23) and mice (n=28) performing a probabilistic learning task under parametric doses of d-amphetamine (human: placebo, 10 mg, 20 mg; mice: placebo, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg.kg, 1.0 mg/kg). In humans, d-amphetamine boosted the Reward Positivity event-related potential (ERP) component as well as the spectral delta-band representation of this signal. In mice, only the Reward Positivity ERP component was significantly boosted by d-amphetamine. In sum, the present results confirm the role of dopamine in the generation of the Reward Positivity, and support the first pharmacologically valid biomarker of reward sensitivity across species.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatial Analysis of Neural Cell Proteomic Profiles following Ischemic Stroke in Mice using High-Plex Digital Spatial Profiling</a></h4>

              
                Stroke is ranked as the fifth leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability. The progression of neuronal damage after stroke is recognized to be a complex integration of glia, neurons, and the surrounding extracellular matrix, therefore potential treatments must target the detrimental effects created by these interactions. In this study, we examined the spatial cellular and neuroinflammatory mechanisms occurring early after ischemic stroke utilizing Nanostring Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) technology. Male C57bl/6 mice were subjected to photothrombotic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and sacrificed at three-days post-ischemia. Spatial distinction of the ipsilateral hemisphere was studied according to the regions of interest: the ischemic core, peri-infarct tissues, and peri-infarct normal tissue (PiNT) in comparison to the contralateral hemisphere. We demonstrated that the ipsilateral hemisphere initiates distinct spatial regulatory proteomic profiles with DSP technology that can be identified consistently with the immunohistochemical markers, FJB, GFAP, and Iba-1. The core border profile demonstrated an induction of neuronal death, apoptosis, autophagy, immunoreactivity, and early degenerative proteins. Most notably, the core border resulted in a decrease of the neuronal proteins Map2 and NeuN, an increase in the autophagy proteins BAG3 and CTSD, an increase in the microglial and peripheral immune invasion proteins Iba1, CD45, CD11b, and CD39, and an increase in the neurodegenerative proteins BACE1, APP, {beta} 1-42, ApoE, and hyperphosphorylated tau protein S-199. The peri-infarct region demonstrated increased astrocytic immunoreactivity, apoptotic, and neurodegenerative proteomic profile, with an increase in BAG3, GFAP, and hyperphosphorylated tau protein S-199. The PiNT region displayed minimal changes compared to the contralateral cortex with only an increase in GFAP. Overall, our data highlight the importance of identifying ischemic mechanisms in a spatial manner to understand the complex, dynamic interactions throughout ischemic progression and repair as well to introduce potential targets for successful therapeutic interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Instructions and experiential learning have similar impacts on pain and pain-related brain responses but produce dissociations in value-based reversal learning</a></h4>

              
                Recent data suggest that interactions between systems involved in higher order knowledge and associative learning drive responses during appetitive and aversive learning. However, it is unknown how these systems impact subjective responses, such as pain. We tested how instructions and reversal learning influence pain and pain-evoked brain activation. Healthy volunteers (n = 40) were either instructed about contingencies between cues and aversive outcomes or learned through experience in a paradigm where contingencies reversed three times. We measured predictive cue effects on pain and heat-evoked brain responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Predictive cues dynamically modulated pain perception as contingencies changed, regardless of whether participants received contingency instructions. Heat-evoked responses in the insula, anterior cingulate, and putamen updated as contingencies changed, whereas the periaqueductal gray and thalamus responded to initial contingencies throughout the task. Quantitative modeling revealed that expected value was shaped purely by instructions in the Instructed Group, whereas expected value updated dynamically in the Uninstructed Group as a function of error-based learning. These differences were accompanied by dissociations in the neural correlates of value-based learning in the rostral anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. These results show how predictions impact subjective pain. Moreover, imaging data delineate three types of networks involved in pain generation and value-based learning: those that respond to initial contingencies, those that update dynamically during feedback-driven learning as contingencies change, and those that are sensitive to instruction. Together, these findings provide multiple points of entry for therapies designs to impact pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reorganizations of latency structure within white matter from wakefulness to sleep</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies based on resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) data have revealed the existence of highly repro-ducible latency structure, reflecting the propagation of BOLD fMRI signals, in white matter (WM). Here, based on simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected from 35 healthy subjects who were instructed to sleep, we explored the alterations of propagations in WM across wakefulness and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stages. Lagged cross-covariance was computed among voxel-wise time series, followed by parabolic interpolation to determine the actual latency value in-between. In WM, regions including cerebellar peduncle, internal capsule, posterior thalamic radiation, genu of corpus callosum, and corona radiata, were found to change their temporal roles drastically, as revealed by applying linear mixed-effect model on voxel-wise latency projections across wakefulness and NREM sleep stages. Using these regions as seeds, further seed-based latency analysis revealed that variations of latency projections across different stages were underlain by inconsistent temporal shifts between each seed and the remaining part of WM. Finally, latency analysis on resting-state networks (RSNs), obtained by applying k-means clustering technique on group-level functional connectivity matrix, identified a path of signal propagations similar to previous findings in EEG during wakefulness, which propagated mainly from the brainstem upward to internal capsule and further to corona radiata. This path showed inter-RSN temporal reorganizations depending on the paired stages between which the brain transitioned, e.g., it changed, between internal capsule and corona radiata, from mainly unidirectional to clearly reciprocal when the brain transitioned from wakefulness to N3 stage. These findings suggested the functional role of BOLD signals in white matter as a slow process, dynamically modulated across wakefulness and NREM sleep stages, and involving in maintaining differ-ent levels of consciousness and cognitive processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optical mini-stroke of thalamic networks impairs sleep stability, topography and cognition.</a></h4>

              
                Modelling stroke in animals remains a challenge for translational research, especially for the infraction of small subcortical arteries. Using combined fibre optics and photothrombosis technologies, we developed a novel model of optically-induced infarcts (Opto-STROKE). Combining our model with electrophysiological recordings in freely-behaving mice, we studied early and late consequent patho-physiological changes in the dynamics of sleep-wake circuits and cognitive performance. Here, focusing on inducing Opto-STROKE lesions in the intralaminar thalamus (IL), which in humans cause severe impairments of arousal, cognition, and affective symptoms, our model recapitulated important deficits on sleep disorders presented in humans including arousal instability, concurrent to an augmented slow-wave activity and a reduction gamma power bands during wakefulness. Moreover, during NREM sleep, spindle density was decreased and topographically shifted to frontal cortices when compared to control animals. Remarkably, gamma power and spindle density were correlated with decreased pain threshold and impaired prefrontal cortex- dependent working memory in Opto-STROKE mice relative to controls. Collectively, our combined method influences both anatomical and functional outcomes of the classical stroke procedures and offers new insights on the fundamental role of the media thalamus as a hub for the regulation of both sleep-wake architecture and cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anterior thalamic nuclei neurons sustain memory</a></h4>

              
                A hippocampal-diencephalic-cortical network supports memory function. The anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) form a key anatomical hub within this system. Consistent with this, injury to the mammillary body-ATN axis is associated with examples of clinical amnesia. However, there is only limited and indirect support that the output of ATN neurons actively enhances memory. Here, in rats, we first showed that mammillothalamic tract (MTT) lesions caused a persistent impairment in spatial working memory. MTT lesions also reduced rhythmic electrical activity across the memory system. Next, we introduced 8.5 Hz optogenetic theta-burst stimulation of the ATN glutamatergic neurons. The exogenously-triggered, regular pattern of stimulation produced an acute and substantial improvement of spatial working memory in rats with MTT lesions and enhanced rhythmic electrical activity. Neither behaviour nor rhythmic activity was affected by endogenous stimulation derived from the dorsal hippocampus. Analysis of immediate early gene activity, after the rats foraged for food in an open field, showed that exogenously-triggered ATN stimulation also increased Zif268 expression across memory-related structures. These findings provide clear evidence that increased ATN neuronal activity supports memory. They suggest that ATN-focused gene therapy may be feasible to counter clinical amnesia associated with dysfunction in the mammillary body-ATN axis.

                The precise organization of fine scale molecular architecture is critical for the nervous system and other biological functions and would benefit from nanoscopic imaging methods with improved accessibility, throughput, and native tissue compatibility. Here, we report RAIN-STORM, a rapid and scalable imaging approach that enables three-dimensional nanoscale target visualization for multiple subcellular and intracellular targets within tissue at depth. RAIN-STORM utilizes conventional tissue samples, readily available reagents in optimized formulas, requires no specialized sample handling, and is suitable for commercial instrumentation. To illustrate RAIN-STORMs ability for quantitative high-resolution nanoscopic tissue imaging, we utilized the well-organized but structurally complex retina. We show that RAIN-STORM is rapid and versatile, enabling 3D nanoscopic imaging of over 20 distinct targets to reveal known and novel nanoscale features of synapses, neurons, glia, and vascular. Further, imaging parameters are compatible with a wide range of tissue sources and molecular targets across a spectrum of biological structures. Finally, we show that this method can be applied to clinically derived samples and reveal the nanoscale distribution of molecular targets within human samples. RAIN-STORM thus enables rapid 3D imaging for a range of molecules, paving the way for high throughput studies of nanoscopic molecular features in intact tissue from diverse sources.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Increased 20-HETE signaling suppresses neurovascular coupling after ischemic stroke in regions beyond the infarct</a></h4>

              
                Neurovascular coupling, the process by which neuronal activity elicits increases in the local blood supply, is impaired in stroke patients in brain regions outside the infarct. Such impairment may contribute to neurological deterioration over time, but its mechanism is unknown. Using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke, we show that neuronal activity-evoked capillary dilation is reduced by ~75% in the intact cortical tissue outside the infarct border. This decrease in capillary responsiveness was not explained by a decrease in local neuronal activity or a loss of vascular contractility. Inhibiting synthesis of the vasoconstrictive molecule 20-HETE, either by inhibiting its synthetic enzyme CYP450 {omega}-hydroxylases or by increasing nitric oxide (NO), which is a natural inhibitor of {omega}-hydroxylases, rescued activity-evoked capillary dilation. The capillary dilation unmasked by inhibiting 20-HETE was dependent on PGE2 activation of EP4 receptors, a vasodilatory pathway previously identified in healthy animals. Cortical 20-HETE levels were increased following MCAO, in agreement with data from stroke patients. Inhibition of {omega}-hydroxylases normalized 20-HETE levels in vivo and increased cerebral blood flow in the peri-infarct cortex. These data identify 20-HETE-dependent vasoconstriction as a mechanism underlying neurovascular coupling impairment after stroke. Our results suggest that the brain's energy supply may be significantly reduced after stroke in regions previously believed to be asymptomatic and that {omega}-hydroxylase inhibition may restore healthy neurovascular coupling post-stroke.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effects of the NMDAR co-agonist D-serine on the structure and function of the optic tectum</a></h4>

              
                The N-methyl-D-aspartate type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) is a molecular coincidence detector which converts correlated patterns of neuronal activity into cues for the structural and functional refinement of developing circuits in the brain. D-serine is an endogenous co-agonist of the NMDAR. In this study, we investigated the effects of potent enhancement of NMDAR-mediated currents by chronic administration of saturating levels of D-serine on the developing Xenopus retinotectal circuit. Chronic exposure to the NMDAR co-agonist D-serine resulted in structural and functional changes to the optic tectum. D-serine administration affected synaptogenesis and dendritic morphology in recently differentiated tectal neurons, resulting in increased arbor compaction, reduced branch dynamics, and higher synapse density. These effects were not observed in more mature neurons. Calcium imaging to examine retinotopic map organization revealed that tectal neurons of animals raised in D-serine had sharper visual receptive fields . These findings suggest that the availability of endogenous NMDAR co-agonists like D-serine at glutamatergic synapses may regulate the refinement of circuits in the developing brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mitochondrial dysfunction compromises ciliary homeostasis in astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Reactive astrogliosis is a key component of neurological diseases. However, the active roles of astrocytes in pathogenic mechanisms and the involved molecular pathways are insufficiently understood. Here, we show that mitochondrial DNA depletion in astrocytes, causing mitochondrial spongiotic encephalopathy in mice, challenges the maintenance of primary cilium, the major cellular sensory organelle, which relays external signals to intracellular pathways. We show that mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in astrocytes induces FOXJ1 and RFX transcription factors, the master regulators of motile ciliogenesis, and consequently an aberrant nuclear expression program of motile cilia components. While the astrocytes still retain their single primary cilia, these organelles elongate and become remarkably distorted. Yet, respiratory chain deficiency in multiciliated ependymal cells does not cause overt cilia morphology defects. Collectively, our evidence points to an active signaling axis between astrocyte mitochondria and primary cilia. Furthermore, our data introduce metabolic ciliopathy as a pathomechanism for mitochondria-related neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term precision editing of neural circuits using engineered gap junction hemichannels</a></h4>

              
                The coordination of activity between brain cells is a key determinant of neural circuit function; nevertheless, approaches that selectively regulate communication between two distinct cellular components of a circuit, while leaving the activity of the presynaptic brain cell undisturbed remain sparce. To address this gap, we developed a novel class of electrical synapses by selectively engineering two connexin proteins found in Morone americana (white perch fish): connexin34.7 (Cx34.7) and connexin35 (Cx35). By iteratively exploiting protein mutagenesis, a novel in vitro assay of connexin docking, and computational modeling of connexin hemichannel interactions, we uncovered the pattern of structural motifs that broadly determine connexin hemichannel docking. We then utilized this knowledge to design Cx34.7 and Cx35 hemichannels that dock with each other, but not with themselves nor other major connexins expressed in the human central nervous system. We validated these hemichannels in vivo, demonstrating that they facilitate communication between two neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans and recode a learned behavioral preference. This system can be applied to edit circuits composed by pairs of genetically defined brain cell types across multiple species. Thus, we establish a potentially translational approach, Long-term integration of Circuits using connexins (LinCx), for context-precise circuit-editing with unprecedented spatiotemporal specificity.

                This report provides a review of our submissions to the Algonauts Challenge 2021. In this challenge, neural responses in the visual cortex were recorded using functional neuroimaging when participants were watching naturalistic videos. The goal of the challenge is to develop voxel-wise encoding models which predict such neural signals based on the input videos. Here we built an ensemble of models that extract representations based on the input videos from 4 perspectives: image streams, motion, edges, and audio. We showed that adding new modules into the ensemble consistently improved our prediction performance. Our methods achieved state-of-the-art performance on both the mini track and the full track tasks.

	<p>Background. The COVID-19 lockdown determined important changes in the sleep of a large percentage of the world population. We assessed the modifications of reported sleep patterns and disturbances in Italian children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD), compared to control children, before and during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy. Methods. Parents of 100 ASD, 236 ADHD patients, and 340 healthy children filled out an anonymous online survey and a modified version of the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC), advertised via social media, to evaluate sleep patterns and disturbances of their children before and during the lockdown. Results. Before the lockdown, bedtime and risetime were not different between the three groups. During the lockdown, ADHD children tended to have a later bedtime and risetime than ASD and controls, while ASD children tended to maintain similar bedtime and risetime. Overall, during the lockdown, a reduced sleep duration significantly differentiated clinical groups from controls. Anxiety at bedtime, difficulties in falling asleep, and daytime sleepiness increased in all groups during the lockdown. Hypnic jerks, rhythmic movement disorders, night awakenings, restless sleep, sleepwalking, and daytime sleepiness increased in ASD and ADHD patients, in particular. Conclusions. This is the first study comparing sleep habits and disorders in ASD and ADHD during the lockdown showing specific differences consistent with the core characteristics of two neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

	<p>In the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, several research studies focused on understanding the damage to the respiratory and circulatory systems. However, the evidence of neurological manifestations as part of the clinical spectrum of the disease has increased. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the potential association of neurological disorders with concomitant COVID-19 infection. We reviewed 101 patients (mean age, 70.05 years; 62.37% men) diagnosed with different neurological disorders and COVID-19 who were referred to the Department of Neurology between March 2020 and May 2021. The protocol included demographic, clinical, and neuroimagistic features, biochemical evaluation data, and prognosis. In the first group of patients with non-severe COVID-19 infection (&amp;amp;lt;50% lung damage), we enrolled 75 cases (mean age, 69.13 years; 65.33% men), and the second group, with 26 patients (mean age, 72.69 years; 53.84% men), developed severe COVID-19 infection (&amp;amp;gt;50% lung damage). Severe COVID-19 infection was significantly correlated with an increased highly sensitive C-reactive protein level (hsCRP) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), lactate dehydrogenase level (LDH) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), D-dimer (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), fibrinogen level (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and blood glucose (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) when compared to the first group. These biochemical parameters were increased in both groups, but the levels were much higher in the second group. Headaches (72.27%) and dizziness (14.85%) were present in the early stage of infection. Cerebrovascular events were also reported: ischemic stroke (48% vs. 57.69%; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), cerebral hemorrhage (4.95%), and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (1.98%). Encephalitis (1.98%) and Guillain–Barré Syndrome (1.98%) were found but less frequently. Cranial nerve abnormalities were statistically more common in the non-severe group: anosmia (32% vs. 26.92%; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), dysgeusia/ageusia (48% vs. 42.30%; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), impaired eye movement (1.33% vs. 0%), and facial nerve palsy (2.66% vs. 0%). Seizures (13.33% vs. 11.53%; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and a depressed level of consciousness (31.68%) occurred commonly. We detected the neuropsychiatric symptoms of anxiety (23.76%) and depression (14.85%). Mortality was increased in both groups but was much higher in the second group (46.15% vs. 21.33%). Neurological complications during COVID-19 infection are common in hospitalized patients, but the mechanism of these complications is not fully understood, representing a continuous challenge for neurologists.</p>

	<p>Group cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is a 7-week activity-based non-pharmacological intervention for people with mild to moderate dementia. Despite consistent evidence of clinical efficacy, the cognitive and brain mechanisms of CST remain unclear. Theoretically, group CST as a person-centred approach may work through promoting social interaction and personhood, executive function, and language use, especially in people with higher brain/cognitive reserve. To explore these putative mechanisms, structural MRI and resting-state functional MRI data were collected from 16 people with mild dementia before and after receiving CST, and in 13 dementia controls who received treatment as usual (TAU). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) analyses were performed. Compared with TAU, the CST group maintained the total brain volume/total intracranial volume (TBV/TICV) ratio. Increased rs-FC in the default mode network (DMN) in the posterior cingulate cortex and bilateral parietal cortices nodes was observed in the CST over TAU groups between pre- and post-intervention timepoints. We provided preliminary evidence that CST maintains/enhances brain reserve both structurally and functionally. Considering the role of DMN in episodic memory retrieval and mental self-representation, preservation of personhood may be an important mechanism of CST for further investigation.</p>

	<p>Background: Intracranial dermoid cyst is a rare, benign, nonneoplastic tumor-like lesion that could cause seizures, headache, and hydrocephalus. We hypothesized that the temporal lobe dermoid cyst in combination with other factors were causing the epileptic seizure. Methods: We encountered a 17-year-old girl with anti-seizure medication-resistant epilepsy secondary to dermoid cyst located in the temporal region depicted on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). She showed neither symptoms of meningitis nor rupture of the cyst according to serial MRI. We hypothesized that temporal lobe dermoid cyst in combination with other factors, such as focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), etc., was causing epileptic seizures in this case. She underwent dermoid cyst removal surgery with resection of the tip of the antero-inferior temporal lobe. Results: Histopathological study showed multiple small intramedullary dermoid cysts in the left antero-inferior temporal lobe in addition to MRI lesions and FCD. Conclusion: A patient with medically intractable epilepsy secondary to left temporal lobe dermoid cyst showed multiple intramedullary dermoid cysts and focal cortical dysplasia that might have interacted to create epileptogenicity. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of dermoid cyst concomitant with FCD.</p>

	<p>Loneliness is a prevalent condition with adverse effects on physical and mental health. Evolutionary theories suggest it evolved to drive people to reconnect. However, chronic loneliness may result in a negative social bias and self-preservation behaviors, paradoxically driving individuals away from social interactions. Lonely people often feel they are not close to anyone; however, little is known about their interpersonal distance preferences. During COVID-19, many experienced situational loneliness related to actual social isolation. Therefore, there was a unique opportunity to examine both chronic and situational (COVID-19-related) loneliness. In the present study, 479 participants completed an online task that experimentally assessed interpersonal distance preferences in four conditions—passively being approached by a friend or a stranger, and actively approaching a friend or a stranger. Results show that high chronic loneliness was related to a greater preferred distance across conditions. Intriguingly, by contrast, high COVID-19-related loneliness was related to a smaller preferred distance across conditions. These findings provide further support for the evolutionary theory of loneliness: situational loneliness indeed seems to drive people towards reconnection, while chronic loneliness seems to drive people away from it. Implications for the amelioration of chronic loneliness are discussed based on these findings.</p>

                <p>Conformational changes within biological macromolecules control a vast array of chemical reactions in living cells. Time-resolved crystallography can reveal time-dependent structural changes that occur within protein crystals, yielding chemical insights in unparalleled detail. Serial crystallography approaches developed at x-ray free-electron lasers are now routinely used for time-resolved diffraction studies of macromolecules. These techniques are increasingly being applied at synchrotron radiation sources and to a growing diversity of macromolecules. Here, we review recent progress in the field, including visualizing ultrafast structural changes that guide the initial trajectories of light-driven reactions as well as capturing biologically important conformational changes on slower time scales, for which bacteriorhodopsin and photosystem II are presented as illustrative case studies.</p>

                <p>Protein kinase activity must be precisely regulated, but how a cell governs hyperactive kinases remains unclear. In this study, we generated a constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase DYF-5 (DYF-5CA) in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> that disrupted sensory cilia. Genetic suppressor screens identified that mutations of ADR-2, an RNA adenosine deaminase, rescued ciliary phenotypes of <I>dyf-5CA</I>. We found that <I>dyf-5CA</I> animals abnormally transcribed antisense RNAs that pair with <I>dyf-5CA</I> messenger RNA (mRNA) to form double-stranded RNA, recruiting ADR-2 to edit the region ectopically. RNA editing impaired <I>dyf-5CA</I> mRNA splicing, and the resultant intron retentions blocked DYF-5CA protein translation and activated nonsense-mediated <I>dyf-5CA</I> mRNA decay. The kinase RNA editing requires kinase hyperactivity. The similar RNA editing&ndash;dependent feedback regulation restricted the other ciliary kinases NEKL-4/NEK10 and DYF-18/CCRK, which suggests a widespread mechanism that underlies kinase regulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Chimeric spike mRNA vaccines protect against Sarbecovirus challenge in mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 highlights the need to develop universal vaccination strategies against the broader <I>Sarbecovirus</I> subgenus. Using chimeric spike designs, we demonstrate protection against challenge from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351, bat CoV (Bt-CoV) RsSHC014, and a heterologous Bt-CoV WIV-1 in vulnerable aged mice. Chimeric spike messenger RNAs (mRNAs) induced high levels of broadly protective neutralizing antibodies against high-risk Sarbecoviruses. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination not only showed a marked reduction in neutralizing titers against heterologous Sarbecoviruses, but SARS-CoV and WIV-1 challenge in mice resulted in breakthrough infections. Chimeric spike mRNA vaccines efficiently neutralized D614G, mink cluster five, and the UK B.1.1.7 and South African B.1.351 variants of concern. Thus, multiplexed-chimeric spikes can prevent SARS-like zoonotic coronavirus infections with pandemic potential.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Identification of a quality-control factor that monitors failures during proteasome assembly</a></h4>

              
                <p>In eukaryotic cells, half of all proteins function as subunits within multiprotein complexes. Imbalanced synthesis of subunits leads to unassembled intermediates that must be degraded to minimize cellular toxicity. Here, we found that excess PSMC5, a subunit of the proteasome base, was targeted for degradation by the HERC1 ubiquitin ligase in mammalian cells. HERC1 identified unassembled PSMC5 by its cognate assembly chaperone PAAF1. Because PAAF1 only dissociates after assembly, HERC1 could also engage later assembly intermediates such as the PSMC4-PSMC5-PAAF1 complex. A missense mutant of HERC1 that causes neurodegeneration in mice was impaired in the recognition and ubiquitination of the PSMC5-PAAF1 complex. Thus, proteasome assembly factors can serve as adaptors for ubiquitin ligases to facilitate elimination of unassembled intermediates and maintain protein homeostasis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Photomediated ring contraction of saturated heterocycles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Saturated heterocycles are found in numerous therapeutics and bioactive natural products and are abundant in many medicinal and agrochemical compound libraries. To access new chemical space and function, many methods for functionalization on the periphery of these structures have been developed. Comparatively fewer methods are known for restructuring their core framework. Herein, we describe a visible light&ndash;mediated ring contraction of &alpha;-acylated saturated heterocycles. This unconventional transformation is orthogonal to traditional ring contractions, challenging the paradigm for diversification of heterocycles including piperidine, morpholine, thiane, tetrahydropyran, and tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives. The success of this Norrish type II variant rests on reactivity differences between photoreactive ketone groups in specific chemical environments. This strategy was applied to late-stage remodeling of pharmaceutical derivatives, peptides, and sugars.</p>

                <p>Materials with multiple superconducting phases are rare. Here, we report the discovery of two-phase unconventional superconductivity in CeRh<SUB>2</SUB>As<SUB>2</SUB>. Using thermodynamic probes, we establish that the superconducting critical field of its high-field phase is as high as 14 tesla, even though the transition temperature is only 0.26 kelvin. Furthermore, a transition between two different superconducting phases is observed in a <I>c</I> axis magnetic field. Local inversion-symmetry breaking at the cerium sites enables Rashba spin-orbit coupling alternating between the cerium sublayers. The staggered Rashba coupling introduces a layer degree of freedom to which the field-induced transition and high critical field seen in experiment are likely related.</p>

                <p>The thermal conductivity of crystalline materials cannot be arbitrarily low, as the intrinsic limit depends on the phonon dispersion. We used complementary strategies to suppress the contribution of the longitudinal and transverse phonons to heat transport in layered materials that contain different types of intrinsic chemical interfaces. BiOCl and Bi<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>Se encapsulate these design principles for longitudinal and transverse modes, respectively, and the bulk superlattice material Bi<SUB>4</SUB>O<SUB>4</SUB>SeCl<SUB>2</SUB> combines these effects by ordering both interface types within its unit cell to reach an extremely low thermal conductivity of 0.1 watts per kelvin per meter at room temperature along its stacking direction. This value comes within a factor of four of the thermal conductivity of air. We demonstrated that chemical control of the spatial arrangement of distinct interfaces can synergically modify vibrational modes to minimize thermal conductivity.</p>

                <p>Skin electronics require stretchable conductors that satisfy metallike conductivity, high stretchability, ultrathin thickness, and facile patternability, but achieving these characteristics simultaneously is challenging. We present a float assembly method to fabricate a nanomembrane that meets all these requirements. The method enables a compact assembly of nanomaterials at the water&ndash;oil interface and their partial embedment in an ultrathin elastomer membrane, which can distribute the applied strain in the elastomer membrane and thus lead to a high elasticity even with the high loading of the nanomaterials. Furthermore, the structure allows cold welding and bilayer stacking, resulting in high conductivity. These properties are preserved even after high-resolution patterning by using photolithography. A multifunctional epidermal sensor array can be fabricated with the patterned nanomembranes.</p>

                <p>The long-term effects of climate change on biodiversity and biogeographic patterns are uncertain. There are known relationships between geographic area and both the number of species and the number of ecological functional groups&mdash;termed the species-area relationship and the functional diversity&ndash;area relationship, respectively. We show that there is a positive relationship between the number of species in an area, the number of ecological functional groups, and oceanic temperature in the shallow-marine fossil record of New Zealand over a time span of ~40 million years. One implication of this relationship is that functional redundancy increases with temperature. This reveals a long-lived and persistent association between the spatial structuring of biodiversity, the temperature-dependence of functional redundancy, and shallow-marine biodiversity in mid-latitudes.</p>

                <p>Biological mechanisms underlying human germline mutations remain largely unknown. We statistically decompose variation in the rate and spectra of mutations along the genome using volume-regularized nonnegative matrix factorization. The analysis of a sequencing dataset (TOPMed) reveals nine processes that explain the variation in mutation properties between loci. We provide a biological interpretation for seven of these processes. We associate one process with bulky DNA lesions that are resolved asymmetrically with respect to transcription and replication. Two processes track direction of replication fork and replication timing, respectively. We identify a mutagenic effect of active demethylation primarily acting in regulatory regions and a mutagenic effect of long interspersed nuclear elements. We localize a mutagenic process specific to oocytes from population sequencing data. This process appears transcriptionally asymmetric.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Insolation triggered abrupt weakening of Atlantic circulation at the end of interglacials</a></h4>

              
                <p>Abrupt cooling is observed at the end of interglacials in many paleoclimate records, but the mechanism responsible remains unclear. Using model simulations, we demonstrate that there exists a threshold in the level of astronomically induced insolation below which abrupt changes at the end of interglacials of the past 800,000 years occur. When decreasing insolation reaches the critical value, it triggers a strong, abrupt weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and a cooler mean climate state accompanied by high-amplitude variations lasting for several thousand years. The mechanism involves sea ice feedbacks in the Nordic and Labrador Seas. The ubiquity of this threshold suggests its fundamental role in terminating the warm climate conditions at the end of interglacials.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Enterococcus peptidoglycan remodeling promotes checkpoint inhibitor cancer immunotherapy</a></h4>

              
                <p>The antitumor efficacy of cancer immunotherapy can correlate with the presence of certain bacterial species within the gut microbiome. However, many of the molecular mechanisms that influence host response to immunotherapy remain elusive. In this study, we show that members of the bacterial genus <I>Enterococcus</I> improve checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in mouse tumor models. Active enterococci express and secrete orthologs of the NlpC/p60 peptidoglycan hydrolase SagA that generate immune-active muropeptides. Expression of SagA in nonprotective <I>E. faecalis</I> was sufficient to promote immunotherapy response, and its activity required the peptidoglycan sensor NOD2. Notably, SagA-engineered probiotics or synthetic muropeptides also augmented anti&ndash;PD-L1 antitumor efficacy. Taken together, our data suggest that microbiota species with specialized peptidoglycan remodeling activity and muropeptide-based therapeutics may enhance cancer immunotherapy and could be leveraged as next-generation adjuvants.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Geometric deep learning of RNA structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>RNA molecules adopt three-dimensional structures that are critical to their function and of interest in drug discovery. Few RNA structures are known, however, and predicting them computationally has proven challenging. We introduce a machine learning approach that enables identification of accurate structural models without assumptions about their defining characteristics, despite being trained with only 18 known RNA structures. The resulting scoring function, the Atomic Rotationally Equivariant Scorer (ARES), substantially outperforms previous methods and consistently produces the best results in community-wide blind RNA structure prediction challenges. By learning effectively even from a small amount of data, our approach overcomes a major limitation of standard deep neural networks. Because it uses only atomic coordinates as inputs and incorporates no RNA-specific information, this approach is applicable to diverse problems in structural biology, chemistry, materials science, and beyond.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Prenatal maternal infection promotes tissue-specific immunity and inflammation in offspring</a></h4>

              
                <p>The immune system has evolved in the face of microbial exposure. How maternal infection experienced at distinct developmental stages shapes the offspring immune system remains poorly understood. Here, we show that during pregnancy, maternally restricted infection can have permanent and tissue-specific impacts on offspring immunity. Mechanistically, maternal interleukin-6 produced in response to infection can directly impose epigenetic changes on fetal intestinal epithelial stem cells, leading to long-lasting impacts on intestinal immune homeostasis. As a result, offspring of previously infected dams develop enhanced protective immunity to gut infection and increased inflammation in the context of colitis. Thus, maternal infection can be coopted by the fetus to promote long-term, tissue-specific fitness, a phenomenon that may come at the cost of predisposition to inflammatory disorders.</p>

                <p>Organ development is orchestrated by cell- and time-specific gene regulatory networks. In this study, we investigated the regulatory basis of mouse cerebellum development from early neurogenesis to adulthood. By acquiring snATAC-seq (single-nucleus assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing) profiles for ~90,000 cells spanning 11 stages, we mapped cerebellar cell types and identified candidate cis<I>-</I>regulatory elements (CREs). We detected extensive spatiotemporal heterogeneity among progenitor cells and a gradual divergence in the regulatory programs of cerebellar neurons during differentiation. Comparisons to vertebrate genomes and snATAC-seq profiles for ~20,000 cerebellar cells from the marsupial opossum revealed a shared decrease in CRE conservation during development and differentiation as well as differences in constraint between cell types. Our work delineates the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of gene regulation in cerebellar cells and provides insights into mammalian organ development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Airborne transmission of respiratory viruses</a></h4>

              
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of and a need to update the traditional view of transmission pathways for respiratory viruses. The long-standing definitions of droplet and airborne transmission do not account for the mechanisms by which virus-laden respiratory droplets and aerosols travel through the air and lead to infection. In this Review, we discuss current evidence regarding the transmission of respiratory viruses by aerosols&mdash;how they are generated, transported, and deposited, as well as the factors affecting the relative contributions of droplet-spray deposition versus aerosol inhalation as modes of transmission. Improved understanding of aerosol transmission brought about by studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection requires a reevaluation of the major transmission pathways for other respiratory viruses, which will allow better-informed controls to reduce airborne transmission.</p>

                Rapid technological advances in the past decades have enabled molecular biologists to generate large-scale and complex data with affordable resource investments, or obtain such data from public repositories. Yet, many graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and senior researchers in the biosciences find themselves ill-equipped to analyze large-scale data. Global surveys have revealed that active researchers prefer short training workshops to fill their skill gaps. In this article, we focus on the challenge of delivering a short data analysis workshop to absolute beginners in computer programming. We propose that introducing R or other programming languages for data analysis as smart versions of calculators can help lower the communication barrier with absolute beginners. We describe this comparison with a few analogies and hope that other instructors will find them useful. We utilized these in our four-hour long training workshops involving participatory live coding, which we delivered in person and via videoconferencing. Anecdotal evidence suggests that our exposition made R programming seem easy and enabled beginners to explore it on their own.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Calcium imaging analysis – how far have we come? [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Techniques for calcium imaging were first demonstrated in the mid-1970s, whilst tools to analyse these markers of cellular activity are still being developed and improved today. For image analysis, custom tools were developed within labs and until relatively recently, software packages were not widely available between researchers. We will discuss some of the most popular methods for calcium imaging analysis that are now widely available and describe why these protocols are so effective. We will also describe some of the newest innovations in the field that are likely to benefit researchers, particularly as calcium imaging is often an inherently low signal-to-noise method. Although calcium imaging analysis has seen recent advances, particularly following the rise of machine learning, we will end by highlighting the outstanding requirements and questions that hinder further progress and pose the question of how far we have come in the past sixty years and what can be expected for future development in the field.
