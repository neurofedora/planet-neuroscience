              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06843">Universal scale-free representations in human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.06843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How does the human visual cortex encode sensory information? To address this question, we explore the covariance structure of neural representations. We perform a cross-decomposition analysis of fMRI responses to natural images in multiple individuals from the Natural Scenes Dataset and find that neural representations systematically exhibit a power-law covariance spectrum over four orders of magnitude in ranks. This scale-free structure is found in multiple regions along the visual hierarchy, pointing to the existence of a generic encoding strategy in visual cortex. We also show that, up to a rotation, a large ensemble of principal axes of these population codes are shared across subjects, showing the existence of a universal high-dimensional representation. This suggests a high level of convergence in how the human brain learns to represent natural scenes despite individual differences in neuroanatomy and experience. We further demonstrate that a spectral approach is critical for characterizing population codes in their full extent, and in doing so, we reveal a vast space of uncharted dimensions that have been out of reach for conventional variance-weighted methods. A global view of neural representations thus requires embracing their high-dimensional nature and understanding them statistically rather than through visual or semantic interpretation of individual dimensions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06716">Detailed delineation of the fetal brain in diffusion MRI via multi-task learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.06716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-weighted MRI is increasingly used to study the normal and abnormal development of fetal brain in-utero. Recent studies have shown that dMRI can offer invaluable insights into the neurodevelopmental processes in the fetal stage. However, because of the low data quality and rapid brain development, reliable analysis of fetal dMRI data requires dedicated computational methods that are currently unavailable. The lack of automated methods for fast, accurate, and reproducible data analysis has seriously limited our ability to tap the potential of fetal brain dMRI for medical and scientific applications. In this work, we developed and validated a unified computational framework to (1) segment the brain tissue into white matter, cortical/subcortical gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid, (2) segment 31 distinct white matter tracts, and (3) parcellate the brain's cortex and delineate the deep gray nuclei and white matter structures into 96 anatomically meaningful regions. We utilized a set of manual, semi-automatic, and automatic approaches to annotate 97 fetal brains. Using these labels, we developed and validated a multi-task deep learning method to perform the three computations. Our evaluations show that the new method can accurately carry out all three tasks, achieving a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.865 on tissue segmentation, 0.825 on white matter tract segmentation, and 0.819 on parcellation. The proposed method can greatly advance the field of fetal neuroimaging as it can lead to substantial improvements in fetal brain tractography, tract-specific analysis, and structural connectivity assessment.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07373">Policy consequences of the new neuroeconomic framework</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.07373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current theories of decision making suggest that the neural circuits in mammalian brains (including humans) computationally combine representations of the past (memory), present (perception), and future (agentic goals) to take actions that achieve the needs of the agent. How information is represented within those neural circuits changes what computations are available to that system which changes how agents interact with their world to take those actions. We argue that the computational neuroscience of decision making provides a new microeconomic framework (neuroeconomics) that offers new opportunities to construct policies that interact with those decision-making systems to improve outcomes. After laying out the computational processes underlying decision making in mammalian brains, we present four applications of this logic with policy consequences: (1) contingency management as a treatment for addiction, (2) precommitment and the sensitivity to sunk costs, (3) media consequences for changes in housing prices after a disaster, and (4) how social interactions underlie the success (and failure) of microfinance institutions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06706">Discovering Long-Term Effects on Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.06706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) exhibit robust pattern recognition capabilities and share extensive similarities with the human brain, specifically Biological Neural Networks (BNNs). We are particularly intrigued by these models' ability to acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning. In this regard, Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) has gained widespread adoption as a substitute for full fine-tuning due to its cost reduction in training and mitigation of over-fitting risks by limiting the number of trainable parameters during adaptation. Since both ANNs and BNNs propagate information layer-by-layer, a common analogy can be drawn: weights in ANNs represent synapses in BNNs, while features (also known as latent variables or logits) in ANNs represent neurotransmitters released by neurons in BNNs. Mainstream PEFT methods aim to adjust feature or parameter values using only a limited number of trainable parameters (usually less than 1% of the total parameters), yet achieve surprisingly good results. Building upon this clue, we delve deeper into exploring the connections between feature adjustment and parameter adjustment, resulting in our proposed method Synapses & Neurons (SAN) that learns scaling matrices for features and propagates their effects towards posterior weight matrices. Our approach draws strong inspiration from well-known neuroscience phenomena - Long-term Potentiation (LTP) and Long-term Depression (LTD), which also reveal the relationship between synapse development and neurotransmitter release levels. We conducted extensive comparisons of PEFT on 26 datasets using attention-based networks as well as convolution-based networks, leading to significant improvements compared to other tuning methods (+8.5% over fully-finetune, +7% over Visual Prompt Tuning, and +3.2% over LoRA). The codes would be released.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07310">Optimizing Neural Network Performance and Interpretability with Diophantine Equation Encoding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.07310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of Diophantine equations into neural network (NN) architectures to improve model interpretability, stability, and efficiency. By encoding and decoding neural network parameters as integer solutions to Diophantine equations, we introduce a novel approach that enhances both the precision and robustness of deep learning models. Our method integrates a custom loss function that enforces Diophantine constraints during training, leading to better generalization, reduced error bounds, and enhanced resilience against adversarial attacks. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through several tasks, including image classification and natural language processing, where improvements in accuracy, convergence, and robustness are observed. This study offers a new perspective on combining mathematical theory and machine learning to create more interpretable and efficient models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10296">Engineering software 2.0 by Interpolating Neural Networks: Unifying Training, Solving, and Calibration</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.10296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and neural network theories has revolutionized the way software is programmed, shifting from a hard-coded series of codes, Software 1.0, to a vast neural network, Software 2.0. However, this transition in engineering software has faced challenges such as data scarcity, multi-modality of data, low model accuracy, and slow inference. Here, we propose a new network based on interpolation theories and tensor decomposition, the interpolating neural network (INN) to open the new era of Engineering Software 2.0 that unifies training, solving, and calibration. Instead of interpolating training data, a common notion in computer science, INN interpolates grid points in the physical space whose coordinates and values are trainable. INN features orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters (or degrees of freedom for solving), faster training/solving, less inference cost, smaller memory footprint, and higher model accuracy compared to multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or physics-informed neural networks (PINN). Various numerical experiments that cover computer science and engineering domains demonstrate that INN can solve over Zetta scale (10^{21}) partial differential equations and train/calibrate a dataset with extraordinary accuracy but fewer parameters using only a single graphics processing unit (GPU).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09210">On the Improvement of Generalization and Stability of Forward-Only Learning via Neural Polarization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.09210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forward-only learning algorithms have recently gained attention as alternatives to gradient backpropagation, replacing the backward step of this latter solver with an additional contrastive forward pass. Among these approaches, the so-called Forward-Forward Algorithm (FFA) has been shown to achieve competitive levels of performance in terms of generalization and complexity. Networks trained using FFA learn to contrastively maximize a layer-wise defined goodness score when presented with real data (denoted as positive samples) and to minimize it when processing synthetic data (corr. negative samples). However, this algorithm still faces weaknesses that negatively affect the model accuracy and training stability, primarily due to a gradient imbalance between positive and negative samples. To overcome this issue, in this work we propose a novel implementation of the FFA algorithm, denoted as Polar-FFA, which extends the original formulation by introducing a neural division (\emph{polarization}) between positive and negative instances. Neurons in each of these groups aim to maximize their goodness when presented with their respective data type, thereby creating a symmetric gradient behavior. To empirically gauge the improved learning capabilities of our proposed Polar-FFA, we perform several systematic experiments using different activation and goodness functions over image classification datasets. Our results demonstrate that Polar-FFA outperforms FFA in terms of accuracy and convergence speed. Furthermore, its lower reliance on hyperparameters reduces the need for hyperparameter tuning to guarantee optimal generalization capabilities, thereby allowing for a broader range of neural network configurations.

	<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with unknown etiology, resulting in various impairments that necessitate continuous rehabilitation to enhance functionality, quality of life, and motor function, including through Virtual Reality (VR) therapy. Comparing tasks in virtual environments and their potential skill transfer to real-world settings could aid in optimizing treatment programs to improve motor performance in individuals with MS. This study aimed to determine whether practicing acquisition and retention phases using two distinct interfaces (concrete&amp;amp;mdash;Touch Screen or abstract&amp;amp;mdash;Kinect system) affects performance in a subsequent task using a different interface (transfer phase). A randomized clinical trial was conducted with 56 volunteers with MS and 41 controls. Participants engaged in a computer game where they burst as many bubbles as possible within 10 s per attempt. After the acquisition and retention phases, all participants switched interfaces (e.g., those using Kinect switched to Touchscreen and vice versa). Significant performance improvements were observed in both groups during the acquisition phase, which were maintained in the retention phase. Although the abstract interface was more challenging for both groups, only the MS group that practiced with the abstract interface successfully transferred their improvements to the concrete interface. Thus, despite the increased difficulty of the abstract task during practice, it led to better performance transfer when required to complete a subsequent concrete task, suggesting that abstract devices may be beneficial in clinical practice for improving motor function in people with MS.</p>

                <p>The neural mechanisms of motor planning have been extensively studied in rodents. Preparatory activity in the frontal cortex predicts upcoming choice, but limitations of typical tasks have made it challenging to determine whether the spatial information is in a self-centered direction reference frame or a world-centered position reference frame. Here, we trained male rats to make delayed visually guided orienting movements to six different directions, with four different target positions for each direction, which allowed us to disentangle direction versus position tuning in neural activity. We recorded single unit activity from the rat frontal orienting field (FOF) in the secondary motor cortex, a region involved in planning orienting movements. Population analyses revealed that the FOF encodes two separate 2D maps of space. First, a 2D map of the planned and ongoing movement in a self-centered direction reference frame. Second, a 2D map of the animal&rsquo;s current position on the port wall in a world-centered reference frame. Thus, preparatory activity in the FOF represents self-centered upcoming movement directions, but FOF neurons multiplex both self- and world-reference frame variables at the level of single neurons. Neural network model comparison supports the view that despite the presence of world-centered representations, the FOF receives the target information as self-centered input and generates self-centered planning signals.</p>

                <p>The act of recalling memories can paradoxically lead to the forgetting of other associated memories, a phenomenon known as retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF). Inhibitory control mechanisms, primarily mediated by the prefrontal cortex, are thought to contribute to RIF. In this study, we examined whether stimulating the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) with transcranial direct current stimulation modulates RIF and investigated the associated electrophysiological correlates. In a randomized study, 50 participants (27 males and 23 females) received either real or sham stimulation before performing retrieval practice on target memories. After retrieval practice, a final memory test to assess RIF was administered. We found that stimulation selectively increased the retrieval accuracy of competing memories, thereby decreasing RIF, while the retrieval accuracy of target memories remained unchanged. The reduction in RIF was associated with a more pronounced beta desynchronization within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left-DLPFC), in an early time window (&lt;500&nbsp;ms) after cue onset during retrieval practice. This led to a stronger beta desynchronization within the parietal cortex in a later time window, an established marker for successful memory retrieval. Together, our results establish the causal involvement of the mPFC in actively suppressing competing memories and demonstrate that while forgetting arises as a consequence of retrieving specific memories, these two processes are functionally independent. Our findings suggest that stimulation potentially disrupted inhibitory control processes, as evidenced by reduced RIF and stronger beta desynchronization in fronto-parietal brain regions during memory retrieval, although further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying this effect.</p>

                <p>The cerebellum plays an important role in diverse brain functions, ranging from motor learning to cognition. Recent studies have suggested that molecular and cellular heterogeneity within cerebellar lobules contributes to functional differences across the cerebellum. However, the specific relationship between molecular and cellular heterogeneity and diverse functional outputs of different regions of the cerebellum remains unclear. Here, we describe a previously unappreciated form of synaptic heterogeneity at parallel fiber synapses to Purkinje cells in the mouse cerebellum (both sexes). In contrast to uniform fast synaptic transmission, we found that the properties of slow synaptic transmission varied by up to threefold across different lobules of the mouse cerebellum, resulting in surprising heterogeneity. Depending on the location of a Purkinje cell, the time of peak of slow synaptic currents varied by hundreds of milliseconds. The duration and decay time of these currents also spanned hundreds of milliseconds, based on lobule. We found that, as a consequence of the heterogeneous synaptic dynamics, the same brief input stimulus was transformed into prolonged firing patterns over a range of timescales that depended on Purkinje cell location.</p>

                <p>To test a Chinese character version of the phonemic verbal fluency task in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and assess the verbal fluency deficiency pattern in TLE with and without hippocampal sclerosis, a cross-sectional study was conducted including 30 patients with TLE and hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS), 28 patients with TLE and without hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-NHS), and 29 demographically matched healthy controls (HC). Both sexes were enrolled. Participants finished a Chinese character verbal fluency (VFC) task during functional MRI. The activation/deactivation maps, functional connectivity, degree centrality, and community features of the left frontal and temporal regions were compared. A neural network classification model was applied to differentiate TLE-HS and TLE-NHS using functional statistics. The VFC scores were correlated with semantic fluency in HC while correlated with phonemic fluency in TLE-NHS. Activation and deactivation deficiency was observed in TLE-HS and TLE-NHS (<I>p </I>&lt; 0.001, <I>k</I> &ge; 10). Functional connectivity, degree centrality, and community features of anterior inferior temporal gyri were impaired in TLE-HS and retained or even enhanced in TLE-NHS (<I>p </I>&lt; 0.05, FDR-corrected). The functional connectivity was correlated with phonemic fluency (<I>p </I>&lt; 0.05, FDR-corrected). The neural network classification reached an area under the curve of 0.90 in diagnosing hippocampal sclerosis. The VFC task is a Chinese phonemic verbal fluency task suitable for clinical application in TLE. During the VFC task, functional connectivity of phonemic circuits was impaired in TLE-HS and was enhanced in TLE-NHS, representing a compensative phonemic searching strategy applied by patients with TLE-NHS.</p>

                <p>Our repertoire of motor skills is filled with sequential movements that need to be performed in a specific order. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether the human hippocampus, a region known to support temporal order in non-motor memory, represents information about the order of sequential motor actions in human participants (both sexes). We also examined such representations in other regions of the motor network (i.e., the premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, anterior superior parietal lobule, and striatum) already known for their critical role in motor sequence learning. Results showed that the hippocampus represents information about movements in their learned temporal position in the sequence, but not about movements or temporal positions in random movement patterns. Other regions of the motor network coded for movements in their learned temporal position, as well as movements and positions in random movement patterns. Importantly, movement coding contributed to sequence learning patterns in primary, supplementary, and premotor cortices but not in striatal and parietal regions. Our findings deepen our understanding of how striatal and cortical regions contribute to motor sequence learning and point to the capacity of the hippocampus to represent movements in their temporal context, an ability possibly explaining its contribution to motor learning.</p>

                <p>Neuronal excitatory synapses are primarily located on small dendritic protrusions called spines. During synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through postsynaptic NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) initiates signaling pathways that coordinate changes in dendritic spine structure and synaptic function. During long-term potentiation (LTP), high levels of NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx promote increases in both synaptic strength and dendritic spine size through activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases. In contrast, during long-term depression (LTD), low levels of NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx promote decreased synaptic strength and spine shrinkage and elimination through activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN), which is anchored at synapses via the scaffold protein A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP)150. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the pathological agent amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) may impair learning and memory through biasing NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways toward LTD and spine elimination. By employing AKAP150 knock-in mice of both sexes with a mutation that disrupts CaN anchoring to AKAP150, we revealed that local, postsynaptic AKAP&ndash;CaN&ndash;LTD signaling was required for A&beta;-mediated impairment of NMDAR synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, inhibition of LTP, and dendritic spine loss. Additionally, we found that A&beta; acutely engages AKAP&ndash;CaN signaling through activation of G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) leading to dephosphorylation of NMDAR GluN2B subunits, which decreases Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to favor LTD over LTP, and cofilin, which promotes F-actin severing to destabilize dendritic spines. These findings reveal a novel interplay between NMDAR and mGluR1 signaling that converges on AKAP-anchored CaN to coordinate dephosphorylation of postsynaptic substrates linked to multiple aspects of A&beta;-mediated synaptic dysfunction.</p>

                <p>Although the locus ceruleus (LC) is recognized as a crucial modulator for attention and perception by releasing norepinephrine into various cortical regions, the impact of LC&ndash;noradrenergic (LC&ndash;NE) modulation on auditory discrimination behavior remains elusive. In this study, we firstly recorded local field potential and single-unit activity in multiple cortical regions associated with auditory&ndash;motor processing, including the auditory cortex, posterior parietal cortex, secondary motor cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), in response to optogenetic activation (40&nbsp;Hz and 0.5&nbsp;s) of the LC&ndash;NE neurons in awake mice (male). We found that phasic LC stimulation induced a persistent high gamma oscillation (50&ndash;80&nbsp;Hz) in the OFC. Phasic activation of LC&ndash;NE neurons also resulted in a corresponding increase in norepinephrine levels in the OFC, accompanied by a pupillary dilation response. Furthermore, when mice were performing a go/no-go auditory discrimination task, we optogeneticaly activated the neural projections from LC to OFC and revealed a shortened latency in behavioral responses to sound stimuli and an increased false alarm rate. These impulsive behavioral responses may be associated with the gamma neural activity in the OFC. These findings have broadened our understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in the role of LC in auditory&ndash;motor processing.</p>

                <p>For better decisions in social interactions, humans often must understand the thinking of others and predict their actions. Since such predictions are uncertain, multiple predictions may be necessary for better decision-making. However, the neural processes and computations underlying such social decision-making remain unclear. We investigated this issue by developing a behavioral paradigm and performing functional magnetic resonance imaging and computational modeling. In our task, female and male participants were required to predict others&rsquo; choices in order to make their own value-based decisions, as the outcome depended on others&rsquo; choices. Results showed, to make choices, the participants mostly relied on a value difference (primary) generated from the case where others would make a likely choice, but sometimes they additionally used another value difference (secondary) from the opposite case where others make an unlikely choice. We found that the activations in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) correlated with the primary difference while the activations in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rdlPFC) correlated with the secondary difference. Analysis of neural coupling and temporal dynamics suggested a three-step processing network, beginning with the left amygdala signals for predictions of others&rsquo; choices. Modulated by these signals, the PCC and rdlPFC reflect the respective value differences for self-decisions. Finally, the medial prefrontal cortex integrated these decision signals for a final decision. Our findings elucidate the neural process of constructing value-based decisions by predicting others and illuminate their key variables with social modulations, providing insight into the differential functional roles of these brain regions in this process.</p>

These findings were recapitulated in an FD mouse model and moreover, the FD mice had reduced intestinal motility, as did patients. To understand the cellular basis for impaired GI function in FD, the enteric nervous system (ENS; both female and male mice) from FD mouse models was analyzed during embryonic development and adulthood. We show here that not only is <I>Elp1</I> required for the normal formation of the ENS, but it is also required in adulthood for the regulation of both neuronal and non-neuronal cells and for target innervation in both the mucosa and in intestinal smooth muscle. In particular, CGRP innervation was significantly reduced as was the number of dopaminergic neurons. Examination of an FD patient's gastric biopsy also revealed reduced and disoriented axons in the mucosa. Finally, using an FD mouse model in which <I>Elp1</I> was deleted exclusively from neurons, we found significant changes to the colon epithelium including reduced E-cadherin expression, perturbed mucus layer organization, and infiltration of bacteria into the mucosa. The fact that deletion of <I>Elp1</I> exclusively in neurons is sufficient to alter the intestinal epithelium and perturb the intestinal epithelial barrier highlights a critical role for neurons in regulating GI epithelium homeostasis.</p>

                <p>During infancy and adolescence, language develops from a predominantly interhemispheric control&mdash;through the corpus callosum (CC)&mdash;to a predominantly intrahemispheric control, mainly subserved by the left arcuate fasciculus (AF). Using multimodal neuroimaging, we demonstrate that human left-handers (both male and female) with an atypical language lateralization show a rightward participation of language areas from the auditory cortex to the inferior frontal cortex when contrasting speech to tone perception and an enhanced interhemispheric anatomical and functional connectivity. Crucially, musicianship determines two different structural pathways to this outcome. Nonmusicians present a relation between atypical lateralization and intrahemispheric underdevelopment across the anterior AF, hinting at a dysregulation of the ontogenetic shift from an interhemispheric to an intrahemispheric brain. Musicians reveal an alternative pathway related to interhemispheric overdevelopment across the posterior CC and the auditory cortex. We discuss the heterogeneity in reaching atypical language lateralization and the relevance of early musical training in altering the normal development of language cognitive functions.</p>

                Chemoprophylactic prevention of veterinary heartworm disease in companion animals, caused by the vector-borne nematode parasite Dirofilaria immitis, is a multi-billion-dollar global market. Experimental use of cats and dogs in preclinical heartworm drug testing is increasing due to evolving drug-resistance to frontline macrocyclic lactones and renewed investment in alternative preventative drug research. We and others recently published data demonstrating proof-of-concept of utilising lymphopenic severe-combined immunodeficient (SCID) or Recombination Activating Gene (RAG)2 deficient mice with additional knockout of the IL-2/7 receptor gamma chain (γc) as alternative preventative drug screening research models of dirofilariasis. Here we summarise the current knowledge of candidate immunodeficient mouse models tested, including a comparison of susceptibility using different background strains of mice, different D. immitis isolates, following use of anti-inflammatory treatments to further suppress residual innate immunity, and efficacies achieved against different reference anthelmintics. We supplement this precis with new data on treatment response to the veterinary anthelmintic, oxfendazole, and initial evaluation of D. immitis susceptibility in CB.17 SCID and C57BL/6 RAG2-/-γc-/- mice. We conclude that in addition to NSG and NXG mice, RAG2-/-γc-/- mice on either a BALB/c or C57BL/6 background offer an alternative screening model option, widening access to academic and commercial laboratories wishing to pursue initial rapid in vivo drug screening whilst avoiding potentially unnecessary cat or dog testing.

                <p>by Mario Grassi, Barbara Tarantino</p>

Large-scale studies of gene expression are commonly influenced by biological and technical sources of expression variation, including batch effects, sample characteristics, and environmental impacts. Learning the causal relationships between observable variables may be challenging in the presence of unobserved confounders. Furthermore, many high-dimensional regression techniques may perform worse. In fact, controlling for unobserved confounding variables is essential, and many deconfounding methods have been suggested for application in a variety of situations. The main contribution of this article is the development of a two-stage deconfounding procedure based on Bow-free Acyclic Paths (BAP) search developed into the framework of Structural Equation Models (SEM), called SEMbap(). In the first stage, an exhaustive search of missing edges with significant covariance is performed via Shipley d-separation tests; then, in the second stage, a Constrained Gaussian Graphical Model (CGGM) is fitted or a low dimensional representation of bow-free edges structure is obtained via Graph Laplacian Principal Component Analysis (gLPCA). We compare four popular deconfounding methods to BAP search approach with applications on simulated and observed expression data. In the former, different structures of the hidden covariance matrix have been replicated. Compared to existing methods, BAP search algorithm is able to correctly identify hidden confounding whilst controlling false positive rate and achieving good fitting and perturbation metrics.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012429">Oscillations in an artificial neural network convert competing inputs into a temporal code</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Katharina Duecker, Marco Idiart, Marcel van Gerven, Ole Jensen</p>

The field of computer vision has long drawn inspiration from neuroscientific studies of the human and non-human primate visual system. The development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for example, was informed by the properties of simple and complex cells in early visual cortex. However, the computational relevance of oscillatory dynamics experimentally observed in the visual system are typically not considered in artificial neural networks (ANNs). Computational models of neocortical dynamics, on the other hand, rarely take inspiration from computer vision. Here, we combine methods from computational neuroscience and machine learning to implement multiplexing in a simple ANN using oscillatory dynamics. We first trained the network to classify individually presented letters. Post-training, we added temporal dynamics to the hidden layer, introducing refraction in the hidden units as well as pulsed inhibition mimicking neuronal alpha oscillations. Without these dynamics, the trained network correctly classified individual letters but produced a mixed output when presented with two letters simultaneously, indicating a bottleneck problem. When introducing refraction and oscillatory inhibition, the output nodes corresponding to the two stimuli activate sequentially, ordered along the phase of the inhibitory oscillations. Our model implements the idea that inhibitory oscillations segregate competing inputs in time. The results of our simulations pave the way for applications in deeper network architectures and more complicated machine learning problems.

                <p>by Janice Yang, Neil J. Daily, Taylor K. Pullinger, Tetsuro Wakatsuki, Eric A. Sobie</p>

Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) have gained traction as a powerful model in cardiac disease and therapeutics research, since iPSCs are self-renewing and can be derived from healthy and diseased patients without invasive surgery. However, current iPSC-CM differentiation methods produce cardiomyocytes with immature, fetal-like electrophysiological phenotypes, and the variety of maturation protocols in the literature results in phenotypic differences between labs. Heterogeneity of iPSC donor genetic backgrounds contributes to additional phenotypic variability. Several mathematical models of iPSC-CM electrophysiology have been developed to help to predict cell responses, but these models individually do not capture the phenotypic variability observed in iPSC-CMs. Here, we tackle these limitations by developing a computational pipeline to calibrate cell preparation-specific iPSC-CM electrophysiological parameters. We used the genetic algorithm (GA), a heuristic parameter calibration method, to tune ion channel parameters in a mathematical model of iPSC-CM physiology. To systematically optimize an experimental protocol that generates sufficient data for parameter calibration, we created <i>in silico</i> datasets by simulating various protocols applied to a population of models with known conductance variations, and then fitted parameters to those datasets. We found that calibrating to voltage and calcium transient data under 3 varied experimental conditions, including electrical pacing combined with ion channel blockade and changing buffer ion concentrations, improved model parameter estimates and model predictions of unseen channel block responses. This observation also held when the fitted data were normalized, suggesting that normalized fluorescence recordings, which are more accessible and higher throughput than patch clamp recordings, could sufficiently inform conductance parameters. Therefore, this computational pipeline can be applied to different iPSC-CM preparations to determine cell line-specific ion channel properties and understand the mechanisms behind variability in perturbation responses.

                <p>by Wen Wen, Shrey Grover, Douglas Hazel, Peyton Berning, Frederik Baumgardt, Vighnesh Viswanathan, Olivia Tween, Robert M. G. Reinhart</p>

Maintaining and removing information in mind are 2 fundamental cognitive processes that decline sharply with age. Using a combination of beta-band neural oscillations, which have been implicated in the regulation of working memory contents, and cross-trial neural variability, an undervalued property of brain dynamics theorized to govern adaptive cognitive processes, we demonstrate an age-related dissociation between distinct working memory functions—information maintenance and post-response deletion. Load-dependent decreases in beta variability during maintenance predicted memory performance of younger, but not older adults. Surprisingly, the post-response phase emerged as the predictive locus of working memory performance for older adults, with post-response beta variability correlated with memory performance of older, but not younger adults. Single-trial analysis identified post-response beta power elevation as a frequency-specific signature indexing memory deletion. Our findings demonstrate the nuanced interplay between age, beta dynamics, and working memory, offering valuable insights into the neural mechanisms of cognitive decline in agreement with the inhibition deficit theory of aging.

                Background Entomopathogenic fungi exists naturally in plants as an asymptote and have the potential to reduce the population of insect pests through indirect interactions. This study was conducted to detect and characterize the endophytic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii from the rhizosphere soil of tomato plants and their virulence effect on Galleria melonella. Methods From the rhizosphere soil of 40 tomato fields, three Beauveria bassiana and seven Metarhizium robertsii isolates were isolated using the galleria bait method. All fungi isolate were morphologically characterized by their colony color, shape, and surface texture. Isolates with the highest percentages of germination, conidial yield, and radial growth were selected, and their virulence was evaluated on second instar larvae of Galleria melonella under laboratory conditions. Results In this study, Beauveria bassiana showed white colony color and aseptate hyphae, whereas Metarhizium robertsii showed dark green to light green colony color and septate hyphal structures. Maximum spore production and conidial length were obtained by Beauveria bassiana isolate APPRC-27 with 2.67x107 spores ml-1 and 3.24 µm, respectively. Colony radial growth rates ranged from 1.73 to 3.24 mm day-1. The results revealed that the highest mortality rate of Galleria melonella (100%) was obtained by Metarhizium robertsii isolates K-61 and K-102 at a concentration of 1x108 conidial ml-1 at 7 days post-inoculation. The lowest mortality rate was registered by Metarhizium robertsii isolate RST-11. Conclusions In the present study, isolates that produced the most spores and had the highest germination rates were the most virulent to Galleria mellonella second instar larvae. Therefore, virulent entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii, are promising bioagents for the control of insect pests.

                Background Xylene, a common solvent in painting, printing, and shoemaking, enters the body through inhalation of vapors. Methods This observational analytic study aimed to examine the relationship between xylene concentration, xylene RQ, and liver function in industrial workers in Surabaya, especially in shoe industries. The chi-square method was utilized for data analysis. To ensure the validity and reliability of the study results, air and blood sampling procedures were implemented. Air sampling was conducted to measure xylene concentrations in the workplace environment, while blood samples were collected from workers to assess Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) levels. The study was conducted in five regions in Surabaya, namely Kalijudan, Ketintang, Jemursari, AUP, and Romokalisari. The population includes a total of 90 workers with 77 of them taken as samples using the accidental sampling method. Results The results show that there is a relationship between xylene concentration and Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) levels (p> 0.05); (r = 0,65) and there is no relationship between xylene concentrations and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) levels (p> 0.05); (r = -0,12). There was no relationship between RQ and SGOT levels (p> 0.05) and there was no relationship between RQ and SGPT levels (p> 0.05). However, from the calculation of the prevalence ratio, workers with unsafe RQ (RQ>1) have a 7.09x greater chance of experiencing damage to SGOT levels and a 1.06x greater chance of experiencing damage to SGPT levels. Conclusions Xylene exposure (concentration & RQ) affects liver enzyme levels (SGOT/SGPT) in workers. Industries should consider providing nutritious food to aid xylene removal and stricter safety policies are needed. This study highlights the importance of a holistic approach to worker health and safety when dealing with hazardous chemicals.

                The concept of secondary range symmetric matrices is introduced here. Some characterizations as well as the equivalent conditions for a range symmetric matrix to be secondary range symmetric matrix is given. The idea of range symmetric matrices, range symmetric matrices over Minkowski space and secondary range symmetric matrices are different, and is depicted with the help of suitable examples. Finally, a necessary and sufficient condition for a secondary range symmetric matrix to have a secondary generalized inverse has been obtained.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1045/v1?src=rss">Systematic review of inquiry-based learning: assessing impact and best practices in education [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Inquiry-based learning (IBL) is a student-centred pedagogical approach that promotes critical thinking, creativity, and active engagement. IBL encourages students to explore, question, and construct their own understanding, making it an effective method for enhancing educational experiences. This systematic review aims to assess the impact of IBL on educational outcomes and identify best practices for its implementation across different disciplines and educational levels. Methods The review involved a comprehensive analysis of peer-reviewed articles focusing on IBL across various educational settings. The selected studies encompassed a wide range of disciplines, educational levels, and geographic contexts. Criteria for inclusion involved examining the impact of IBL on students’ critical thinking, motivation, academic achievement, and overall learning experiences. Results Findings indicate that IBL positively impacts students’ critical thinking skills, motivation, and academic performance. Effective integration of IBL into curricula requires several key strategies: comprehensive teacher training, the creation of supportive learning environments, and the use of technology to facilitate inquiry-based activities. However, challenges were noted, such as the need for substantial instructional support and varying levels of student readiness for self-directed learning. Conclusions This systematic review confirms the benefits of IBL in enhancing educational outcomes and provides a synthesized overview of effective practices for its implementation. While IBL fosters critical thinking, creativity, and academic achievement, its success relies on adequate teacher training, supportive environments, and technological integration. Addressing the challenges related to instructional support and student readiness is crucial for optimizing IBL. The findings offer valuable insights for educators, researchers, and policymakers to enhance educational practices and outcomes through inquiry-based approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1044/v1?src=rss">Methodology used to develop the minimum common data elements for surveillance and Reporting of Musculoskeletal Injuries in the MILitary (ROMMIL) statement [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The objective was to summarize the methodology used to reach consensus for recommended minimum data elements that should be collected and reported when conducting injury surveillance research in military settings. This paper summarizes the methodology used to develop the international Minimum Data Elements for surveillance and Reporting of Musculoskeletal Injuries in the MILitary (ROMMIL) statement. Methods A Delphi methodology was employed to reach consensus for minimum reporting elements. Preliminary steps included conducting a literature review and surveying a convenience sample of military stakeholders to 1) identify barriers and facilitators of military musculoskeletal injury (MSKI) prevention programs, 2) identify relevant knowledge/information gaps and 3) establish future research priorities. The team then led a sequential three-round Delphi consensus survey, including relevant stakeholders from militaries around the world, and then conducted asynchronous mixed knowledge user meeting to explore level of agreement among subject matter experts. Knowledge users, including former and current military service members, civil servant practitioners, and global-wide subject matter experts having experience with policy, execution, or clinical investigation of MSKI mitigation programs, MSKI diagnoses, and MSKI risk factors in military settings. For each round, participants scored each question on a Likert scale of 1-5. Scores ranged from No Importance (1) to Strong Importance (5). Results Literature review and surveys helped informed the scope of potential variables to vote on. Three rounds were necessary to reach minimum consensus. Ninety-five, 65 and 42 respondents participated in the first, second and third rounds of the Delphi consensus, respectively. Ultimately, consensus recommendations emerged consisting of one data principle and 33 minimum data elements. Conclusions Achieving consensus across relevant stakeholders representing military organizations globally can be challenging. This paper details the methodology employed to reach consensus for a core minimum data elements checklist for conducting MSKI research in military settings and improve data harmonization and scalability efforts. These methods can be used as a resource to assist in future consensus endeavors of similar nature.

                Peeters et al. demonstrate that increasing H3K27me3 levels in regulatory T (Treg) cells by hyperactivating the H3K27me3 methyltransferase EZH2 pushes naive Treg cells toward a CD28-activated state. This promotes Treg cell migration to tissues for more rapid suppression of autoimmunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90559">Different coexistence patterns between apex carnivores and mesocarnivores based on temporal, spatial, and dietary niche partitioning analysis in Qilian Mountain National Park, China</a></h4>

              
                Carnivores play key roles in maintaining ecosystem structure and function as well as ecological processes. Understanding how sympatric species coexist in natural ecosystems is a central research topic in community ecology and biodiversity conservation. In this study, we explored intra- and interspecific niche partitioning along spatial, temporal, and dietary niche partitioning between apex carnivores (wolf <i>Canis lupus</i>, snow leopard <i>Panthera uncia</i>, Eurasian lynx <i>Lynx lynx</i>) and mesocarnivores (Pallas’s cat <i>Otocolobus manul</i>, red fox <i>Vulpes vulpes</i>, Tibetan fox <i>Vulpes ferrilata</i>) in Qilian Mountain National Park, China, using camera trapping data and DNA metabarcoding sequencing data. Our study showed that apex carnivore species had more overlap temporally (coefficients of interspecific overlap ranging from 0.661 to 0.900) or trophically (Pianka’s index ranging from 0.458 to 0.892), mesocarnivore species had high dietary overlap with each other (Pianka’s index ranging from 0.945 to 0.997), and apex carnivore and mesocarnivore species had high temporal overlap (coefficients of interspecific overlap ranging from 0.497 to 0.855). Large dietary overlap was observed between wolf and snow leopard (Pianka’s index = 0.892) and Pallas’s cat and Tibetan fox (Pianka’s index = 0.997), suggesting the potential for increased resource competition for these species pairs. We concluded that spatial niche partitioning is likely to key driver in facilitating the coexistence of apex carnivore species, while spatial and temporal niche partitioning likely facilitate the coexistence of mesocarnivore species, and spatial and dietary niche partitioning facilitate the coexistence between apex and mesocarnivore species. Our findings consider partitioning across temporal, spatial, and dietary dimensions while examining diverse coexistence patterns of carnivore species in Qilian Mountain National Park, China. These findings will contribute substantially to current understanding of carnivore guilds and effective conservation management in fragile alpine ecosystems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91420">Revealing a hidden conducting state by manipulating the intracellular domains in KV10.1 exposes the coupling between two gating mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                The <i>KCNH</i> family of potassium channels serves relevant physiological functions in both excitable and non-excitable cells, reflected in the massive consequences of mutations or pharmacological manipulation of their function. This group of channels shares structural homology with other voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels, but the mechanisms of gating in this family show significant differences with respect to the canonical electromechanical coupling in these molecules. In particular, the large intracellular domains of <i>KCNH</i> channels play a crucial role in gating that is still only partly understood. Using <i>KCNH1</i>(K<sub>V</sub>10.1) as a model, we have characterized the behavior of a series of modified channels that could not be explained by the current models. With electrophysiological and biochemical methods combined with mathematical modeling, we show that the uncovering of an open state can explain the behavior of the mutants. This open state, which is not detectable in wild-type channels, appears to lack the rapid flicker block of the conventional open state. Because it is accessed from deep closed states, it elucidates intermediate gating events well ahead of channel opening in the wild type. This allowed us to study gating steps prior to opening, which, for example, explain the mechanism of gating inhibition by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Calmodulin and generate a model that describes the characteristic features of <i>KCNH</i> channels gating.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97069">Dysregulated Ca2+ signaling, fluid secretion, and mitochondrial function in a mouse model of early Sjögren’s disease</a></h4>

              
                The molecular mechanisms leading to saliva secretion are largely established, but factors that underlie secretory hypofunction, specifically related to the autoimmune disease Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) are not fully understood. A major conundrum is the lack of association between the severity of salivary gland immune cell infiltration and glandular hypofunction. SS-like disease was induced by treatment with DMXAA, a small molecule agonist of murine STING. We have previously shown that the extent of salivary secretion is correlated with the magnitude of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (Takano et al., 2021). Contrary to our expectations, despite a significant reduction in fluid secretion, neural stimulation resulted in enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals with altered spatiotemporal characteristics in vivo. Muscarinic stimulation resulted in reduced activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel, TMEM16a, although there were no changes in channel abundance or absolute sensitivity to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Super-resolution microscopy revealed a disruption in the colocalization of Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels with TMEM16a, and channel activation was reduced when intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering was increased. These data indicate altered local peripheral coupling between the channels. Appropriate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is also pivotal for mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics. Disrupted mitochondrial morphology and reduced oxygen consumption rate were observed in DMXAA-treated animals. In summary, early in SS disease, dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals lead to decreased fluid secretion and disrupted mitochondrial function contributing to salivary gland hypofunction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94317">Lateral/caudal ganglionic eminence makes limited contribution to cortical oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                The emergence of myelinating oligodendrocytes represents a pivotal developmental milestone in vertebrates, given their capacity to ensheath axons and facilitate the swift conduction of action potentials. It is widely accepted that cortical oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) arise from medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), lateral/caudal ganglionic eminence (LGE/CGE), and cortical radial glial cells (RGCs). Here, we used two different fate mapping strategies to challenge the established notion that the LGE generates cortical OPCs. Furthermore, we used a Cre/loxP-dependent exclusion strategy to reveal that the LGE/CGE does not give rise to cortical OPCs. Additionally, we showed that specifically eliminating MGE-derived OPCs leads to a significant reduction of cortical OPCs. Together, our findings indicate that the LGE does not generate cortical OPCs, contrary to previous beliefs. These findings provide a new view of the developmental origins of cortical OPCs and a valuable foundation for future research on both normal development and oligodendrocyte-related disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98818">Developmental stage shapes the realized energy landscape for a flight specialist</a></h4>

              
                The heterogeneity of the physical environment determines the cost of transport for animals, shaping their energy landscape. Animals respond to this energy landscape by adjusting their distribution and movement to maximize gains and reduce costs. Much of our knowledge about energy landscape dynamics focuses on factors external to the animal, particularly the spatio-temporal variations of the environment. However, an animal’s internal state can significantly impact its ability to perceive and utilize available energy, creating a distinction between the ‘fundamental’ and the ‘realized’ energy landscapes. Here, we show that the realized energy landscape varies along the ontogenetic axis. Locomotor and cognitive capabilities of individuals change over time, especially during the early life stages. We investigate the development of the realized energy landscape in the Central European Alpine population of the golden eagle <i>Aquila chrysaetos</i>, a large predator that requires negotiating the atmospheric environment to achieve energy-efficient soaring flight. We quantified weekly energy landscapes using environmental features for 55 juvenile golden eagles, demonstrating that energetic costs of traversing the landscape decreased with age. Consequently, the potentially flyable area within the Alpine region increased 2170-fold during their first three years of independence. Our work contributes to a predictive understanding of animal movement by presenting ontogeny as a mechanism shaping the realized energy landscape.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89486">Targeting ribosome biogenesis as a novel therapeutic approach to overcome EMT-related chemoresistance in breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes significantly to chemotherapy resistance and remains a critical challenge in treating advanced breast cancer. The complexity of EMT, involving redundant pro-EMT signaling pathways and its paradox reversal process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), has hindered the development of effective treatments. In this study, we utilized a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model in mice and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively analyze the EMT status of tumor cells. Our findings revealed elevated ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) during the transitioning phases of both EMT and MET processes. RiBi and its subsequent nascent protein synthesis mediated by ERK and mTOR signalings are essential for EMT/MET completion. Importantly, inhibiting excessive RiBi genetically or pharmacologically impaired the EMT/MET capability of tumor cells. Combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells under chemotherapies. Our study suggests that targeting the RiBi pathway presents a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced breast cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84385">Neuroelectrophysiology-compatible electrolytic lesioning</a></h4>

              
                Lesion studies have historically been instrumental for establishing causal connections between brain and behavior. They stand to provide additional insight if integrated with multielectrode techniques common in systems neuroscience. Here, we present and test a platform for creating electrolytic lesions through chronically implanted, intracortical multielectrode probes without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology. A custom-built current source provides stable current and allows for controlled, repeatable lesions in awake-behaving animals. Performance of this novel lesioning technique was validated using histology from ex vivo and in vivo testing, current and voltage traces from the device, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesioning. This electrolytic lesioning method avoids disruptive procedures, provides millimeter precision over the extent and submillimeter precision over the location of the injury, and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining neuronal population after lesioning. This technique can be used in many areas of cortex, in several species, and theoretically with any multielectrode probe. The low-cost, external lesioning device can also easily be adopted into an existing electrophysiology recording setup. This technique is expected to enable future causal investigations of the recorded neuronal population’s role in neuronal circuit function, while simultaneously providing new insight into local reorganization after neuron loss.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95524">Identifying images in the biology literature that are problematic for people with a color-vision deficiency</a></h4>

              
                To help maximize the impact of scientific journal articles, authors must ensure that article figures are accessible to people with color-vision deficiencies (CVDs), which affect up to 8% of males and 0.5% of females. We evaluated images published in biology- and medicine-oriented research articles between 2012 and 2022. Most included at least one color contrast that could be problematic for people with deuteranopia (‘deuteranopes’), the most common form of CVD. However, spatial distances and within-image labels frequently mitigated potential problems. Initially, we reviewed 4964 images from <i>eLife</i>, comparing each against a simulated version that approximated how it might appear to deuteranopes. We identified 636 (12.8%) images that we determined would be difficult for deuteranopes to interpret. Our findings suggest that the frequency of this problem has decreased over time and that articles from cell-oriented disciplines were most often problematic. We used machine learning to automate the identification of problematic images. For a hold-out test set from <i>eLife</i> (n=879), a convolutional neural network classified the images with an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.75. The same network classified images from PubMed Central (n=1191) with an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.39. We created a Web application (<a href="https://bioapps.byu.edu/colorblind_image_tester">https://bioapps.byu.edu/colorblind_image_tester</a>); users can upload images, view simulated versions, and obtain predictions. Our findings shed new light on the frequency and nature of scientific images that may be problematic for deuteranopes and motivate additional efforts to increase accessibility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90854">Cannabinoid combination targets NOTCH1-mutated T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia through the integrated stress response pathway</a></h4>

              
                In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), more than 50% of cases display autoactivation of Notch1 signaling, leading to oncogenic transformation. We have previously identified a specific chemovar of Cannabis that induces apoptosis by preventing Notch1 maturation in leukemia cells. Here, we isolated three cannabinoids from this chemovar that synergistically mimic the effects of the whole extract. Two were previously known, cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabidivarin (CBDV), whereas the third cannabinoid, which we termed 331-18A, was identified and fully characterized in this study. We demonstrated that these cannabinoids act through cannabinoid receptor type 2 and TRPV1 to activate the integrated stress response pathway by depleting intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This is followed by increased mRNA and protein expression of ATF4, CHOP, and CHAC1, which is hindered by inhibiting the upstream initiation factor eIF2α. The increased abundance of CHAC1 prevents Notch1 maturation, thereby reducing the levels of the active Notch1 intracellular domain, and consequently decreasing cell viability and increasing apoptosis. Treatment with the three isolated molecules resulted in reduced tumor size and weight in vivo and slowed leukemia progression in mice models. Altogether, this study elucidated the mechanism of action of three distinct cannabinoids in modulating the Notch1 pathway, and constitutes an important step in the establishment of a new therapy for treating <i>NOTCH1</i>-mutated diseases and cancers such as T-ALL.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95406">Embryonic origins of forebrain oligodendrocytes revisited by combinatorial genetic fate mapping</a></h4>

              
                Multiple embryonic origins give rise to forebrain oligodendrocytes (OLs), yet controversies and uncertainty exist regarding their differential contributions. We established intersectional and subtractional strategies to genetically fate map OLs produced by medial ganglionic eminence/preoptic area (MGE/POA), lateral/caudal ganglionic eminences (LGE/CGE), and dorsal pallium in the mouse brain. We found that, contrary to the canonical view, LGE/CGE-derived OLs make minimum contributions to the neocortex and corpus callosum, but dominate piriform cortex and anterior commissure. Additionally, MGE/POA-derived OLs, instead of being entirely eliminated, make small but sustained contribution to cortex with a distribution pattern distinctive from those derived from the dorsal origin. Our study provides a revised and more comprehensive view of cortical and white matter OL origins, and established valuable new tools and strategies for future OL studies.

">The transcriptome of playfulness is sex-biased in the juvenile rat medial amygdala: a role for inhibitory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Social play is a dynamic behavior known to be sexually differentiated; in most species, males play more than females, a sex difference driven in large part by the medial amygdala (MeA). Despite the well-conserved nature of this sex difference and the importance of social play for appropriate maturation of brain and behavior, the full mechanism establishing the sex bias in play is unknown. Here, we explore the transcriptome of playfulness in the juvenile rat MeA, assessing differences in gene expression between high- and low-playing animals of both sexes via bulk RNA-sequencing. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify gene modules combined with analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we demonstrate that the transcriptomic profile in the juvenile rat MeA associated with playfulness is largely distinct in males compared to females. Of the 13 play-associated WGCNA networks identified, only two were associated with play in both sexes, and very few DEGs associated with playfulness were shared between males and females. Data from our parallel single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments using amygdala samples from newborn male and female rats suggests that inhibitory neurons drive this sex difference, as the majority of sex-biased DEGs in the neonatal amygdala are enriched within this population. Supporting this notion, we demonstrate that inhibitory neurons comprise the majority of play-active cells in the juvenile MeA, with males having a greater number of play-active cells than females, of which a larger proportion are GABAergic. Through integrative bioinformatic analyses, we further explore the expression, function, and cell-type specificity of key play-associated modules and the regulator hub genes predicted to drive them, providing valuable insight into the sex-biased mechanisms underlying this fundamental social behavior.

">Abrogation of presynaptic facilitation at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses impacts neural ensemble activity and spatial memory</a></h4>

              
                Presynaptic short-term plasticity is thought to play a major role in the process of spike transfer within local circuits. Mossy fiber synapses between the axons of dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells and CA3 pyramidal cells (Mf-CA3 synapses) display a remarkable extent of presynaptic plasticity which endows these synaptic connections with detonator properties. The pattern of action potential firing, in the form of high frequency bursts in the DG, strongly controls the amplitude of synaptic responses and information transfer to CA3. Here we have investigated the role of presynaptic facilitation at Mf-CA3 synapses in the operation of CA3 circuits in vivo and in memory encoding. Syt7, a calcium sensor necessary for presynaptic facilitation, was selectively abrogated, in DG granule cells using Syt7 conditional KO mice (DG Syt7 KO mice). In hippocampal slices, we extend previous analysis to show that short-term presynaptic facilitation is selectively suppressed at Mf-CA3 synapses in the absence of Syt7, without any impact on basal synaptic properties and long-term potentiation. Short-term plasticity was found to be crucial for spike transfer between the DG and CA3 in conditions of naturalistic patterns of presynaptic firing. At the network level, in awake head-fixed mice, the abrogation of short-term plasticity largely reduced the co-activity of CA3 pyramidal cells. Finally, whereas DG Syt7 KO mice are not impaired in behavioral tasks based on pattern separation, they show deficits in spatial memory tasks which rely on the process of pattern completion. These results shed new light on the role of the detonator properties of DG-CA3 synapses, and give important insights into how this key synaptic feature translate at the population and behavioral levels.

">Genetic deletion of NAPE-PLD induces context-dependent dysregulation of anxiety-like behaviors, stress responsiveness, and HPA-axis functionality in mice</a></h4>

              
                The endocannabinoid (eCB) system regulates stress responsiveness and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. The enzyme N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase-D (NAPE-PLD) is primarily responsible for the synthesis of the endocannabinoid signaling molecule anandamide (AEA) and other structurally related lipid signaling molecules known as N-acylethanolamines (NAEs). However, little is known about how activity of this enzyme affects behavior. As AEA plays a regulatory role in stress adaptation, we hypothesized that reducing synthesis of AEA and other NAEs would dysregulate stress reactivity. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated wild type (WT) and NAPE-PLD knockout (KO) mice in behavioral assays that assess stress responsiveness and anxiety-like behavior. NAPE-PLD KO mice exhibited anxiety-like behaviors in the open field test and the light-dark box test after a period of single housing. NAPE-PLD KO mice exhibited a heightened freezing response to the testing environment that was further enhanced by exposure to 2,3,5-trimethyl-3-thiazoline (TMT) predator odor. NAPE-PLD KO mice exhibited an exaggerated freezing response at baseline but blunted response to TMT when compared to WT mice. NAPE-PLD KO mice also exhibited a context-dependent dysregulation of HPA axis in response to TMT in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus at a neuronal level, as measured by c-Fos immunohistochemstry. Male, but not female, NAPE-PLD knockout mice showed higher levels of circulating corticosterone relative to same-sex wildtype mice in response to TMT exposure, suggesting a sexually-dimorphic dysregulation of the HPA axis at the hormonal level. Together, these findings suggest the enzymatic activity of NAPE-PLD regulates emotional resilience and recovery from both acute and sustained stress.

">Intergenerational transmission of the structure of the auditory cortex and reading skills</a></h4>

              
                High-level cognitive skill development relies on genetic and environmental factors, tied to brain structure and function. Inter-individual variability in language and music skills has been repeatedly associated with the structure of the auditory cortex: the shape, size and asymmetry of the transverse temporal gyrus (TTG) or gyri (TTGs). TTG is highly variable in shape and size, some individuals having one single gyrus (also referred to as Heschl's gyrus, HG) while others presenting duplications (with a common stem or fully separated) or higher-order multiplications of TTG. Both genetic and environmental influences on children's cognition, behavior, and brain can to some to degree be traced back to familial and parental factors. In the current study, using a unique MRI dataset of parents and children (135 individuals from 37 families), we ask whether the anatomy of the auditory cortex is related to reading skills, and whether there are intergenerational effects on TTG(s) anatomy. For this, we performed detailed, automatic segmentations of HG and of additional TTG(s), when present, extracting volume, surface area, thickness and shape of the gyri. We tested for relationships between these and reading skill, and assessed their degree of familial similarity and intergenerational transmission effects. We found that volume and area of all identified left TTG(s) combined was positively related to reading scores, both in children and adults. With respect to intergenerational similarities in the structure of the auditory cortex, we identified structural brain similarities for parent-child pairs of the 1st TTG (Heschl's gyrus, HG) (in terms of volume, area and thickness for the right HG, and shape for the left HG) and of the lateralization of all TTG(s) surface area for father-child pairs. Both the HG and TTG-lateralization findings were significantly more likely for parent-child dyads than for unrelated adult-child pairs. Furthermore, we established characteristics of parents' TTG that are related to better reading abilities in children: fathers' small left HG, and a small ratio of HG to planum temporale. Our results suggest intergenerational transmission of specific structural features of the auditory cortex; these may arise from genetics and/or from shared environment.

">Multiple Functions of Cerebello-Thalamic Neurons in Learning and Offline Consolidation of a Motor Skill in mice.</a></h4>

              
                Motor skill learning is a complex and gradual process that involves the cortex and basal ganglia, both crucial for the acquisition and long-term retention of skills. The cerebellum, which rapidly learns to adjust the movement, connects to the motor cortex and the striatum via the ventral and intralaminar thalamus respectively. Here, we evaluated the contribution of cerebellar neurons projecting to these thalamic nuclei in a skilled locomotion task in mice. Using a targeted chemogenetic inhibition that preserves the motor abilities, we found that cerebellar nuclei neurons projecting to the intralaminar thalamus contribute to learning and expression, while cerebellar nuclei neurons projecting to the ventral thalamus contribute to offline consolidation. Asymptotic performance, however, required each type of neurons. Thus, our results show that cerebellar neurons belonging to two parallel cerebello-thalamic pathways play distinct, but complementary, roles functioning on different timescales and both necessary for motor skill learning.

">Neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex that are not modulated by hippocampal sharp-wave ripples are involved in spatial tuning and signaling upcoming choice.</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is known to encode spatial information and reactivate experienced trajectories during sharp-wave ripple events. These events are thought to be key time-points at which information about learned trajectories is transferred to the neocortex for long-term storage. It is unclear, however, how this information may be transferred and integrated in downstream cortical regions. In this study, we performed high-density probe recordings across the full depth of the medial prefrontal cortex and in the hippocampus simultaneously in rats while they were performing a task of spatial navigation. We find that neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex encode spatial information and reliably predict upcoming choice on a maze, and we find that a subset of neurons in the mPFC is modulated by hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. However, the neurons that are involved in predicting upcoming choice are not the neurons that are modulated by hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. This indicates that the integration of spatial information requires the collaboration of different specialized populations of neurons.

">Brain-wide projections of mouse dopaminergic zona incerta neurons</a></h4>

              
                The zona incerta (ZI) supports diverse behaviors including binge feeding, sleep/wake cycles, nociception, and hunting. This diversity of functions can be attributed to the heterogenous neurochemicals, cytoarchitecture, and efferent connections that characterize the ZI. The ZI is predominantly GABAergic, but we recently identified a subset of medial ZI GABA cells that co-express dopamine (DA), as marked by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). While the role of GABA within the ZI is well studied, little is understood about the function of ZI DA cells. To identify potential roles of ZI DA cells we mapped the efferent fiber projections from Th-cre ZI cells. We first validated a Th-cre;L10-Egfp mouse line and found that medial Egfp ZI cells were more likely to co-express TH-immunoreactivity (TH-ir). We thus delivered a cre-dependent virus into the medial ZI of Th-cre or Th-cre;L10-Egfp mice and selected two injection cases for full brain mapping. We selected the cases with the lowest (17%) and highest (53%) percentage of colocalization between TH-ir and virus transfected cells labelled with DsRed. Overall, DsRed-labelled fibers were observed throughout the brain and were most prominent within motor-related regions of the midbrain (MBmot), notably the periaqueductal grey area and superior colliculus. We also observed considerable DsRed-labelled fibers within the polymodal cortex associated regions of the thalamus (DORpm), including the paraventricular thalamic nucleus and nucleus of reunions. Overall, ZI DA cells displayed a similar connectivity profile to ZI GABA cells, suggesting that ZI DA cells may perform synergistic or opposing functions at the same target sites.

">Neurotransmitters Contribute Structure-Function Coupling: Evidence from Grey Matter Volume (GMV) and Brain Entropy (BEN)</a></h4>

              
                The emergence of human brain function from macroscopic anatomical structures and its relationship with the coupling of structure and function have long been pivotal questions in neuroscience. Neurotransmitter receptors are critical in signal transmission, regulating brain function, and potentially enhancing the coupling between brain structure and function. Recent research suggests that neurotransmitter systems facilitate this coupling between structural and functional networks. However, the mechanisms of how neurotransmitters adapt to local anatomical structures and drive functional emergence are not yet fully understood. This study explores these mechanisms using gray matter volume (GMV) and brain entropy (BEN). BEN reflects the irregularity, unpredictability, and complexity of brain activity, and functional MRI (fMRI)-based BEN has identified its distribution in the normal human brain. BEN is correlated to cognitive and task performance, and aberrant BEN patterns link to various brain disorders. Notably, BEN can indicate neuroplasticity through non-invasive brain stimulation, and pharmacological intervention. We analyzed structural imaging data, as well as 7T resting-state and movie-watching fMRI data from 176 participants in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), to calculate GMV, resting-state BEN (rsBEN), and movie-watching BEN (mvBEN). By integrating data from the publicly available neurotransmitter receptors database, we evaluated the role of neurotransmitters in the coupling between GMV and rsBEN, GMV and mvBEN, and rsBEN and mvBEN. Our findings reveal that neurotransmitters significantly contribute to structural and functional coupling and influence the transition from task-free to movie-watching conditions.

">Death in the taste bud: Morphological features of dying taste cells and engulfment by Type I cells</a></h4>

              
                Taste buds comprise 50-100 epithelial derived cells, which are renewed throughout the life of an organism. Immature cells enter the bud at its base, maturing into one of three distinct cell types. How taste cells die and/or exit the bud, however, remains unclear. Here we present morphological data obtained through Serial Blockface Scanning Electron Microscopy of murine circumvallate taste buds, revealing several taste cells at the end of their life (4-6 per bud). Cells we identify as dying share certain morphological features typical of apoptosis: swollen endoplasmic reticulum, large lysosomes, degrading organelles, distended outer nuclear membranes, heterochromatin reorganization, cell shrinkage, and cell and/or nuclear fragmentation. Based on these features, we divide the cells into early and late stage dying cells. Most early stage dying cells have Type II cell morphologies, while a few display Type III cell features. Many dying cells maintain contacts with nerve fibers, but those fibers often appear detached from the main trunk of an afferent nerve fiber. Dying cells, like mature Type II and Type III taste cells, are surrounded by Type I taste cells, the glial-like cells of the bud. In many instances Type I cells appear to be engulfing their dying neighbors, suggesting a novel, phagocytic role for Type I cells. Surprisingly, virtually no Type I cells, which have the shortest residence time in taste buds, display features of apoptosis. The ultimate fate of Type I cells therefore remains enigmatic.

">Potent and selective repression of SCN9A by engineered zinc finger repressors for the treatment of neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral neuropathies are estimated to affect several million patients in the US with no long-lasting therapy currently available. In humans, the Nav1.7 sodium channel, encoded by the SCN9A gene, is involved in a spectrum of inherited neuropathies, and has emerged as a promising target for analgesic drug development. The development of a selective Nav1.7 inhibitor has been challenging, in part due to structural similarities among other Nav channels. Here we present preclinical studies for the first genomic medicine approach using engineered zinc finger repressors (ZFRs) specifically targeting human/nonhuman primate (NHP) SCN9A. AAV-mediated delivery of ZFRs in human iPSC-derived neurons resulted in 90% reduction of SCN9A with no detectable off-target activity. To establish proof-of-concept, a ZFR targeting the mouse Scn9a was assessed in the SNI neuropathic pain mouse model, which resulted in up to 70% repression of Scn9a in mouse DRGs and was associated with reduction in pain hypersensitivity as measured by increased mechanical- and cold-induced pain thresholds. AAV-mediated intrathecal delivery of ZFR in NHPs demonstrated up to 60% repression of SCN9A in bulk DRG tissue and on single-cell levels in the nociceptors. The treatment was well tolerated in NHPs, and no dose-limiting findings were observed four weeks after a single intrathecal injection. Taken together, our results demonstrate that AAV-delivered ZFR targeting the SCN9A gene is promising and supports further development as a potential therapy for peripheral neuropathies.

">Variation in moment-to-moment brain state engagement changes across development and contributes to individual differences in executive function</a></h4>

              
                Neural variability, or variation in brain signals, facilitates dynamic brain responses to ongoing demands. This flexibility is important during development from childhood to young adulthood, a period characterized by rapid changes in experience. However, little is known about how variability in the engagement of recurring brain states changes during development. Such investigations would require the continuous assessment of multiple brain states concurrently. Here, we leverage a new computational framework to study state engagement variability (SEV) during development. A consistent pattern of SEV changing with age was identified across cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets (N>3000). SEV developmental trajectories stabilize around mid-adolescence, with timing varying by sex and brain state. SEV successfully predicts executive function (EF) in youths from an independent dataset. Worse EF is further linked to alterations in SEV development. These converging findings suggest SEV changes over development, allowing individuals to flexibly recruit various brain states to meet evolving needs.

">KIF5A regulates axonal repair and time-dependent axonal transport of SFPQ granules and mitochondria in human motor neurons</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the microtubule binding motor protein, kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A), cause the fatal motor neuron disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. While KIF5 family members transport a variety of cargos along axons, it is still unclear which cargos are affected by KIF5A mutations. We generated KIF5A null mutant human motor neurons to investigate the impact of KIF5A loss on the transport of various cargoes and its effect on motor neuron function at two different timepoints in vitro. The absence of KIF5A resulted in reduced neurite complexity in young motor neurons (DIV14) and significant defects in axonal regeneration capacity at all developmental stages. KIF5A loss did not affect neurofilament transport but resulted in decreased mitochondria motility and anterograde speed at DIV42. More prominently, KIF5A depletion strongly reduced anterograde transport of SFPQ-associated RNA granules in DIV42 motor neuron axons. We conclude that KIF5A most prominently functions in human motor neurons to promote axonal regrowth after injury as well as to anterogradely transport mitochondria and, to a larger extent, SFPQ-associated RNA granules in a time-dependent manner.

">Neural Correlates of the Embodied Sense of Agency</a></h4>

              
                The Sense of Agency (SoA) is the subjective experience that 'I am in control of my actions'. Recent accounts have distinguished two levels in the formation of SoA - early implicit sensorimotor processes (feeling of agency) and later explicit higher-level processes, incorporating one's thoughts and beliefs (judgment of agency). Even though SoA is fundamental to our interactions with the external world and the construct of the self, its underlying neural mechanism remains elusive. In the current pre-registered electroencephalography (EEG) study, we used time-frequency and Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) to investigate the electrophysiological characteristics associated with SoA. We used an established embodied virtual reality paradigm in which visual feedback of a movement is modulated to examine the effect of conflicts between the predicted and perceived sensory feedback. Participants moved their finger and were shown a virtual hand that either mimicked their movement or differed anatomically (different finger) or spatially (angular shift), then judged their SoA over the observed movement while their brain activity was recorded. In accordance with our pre-registered hypothesis, we found that a reduction of SoA is associated with decreased attenuation in the alpha frequency band. Increased power in the theta frequency band was also associated with SoA reduction. Importantly, we show that trials containing a sensorimotor alteration vs. trials containing no alteration can reliably be decoded with up to 68% accuracy starting around 200ms after the movement onset. Finally, cross-decoding analyses revealed similar neural patterns for reduced SoA in the anatomical and spatial conditions, starting around 500ms after the movement onset. Together, our results reveal a cortical signature of loss of SoA and provide neural evidence supporting the hypothesis of a two-level formation of SoA - an early domain-specific component, possibly the equivalent of the implicit feeling of agency, and a late domain-general component, possibly the equivalent of the explicit judgment of agency.

">Learning to read transforms phonological into phonographic representations: Evidence from a Mismatch Negativity study</a></h4>

              
                Learning to read changes the nature of speech representation. One possible change consists in transforming phonological representations into phonographic ones. However, evidence for such transformation remains surprisingly scarce. Here, we used a novel word learning paradigm to address this issue. During a learning phase, participants were exposed to unknown words in both spoken and written forms. Following this phase, the impact of spelling knowledge on spoken input perception was assessed at two time points through an unattended oddball paradigm, while the Mismatch Negativity component was measured by high density EEG. Immediately after the learning phase, no influence of spelling knowledge on the perception of the spoken input was found. Interestingly, one week later, this influence emerged, making similar sounding words with different spellings more distinct than similar sounding words that also share the same spelling. Our finding provides novel neurophysiological evidence of an integration of phonological and orthographic representations that occurs once newly acquired knowledge has been consolidated. These novel phonographic representations may characterize how known words are stored in literates' mental lexicon.

">What if...? Computational anatomy in the cerebellar microzone, the middle layer of the cerebellar network</a></h4>

              
                It is generally assumed that the representation of information in the brain is in high resolution and replicable with high fidelity, and that those features make it precise and characterise the inputs to sophisticated computations. Replicability is an important assumption of neural network learning models, including cerebellar models. We question those ideas. The molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex is divided functionally into strips called microzones populated by Purkinje cells and inhibitory interneurons. We propose instead: (1) The microzone computation is a passive effect, unaided, of the triad of cell morphologies, cerebellar network geometry and linear transmission. (2) Control of Purkinje cells is by a chain of rate codes, and not supplanted by learning. (3) Striped topography of input to a network can represent collectively coherent information about body shape and movement. This is capable, passed through the network computation, of driving coordinated motor sequences. (4) A learning algorithm and replicability are unnecessary to explain the evidence.

                Disruption of the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission (E-I balance) underlies theories of many neurodevelopmental disorders, however, its study is typically restricted to adults, animal models and the lab-bench. Neurophysiological oscillations in the gamma frequency band relate closely to E-I balance, and a new technology - OPM-MEG - offers the possibility to measure such signals across the lifespan. We used OPM-MEG to measure gamma oscillations induced by visual stimulation in >100 participants, aged 2-34 years. We demonstrate a significantly changing spectrum with age, with low amplitude broadband gamma oscillations in children and high amplitude band limited oscillations dominating in adults. We used a canonical cortical microcircuit to model these gamma signals, revealing significant age-related shifts in E-I balance in superficial pyramidal neurons in visual cortex. Our findings detail the first MEG metrics of gamma oscillations and their underlying generators from toddlerhood, providing a benchmark against which future studies can contextualise.

">Bridging the gap between grey-matter microstructural and functional connectomes: A multi-modal MRI study in preterm and full-term infants</a></h4>

              
                Functional networks characterised by synchronous neural activity across distributed brain regions have been observed to emerge early in neurodevelopment. However, how the maturation of regional specialization and functional organization relates to developmental changes in structure is poorly understood. The covariation of regional microstructural properties, or microstructural connectivity (MC), could partially reflect synchronized maturation across regions that relate to functional connectivity (FC) during the early neurodevelopmental period. In this study, we investigated the evolution of MC and FC postnatally across a set of cortical and subcortical regions, focusing on 45 preterm infants scanned longitudinally, and compared to 45 matched full-term neonates as part of the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). Our findings revealed a global reinforcement of both MC and FC with age, with connection-specific variability dependent on the connection maturational stage and confirmed the impact of prematurity at term-equivalent age. We also reported a significant relationship between MC and FC during the preterm period. This relationship seemed to decrease with development when directly comparing the two modalities. However, evaluation of overlaps between MC- and FC-derived networks suggested increasing relationships with age, potentially due to a shared network structure underlying changes of microstructural and functional properties. Thus, our study offers novel insights on the complex interplay of functional and microstructural development and highlights the potential utility of MC as a complementary descriptor for characterizing the brain network development and alterations due to perinatal insults such as premature birth.

">Spatiotemporal evidence accumulation through saccadic sampling for object recognition</a></h4>

              
                Visual object recognition has been extensively studied under fixation conditions, but our natural viewing involves frequent saccadic eye movements that scan multiple local informative features within an object (e.g., eyes and mouth in a face image). Such visual exploration can facilitate object recognition, but mechanistic accounts of the contribution of saccades are yet to be established due to the presumed complexity of the interactions between the visual and oculomotor systems. Here, we present a framework for formulating object recognition as a process of accumulating evidence from local features through saccades to render a decision. This approach offers a simple model that quantitatively explains human face and object categorization behavior, even under conditions in which people freely make saccades to scan local features, departing from past studies that required controlled eye movements to examine trans-saccadic integration. Notably, our experimental results showed that active saccade commands (efference copy) did not substantially contribute to behavioral performance and that the patterns of saccades were largely independent of the ongoing decision-making processes. Therefore, we propose that object recognition with saccades can be approximated using a parsimonious decision-making model without assuming complex interactions between the visual and oculomotor systems.

                The lateral habenula (LHb) integrates aversive information to regulate motivated behaviors. Despite recent advances in identifying neuronal diversity at the molecular level, in vivo electrophysiological diversity of LHb neurons remains poorly understood. Understanding this diversity is essential for deciphering how information is processed in the LHb. To address this gap, we conducted in vivo electrophysiological recordings in mice and applied unsupervised clustering algorithm to analyze firing patterns. This analysis identified four distinct spontaneous firing patterns of LHb neurons, which were consistent across both anesthetized and awake states. To determine whether these firing patterns correlate with function, we recorded neuronal responses to foot shock stimulation in anesthetized mice and monitored spontaneous behavior in awake mice. We found that low-firing, bursting neurons were preferentially modulated by foot shocks in anesthetized mice and also tracked behavioral states in awake mice. Collectively, our findings indicate significant electrophysiological diversity among LHb neurons, which is associated with their modulation by aversive stimuli and behavioral state.

                Huntington's disease (HD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder affecting an individual's cognitive and motor abilities. HD is caused by mutation in the huntingtin gene producing a toxic polyglutamine-expanded protein (mHTT) and leading to degeneration in the striatum and cortex. Yet, the molecular signatures that underlie tissue-specific vulnerabilities remain unclear. Here, we investigate this aspect by leveraging multi-epitope protein interaction assays, subcellular fractionation, thermal proteome profiling, and genetic modifier assays. Use of human cell, mouse, and fly models afforded capture of distinct subcellular pools of epitope-enriched and tissue-dependent interactions linked to dysregulated cellular pathways and disease relevance. We established an HTT association with nearly all subunits of the transcriptional regulatory Mediator complex (20/26), with preferential enrichment of MED15 in the tail domain. Using HD and KO models, we find HTT modulates the subcellular localization and assembly of Mediator. We demonstrated striatal enriched and functional interactions with regulators of calcium homeostasis and chromatin remodeling, whose disease relevance was supported by HD fly genetic modifiers assays. Altogether, we offer insights into tissue- and localization-dependent (m)HTT functions and pathobiology.

">Curriculum Learning: sequential acquisition of task complexity enhances neuronal discriminability</a></h4>

              
                Curriculum Learning (CL) is a strategy where concepts with increasing complexity are acquired sequentially. Despite its widespread application, its putative neural mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, using a multi-staged Go/No-Go auditory discrimination paradigm for mice, we show that CL improves and accelerates learning in a unidirectional way. By combining behavioral data with in vivo electrophysiological recordings of the auditory cortex, we demonstrate that neuronal discriminability is enhanced with sequential training. This improvement suggests that CL involves a convergence of common discriminable features in the auditory stimuli shared across tasks of different complexity. Our findings uncover specific properties of CL at the level of neuronal discriminability, distinguishing it from other forms of learning strategies.

">Shox2 is necessary for normal thalamic spindle function</a></h4>

              
                The cellular identity of thalamocortical neurons (TCNs), namely their firing properties, dictates brain-wide activity patterns, such as sleep spindles. Transcription factors are critical to the determination of cellular identity. Previously, we discovered that a subset of TCNs express the transcription factor, Shox2, and, in a global Shox2 KO, established that TCNs within the anterior nucleus of the thalamus rely on the expression of Shox2 to regulate key ion channels that are necessary to maintain their firing properties. From this, we hypothesized that Shox2 expression, through the regulation of firing properties of TCNs, is critical for the thalamocortical circuit to generate spindle oscillations. We exploited the somatosensory thalamocortical circuit to investigate this by creating a primary somatosensory thalamus (VB) Shox2 knockdown mouse model. We delivered Cre into the VB of P21 Shox2fl/fl mice using viral infection and compared in vitro, patch-clamp recordings from Shox2+ and Shox2 knockdown TCNs, finding that Shox2 expression is indeed critical to maintain burst and tonic firing properties of VB TCNs. Since Shox2 is important developmentally and firing from TCNs to cortex during development structures the circuit, we performed ultrasound-guided P3 injections at P3 to generate an early-stage, Shox2 VB knockdown, but found no changes in the layer four, barrel map (VB cortical target). Despite this, Shox2 knockdown mice exhibit reduced sleep-spindle EEG density. Further, key behaviors associated with spindles and proper VB thalamic function, memory consolidation and somatosensory perception, are significantly impaired. These results indicate that the impact on spindle function is likely due to cell autonomous changes to TCNs rather than circuit changes, confirming our hypothesis that Shox2 is necessary for normal thalamic spindle function and implicating a potential role for Shox2 in autism and schizophrenia pathologies.

">Effects Of Extrinsic Reward Based Skill Learning On Motor Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Human motor skill acquisition is improved by performance feedback and coupling such feedback with extrinsic reward (such as money) can enhance skill learning. However, the neurophysiology underlying such behavioral effect is unclear. To bridge this gap, we assessed the effects of reward on multiple forms of motor plasticity during skill learning. Sixty-five healthy participants divided in three groups performed a pinch-grip skill task with sensory feedback only, sensory and reinforcement feedback or both feedback coupled with an extrinsic monetary reward during skill training. To probe motor plasticity, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation on the left primary motor cortex at rest before, during and after training in the three groups. We evaluated the amplitude and variability of corticospinal output, GABA-ergic short-intracortical inhibition and use-dependent plasticity before training and at two time points during and after training. At the behavioral level, monetary reward accelerated skill learning. In parallel, corticospinal output became less variable early on during training in the presence of extrinsic reward. Interestingly, this effect was particularly pronounced for participants who were more sensitive to reward, as evaluated in an independent questionnaire. Other measures of motor excitability remained comparable across groups. These findings highlight that a mechanism underlying the benefit of reward on motor skill learning is the fine tuning of early-training resting-state corticospinal variability.

">Eye Movements in Silent Visual Speech track Unheard Acoustic Signals and Relate to Hearing Experience</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral and neuroscientific studies have shown that watching a speaker's lip movements aids speech comprehension. Intriguingly, even when videos of speakers are presented silently, various cortical regions track auditory features, such as the envelope. Recently, we demonstrated that eye movements track low-level acoustic information when attentively listening to speech. In this study we investigated whether ocular speech tracking occurs during visual speech and how it influences cortical silent speech tracking. Furthermore, we compared the data of hearing individuals with congenitally deaf individuals, and those with acquired deafness or hearing loss (DHH; Deaf or hard of hearing) to assess how auditory deprivation (early vs. late onset) affects neural and ocular speech tracking during silent lip-reading. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we examined ocular and neural speech tracking of 75 participants observing silent videos of a speaker played forward and backward. Our main finding is a clear ocular unheard speech tracking effect with a dominance <1 Hz, which was not present for the lip movements. Similarly, we observed a <=1.3 Hz effect of neural unheard speech tracking in temporal regions for hearing participants. Importantly, neural tracking was not directly linked to ocular tracking in this study. Strikingly, across different listening groups, deaf participants with auditory listening experience showed higher ocular speech tracking than hearing participants, while no ocular speech tracking effect was revealed for congenitally deaf participants in a very small sample. This study extends our previous work by demonstrating the involvement of eye movements in speech processing, even in the absence of acoustic input.

">Early Life Neuroimaging: The Generalizability of Cortical Area Parcellations Across Development</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortex comprises discrete cortical areas that form during development. Accurate area parcellation in neuroimaging studies enhances statistical power and comparability across studies. The formation of cortical areas is influenced by intrinsic embryonic patterning as well as extrinsic inputs, particularly through postnatal exposure. Given the substantial changes in brain volume, microstructure, and functional connectivity during the first years of life, we hypothesized that cortical areas in 1-to-3-year-olds would exhibit major differences from those in neonates and progressively resemble adults as development progresses. Here, we parcellated the cerebral cortex into putative areas using local functional connectivity gradients in 92 toddlers at 2 years old. We demonstrated high reproducibility of these cortical regions across 1-to-3-year-olds in two independent datasets. The area boundaries in 1-to-3-year-olds were more similar to adults than neonates. While the age-specific group parcellation fitted better to the underlying functional connectivity in individuals during the first 3 years, adult area parcellations might still have some utility in developmental studies, especially in children older than 6 years. Additionally, we provided connectivity-based community assignments of the parcels, showing fragmented anterior and posterior components based on the strongest connectivity, yet alignment with adult systems when weaker connectivity was included.

">Omission-responsive neurons encode negative prediction error and probability in the auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Predictive coding posits the brain predicts incoming sensory information and signals prediction errors when actual input differs from expectations. Positive prediction errors occur when input exceeds predictions, while negative prediction errors arise when input falls short. Specific neurons are theorized to encode negative prediction errors, linked to responses to omitted expected inputs. However, the information encoded in omission responses remains unclear. We recorded single-unit activity in rat auditory cortex during an omission paradigm with varying tone probabilities. We identified neurons selectively responding to omissions, with responses increasing with evidence accumulation and correlating with tone predictability; key characteristics of negative prediction-error neurons. Interestingly, these neurons showed selective omission responses but broad tone responses, revealing an asymmetry in error signaling. We propose a circuit model with laterally interconnected prediction-error neurons reproducing this asymmetry. Our model demonstrates that lateral connections enhance precision and efficiency of prediction encoding, supported by the free energy principle

">Progressive overfilling of readily releasable pool underlies short-term facilitation at recurrent excitatory synapses in layer 2/3 of the rat prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Short-term facilitation of recurrent excitatory synapses within the cortical network has been proposed to support persistent activity during working memory tasks, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We characterized short-term plasticity at the local excitatory synapses in layer 2/3 of the rat medial prefrontal cortex and studied its presynaptic mechanisms. Low-frequency stimulation induced slowly developing facilitation, whereas high-frequency stimulation initially induced strong depression followed by rapid facilitation. This non-monotonic delayed facilitation after a brief depression resulted from a high vesicular fusion probability and slow activation of Ca2+-dependent vesicle replenishment, which led to the overfilling of release sites beyond their basal occupancy. Pharmacological and gene knockdown (KD) experiments revealed that the facilitation was mediated by phospholipase C/diacylglycerol signaling and synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7). Notably, Syt7 KD abolished facilitation and slowed the refilling rate of vesicles with high fusion probability. Furthermore, Syt7 deficiency in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons impaired the acquisition of trace fear memory and reduced c-Fos activity. In conclusion, Ca2+- and Syt7-dependent overfilling of release sites mediates synaptic facilitation at L2/3 recurrent excitatory synapses and contributes to temporal associative learning.

">Disrupted development of sensory systems and the cerebellum in a zebrafish ebf3a mutant</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the transcription factor EBF3 results in a neurodevelopmental disorder, and studies in animal models indicate that it has a critical role in neuronal differentiation. The molecular pathways and neuron types disrupted by its loss, however, have not been thoroughly investigated. Nor have the outcomes of these changes on behavior and brain activity. Here, we generated and characterized a zebrafish ebf3a loss-of-function mutant. We discovered morphological and neural phenotypes, including an overall smaller brain size, particularly in the hypothalamus, cerebellum, and hindbrain. Brain function was also compromised, with activity strongly increased in the cerebellum and abnormal behavior at baseline and in response to visual and acoustic stimuli. From RNA-sequencing of developing larvae, notable changes included significant downregulation of genes that mark olfactory sensory neurons, the lateral line, and cerebellar Purkinje neurons. This study sets the stage for determining which downstream pathways underlie the emergence of the observed phenotypes and establishes multiple strong phenotypes that could form the basis of a drug screen.

	<p>The neural basis of tactile processing in humans has been extensively studied; however, the neurophysiological basis of human width discrimination remains relatively unexplored. In particular, the changes that occur in neural networks underlying active tactile width discrimination learning have yet to be described. Here, it is hypothesized that subjects learning to perform the active version of the width discrimination task would present changes in behavioral data and in the neurophysiological activity, specifically in networks of electrodes relevant for tactile and motor processing. The specific hypotheses tested here were that the performance and response latency of subjects would change between the first and the second blocks; the power of the different frequency bands would change between the first and the second blocks; electrode F4 would encode task performance and response latency through changes in the power of the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and low-gamma frequency bands; the relative power in the alpha and beta frequency bands in electrodes C3 and C4 (Interhemispheric Spectral Difference&amp;amp;mdash;ISD) would change because of learning between the first and the second blocks. To test this hypothesis, we recorded and analyzed electroencephalographic (EEG) activity while subjects performed a session where they were tested twice (i.e., two different blocks) in an active tactile width discrimination task using their right index finger. Subjects (n = 18) presented high performances (high discrimination accuracy) already in their first block, and therefore no significant improvements were found in the second block. Meanwhile, a reduction in response latency was observed between the two blocks. EEG recordings revealed an increase in power for the low-gamma frequency band (30&amp;amp;ndash;45 Hz) for electrodes F3 and C3 from the first to the second block. This change was correlated with neither performance nor latency. Analysis of the neural activity in electrode F4 revealed that the beta frequency band encoded the subjects&amp;amp;rsquo; performance. Meanwhile, the delta frequency band in the same electrode revealed a complex pattern where blocks appeared clustered in two different patterns: an Upper Pattern (UP), where power and latency were highly correlated (Rho = 0.950), and a sparser and more uncorrelated Lower Pattern (LP). Blocks belonging to the UP or LP patterns did not differ in performance and were not specific to the first or the second block. However, blocks belonging to the LP presented an increase in response latency, increased variability in performance, and an increased ISD in alpha and beta frequency bands for the pair of electrodes C3&amp;amp;ndash;C4, suggesting that the LP may reflect a state related to increased cognitive load or task difficulty. These results suggest that changes in performance and latency in an active tactile width discrimination task are encoded in the delta, alpha, beta, and low-gamma frequency bands in a fronto-central network. The main contribution of this study is therefore related to the description of neural dynamics in frontal and central networks involved in the learning process of active tactile width discrimination.</p>

	<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) often necessitates frequent clinic visits for stimulation program optimization, with limited experience in remote patient management. Due to the resource-intensive nature of these procedures, we investigated a way to simplify stimulation optimization for these patients that allows for the continuous monitoring of symptoms while also reducing patient burden and travel distances. To this end, we prospectively recruited ten patients treated with DBS for PD to evaluate the feasibility of telemedicinal optimization in a home-based setting. Patients recorded daily videos of a modified Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III, which experienced DBS physicians located at the clinic assessed to provide instructions on adjusting stimulation settings using a handheld programmer with previously set programs as well as patient amplitude control. This study concluded with significant improvements in participants&amp;amp;rsquo; motor status as measured by the UPDRS-III (p = 0.0313) compared to baseline values. These findings suggest that remote video-guided optimization of DBS settings is feasible and may enhance motor outcomes for patients.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) patients are impaired in word production when the word has to be selected among competing alternatives requiring higher attentional resources. In PD, word selection processes are correlated with the structural integrity of the inferior frontal gyrus, which is critical for response selection, and the uncinate fasciculus, which is necessary for processing lexical information. In early PD, we investigated the role of the main cognitive large-scale networks, namely the salience network (SN), the central executive networks (CENs), and the default mode network (DMN), in word selection. Eighteen PD patients and sixteen healthy controls were required to derive nouns from verbs or generate verbs from nouns. Participants also underwent a resting-state functional MRI. Functional connectivity (FC) was examined using independent component analysis. Functional seeds for the SN, CENs, and DMN were defined as spheres, centered at the local activation maximum. Correlations were calculated between the FC of each functional seed and word production. A significant association between SN connectivity and task performance and, with less evidence, between CEN connectivity and the task requiring selection among a larger number of competitors, emerged in the PD group. These findings suggest the involvement of the SN and CEN in word selection in early PD, supporting the hypothesis of impaired executive control.</p>

                <p>Alteration of synaptic function in the dorsal horn (DH) has been implicated as a cellular substrate for the development of neuropathic pain, but certain details remain unclear. In particular, the lack of information on the types of synapses that undergo functional changes hinders the understanding of disease pathogenesis from a synaptic plasticity perspective. Here, we addressed this issue by using optogenetic and retrograde tracing ex vivo to selectively stimulate first-order nociceptors expressing Nav1.8 (NRs<sup>Nav1.8</sup>) and record the responses of spinothalamic tract neurons in spinal lamina I (L1-STTNs). We found that spared nerve injury (SNI) increased excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in L1-STTNs evoked by photostimulation of NRs<sup>Nav1.8</sup> (referred to as Nav1.8-STTN EPSCs). This effect was accompanied by a significant change in the failure rate and paired-pulse ratio of synaptic transmission from NRs<sup>Nav1.8</sup> to L1-STTN and in the frequency (not amplitude) of spontaneous EPSCs recorded in L1-STTNs. However, no change was observed in the ratio of AMPA to NMDA receptor&ndash;mediated components of Nav1.8-STTN EPSCs or in the amplitude of unitary EPSCs constituting Nav1.8-STTN EPSCs recorded with extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> replaced by Sr<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, there was a small increase (approximately 10%) in the number of L1-STTNs showing immunoreactivity for phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases in mice after SNI compared with sham. Similarly, only a small percentage of L1-STTNs showed a lower action potential threshold after SNI. In conclusion, our results show that SNI induces presynaptic modulation at NR<sup>Nav1.8</sup> (consisting of both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors) synapses on L1-STTNs forming the lateral spinothalamic tract.</p>

                <p>Ionic current levels of identified neurons vary substantially across individual animals. Yet, under similar conditions, neural circuit output can be remarkably similar, as evidenced in many motor systems. All neural circuits are influenced by multiple neuromodulators, which provide flexibility to their output. These neuromodulators often overlap in their actions by modulating the same channel type or synapse, yet have neuron-specific actions resulting from distinct receptor expression. Because of this different receptor expression pattern, in the presence of multiple convergent neuromodulators, a common downstream target would be activated more uniformly in circuit neurons across individuals. We therefore propose that a baseline tonic (non-saturating) level of comodulation by convergent neuromodulators can reduce interindividual variability of circuit output. We tested this hypothesis in the pyloric circuit of the crab, <I>Cancer borealis</I>. Multiple excitatory neuropeptides converge to activate the same voltage-gated current in this circuit, but different subsets of pyloric neurons have receptors for each peptide. We quantified the interindividual variability of the unmodulated pyloric circuit output by measuring the activity phases, cycle frequency, and intraburst spike number and frequency. We then examined the variability in the presence of different combinations and concentrations of three neuropeptides. We found that at mid-level concentration (30&nbsp;nM) but not at near-threshold (1&nbsp;nM) or saturating (1&nbsp;&micro;M) concentrations, comodulation by multiple neuropeptides reduced the circuit output variability. Notably, the interindividual variability of response properties of an isolated neuron was not reduced by comodulation, suggesting that the reduction of output variability may emerge as a network effect.</p>

                <p>Homeostatic plasticity represents a set of mechanisms thought to stabilize some function of neural activity. Here, we identified the specific features of cellular or network activity that were maintained after the perturbation of GABAergic blockade in two different systems: mouse cortical neuronal cultures where GABA is inhibitory and motoneurons in the isolated embryonic chick spinal cord where GABA is excitatory (males and females combined in both systems). We conducted a comprehensive analysis of various spiking activity characteristics following GABAergic blockade. We observed significant variability in many features after blocking GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (e.g., burst frequency, burst duration, overall spike frequency in culture). These results are consistent with the idea that neuronal networks achieve activity goals using different strategies (degeneracy). On the other hand, some features were consistently altered after receptor blockade in the spinal cord preparation (e.g., overall spike frequency). Regardless, these features did not express strong homeostatic recoveries when tracking individual preparations over time. One feature showed a consistent change and homeostatic recovery following GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor block. We found that spike rate within a burst (SRWB) increased after receptor block in both the spinal cord preparation and cortical cultures and then returned to baseline within hours. These changes in SRWB occurred at both single cell and population levels. Our findings indicate that the network prioritizes the burst spike rate, which appears to be a variable under tight homeostatic regulation. The result is consistent with the idea that networks can maintain an appropriate behavioral response in the face of challenges.</p>

                Background Public tenders are vital for a country’s GDP and citizens’ quality of life, enabling public administration to achieve various goals. Developing and developed countries allocate over 10% of their GDP to public procurement. This highlights the significant societal support public tenders can provide, making it important to consider how they can further benefit society. Policy and implications Public procurement can achieve policy objectives and benefit society by selecting tenders based on criteria beyond price, such as economic advantage and social benefits. This approach, endorsed by EU directives since 2014, encourages innovation and socially responsible practices. Contracting authorities in the EU can use social, environmental, and qualitative criteria to determine the most advantageous offers. Poland’s Public Procurement Law (PPL) allows contract award criteria based on quality and price, including social aspects. Contracting authorities can specify criteria like employing marginalized groups, though these criteria often face scrutiny and legal challenges. Non-price criteria aim to enhance competition and achieve social, environmental, and economic goals. Recommendations EU and Polish laws permit and encourage using social aspects as contract award criteria in public procurement. However, contracting authorities must analyze priorities, risk balancing, time constraints, and departmental coordination to effectively implement these criteria. This approach can improve the social situation and support specific groups. Conclusions Public procurement significantly influences a country’s economy and quality of life, with EU and Polish laws allowing social criteria in contract awards. Directive 2014/24/EU supports tenders based on economic and social benefits. Poland’s PPL aligns with this, emphasizing marginalized group employment. Effective implementation fosters job creation, social integration, and improved living standards.

                Background: Breast and esophageal cancer are the most aggressive and prominent causes of death worldwide. In addition, these cancers showed resistance to current chemotherapy regimens with limited success rates and fatal outcomes. Recently many studies reported the significant cytotoxic effects of phenolic and terpene fractions extracted from various Prunus species against different cancer cell lines. As a result, it has a good chance to be tested as a complement or replacement for standard chemotherapies. Methods: The study aimed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of phenolic and terpene fractions extracted from Iraqi Prunus arabica on breast (AMJ13) and esophageal (SK-GT-4) cancer cell lines by using the MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide). Analysis using the Chou-Talalay method was performed to assess the synergistic effect between the extracted fractions and chemotherapeutic agent (docetaxel). Moreover, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was conducted for the quantitative determination of different bioactive molecules of both phenolic and terpene fractions in the extract. Results: According to the findings, the treatment modalities significantly decreased cancer cell viability of AMJ13 and SK-GT-4 and had insignificant cytotoxicity on the normal cells (normal human fibroblast cell line) (all less than 50% cytotoxicity). Analysis with Chou-Talalay showed a strong synergism with docetaxel on both cancer cell lines (higher cytotoxicity even in low concentrations) and failed to induce cytotoxicity on the normal cells. Important flavonoid glycosides and terpenoids were detected by HPLC, in particularly, ferulic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, β-sitosterol, and campesterol. Conclusions: In conclusion, the extracted fractions selectively inhibited the proliferation of both cancer cell lines and showed minimal cytotoxicity on normal cells. These fractions could be naturally derived drugs for treating breast and esophageal cancers.

                Abstract Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had significant impacts worldwide, especially among older adults. Frailty is a determinant of susceptibility to morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 in the elderly. This study aimed to determine frailty status and identify factors associated with the suburban elderly population in Cirebon Regency, Indonesia, after the one-year COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional study of community-dwelling individuals aged ≥ 60 years was conducted in Klangenan, Cirebon Regency, Indonesia, from March to June 2021. A questionnaire was used to determine the baseline characteristics of participants, healthcare access, comorbidity, and frailty status. The Ina-FRAIL scale was used to determine the frailty status (frail/non-frail). The chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to determine the association between independent variables and frailty. Results A total of 383 participants were recruited, with a median age of 67 (IQR 64-73) years. The prevalence of frailty in the present study was 10.2%. Multivariate analysis showed that age (OR 2.73; 95%CI 1.21-6.12), multimorbidity (OR 7.86; 95% CI 3.01-20.57) and financial dependence (OR 13.40, 95% CI 5.66-31.73) were significantly associated with frailty. Conclusion One-year COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable burden on frailty among the suburban elderly population in Indonesia. The factors associated with frailty were age, multimorbidity, and financial dependence.

                Background Currently, there is no objective and quantified measurement for detecting blood clots during extraction socket hemostasis. It has relied solely on clinical observation, even when conducting clinical research by using extraction sockets as samples. This study aimed to assess the in vitro reliability and clinical-relevant validity of a new objective measurement providing quantified data called blood clot detection (BCD) using a standard capillary tube. Methods The in vitro part of the study was conducted using surplus blood samples from ten healthy participants. Two identical sets of blood samples in simulation reservoirs mimicking bleeding sockets were prepared for reliability tests. Then, the capillary tubes were concurrently placed in the reservoirs. The blood-filled distances were measured. The part of clinical-relevant validity study was conducted in sixteen extraction sockets from each healthy participant. Clinical observation and BCD measurement were evaluated by two calibrated assessors. The total duration of the assessment was a 30-minute. Results The distances of the blood-filled capillary tube were decreased by time. Test and retest reliability analysis of the BCD measurement showed an excellent intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.980 (0.968 to 0.988). The medians of blood-filled distance categorized by clinical observation into active bleeding, sluggish oozing, and clot formation were 13.0 mm (Q1 = 11.7, Q3 = 13.8), 5.6 mm (Q1 = 4.3, Q3 = 7.0), and 0.9 mm (Q1 = 0.5, Q3 = 1.3), respectively. The blood-filled distance of the clot formation group was significantly less than the active bleeding and sluggish oozing (p<0.001). Therefore, the BCD measurement also significantly indicated the completion of extraction socket hemostasis Conclusions A distance of blood-filled in capillary tube of 0.9 mm from the BCD measurement significantly ensured complete clot formation. The BCD measurement proved to be a quantified tool for objectively measuring hemostasis of bleeding socket.

Methodology The chemical identification was performed by Ultra-High Liquid Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry, whereas the Total Phenolic content and Total Flavonoid quantification were measured through UV spectrometry. Results As a result, 19 substances were identified, which are mostly included within the group of condensed tannins, phenolic acids and flavonoids, such as procyanidins, chlorogenic acid and luteolin. Conclusion The identification of the main substances of F. pertusa’s bark and the measurement of its polyphenols content can guide the understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms involved in its ethnomedicinal uses.

                Background Reverse Transcriptase (RT) enzymes have been extensively utilized, especially in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Many viruses that cause infections worldwide contain ribonucleic acid (RNA), and for their molecular detection, it is essential to convert RNA to DNA using RT. This study aimed to create and characterize a thermostable Moloney Murine Reverse Transcriptase (MMLV-RT) enzyme by using consensus sequences from the latest MMLV-RT sequence database. Methodology The six latest sequences encoding MMLV-RT were retrieved from the NCBI website, and the consensus sequence was determined and cloned into the pET28a (+) vector. The vector was overexpressed in an E. coli expression system. The enzyme obtained was purified using Talon accept resin. The purified enzyme was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting. The enzyme performance was evaluated by performing PCR on 89 SARS-CoV 2 positive samples and 40 negative samples both in a concentrated state and at a dilution factor of x10−1. The performance was compared with that of the commercial enzyme, a commercial RT enzyme kit, and Superscript (Invitrogen). Results The enzyme was successfully expressed in E. coli. The concentration of MMLV-RT used was 0.313 mg/mL. The concentrated enzyme detected 98.9% of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, whereas the diluted RT enzyme detected 92.1% of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In contrast, the diagnostic specificity was 98% for concentrated RT and 95% for diluted RT. This showed that the recombinant in-house MMLV-RT enzyme prototype could be used for the PCR amplification of viral RNA. (Figure 3) Conclusion We successfully produced a recombinant MMLV-RT enzyme whose performance was comparable to that of standard commercial reverse transcriptase (P <0.0001).

                The material extrusion process has been widely used to manufacture custom products. However, the surface texture varies due to the additive mechanism of the process, which depends on the layer height and surface orientation, resulting in varying average surface roughness values for inclined, flat and vertical surfaces. Different strand welding conditions result in non-uniform internal stresses, surface distortions, layer traces, weak bonding, non-uniform pores and material overflow. This paper comprehensively examines material extrusion process achievements in surface texture quality and studies and summarises the most influential processing parameters. Parameter effects are critically discussed for each topic; flat, inclined, and vertical surfaces. The results of this research help reduce post-processing.

                Tuberculous mastitis (TM) is a rare form of tuberculosis, occurring as a primary disease when there is no evidence of tuberculosis in other locations. There are no clear clinical features of TM, especially in the absence of a previous tuberculosis infection. Due to its unclear clinical picture, diagnosis is difficult, and it is often confused with breast carcinoma or pyogenic abscesses. The aim of this study was to report our experience and discuss the characteristics and diagnostic modalities in cases of primary TM in a tuberculosis-endemic area. Method A case series study was conducted at the Arifin Achmad Regional Hospital, reporting four cases of primary tuberculous mastitis in January 2024. The patients were women aged 24-41 years. Case presentation All patients presented with complaints of breast pain for the last 2 weeks to 2 months and complained of symptoms in the form of a lump in the breast that was reddish in colour and mastalgia. One patient was diagnosed during pregnancy, and one had a history of prior breastfeeding. One patient presented with FNAB results for breast carcinoma. The other patient complained of an ulcer on her breast. Physical examination revealed axillary lymphadenopathy in all patients. Histopathological examination revealed tuberculous mastitis in all patients and 1 with tuberculous mastitis, fibrocystic changes, and Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia (ADH). Conclusion Patients with tuberculous mastitis who visited our institution had symptoms similar to those of abscesses and breast cancer. The FNAC test is the most reliable, but false-negative results can occur. Diagnosis requires teamwork between the patient’s doctor, anatomical pathologist, and radiologist. This research requires a larger scale to describe actual conditions.

                Background Supply chain risk management is crucial for the consumer products industry due to its vulnerability to uncertainties and risks. This study investigates the relationship between supply chain risks and performance among SMEs in the ASEAN countries. Supply chain performance, defined as meeting end-customer demands, involves ensuring commodity availability, on-time deliveries, and maintaining sufficient inventory and capacity across organizational boundaries from raw materials to the final consumer. Methods The study utilized a sample of 385 entrepreneurs from the consumer products industry in ASEAN countries. The research was analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to establish the correlation between supply chain performance and risks. Factors related to the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) for economic integration and regional trade agreements were incorporated to understand the diverse economic development, infrastructure, and regulatory environments across nations. Results The analysis revealed a strong correlation between supply chain risks and performance. Entrepreneurs in the consumer products industry should collaborate closely with governmental organizations to address the unique challenges posed by regulatory landscapes, cross-border logistics, and geopolitical risks within the ASEAN region. Adapting to cultural nuances and market variations, along with optimizing logistics and infrastructure, are crucial for successful supply chain risk management. Conclusions Effective supply chain risk management significantly enhances the performance of the consumer products industry’s supply chain. Entrepreneurs in this sector should align their strategies with regional and national governments to proactively address issues and mitigate risks. Continuous monitoring and adaptive measures are necessary to handle emerging risks in the dynamic market landscape. The study provides valuable insights for policymakers, suggesting that supportive frameworks and policies are necessary to bolster SME capabilities in risk management. By fostering a collaborative environment between the public and private sectors, ASEAN countries can enhance overall supply chain resilience. Future research could explore sector-specific risk management practices and their impact on supply chain robustness, underscoring the imperative for SMEs to adopt proactive and integrated risk management approaches to thrive in a complex and evolving economic environment.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disease exhibiting aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow. The effects of treatments for MM vary between patients, highlighting the importance of developing prognostic models for informed therapeutic decision-making. Most previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring the fact that the dysfunction of the pathway is closely associated with disease development and progression. The present study considered two strategies that construct predictive models by taking pathway information into consideration: pathway score method and group lasso using pathway information. The former simply converted gene expression to sample-wise pathway scores for model fitting. We considered three methods for pathway score calculation (ssGSEA, GSVA, and z-scores) and 14 data sources providing pathway information. We implemented these methods in microarray data for MM (GSE136324) and obtained a candidate model with the best prediction performance in interval validation. The candidate model is further compared with the gene-based model and previously published models in two external data. We also investigated the effects of missing values on prediction. The results showed that group lasso incorporating Vax pathway information (Vax(grp)) was more competitive in prediction than the gene model in both internal and external validation. Immune information, including VAX pathways, seemed to be more predictive for MM. Vax(grp) also outperformed the previously published models. Moreover, the new model was more resistant to missing values, and the presence of missing values (<5%) would not evidently deteriorate its prediction accuracy using our missing data imputation method. In a nutshell, pathway-based models (using group lasso) were competitive alternatives to gene-based models for MM. These models were documented in an R package (https://github.com/ShuoStat/MMMs), where a missing data imputation method was also integrated to facilitate future validation.

                <p>by Ahmadou Sylla, Christine Chevillon, Ramsès Djidjiou-Demasse, Ousmane Seydi, Carlos A. Vargas Campos, Magdalene Dogbe, Kayla M. Fast, Jennifer L. Pechal, Alex Rakestraw, Matthew E. Scott, Michael W. Sandel, Heather Jordan, Mark Eric Benbow, Jean-François Guégan</p>

Pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and viruses are important components of soil and aquatic communities, where they can benefit from decaying and living organic matter, and may opportunistically infect human and animal hosts. One-third of human infectious diseases is constituted by sapronotic disease agents that are natural inhabitants of soil or aquatic ecosystems. They are capable of existing and reproducing in the environment outside of the host for extended periods of time. However, as ecological research on sapronosis is infrequent and epidemiological models are even rarer, very little information is currently available. Their importance is overlooked in medical and veterinary research, as well as the relationships between free environmental forms and those that are pathogenic. Here, using dynamical models in realistic aquatic metacommunity systems, we analyze sapronosis transmission, using the human pathogen <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> that is responsible for Buruli ulcer. We show that the persistence of bacilli in aquatic ecosystems is driven by a seasonal upstream supply, and that the attachment and development of cells to aquatic living forms is essential for such pathogen persistence and population dynamics. Our work constitutes the first set of metacommunity models of sapronotic disease transmission, and is highly flexible for adaptation to other types of sapronosis. The importance of sapronotic agents on animal and human disease burden needs better understanding and new models of sapronosis disease ecology to guide the management and prevention of this important group of pathogens.

While most individuals suffer progressive disease following HIV infection, a small fraction spontaneously controls the infection. Although CD8 T-cells have been implicated in this natural control, their mechanistic roles are yet to be established. Here, we combined mathematical modeling and analysis of previously published data from 16 SIV-infected macaques, of which 12 were natural controllers, to elucidate the role of CD8 T-cells in natural control. For each macaque, we considered, in addition to the canonical <i>in vivo</i> plasma viral load and SIV DNA data, longitudinal <i>ex vivo</i> measurements of the virus suppressive capacity of CD8 T-cells. Available mathematical models do not allow analysis of such combined <i>in vivo</i>-<i>ex vivo</i> datasets. We explicitly modeled the <i>ex vivo</i> assay, derived analytical approximations that link the <i>ex vivo</i> measurements with the <i>in vivo</i> effector function of CD8-T cells, and integrated them with an <i>in vivo</i> model of virus dynamics, thus developing a new learning framework that enabled the analysis. Our model fit the data well and estimated the recruitment rate and/or maximal killing rate of CD8 T-cells to be up to 2-fold higher in controllers than non-controllers (p = 0.013). Importantly, the cumulative suppressive capacity of CD8 T-cells over the first 4–6 weeks of infection was associated with virus control (Spearman’s ρ = -0.51; p = 0.05). Thus, our analysis identified the early cumulative suppressive capacity of CD8 T-cells as a predictor of natural control. Furthermore, simulating a large virtual population, our model quantified the minimum capacity of this early CD8 T-cell response necessary for long-term control. Our study presents new, quantitative insights into the role of CD8 T-cells in the natural control of HIV infection and has implications for remission strategies.

Zebrafish have become an essential model organism in screening for developmental neurotoxic chemicals and their molecular targets. The success of zebrafish as a screening model is partially due to their physical characteristics including their relatively simple nervous system, rapid development, experimental tractability, and genetic diversity combined with technical advantages that allow for the generation of large amounts of high-dimensional behavioral data. These data are complex and require advanced machine learning and statistical techniques to comprehensively analyze and capture spatiotemporal responses. To accomplish this goal, we have trained semi-supervised deep autoencoders using behavior data from unexposed larval zebrafish to extract quintessential “normal” behavior. Following training, our network was evaluated using data from larvae shown to have significant changes in behavior (using a traditional statistical framework) following exposure to toxicants that include nanomaterials, aromatics, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and other environmental contaminants. Further, our model identified new chemicals (Perfluoro-n-octadecanoic acid, 8-Chloroperfluorooctylphosphonic acid, and Nonafluoropentanamide) as capable of inducing abnormal behavior at multiple chemical-concentrations pairs not captured using distance moved alone. Leveraging this deep learning model will allow for better characterization of the different exposure-induced behavioral phenotypes, facilitate improved genetic and neurobehavioral analysis in mechanistic determination studies and provide a robust framework for analyzing complex behaviors found in higher-order model systems.

Understanding sensory processing relies on the establishment of a consistent relationship between the stimulus space, its neural representation, and perceptual quality. In olfaction, the difficulty in establishing these links lies partly in the complexity of the underlying odor input space and perceptual responses. Based on the recently proposed primacy model for concentration invariant odor identity representation and a few assumptions, we have developed a theoretical framework for mapping the odor input space to the response properties of olfactory receptors. We analyze a geometrical structure containing odor representations in a multidimensional space of receptor affinities and describe its low-dimensional implementation, the primacy hull. We propose the implications of the primacy hull for the structure of feedforward connectivity in early olfactory networks. We test the predictions of our theory by comparing the existing receptor-ligand affinity and connectivity data obtained in the fruit fly olfactory system. We find that the Kenyon cells of the insect mushroom body integrate inputs from the high-affinity (primacy) sets of olfactory receptors in agreement with the primacy theory.

In 2024, all biology is computational biology. Computer-aided analysis continues to spread into new fields, becoming more accessible to researchers trained in the wet lab who are eager to take advantage of growing datasets, falling costs, and novel assays that present new opportunities for discovery. It is currently much easier to find guidance for implementing these techniques than for reporting their use, leaving biologists to guess which details and files are relevant. In this essay, we review existing literature on the topic, summarize common tips, and link to additional resources for training. Following this overview, we then provide a set of recommendations for sharing code, with an eye toward guiding those who are comparatively new to applying open science principles to their computational work. Taken together, we provide a guide for biologists who seek to follow code sharing best practices but are unsure where to start.

Mitosis is an important process in the cell cycle required for cells to divide. Never in mitosis (NIMA)-like kinases (NEKs) are regulators of mitotic functions in diverse organisms. <i>Plasmodium</i> spp., the causative agent of malaria is a divergent unicellular haploid eukaryote with some unusual features in terms of its mitotic and nuclear division cycle that presumably facilitate proliferation in varied environments. For example, during the sexual stage of male gametogenesis that occurs within the mosquito host, an atypical rapid closed endomitosis is observed. Three rounds of genome replication from 1N to 8N and successive cycles of multiple spindle formation and chromosome segregation occur within 8 min followed by karyokinesis to generate haploid gametes. Our previous <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> kinome screen identified 4 <i>Nek</i> genes, of which 2, NEK2 and NEK4, are required for meiosis. NEK1 is likely to be essential for mitosis in asexual blood stage schizogony in the vertebrate host, but its function during male gametogenesis is unknown. Here, we study NEK1 location and function, using live cell imaging, ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM), and electron microscopy, together with conditional gene knockdown and proteomic approaches. We report spatiotemporal NEK1 location in real-time, coordinated with microtubule organising centre (MTOC) dynamics during the unusual mitoses at various stages of the <i>Plasmodium</i> spp. life cycle. Knockdown studies reveal NEK1 to be an essential component of the MTOC in male cell differentiation, associated with rapid mitosis, spindle formation, and kinetochore attachment. These data suggest that <i>P</i>. <i>berghei</i> NEK1 kinase is an important component of MTOC organisation and essential regulator of chromosome segregation during male gamete formation.

Virulence of apicomplexan parasites is based on their ability to divide rapidly to produce significant biomass. The regulation of their cell cycle is therefore key to their pathogenesis. Phosphorylation is a crucial posttranslational modification that regulates many aspects of the eukaryotic cell cycle. The phosphatase PP1 is known to play a major role in the phosphorylation balance in eukaryotes. We explored the role of TgPP1 during the cell cycle of the tachyzoite form of the apicomplexan parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. Using a conditional mutant strain, we show that TgPP1 regulates many aspects of the cell cycle including the proper assembly of the daughter cells’ inner membrane complex (IMC), the segregation of organelles, and nuclear division. Unexpectedly, depletion of TgPP1 also results in the accumulation of amylopectin, a storage polysaccharide that is usually found in the latent bradyzoite form of the parasite. Using transcriptomics and phospho-proteomics, we show that TgPP1 mainly acts through posttranslational mechanisms by dephosphorylating target proteins including IMC proteins. TgPP1 also dephosphorylates a protein bearing a starch-binding domain. Mutagenesis analysis reveals that the targeted phospho-sites are linked to the ability of the parasite to regulate amylopectin steady-state levels. Therefore, we show that TgPP1 has pleiotropic roles during the tachyzoite cell cycle regulation, but also regulates amylopectin accumulation.

Hallucinations and perceptual abnormalities in psychosis are thought to arise from imbalanced integration of prior information and sensory inputs. We combined psychophysics, Bayesian modeling, and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate potential changes in perceptual and causal inference in response to audiovisual flash-beep sequences in medicated individuals with schizophrenia who exhibited limited psychotic symptoms. Seventeen participants with schizophrenia and 23 healthy controls reported either the number of flashes or the number of beeps of audiovisual sequences that varied in their audiovisual numeric disparity across trials. Both groups balanced sensory integration and segregation in line with Bayesian causal inference rather than resorting to simpler heuristics. Both also showed comparable weighting of prior information regarding the signals’ causal structure, although the schizophrenia group slightly overweighted prior information about the number of flashes or beeps. At the neural level, both groups computed Bayesian causal inference through dynamic encoding of independent estimates of the flash and beep counts, followed by estimates that flexibly combine audiovisual inputs. Our results demonstrate that the core neurocomputational mechanisms for audiovisual perceptual and causal inference in number estimation tasks are largely preserved in our limited sample of medicated post-acute individuals with schizophrenia. Future research should explore whether these findings generalize to unmedicated patients with acute psychotic symptoms.

The information contained in population genomic data can tell us much about the past ecology and evolution of species. We leveraged detailed phenotypic and genomic data of nearly all living kākāpō to understand the evolution of its feather color polymorphism. The kākāpō is an endangered and culturally significant parrot endemic to Aotearoa New Zealand, and the green and olive feather colorations are present at similar frequencies in the population. The presence of such a neatly balanced color polymorphism is remarkable because the entire population currently numbers less than 250 birds, which means it has been exposed to severe genetic drift. We dissected the color phenotype, demonstrating that the two colors differ in their light reflectance patterns due to differential feather structure. We used quantitative genomics methods to identify two genetic variants whose epistatic interaction can fully explain the species’ color phenotype. Our genomic forward simulations show that balancing selection might have been pivotal to establish the polymorphism in the ancestrally large population, and to maintain it during population declines that involved a severe bottleneck. We hypothesize that an extinct apex predator was the likely agent of balancing selection, making the color polymorphism in the kākāpō a “ghost of selection past.”

                Introduction Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare disease characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms and peripheral eosinophilia. It can affect any layer of the gastrointestinal tract. Mucosal, muscular, and sub-serosal subtypes of eosinophilic infiltration are distinguished based on their infiltration depth. Ascites is a characteristic feature of sub-serosal eosinophilic gastroenteritis. However, isolated ascites is a very rare presentation of the disease, making diagnosis challenging. Case presentation In this case report, we present a 25-year-old female eosinophilic gastroenteritis patient who initially presented with symptoms and signs of ascites. She also reported seasonal rhinitis, which has been associated with eosinophilic gastroenteritis. She responded effectively to treatment with prednisolone. Conclusions This case report highlights the importance of considering rare diseases like eosinophilic gastroenteritis in the differential diagnosis of ascites. Treatment typically involves dietary modifications and corticosteroids. This case also contributes to our understanding of this rare initial presentation of the disease.

                Background Low back pain (LBP), the primary cause of disability, is the most common musculoskeletal disorder globally and the primary cause of disability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are inconclusive and less sensitive for identifying and classifying patients with LBP. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the role of artificial intelligence (AI) models in the prediction of LBP using T2 weighted MRI image of the lumbar spine. Methods This was a prospective case-control study. A total of 200 MRI patients (100 cases and controls each) referred for lumbar spine and whole spine screening were included. The scans were performed using 3.0 Tesla MRI (United Imaging Healthcare). T2 weighted images of the lumbar spine were segmented to extract radiomic features. Machine learning (ML) models, such as random forest, decision tree, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, adaboost, and deep learning methods (DL), such as ResNet and GoogleNet, were used, and performance measures were calculated. Results Our study showed that Random forest and AdaBoost are the most reliable ML models for predicting LBP. Random forest showed high performance with area under curve (AUC) values from 0.83 to 0.88 across all lumbar vertebrae and L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5 intervertebral discs (IVDs), with AUCs of 0.88 the highest at L5-S1 IVD (0.92). Adaboost demonstrated high performance at the L2-L5 vertebrae with AUC values of 0.82 to 0.90, with the highest AUC (0.97) at the L5-S1 IVD. Among the DL models, GoogleNet outperformed the other models at 30 epochs with an accuracy of 0.85, followed by ResNet 18 (30 epochs) with an accuracy of 0.84. Conclusion The study demonstrated that ML and DL models can effectively predict LBP from MRI T2 weighted image of the lumbar spine. ML and DL models could also enhance the diagnostic accuracy of LBP, potentially leading to better patient management and outcomes.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neurons establish functional connections responsible for how we perceive and react to the world around us. Communication from a neuron to its target cell occurs through a long projection called an axon. Axon distances can exceed 1 m in length in humans and require a dynamic microtubule cytoskeleton for growth during development and maintenance in adulthood. Stathmins are microtubule-associated proteins that function as relays between kinase signaling and microtubule polymerization. In this review, we describe the prolific role of Stathmins in microtubule homeostasis with an emphasis on emerging roles for Stathmin-2 (Stmn2) in axon integrity and neurodegeneration. Stmn2 levels are altered in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and loss of Stmn2 provokes motor and sensory neuropathies. There is growing potential for employing Stmn2 as a disease biomarker or even a therapeutic target. Meeting this potential requires a mechanistic understanding of emerging complexity in Stmn2 function. In particular, Stmn2 palmitoylation has a surprising contribution to axon maintenance through undefined mechanisms linking membrane association, tubulin interaction, and axon transport. Exploring these connections will reveal new insight on neuronal cell biology and novel opportunities for disease intervention.</p>

                Stress-related disorders are among the biggest global health challenges. Despite significant progress in understanding their neurocognitive basis, the promise of applying insights from fundamental research to prevention and treatment remains largely unfulfilled. We argue that neurofeedback – a method for training voluntary control over brain activity – has the potential to fill this translational gap. We provide a contemporary perspective on neurofeedback as endogenous neuromodulation that can target complex brain network dynamics, is transferable to real-world scenarios outside a laboratory or treatment facility, can be trained prospectively, and is individually adaptable. This makes neurofeedback a prime candidate for a personalized preventive neuroscience-based intervention strategy that focuses on the ecological momentary neuromodulation of stress-related brain networks in response to actual stressors in real life.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93887">Individuals with anxiety and depression use atypical decision strategies in an uncertain world</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies on reinforcement learning have identified three prominent phenomena: (1) individuals with anxiety or depression exhibit a reduced learning rate compared to healthy subjects; (2) learning rates may increase or decrease in environments with rapidly changing (i.e. volatile) or stable feedback conditions, a phenomenon termed <i>learning rate adaptation</i>; and (3) reduced learning rate adaptation is associated with several psychiatric disorders. In other words, multiple learning rate parameters are needed to account for behavioral differences across participant populations and volatility contexts in this flexible learning rate (FLR) model. Here, we propose an alternative explanation, suggesting that behavioral variation across participant populations and volatile contexts arises from the use of mixed decision strategies. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a mixture-of-strategies (MOS) model and used it to analyze the behaviors of 54 healthy controls and 32 patients with anxiety and depression in volatile reversal learning tasks. Compared to the FLR model, the MOS model can reproduce the three classic phenomena by using a single set of strategy preference parameters without introducing any learning rate differences. In addition, the MOS model can successfully account for several novel behavioral patterns that cannot be explained by the FLR model. Preferences for different strategies also predict individual variations in symptom severity. These findings underscore the importance of considering mixed strategy use in human learning and decision-making and suggest atypical strategy preference as a potential mechanism for learning deficits in psychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94144">Distinguishing mutants that resist drugs via different mechanisms by examining fitness tradeoffs</a></h4>

              
                There is growing interest in designing multidrug therapies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. Tradeoffs are common in evolution and occur when, for example, resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another. Major questions remain about the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable, specifically, whether the mutants that provide resistance to a given drug all suffer similar tradeoffs. This question is difficult because the drug-resistant mutants observed in the clinic, and even those evolved in controlled laboratory settings, are often biased towards those that provide large fitness benefits. Thus, the mutations (and mechanisms) that provide drug resistance may be more diverse than current data suggests. Here, we perform evolution experiments utilizing lineage-tracking to capture a fuller spectrum of mutations that give yeast cells a fitness advantage in fluconazole, a common antifungal drug. We then quantify fitness tradeoffs for each of 774 evolved mutants across 12 environments, finding these mutants group into classes with characteristically different tradeoffs. Their unique tradeoffs may imply that each group of mutants affects fitness through different underlying mechanisms. Some of the groupings we find are surprising. For example, we find some mutants that resist single drugs do not resist their combination, while others do. And some mutants to the same gene have different tradeoffs than others. These findings, on one hand, demonstrate the difficulty in relying on consistent or intuitive tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments. On the other hand, by demonstrating that hundreds of adaptive mutations can be reduced to a few groups with characteristic tradeoffs, our findings may yet empower multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. More generally speaking, by grouping mutants that likely affect fitness through similar underlying mechanisms, our work guides efforts to map the phenotypic effects of mutation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88344">A three filament mechanistic model of musculotendon force and impedance</a></h4>

              
                The force developed by actively lengthened muscle depends on different structures across different scales of lengthening. For small perturbations, the active response of muscle is well captured by a linear-time-invariant (LTI) system: a stiff spring in parallel with a light damper. The force response of muscle to longer stretches is better represented by a compliant spring that can fix its end when activated. Experimental work has shown that the stiffness and damping (impedance) of muscle in response to small perturbations is of fundamental importance to motor learning and mechanical stability, while the huge forces developed during long active stretches are critical for simulating and predicting injury. Outside of motor learning and injury, muscle is actively lengthened as a part of nearly all terrestrial locomotion. Despite the functional importance of impedance and active lengthening, no single muscle model has all these mechanical properties. In this work, we present the viscoelastic-crossbridge active-titin (VEXAT) model that can replicate the response of muscle to length changes great and small. To evaluate the VEXAT model, we compare its response to biological muscle by simulating experiments that measure the impedance of muscle, and the forces developed during long active stretches. In addition, we have also compared the responses of the VEXAT model to a popular Hill-type muscle model. The VEXAT model more accurately captures the impedance of biological muscle and its responses to long active stretches than a Hill-type model and can still reproduce the force-velocity and force-length relations of muscle. While the comparison between the VEXAT model and biological muscle is favorable, there are some phenomena that can be improved: the low frequency phase response of the model, and a mechanism to support passive force enhancement.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95443">Mechanical force of uterine occupation enables large vesicle extrusion from proteostressed maternal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Large vesicle extrusion from neurons may contribute to spreading pathogenic protein aggregates and promoting inflammatory responses, two mechanisms leading to neurodegenerative disease. Factors that regulate the extrusion of large vesicles, such as exophers produced by proteostressed <i>C. elegans</i> touch neurons, are poorly understood. Here, we document that mechanical force can significantly potentiate exopher extrusion from proteostressed neurons. Exopher production from the <i>C. elegans</i> ALMR neuron peaks at adult day 2 or 3, coinciding with the <i>C. elegans</i> reproductive peak. Genetic disruption of <i>C. elegans</i> germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early embryo production can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from the ALMR neurons during the peak period. Conversely, restoring egg production at the late reproductive phase through mating with males or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions that block egg-laying can strongly increase ALMR exopher production. Overall, genetic interventions that promote ALMR exopher production are associated with expanded uterus lengths and genetic interventions that suppress ALMR exopher production are associated with shorter uterus lengths. In addition to the impact of fertilized eggs, ALMR exopher production can be enhanced by filling the uterus with oocytes, dead eggs, or even fluid, supporting that distention consequences, rather than the presence of fertilized eggs, constitute the exopher-inducing stimulus. We conclude that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons. Our observations draw attention to the potential importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and in aggregate spreading mechanisms, making a case for enhanced attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93604">Glial ferritin maintains neural stem cells via transporting iron required for self-renewal in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Stem cell niche is critical for regulating the behavior of stem cells. <i>Drosophila</i> neural stem cells (Neuroblasts, NBs) are encased by glial niche cells closely, but it still remains unclear whether glial niche cells can regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of NBs. Here, we show that ferritin produced by glia, cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NBs for the energy production, which is essential to the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs. The knockdown of glial ferritin encoding genes causes energy shortage in NBs via downregulating aconitase activity and NAD<sup>+</sup> level, which leads to the low proliferation and premature differentiation of NBs mediated by Prospero entering nuclei. More importantly, ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression. In addition, the level of glial ferritin production is affected by the status of NBs, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis. In this study, we demonstrate that glial cells are indispensable to maintain the self-renewal of NBs, unveiling a novel role of the NB glial niche during brain development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94198">Speech-induced suppression and vocal feedback sensitivity in human cortex</a></h4>

              
                Across the animal kingdom, neural responses in the auditory cortex are suppressed during vocalization, and humans are no exception. A common hypothesis is that suppression increases sensitivity to auditory feedback, enabling the detection of vocalization errors. This hypothesis has been previously confirmed in non-human primates, however a direct link between auditory suppression and sensitivity in human speech monitoring remains elusive. To address this issue, we obtained intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production. We first characterized the detailed topography of auditory suppression, which varied across superior temporal gyrus (STG). Next, we performed a delayed auditory feedback (DAF) task to determine whether the suppressed sites were also sensitive to auditory feedback alterations. Indeed, overlapping sites showed enhanced responses to feedback, indicating sensitivity. Importantly, there was a strong correlation between the degree of auditory suppression and feedback sensitivity, suggesting suppression might be a key mechanism that underlies speech monitoring. Further, we found that when participants produced speech with simultaneous auditory feedback, posterior STG was selectively activated if participants were engaged in a DAF paradigm, suggesting that increased attentional load can modulate auditory feedback sensitivity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91002">DBT is a metabolic switch for maintenance of proteostasis under proteasomal impairment</a></h4>

              
                Proteotoxic stress impairs cellular homeostasis and underlies the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The proteasomal and autophagic degradation of proteins are two major pathways for protein quality control in the cell. Here, we report a genome-wide CRISPR screen uncovering a major regulator of cytotoxicity resulting from the inhibition of the proteasome. Dihydrolipoamide branched chain transacylase E2 (DBT) was found to be a robust suppressor, the loss of which protects against proteasome inhibition-associated cell death through promoting clearance of ubiquitinated proteins. Loss of DBT altered the metabolic and energetic status of the cell and resulted in activation of autophagy in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent mechanism in the presence of proteasomal inhibition. Loss of DBT protected against proteotoxicity induced by ALS-linked mutant TDP-43 in <i>Drosophila</i> and mammalian neurons. DBT is upregulated in the tissues of ALS patients. These results demonstrate that DBT is a master switch in the metabolic control of protein quality control with implications in neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96013">Male cuticular pheromones stimulate removal of the mating plug and promote re-mating through pC1 neurons in Drosophila females</a></h4>

              
                In birds and insects, the female uptakes sperm for a specific duration post-copulation known as the ejaculate holding period (EHP) before expelling unused sperm and the mating plug through sperm ejection. In this study, we found that <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> females shortens the EHP when incubated with males or mated females shortly after the first mating. This phenomenon, which we termed <span class="underline">m</span>ale-<span class="underline">i</span>nduced <span class="underline">E</span>HP <span class="underline">s</span>hortening (MIES), requires Or47b+ olfactory and ppk23+ gustatory neurons, activated by 2-methyltetracosane and 7-tricosene, respectively. These odorants raise cAMP levels in pC1 neurons, responsible for processing male courtship cues and regulating female mating receptivity. Elevated cAMP levels in pC1 neurons reduce EHP and reinstate their responsiveness to male courtship cues, promoting re-mating with faster sperm ejection. This study established MIES as a genetically tractable model of sexual plasticity with a conserved neural mechanism.

">Systemic injection of scopolamine increased the variability of temporal prediction in head-fixed mice.</a></h4>

              
                Several theories propose a close relationship between interval timing and the temporal properties of memory. Systemic administration of scopolamine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, is known to induce memory deficits and impair temporal prediction. However, existing studies on timing using free-moving animals are challenging to interpret due to the confounding effects of movement on interval timing. In this study, we examined the effects of scopolamine on timing behavior in mice using a head-fixed experimental setup. Mice were trained on a fixed-time schedule task with a peak procedure, where a 10% sucrose solution was delivered every 10 seconds through a spout placed within the licking distance of the mice. Following training, the mice exhibited anticipatory licking behavior in response to the timing of sucrose delivery, indicating that they could predict the reward timing. Systemic administration of scopolamine increased the variability of temporal prediction in a dose-dependent manner but did not affect the mean temporal prediction. Single-trial bout analysis revealed that scopolamine impaired the duration of licking bouts without affecting the total number of licks in peak trials, suggesting that the mice were unable to sustain licking at the spout. Additionally, we assessed the effects of scopolamine on spontaneous locomotor activity and excretion in a free-moving open-field task. Scopolamine injections increased locomotor activity and decreased fecal output. Taken together, these findings suggest that the increased variability in timing behavior induced by scopolamine may be attributed to changes in transitions between behavioral states.

">Generating human parvalbumin interneurons through 3D glia reprogramming</a></h4>

              
                Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are crucial for synaptic plasticity, and their damage or loss is linked to various neurological disorders. Yet, generating these cells of human source in vitro is challenging, limiting advancements in cell repair and disease modelling. We introduce a novel approach to derive human PV neurons through direct reprogramming of glial precursor cells (GPCs). Using ectopic expression of GABAergic neuronal genes, GPCs efficiently convert into GABAergic interneurons in 3D culture environment within weeks and achieve functional neuronal maturity. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing identified a distinct PV neuronal cluster with high maturity and characteristics of PV chandelier subclass that are equivalent to bona fide human interneurons. Trajectory analysis revealed a distinct glia-to-PV interneuron conversion pathway, involving several new transitory genes, with potential for functional importance for PV derivation. Our data introduces a new strategy for generating human PV interneurons, promising significant implications for future generation of patient-specific PV neurons both in vitro and in vivo.

	<p>Objective: Nimodipine still represents a unique selling point in the prevention of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Its intrathecal effect is limited by a low oral bioavailability, leading to the development of nanocarrier systems to overcome this limitation. This study investigated the ultrasound-induced release profile of nimodipine from drug-loaded copolymers in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within 72 h after a singular versus repeated sonication. Methods: Pluronic&amp;amp;reg; F127 copolymers (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany)were loaded with nimodipine by direct dissolution. Spontaneous and on-demand drug release by ultrasound (1 MHz at 1.7 W/cm2) was determined in artificial cerebrospinal fluid using the dialysis bag method. Nimodipine concentrations were measured at predefined time points within 72 h of sonication. Results: Spontaneous release of nimodipine was enhanced by ultrasound application with significantly increased nimodipine concentrations two hours after a repeated sonication compared to a singular sonication (median 1.62 vs. 17.48 &amp;amp;micro;g/&amp;amp;micro;L, p = 0.04). A further trend was observed after four hours (median 1.82 vs. 22.09 &amp;amp;micro;g/&amp;amp;micro;L, p = 0.06). There was no difference in the overall nimodipine concentrations between the groups with a singular versus repeated sonication (357.2 vs. 540.3 &amp;amp;micro;g/&amp;amp;micro;L, p = 0.60) after 72 h. Conclusions: Repeated sonication resulted in an acceleration of nimodipine release from the drug-loaded copolymer in a CSF medium. These findings confirm the proof of principle of an on-demand guidance of nimodipine release from nimodipine-loaded nanodrugs by means of ultrasound, which suggests that evaluating the concept in an animal model may be appropriate.</p>

	<p>The aim of this study is to present the outcomes of cerebral aneurysm treatment with the DERIVO&amp;amp;reg; mini Embolisation Device (DMD), which is compatible with microcatheters with 0.021-inch inner diameters. Consecutive patients treated with DMD were identified retrospectively. Patient and aneurysm characteristics, procedural findings, clinical outcomes and follow-up imaging results were evaluated. A total of 44 target aneurysms in 30 patients were treated with DMD. The mean age of the patients was 49.9 (range, 4&amp;amp;ndash;77 years). Four patients with five aneurysms presented with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. The mean aneurysm size was 6.8 mm (range, 1.5&amp;amp;ndash;22 mm). In 29 (65.9%) aneurysms, adjunctive devices were used for endovascular treatment. The overall mortality rate was 3.3% and procedure-related mortality was 0%. Overall neurologic morbidity was 6.6% and none of the patients had a permanent sequela secondary to the procedure. The mean clinical follow-up period was 20.9 months (range, 3 days&amp;amp;ndash;46 months) and the mean DSA follow-up period was 10.9 months. A total of 37 (84.1%) aneurysms demonstrated total occlusion (Raymond&amp;amp;ndash;Roy [RR 1]); 3 (6.8%) aneurysms had a neck remnant or infundibular filling at the origin of the jailed side branch (RR 2), 4 (9.1%) aneurysms had residual aneurysm filling (RR 3). For those aneurysms treated with bare DMD, the total occlusion rate was 73.3% at a mean follow-up of 16.1 months. In this initial clinical single-center experience, DMD had a good safety profile and efficacy comparable with the currently used flow diverters.</p>

                <p>by Maansi Desai, Alyssa M. Field, Liberty S. Hamilton</p>

Communication in the real world is inherently multimodal. When having a conversation, typically sighted and hearing people use both auditory and visual cues to understand one another. For example, objects may make sounds as they move in space, or we may use the movement of a person’s mouth to better understand what they are saying in a noisy environment. Still, many neuroscience experiments rely on unimodal stimuli to understand encoding of sensory features in the brain. The extent to which visual information may influence encoding of auditory information and vice versa in natural environments is thus unclear. Here, we addressed this question by recording scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in 11 subjects as they listened to and watched movie trailers in audiovisual (AV), visual (V) only, and audio (A) only conditions. We then fit linear encoding models that described the relationship between the brain responses and the acoustic, phonetic, and visual information in the stimuli. We also compared whether auditory and visual feature tuning was the same when stimuli were presented in the original AV format versus when visual or auditory information was removed. In these stimuli, visual and auditory information was relatively uncorrelated, and included spoken narration over a scene as well as animated or live-action characters talking with and without their face visible. For this stimulus, we found that auditory feature tuning was similar in the AV and A-only conditions, and similarly, tuning for visual information was similar when stimuli were presented with the audio present (AV) and when the audio was removed (V only). In a cross prediction analysis, we investigated whether models trained on AV data predicted responses to A or V only test data similarly to models trained on unimodal data. Overall, prediction performance using AV training and V test sets was similar to using V training and V test sets, suggesting that the auditory information has a relatively smaller effect on EEG. In contrast, prediction performance using AV training and A only test set was slightly worse than using matching A only training and A only test sets. This suggests the visual information has a stronger influence on EEG, though this makes no qualitative difference in the derived feature tuning. In effect, our results show that researchers may benefit from the richness of multimodal datasets, which can then be used to answer more than one research question.

                Prosthetic joint loosening due to Brucella spp. is a rare event. In this report, we describe a rare case of prosthetic infection caused by brucella. A 71-year-old woman reported a six-month history of progressing pain in the right prosthetic knee, which had been implanted for arthrosis four years prior to admission, associated with fever. No night sweats were noted. On examination, the right knee appeared slightly swollen and painful on mobilization, and the surgical wound was normal. Blood tests showed increased C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (34mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (34mm/hr). A CT scan of her right knee was performed, showing loosening of the prosthesis, joint effusion, and osteolysis in contact with the internal tibial component measuring 16mm maximum with bone remodeling of the epiphysis and metaphysis regions. Rose Bengal test was positive for brucellosis, a standard brucella tube agglutination test was positive at a titer of 1/80, blood cultures for brucella were negative and a PCR for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. The patient was diagnosed as having Brucella infection of his total knee arthroplasty. Favorable outcome was observed after medical and surgical treatment. We believe this is the first detailed report of Brucella prosthetic infection in the country despite the endemicity of this type of zoonosis.

                Background Treatment expectations influence clinical outcomes in various physical and psychological conditions; however, no studies have explored their role in endometriosis treatment. It is necessary to understand how these expectations can be measured to study treatment expectations and their effects in clinical practice. This study aimed to psychometrically analyze and compare different treatment expectation measurements and describe treatment expectations in women with suspected endometriosis. Method Analysis of cross-sectional baseline data of a mixed-method clinical observational study of N=699 patients undergoing laparoscopy in Germany. Descriptives, bivariate associations, convergent and discriminant validity of four expectation measurements (Treatment Expectation Questionnaire (TEX-Q); Generic rating scale for previous treatment experiences, treatment expectations, and treatment effects (GEEE); numerical rating scales (NRS) assessing improvement and worsening of endometriosis symptoms, expected Pain Disability Index (PDI); range: 0 to 10) were estimated. A cluster analysis was performed on the three GEEE items. Results Most participants expected high improvement (M=6.68 to 7.20, SD=1.90 to 2.09) and low worsening (M=1.09 to 2.52, SD=1.80 to 2.25) of disability from laparoscopy. Participants who expected greater worsening expected more side effects (r=.31 to .60, p<.001). Associations between the positive and negative expectation dimensions, including side effects, were small to non-significant (r =|.24| to .00, p<.001 to.978). Four distinct clusters, described as’positive’, ‘no pain, no gain’, ‘diminished’, and ‘uniform’ were found, with a total PVE of 62.2%. Conclusions Women with suspected endometriosis reported positive expectations concerning laparoscopy, but wide ranges indicated interindividual differences. Treatment expectations seem to be a multidimensional construct in this patient group. The investigated measurements did not correlate to the extent that they measured exactly the same construct. The selection of measurements should be carefully considered and adapted for the study purposes. Clusters provide initial indications for individualized interventions that target expectation manipulation. Trial Registration Number ID NCT05019612 (ClinicalTrials.gov)

                Background The significant challenge in adolescent and young adult therapy lies in the fact that research in this field does not provide many clinical indications. This study addresses domains contributing to the establishment and sustenance of engagement, satisfaction, and progress among adolescents and young adults in their treatment by delving into the impact of events that, from the perspective of clients, have positively influenced their therapeutic process. Methods Employing a qualitative research approach, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 adolescents and young adults undergoing therapy, recounting positive and constructive events during their treatment. Results A structured thematic analysis revealed six primary domains of positive events: events linked to the management of the setting, events shaping the definition of therapy goals, occurrences tied to the therapist’s active role, collaborative events between therapists and clients, and events associated with both clients’ external and internal worlds. Conclusions The findings suggest that working with adolescents shares similarities with psychotherapy involving adult clients but demands specific attention to adolescents and young adults’ families, surrounding environment, and rapidly changing needs.

                Abstract Paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors, often associated with catecholamine secretion. These tumors can arise in various locations, with the majority found in the abdomen and pelvis, while a smaller percentage occurs in the thorax and head and neck regions. Diaphragmatic paragangliomas are exceedingly rare, with only two documented cases in the literature. This report details a case of a primary diaphragmatic paraganglioma in a 59-year-old patient presenting with unexplained weight loss, tremors, and diaphoresis. Imaging studies revealed a mass in the right lobe of the liver, later identified as a diaphragmatic paraganglioma during surgery. The case underscores the importance of preoperative catecholamine assessment and careful surgical planning due to the risks associated with tumor manipulation. Complete surgical resection, although challenging, remains the definitive treatment, especially in hypervascular tumors located near major vascular structures.

                Background Age-related central auditory processing disorder and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be concomitant in older adults, making it difficult to communicate, especially in challenging listening conditions. This preliminary study investigated the efficacy of auditory-based cognitive training on the auditory processing abilities and cognitive functions of older adults with MCI. Methods In this randomized controlled trial twenty-two older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were randomly assigned to either an experimental (n=11) or a control group (n=11). The experimental group received 15 cognitive training sessions through tasks involving the auditory domain. The outcome measures of this study included auditory resolution (Temporal gap detection, frequency discrimination, and modulation detection) and cognitive measures (Trail making tests and digit recall), which were administered at three-time points (before training, post-training, and follow-up). The linear mixed model computed the effects of training on the outcome measures. Results A significant improvement was observed in the modulation detection threshold between baseline and follow-up and between post-training and follow-up sessions. However, GDT and FD thresholds did not reveal any statistically significant difference. In the trail making test, Part B showed consistent significance across the time points, whereas Part A and the delayed recall task showed no significant difference. Conclusion Auditory-based cognitive training may improve auditory processing and executive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The findings concerning the association between endocannabinoid system (ECS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibited inconsistencies when examining the expression levels of endocannabinoids. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the studies regarding alterations of the ECS in AD. Six databases were thoroughly searched for literature to select relevant studies investigating the ECS in AD, including changes in cannabinoid receptors (CB1R and CB2R), endocannabinoids (2-AG and AEA), and their associated enzymes (FAAH and MAGL). Traditional meta-analysis evaluated the expression levels of the ECS in AD, and the results showed no significant differences in ECS components between healthy controls and AD patients. However, subgroup analysis revealed significantly lower expression levels of CB1R in AD than in controls, particularly in studies using western blot (SMD = −0.88, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and in studies testing CB1R of frontal cortex (SMD = −1.09, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). For studies using HPLC, the subgroup analysis indicated significantly higher 2-AG levels in AD than in controls (SMD = 0.46, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Network meta-analysis examined the rank of ECS alterations in AD compared to controls, and the findings revealed that 2-AG and MAGL exhibited the largest increase and CB1R showed the largest decrease relative to the control group. Based on the findings of traditional meta-analysis and network meta-analysis, we proposed that AD patients may present decreased expression levels of CB1R and increased expression levels of 2-AG and its degrading enzyme MAGL. Our results may contribute to the growing body of research supporting the therapeutic potential of ECS modulation in the management of AD.</p>

                Hüser et al. show that an age-associated decline in CD9 expression in dermal fibroblasts promotes the secretion of CD9-low and ANGPTL2-high extracellular vesicles. The loss of CD9 promotes angiogenesis and presents an age-related mechanism, which could drive melanoma progression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98175">SRSF2 is a key player in orchestrating the directional migration and differentiation of MyoD progenitors during skeletal muscle development</a></h4>

              
                SRSF2 plays a dual role, functioning both as a transcriptional regulator and a key player in alternative splicing. The absence of Srsf2 in MyoD + progenitors resulted in perinatal mortality in mice, accompanied by severe skeletal muscle defects. SRSF2 deficiency disrupts the directional migration of MyoD progenitors, causing them to disperse into both muscle and non-muscle regions. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed significant alterations in Srsf2-deficient myoblasts, including a reduction in extracellular matrix components, diminished expression of genes involved in ameboid-type cell migration and cytoskeleton organization, mitosis irregularities, and premature differentiation. Notably, one of the targets regulated by Srsf2 is the serine/threonine kinase Aurka. Knockdown of <i>Aurka</i> led to reduced cell proliferation, disrupted cytoskeleton, and impaired differentiation, reflecting the effects seen with <i>Srsf2</i> knockdown. Crucially, the introduction of exogenous Aurka in <i>Srsf2</i>-knockdown cells markedly alleviated the differentiation defects caused by <i>Srsf2</i> knockdown. Furthermore, our research unveiled the role of Srsf2 in controlling alternative splicing within genes associated with human skeletal muscle diseases, such as <i>BIN1</i>, <i>DMPK</i>, <i>FHL1</i>, and <i>LDB3</i>. Specifically, the precise knockdown of the <i>Bin1</i> exon17-containing variant, which is excluded following <i>Srsf2</i> depletion, profoundly disrupted C2C12 cell differentiation. In summary, our study offers valuable insights into the role of SRSF2 in governing MyoD progenitors to specific muscle regions, thereby controlling their differentiation through the regulation of targeted genes and alternative splicing during skeletal muscle development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99172">Proteomic landscape of tunneling nanotubes reveals CD9 and CD81 tetraspanins as key regulators</a></h4>

              
                Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are open actin- and membrane-based channels, connecting remote cells and allowing direct transfer of cellular material (e.g. vesicles, mRNAs, protein aggregates) from the cytoplasm to the cytoplasm. Although they are important especially, in pathological conditions (e.g. cancers, neurodegenerative diseases), their precise composition and their regulation were still poorly described. Here, using a biochemical approach allowing to separate TNTs from cell bodies and from extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs), we obtained the full composition of TNTs compared to EVPs. We then focused on two major components of our proteomic data, the CD9 and CD81 tetraspanins, and further investigated their specific roles in TNT formation and function. We show that these two tetraspanins have distinct non-redundant functions: CD9 participates in stabilizing TNTs, whereas CD81 expression is required to allow the functional transfer of vesicles in the newly formed TNTs, possibly by regulating docking to or fusion with the opposing cell.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93243">Rifampicin tolerance and growth fitness among isoniazid-resistant clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from a longitudinal study</a></h4>

              
                Antibiotic tolerance in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> reduces bacterial killing, worsens treatment outcomes, and contributes to resistance. We studied rifampicin tolerance in isolates with or without isoniazid resistance (IR). Using a minimum duration of killing assay, we measured rifampicin survival in isoniazid-susceptible (IS, n=119) and resistant (IR, n=84) isolates, correlating tolerance with bacterial growth, rifampicin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), and isoniazid-resistant mutations. Longitudinal IR isolates were analyzed for changes in rifampicin tolerance and genetic variant emergence. The median time for rifampicin to reduce the bacterial population by 90% (MDK90) increased from 1.23 days (IS) and 1.31 days (IR) to 2.55 days (IS) and 1.98 days (IR) over 15–60 days of incubation, indicating fast and slow-growing tolerant sub-populations. A 6 log10-fold survival fraction classified tolerance as low, medium, or high, showing that IR is linked to increased tolerance and faster growth (OR = 2.68 for low vs. medium, OR = 4.42 for low vs. high, p-trend = 0.0003). High tolerance in IR isolates was associated with rifampicin treatment in patients and genetic microvariants. These findings suggest that IR tuberculosis should be assessed for high rifampicin tolerance to optimize treatment and prevent the development of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis.

                CXCR4 is a ubiquitously expressed chemokine receptor that regulates leukocyte trafficking and arrest in both homeostatic and pathological states. It also participates in organogenesis, HIV-1 infection, and tumor development. Despite the potential therapeutic benefit of CXCR4 antagonists, only one, plerixafor (AMD3100), which blocks the ligand-binding site, has reached the clinic. Recent advances in imaging and biophysical techniques have provided a richer understanding of the membrane organization and dynamics of this receptor. Activation of CXCR4 by CXCL12 reduces the number of CXCR4 monomers/dimers at the cell membrane and increases the formation of large nanoclusters, which are largely immobile and are required for correct cell orientation to chemoattractant gradients. Mechanistically, CXCR4 activation involves a structural motif defined by residues in TMV and TMVI. Using this structural motif as a template, we performed in silico molecular modeling followed by in vitro screening of a small compound library to identify negative allosteric modulators of CXCR4 that do not affect CXCL12 binding. We identified AGR1.137, a small molecule that abolishes CXCL12-mediated receptor nanoclustering and dynamics and blocks the ability of cells to sense CXCL12 gradients both in vitro and in vivo while preserving ligand binding and receptor internalization.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94899">Machine learning approaches identify immunologic signatures of total and intact HIV DNA during long-term antiretroviral therapy</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the interplay between the HIV reservoir and the host immune system may yield insights into HIV persistence during antiretroviral therapy (ART) and inform strategies for a cure. Here, we applied machine learning (ML) approaches to cross-sectional high-parameter HIV reservoir and immunology data in order to characterize host–reservoir associations and generate new hypotheses about HIV reservoir biology. High-dimensional immunophenotyping, quantification of HIV-specific T cell responses, and measurement of genetically intact and total HIV proviral DNA frequencies were performed on peripheral blood samples from 115 people with HIV (PWH) on long-term ART. Analysis demonstrated that both intact and total proviral DNA frequencies were positively correlated with T cell activation and exhaustion. Years of ART and select bifunctional HIV-specific CD4 T cell responses were negatively correlated with the percentage of intact proviruses. A leave-one-covariate-out inference approach identified specific HIV reservoir and clinical–demographic parameters, such as age and biological sex, that were particularly important in predicting immunophenotypes. Overall, immune parameters were more strongly associated with total HIV proviral frequencies than intact proviral frequencies. Uniquely, however, expression of the IL-7 receptor alpha chain (CD127) on CD4 T cells was more strongly correlated with the intact reservoir. Unsupervised dimension reduction analysis identified two main clusters of PWH with distinct immune and reservoir characteristics. Using reservoir correlates identified in these initial analyses, decision tree methods were employed to visualize relationships among multiple immune and clinical–demographic parameters and the HIV reservoir. Finally, using random splits of our data as training-test sets, ML algorithms predicted with approximately 70% accuracy whether a given participant had qualitatively high or low levels of total or intact HIV DNA . The techniques described here may be useful for assessing global patterns within the increasingly high-dimensional data used in HIV reservoir and other studies of complex biology.

	<p>The present study analyzed the association between anxiety, repetitive behavior and parental stress in individuals with autism from Spain (n = 60, mean age = 8.52, SD = 4.41) and Colombia (n = 58, mean age = 10.29, SD = 4.98). Similarly, differences in anxiety, repetitive behavior and parental stress between both countries were analyzed. Outcomes revealed a strong relationship between anxiety and repetitive behavior in both populations. Furthermore, moderate positive associations were observed between anxiety, repetitive behavior and parental stress in the Spanish sample. However, parental stress was found to be moderately and negatively related with anxiety and repetitive behavior in the Colombian sample. Finally, no differences were found in anxiety and repetitive behavior between countries, but differences did emerge for parental stress which was found to be higher in the Colombian sample. In conclusion, differences in parental stress may be due to regional differences in socio-health resources, socio-economics, parenting styles, etc.</p>

                <p>Slowly expanding lesions (SELs) in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) indicate a progressive pathological process. Whether SELs are present in pediatric-onset MS (POMS) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is unknown. We studied 19 children with POMS and 14 with MOGAD (median age 14.3 and 9.4 years, respectively) recruited to the Canadian Pediatric Demyelinating Disease Study with: (1) ≥3 research scans 12 months apart; and (2) ≥1 T2-lesions on the earliest scan. A total of 70 SELs from 16 POMS participants and 1 SEL in the MOGAD group were detected. SELs are an early feature of POMS and essentially not a feature of MOGAD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Many animal species use olfaction to extract information about objects in their environment. Yet, the specific molecular signature that any given object emits varies due to various factors. Here, we detail why such variability makes chemosensory-mediated object recognition such a hard problem, and we propose that a major function of the elaborate chemosensory network is to overcome it. We describe previous work addressing different elements of the problem and outline future research directions that we consider essential for a full understanding of object-oriented olfaction. In particular, we call for extensive representation of olfactory object variability in chemical, behavioral, and electrophysiological analyses. While written with an emphasis on macrosmatic mammalian species, our arguments apply to all organisms that employ chemosensation to navigate complex environments.

                Blot et al. demonstrate that Nrf2 is a critical transcription factor that protects Leishmania infantum from lipid peroxidation and death by a ferroptosis-like process through the induction of an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory profile of macrophages. Hence, pharmacological inhibition of Nrf2 constitutes a promising target for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis.

	<p>Objective: This meta-analysis with a systematic review was undertaken to assess the association between APOE allelic genotypes and the risk of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) in the Italian population. Methods: The Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases were searched until 15 November 2023. The odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed and random effect models, depending on the I2 statistic value. The systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in agreement with the PRISMA guideline and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023492580). Results: Our meta-analysis based on 15 studies revealed a higher risk of AD among Italian individuals carrying the APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4 allele (OR = 3.60, 95% CI [2.90&amp;amp;ndash;4.47], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). The association of AD genotype APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;2&amp;amp;epsilon;4 (OR = 1.36, 95% CI [0.76&amp;amp;ndash;2.41], p = 0.29) was not statistically significant, while APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;3&amp;amp;epsilon;4 (OR = 3.43, 95% CI [2.95&amp;amp;ndash;3.99], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) has a high risk of AD development; the risk is more notably in the APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4&amp;amp;epsilon;4 genotype (OR = 7.08, 95% CI [4.22&amp;amp;ndash;11.86], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). The APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;2 allele has a protective effect (APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;2 (OR = 0.47, 95% CI [0.29&amp;amp;ndash;0.74], p = 0.0013)), and similar results were achieved by APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;3 (OR&amp;amp;thinsp; = &amp;amp;thinsp;0.49, 95% CI [0.37&amp;amp;ndash;0.65], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Subgroup analysis of three areas of Italy (southern, northern, and center) revealed that that APOE&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;epsilon;4 allele was a risk factor with a higher OR in northern Italy (OR 4.22; 95% CI [3.46&amp;amp;ndash;5.16], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) compared to southern and center Italy (OR 3.02; 95% CI [2.28&amp;amp;ndash;4.01], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001 and OR 3.97; 95% CI [1.37&amp;amp;ndash;11.56], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001, respectively). As well, APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4&amp;amp;epsilon;4 genotype carriers had a significantly higher OR in northern Italy (OR 9.69; 95% CI [4.94&amp;amp;ndash;18.99], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) compared to in southern and center Italy (OR 4.38; 95% CI [1.54&amp;amp;ndash;12.47], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001 and OR 3.59; 95% CI [0.87&amp;amp;ndash;14.86], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001, respectively). Conclusions: This systematic review with a meta-analysis of the Italian population on APOE alleles, genotyping, and AD incidence, highlights that individuals harboring APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4 have a higher risk of developing AD compared to those with other alleles. It also supports the protective effect of the APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;2 allele against the progress of AD. The qualitative analysis on the complex genetic interactions influencing Alzheimer risk emphasizes the need for further research on genetic and environmental factors for effective prevention strategies.</p>

	<p>In this narrative review, we explore the latest evidence on semantic interventions for older adults, including both prevention and rehabilitation/remediation efforts, discussing them particularly in the context of dementia. Cognitive interventions vary in their level of structure, encompassing standardized (task-focused tasks) and unstandardized tasks (person-centered tasks). These interventions also differ in their target: rehabilitation or prevention. Addressing semantic knowledge/semantic memory/semantics is important, primarily because its efficiency impacts other cognitive domains. Semantic tasks are commonly included in preventive and rehabilitation programs, typically as standardized tasks with pre-defined semantic referents. On the other hand, person-centered approaches introduce personally relevant semantics, allowing patients to share thoughts and experiences with expressive language. Although these approaches offer benefits beyond cognitive improvement, their lack of structure may pose challenges.

                Background Insufficient awareness of foot self-care among diabetic individuals results in diabetic foot ulcers. The management of diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers demands a well-coordinated approach that involves multiple healthcare providers (HCPs). The present study aims to develop and validate an interprofessional collaborative (IPC) educational program involving HCPs to efficiently oversee and instruct the public on appropriate strategies for self-managing diabetic foot health. Methods The research group worked on creating an educational module titled ‘An Interprofessional Collaborative Educational Module on Self-Management of Foot for Individuals with Type II Diabetes Mellitus.’ The objective of this module was to promote the adoption of proper practices in self-managing foot health for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A panel of 13 experts participated in a two-stage validation process using the Delphi method to assess the module and its educational resources. Subsequently, the module was tested on a group of 30 participants, i.e., individuals with diabetes, with its efficacy evaluated through conversation analysis and in-depth interviews. Results The three-month-long module included three sessions • 1: Diabetes and its health implications • 2: Diabetic foot and self-management • 3: Interprofessional education in diabetic foot care The mode of content delivery was via Whatsapp, and the educational resources, in the form of pamphlets, flowcharts, handouts, case-based cartoons, and videos on diabetes, including diabetic foot, its risks, and self-management, were shared regularly. All participating experts consensually validated the module and educational resources. Analysis of in-depth interviews revealed that the module immensely benefitted the participants and helped them improve their knowledge and practices of foot care in diabetes. Conclusions The study concludes that IPC educational modules can enhance adherence to proper diabetic foot care practices, potentially reducing the occurrence of foot ulcers and amputations, and ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals with diabetes.

                Background An entrepreneurial mindset is widely recognized as crucial for success in today’s fast-paced competitive world. People across various sectors—businesses, schools, politics, the military, and the public— benefit from a developed entrepreneurial mindset. Consequently, an accurate entrepreneurial mind-sets is becoming increasingly vital. This systematic literature review comprehensively analyzed the research on methods used to assess entrepreneurial mindsets. This inquiry was explored in terms of the fundamental characteristics of the reviewed documents, common entrepreneurial mindset traits or skills, evidence of validity and reliability, research methods employed, study participants, focus areas, and key findings from recent studies. Methods A systematic literature review using the PRISMA framework was utilized, and 39 documents published in the period 2015–2024 were extracted from the EBSCO, ERIC, and SCOPUS databases. Results Researchers from the USA dominated the field of this study. These assessment practices mainly target the educational sector, especially engineering education, where students are the primary participants. Currently, researchers are actively creating new assessment tools for entrepreneurial mind-sets tailored to students in entrepreneurial programs at engineering institutions. Most of these tools have been shown to be valid and reliable. The KEEN 3C framework is the most common assessment tool, emphasizing curiosity (CU), connections (CON), and creating value (CV). Conclusions This study makes significant contributions by compiling the existing literature on entrepreneurial mindset assessment, which presents the most up-to-date knowledge in the field. Educational institutions and business organizations can utilize the entrepreneurial mind-set assessment approaches highlighted in this review. This article is unique in that it enhances the field of entrepreneurship by presenting a new systematic literature review of entrepreneurial mindset assessment approaches.

                Background Piezoceramic materials have unique property which enables direct and bilateral conversion between mechanical and electrical energy. This ability facilitates significant miniaturisation of technology and opens many opportunities in design of new actuators and energy harvesters. Mathematical modelling of piezoelectric modules is notoriously hard due to complex constitutive equations defining mechanical and electrical energy conversion. Methods The article presents research on a new synthesis method based on the Cauer’s method. Mechanical damping is introduced with the use of Rayleigh’s approximation. A discrete electromechanical model is formed based on the Mason’s piezoelectric model. The proposed approach allows modelling of piezoelectric systems based on a set of characteristic frequencies. The method allows a more general approach to the problem of modelling new systems, as opposed to application-oriented methods seen in literature. A non-standard model analysis method using edge graphs and structural numbers is also verified as a potential alternative for matrix-based method. The authors compare their precision and computation requirements. Results The structural method of mechanical model analysis gave identical results as the reference matrix method. However, the non-classical algorithm took much longer to calculate and was using more memory. The electromechanical model analysis has shown an error of 5% in comparison to resonance frequencies taken from a reference plate specification. The calculated magnitude of displacement was well above the capability of a 3.5mm thick piezoelectric plate. Conclusions The synthesis method presented in this paper allows synthesizing piezoelectric cascade models based on limited information in form of characteristic frequencies. Currently this method allows a coarse approximation of the real piezoelectric parameters with limited number of inputs. The additional method of analysis based on structural numbers offers a promising alternative to matrix calculations but requires a more thorough investigation of the computational power required to determine whether it can compete with existing algorithms.

                Abstract Background Melanoma, an aggressive malignant skin cancer, has the ability to spread both locoregionally and to distant sites. The risk of metastasis is correlated to invasion depth and the presence of ulceration. Although gastrointestinal (GI) metastases are uncommon, gastric involvement is particularly rare. Case presentation We report a case of a 62-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain, dyspepsia, anorexia, and weight loss. On physical examination abdominal masses and hepatomegaly were detected. Radiological imaging showed widespread masses in the abdominal and thoracic regions. Upper GI endoscopy identified an umbilicated protruded lesion with central dark pigmentation at the antro-fundic junction. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with melanoma. A subsequent rigorous skin examination uncovered a primary malignant skin melanoma. Due to worsening general condition, the patient received palliative hospice care. Conclusion This report highlights the critical need for vigilant skin examination when encountering gastric lesions with dark pigmentation, which led to the identification of initially undetected cutaneous melanoma.

                Background Education for diabetes patients is not managed well by diabetes nurse educators because the competency of diabetes nurse educators is low, and the number of diabetes nurse educators in hospitals is not commensurate with the number of diabetes patients, which is much larger. Methods This qualitative phenomenological research uses an exploratory design. Twenty nurse managers and forty staff nurses who participated in the focus group discussion (FGD) were selected using purposive sampling. Nine staff nurses who participated in in-depth interviews were selected using the snowball method. The results of the FGD exploration and in-depth interviews produced components for developing an educational model with a management approach. The development of this educational model uses an input, process, output, and outcome approach. The input uses King’s conceptual framework approach, the method uses the theory of goal attainment and management functions, the output is the competency of nurses to educate diabetes patients, and the outcome is the health literacy of diabetes patients. This educational model was reviewed by three experts: a nursing management expert, a diabetes mellitus expert, and a health literacy expert. Results The educational model for Diabetes nurse educators with a management approach consists of five stages: 1) Educational planning includes identifying educational targets, strategy formulation, and situation analysis. 2) Organizing nursing resources includes strengthening the role of nurses as diabetes educators. 3) Nursing staff includes intraprofessional collaboration and collaboration between nurses and patient families. 4) Direction includes nurses’ motivation for diabetes patients and respecting the culture and values of diabetes patients. 5) Control includes evaluating nurse education for diabetes patients. Conclusion This education model has five competencies, which are structured and systematic so that diabetes nurse educators have the competence to manage diabetes patient education: the personal system, interpersonal system, and social system influence nurse competency.

                Background Muscarinic receptor agonism is a promising mechanism of action for treating psychosis, not present in most D2R-blocking antipsychotics. Xanomeline, an M1/M4-preferring agonist, has shown efficacy in late-stage clinical trials, with more compounds being investigated. Therefore, we aim to synthesize evidence on the preclinical efficacy of muscarinic receptor agonists in animal models of psychosis to provide unique insights and evidence-based information to guide drug development. Methods We plan a systematic review and meta-analysis of in vivo animal studies comparing muscarinic receptor agonists or positive allosteric modulators with control conditions and existing D2R-blocking antipsychotics in animals subjected to any method that induces behavioural changes of relevance for psychosis. We will identify eligible studies by searching multiple electronic databases. At least two independent reviewers will conduct the study selection and data extraction using prespecified forms and assess the risk of bias with the SYRCLE’s tool. Our primary outcomes include locomotor activity and prepulse inhibition measured with standardized mean differences. We will examine other behavioural readouts of relevance for psychosis as secondary outcomes, such as social interaction and cognitive function. We will synthesize the data using multi-level meta-analysis with a predefined random-effects structure, considering the non-independence of the data. In meta-regressions we will explore potential sources of heterogeneity from a predefined list of characteristics of the animal population, model, and intervention. We will assess the confidence in the evidence considering a self-developed instrument thatconsiders the internal and external validity of the evidence.

                Background Patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) frequently present with kinesiophobia. Although kinesiophobia is found to affect outcomes such as affect pain and quality of life in patients with CLBP, it is unclear whether kinesiophobia is linked to reduction of muscle endurance in these patients. The primary aim of the study was to analyze the impact of kinesiophobia on lumbar extensor endurance in patients with CLBP and asymptomatic individuals. Methods This case-control study was proceeded with 200 patients with CLBP and 400 controls. Kinesiophobia, lumbar endurance and Pain intensity were assessed with Tampa Scale, Soren’s lumbar extensor test and visual analog scale respectively. Regression model was administered to explore the relationship between kinesiophobia and lumbar extensor endurance. Results Prevalence of kinesiophobia was found to be higher in patients with CLBP (30%) than in controls (11%) which is (6.49 ± 0.52, d= 1.07) more in CLBP than controls. Lumbar endurance was significantly lower in CLBP than controls (-20.5±6.84), further affected by the presence of kinesiophobia as lumbar endurance was negatively correlated (r = - 0.09) to Kinesiophobia. Moreover, VAS (r = 0.2) was positively correlated with kinesiophobia in patients with CLBP. Discussion and conclusion A high prevalence of kinesiophobia was reported by patients with CLBP. The presence of kinesiophobia exhibited strong linear relationship with lumbar endurance, and pain intensity among patients with CLBP. Hence management of CLBP should comprise of an assessment of kinesiophobia and appropriate treatment strategies to address it in preventing persistent CLBP.
