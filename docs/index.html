              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Genetic and environmental perturbations alter the rhythmic expression pattern of a circadian long non-coding RNA, Per2AS, in mouse liver [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a wide variety of biological roles without encoding a protein. Although the functions of many lncRNAs have been uncovered in recent years, the regulatory mechanism of lncRNA expression is still poorly understood despite that the expression patterns of lncRNAs are much more specific compared to mRNAs. Here, we investigated the rhythmic expression of Per2AS, a novel lncRNA that regulates circadian rhythms. Given that Per2AS expression is antiphasic to Period2 (Per2), a core circadian clock gene, and transcribed from the antisense strand of Per2, we hypothesized that the rhythmic Per2AS expression is driven either by its own promoter or by the rhythmic Per2 transcription via transcriptional interference. Methods: We leveraged existing circadian RNA-seq datasets and analyzed the expression patterns of Per2AS and Per2 in response to the genetic or environmental disruption of the circadian rhythm in mouse liver. We tested our hypotheses by comparing the changes in the expression patterns of Per2AS and Per2. Conclusions: We found that, in some cases, Per2AS expression is independently controlled by other circadian transcription factors. In other cases, the pattern of expression change is consistent with both transcriptional interference and independent regulation hypotheses. Although additional experiments will be necessary to distinguish these possibilities, findings from this work contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of how the expression of lncRNA is regulated.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The circadian clock mediates the response to oxidative stress in a cone photoreceptor‒like (661W) cell line via regulation of glutathione peroxidase activity [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The mammalian retina contains an autonomous circadian clock that controls many physiological functions within this tissue. Our previous studies have indicated that disruption of this circadian clock by removing Bmal1 from the retina affects the visual function, retinal circuitry, and cone photoreceptor viability during aging. In the present study, we employed a mouse-derived cone photoreceptor‒like cell, 661W, to investigate which molecular mechanisms of the circadian clock may modulate cone photoreceptor viability during aging. Methods: Bmal1 knockout (BKO) cells were generated from 661W cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool. Deletion of Bmal1 from 661W was verified by western blot and monitoring Per2-luc bioluminescence circadian rhythms. To investigate the effect of Bmal1 removal on an oxidative stress challenge, cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2,1 mM) for two hours and then cell viability was assessed. Cells were also cultured and harvested for gene expression analysis and antioxidant assay. Results: Our data indicated that 661W cells contain a functional circadian clock that mediates the response to an oxidative stress challenge in vitro and that such a response is no longer present in the BKO cell. We also hypothesized that the effect was due to the circadian regulation of the intracellular antioxidant defense mechanism. Our results indicated that in 661W cells, the antioxidant defense mechanism is under circadian control, whereas in BKO cells, there is an overall reduction in this antioxidant defense mechanism, and it is no longer under circadian control. Conclusions: Our work supported the notion that the presence of a functional circadian clock and its ability to modulate the response to an oxidative stress is the underlying mechanism that may protect cones during aging.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Understanding the funding characteristics of research impact: A proof-of-concept study linking REF 2014 impact case studies with Researchfish grant agreements [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: All parts of the research community have an interest in understanding research impact whether that is around the pathways to impact, processes around impact, methods for measurement, describing impact and so on. This proof of concept study explored the relationship between research funding and research impact using the case studies submitted to the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) exercise in 2014 as a proxy for impact. Methods: The paper describes an approach to link the REF impact case studies with the underpinning research grants present in the Researchfish dataset, primarily using the publications captured in both datasets. Where possible the methodology utilised unique identifiers such as Digital Object Identifiers and PubMed ID’s, and where this was not possible the funding information within each publication was used. Results: Through this automated approach 21% of the non-redacted case studies could be linked to a specific research grant. Additional qualitative analysis was then done for unlinked REF impact case studies, which involved reading the document to identify additional information to make the linkage. This approach was taken on 100 REF impact case studies selected at random and resulted in only seven having no identifiable research grants funding associated. The linked research grants were analysed to identify characteristics that are more frequently associated with these grants, than non-linked ones. Conclusions: This analysis did point to some interesting observations such as the grant funding linked to REF impact case studies are more likely to be longer, higher financial value, have more publications and be more collaborative (amongst other characteristics). These findings should be used with caution at present and not be over interpreted, this is due to the sample size for this proof of concept study and some potential limitations on the data which were not addressed at this stage.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dentists’ perceptions on present and future dental practice during the COVID-19 pandemic: An embedded study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant burden on everyone. Although dental professionals are at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, currently, very little is known about how oral health professionals and their professions could be affected by the pandemic. This study aims to investigate dentists' perceptions on present and future dental practice in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Methods: We conducted an embedded mixed-methods study at Manipal College of Dental Sciences, Mangalore, with Indian dentists registered with the Dental Council of India.   Results: Of the 976 participating dentists, 61% were females, 32% were 40 years of age or younger. Nearly half of the respondents (54%) acknowledged that the lockdown measures caused them a severe financial burden, and 56% were seriously concerned about being a source of infection to their family, friends, and community. Although 79% felt very comfortable or somewhat comfortable going back to work, they were all worried that Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) use would increase their financial burden and impact the number of patients seeking care. Even though a vast majority received the necessary information regarding returning to practice from their concerned dental regulatory bodies, some were unsure about the reuse of the PPEs because of the conflicting information they received.  Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic affected participants' professional lives negatively. Their major concerns were being a source of infection to their families and community. Providing information to dental professionals in a timely manner may prepare dentists to provide safe care to their patients while protecting themselves, their staff, and their families.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Informative prior on structural equation modelling with non-homogenous error structure [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: This study investigates the impact of informative prior on Bayesian structural equation model (BSEM) with heteroscedastic error structure. A major drawback of homogeneous error structure is that, in most studies the underlying assumption of equal variance across observation is often unrealistic, hence the need to consider the non-homogenous error structure. Methods: Updating appropriate informative prior, four different forms of heteroscedastic error structures were considered at sample sizes 50, 100, 200 and 500. Results: The results show that both posterior predictive probability (PPP) and log likelihood are influenced by the sample size and the prior information, hence the model with the linear form of error structure is the best. Conclusions: The study has been able to address sufficiently the problem of heteroscedasticity of known form using four different heteroscedastic conditions, the linear form outperformed other forms of heteroscedastic error structure thus can accommodate any form of data that violates the homogenous variance assumption by updating appropriate informative prior. Thus, this approach provides an alternative approach to the existing classical method which depends solely on the sample information.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Nicotine products relative risk assessment: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The nicotine products relative risk assessment estimates the relative risk of tobacco-related diseases due to use of 15 nicotine products. This update adds new data to the original analysis and creates separate categories for United States and rest of world varieties of smokeless tobacco, as well as bidi cigarettes. Methods: The PubMed®, MEDLINE and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched systematically. The study lists were exported, screened at the title, abstract and full-text level according to pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. The study quality was assessed, and risk of bias was accounted for in the screening criteria. The extracted data was synthesized into a toxin emissions/content analysis for 12 Group 1 carcinogens, used to estimate lifetime cancer risk, and epidemiological meta-analysis of over 40 tobacco-related diseases. The two analyses were integrated into a combined risk score for each nicotine product, weighted by the risk of bias due to missing data, and incorporated into the relative risk spectrum. Results: In this update, 70 new studies were added to the synthesis, making a total of 123 studies included. All combustible tobacco products score between 40 and 100, with bidis and smokeless (rest of world) also in this range. All other products have a combined risk score of 10 or less, including U.S. chewing tobacco, U.S. dipping tobacco, snus, heat-not-burn tobacco, electronic cigarettes, non-tobacco pouches and nicotine replacement therapy. Discussion: Consistent with previous studies, we define a group of high-risk nicotine products, scoring between 40 and 100 on the spectrum, and reduced risk nicotine products, scoring less than 10. Limitations of this study include the potential for bias due to missing data, the heterogeneity of the data included in the relative risk hierarchy synthesis, and the assumed consumption levels.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anti-inflammatory activity and toxicity evaluation of 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Inflammation is a normal protective response caused by tissue damage through physical trauma, chemical damage, or invasion of pathogenic microorganisms. 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea is a modified p-aminophenol compound, which is considered to have strong analgesic activity based on cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition and has fewer hepatotoxic side effects. In-silico test showed 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea has COX-1 and TNF- binding activity, so it has the potential to be developed as an anti-inflammatory agent. Anti-inflammatory activity was tested using mice. Toxicity test was conducted to test the safety of 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea. Methods: Anti-inflammatory test was carried out by measuring the percentage of inflammation in rat paws using a plethysmometer after administration of 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea induced by carrageenan 1%, and then histology was performed to observe the number of neutrophils. A toxicity test using OECD guidelines carried out acute toxicity for 24 hours and was observed for 14 days. The subchronic toxicity test was carried out for 28 days, followed by 42 days in the satellite group. Results: Analysis of rat paw inflammation volume showed 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea could suppress inflammation after carrageenan-1% induction. The group given {1.3 bis (p-Hydroxyphenyl)urea} and sodium diclofenac 2.25 mg/kg BW had a significant difference in results (p<0.05) with 0.5% Na CMC group. Doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg BW showed no significant difference (p>0.05) with diclofenac sodium. The number of neutrophils also decreased compared to the 0.5% Na CMC group. The acute toxicity test of 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea did not cause toxic symptoms and death up to a dose of 5000 mg/kg BW. The microscopic results of subchronic toxicity of liver tissue experienced hydropic degeneration at a dose of 1000 mg/kg BW; in the lungs causes congestion, and microscopic renal tissue undergoes Bowman space dilatation and tubular lumen dilatation, but this condition is reversible. Conclusion: This 1,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)urea compound had an anti-inflammatory activity and relatively low toxicity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">AIRRscape: An interactive tool for exploring B-cell receptor repertoires and antibody responses</a></h4>

The sequencing of antibody repertoires of B-cells at increasing coverage and depth has led to the identification of vast numbers of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. However, the size and complexity of these Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) datasets makes it difficult to perform exploratory analyses. To aid in data exploration, we have developed AIRRscape, an R Shiny-based interactive web browser application that enables B-cell receptor (BCR) and antibody feature discovery through comparisons among multiple repertoires. Using AIRR-seq data as input, AIRRscape starts by aggregating and sorting repertoires into interactive and explorable bins of germline V-gene, germline J-gene, and CDR3 length, providing a high-level view of the entire repertoire. Interesting subsets of repertoires can be quickly identified and selected, and then network topologies of CDR3 motifs can be generated for further exploration. Here we demonstrate AIRRscape using patient BCR repertoires and sequences of published monoclonal antibodies to investigate patterns of humoral immunity to three viral pathogens: SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1, and DENV (dengue virus). AIRRscape reveals convergent antibody sequences among datasets for all three pathogens, although HIV-1 antibody datasets display limited convergence and idiosyncratic responses. We have made AIRRscape available as a web-based Shiny application, along with code on GitHub to encourage its open development and use by immuno-informaticians, virologists, immunologists, vaccine developers, and other scientists that are interested in exploring and comparing multiple immune receptor repertoires.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An in-silico analysis of experimental designs to study ventricular function: A focus on the right ventricle</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mitchel J. Colebank, Naomi C. Chesler</p>

<i>In-vivo</i> studies of pulmonary vascular disease and pulmonary hypertension (PH) have provided key insight into the progression of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. Additional <i>in-silico</i> experiments using multiscale computational models have provided further details into biventricular mechanics and hemodynamic function in the presence of PH, yet few have assessed whether model parameters are practically identifiable prior to data collection. Moreover, none have used modeling to devise synergistic experimental designs. To address this knowledge gap, we conduct a practical identifiability analysis of a multiscale cardiovascular model across four simulated experimental designs. We determine a set of parameters using a combination of Morris screening and local sensitivity analysis, and test for practical identifiability using profile likelihood-based confidence intervals. We employ Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to quantify parameter and model forecast uncertainty in the presence of noise corrupted data. Our results show that model calibration to only RV pressure suffers from practical identifiability issues and suffers from large forecast uncertainty in output space. In contrast, parameter and model forecast uncertainty is substantially reduced once additional left ventricular (LV) pressure and volume data is included. A comparison between single point systolic and diastolic LV data and continuous, time-dependent LV pressure-volume data reveals that any information from the LV substantially reduces parameter and forecast uncertainty, encouraging at least some quantitative data from both ventricles for future experimental studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Forebrain nuclei linked to woodpecker territorial drum displays mirror those that enable vocal learning in songbirds</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eric R. Schuppe, Lindsey Cantin, Mukta Chakraborty, Matthew T. Biegler, Electra R. Jarvis, Chun-Chun Chen, Erina Hara, Mads F. Bertelsen, Christopher C. Witt, Erich D. Jarvis, Matthew J. Fuxjager</p>

Vocal learning is thought to have evolved in 3 orders of birds (songbirds, parrots, and hummingbirds), with each showing similar brain regions that have comparable gene expression specializations relative to the surrounding forebrain motor circuitry. Here, we searched for signatures of these same gene expression specializations in previously uncharacterized brains of 7 assumed vocal non-learning bird lineages across the early branches of the avian family tree. Our findings using a conserved marker for the song system found little evidence of specializations in these taxa, except for woodpeckers. Instead, woodpeckers possessed forebrain regions that were anatomically similar to the pallial song nuclei of vocal learning birds. Field studies of free-living downy woodpeckers revealed that these brain nuclei showed increased expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) when males produce their iconic drum displays, the elaborate bill-hammering behavior that individuals use to compete for territories, much like birdsong. However, these specialized areas did not show increased IEG expression with vocalization or flight. We further confirmed that other woodpecker species contain these brain nuclei, suggesting that these brain regions are a common feature of the woodpecker brain. We therefore hypothesize that ancient forebrain nuclei for refined motor control may have given rise to not only the song control systems of vocal learning birds, but also the drumming system of woodpeckers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Metabolic reconstitution of germ-free mice by a gnotobiotic microbiota varies over the circadian cycle</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel Hoces, Jiayi Lan, Wenfei Sun, Tobias Geiser, Melanie L. Stäubli, Elisa Cappio Barazzone, Markus Arnoldini, Tenagne D. Challa, Manuel Klug, Alexandra Kellenberger, Sven Nowok, Erica Faccin, Andrew J. Macpherson, Bärbel Stecher, Shinichi Sunagawa, Renato Zenobi, Wolf-Dietrich Hardt, Christian Wolfrum, Emma Slack</p>

The capacity of the intestinal microbiota to degrade otherwise indigestible diet components is known to greatly improve the recovery of energy from food. This has led to the hypothesis that increased digestive efficiency may underlie the contribution of the microbiota to obesity. OligoMM12-colonized gnotobiotic mice have a consistently higher fat mass than germ-free (GF) or fully colonized counterparts. We therefore investigated their food intake, digestion efficiency, energy expenditure, and respiratory quotient using a novel isolator-housed metabolic cage system, which allows long-term measurements without contamination risk. This demonstrated that microbiota-released calories are perfectly balanced by decreased food intake in fully colonized versus gnotobiotic OligoMM12 and GF mice fed a standard chow diet, i.e., microbiota-released calories can in fact be well integrated into appetite control. We also observed no significant difference in energy expenditure after normalization by lean mass between the different microbiota groups, suggesting that cumulative small differences in energy balance, or altered energy storage, must underlie fat accumulation in OligoMM12 mice. Consistent with altered energy storage, major differences were observed in the type of respiratory substrates used in metabolism over the circadian cycle: In GF mice, the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was consistently lower than that of fully colonized mice at all times of day, indicative of more reliance on fat and less on glucose metabolism. Intriguingly, the RER of OligoMM12-colonized gnotobiotic mice phenocopied fully colonized mice during the dark (active/eating) phase but phenocopied GF mice during the light (fasting/resting) phase. Further, OligoMM12-colonized mice showed a GF-like drop in liver glycogen storage during the light phase and both liver and plasma metabolomes of OligoMM12 mice clustered closely with GF mice. This implies the existence of microbiota functions that are required to maintain normal host metabolism during the resting/fasting phase of circadian cycle and which are absent in the OligoMM12 consortium.

                <p>by Franziska Müller, Francesco De Virgiliis, Guiping Kong, Luming Zhou, Elisabeth Serger, Jessica Chadwick, Alexandros Sanchez-Vassopoulos, Akash Kumar Singh, Muthusamy Eswaramoorthy, Tapas K. Kundu, Simone Di Giovanni</p>

The interruption of spinal circuitry following spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts neural activity and is followed by a failure to mount an effective regenerative response resulting in permanent neurological disability. Functional recovery requires the enhancement of axonal and synaptic plasticity of spared as well as injured fibres, which need to sprout and/or regenerate to form new connections. Here, we have investigated whether the epigenetic stimulation of the regenerative gene expression program can overcome the current inability to promote neurological recovery in chronic SCI with severe disability. We delivered the CBP/p300 activator CSP-TTK21 or vehicle CSP weekly between week 12 and 22 following a transection model of SCI in mice housed in an enriched environment. Data analysis showed that CSP-TTK21 enhanced classical regenerative signalling in dorsal root ganglia sensory but not cortical motor neurons, stimulated motor and sensory axon growth, sprouting, and synaptic plasticity, but failed to promote neurological sensorimotor recovery. This work provides direct evidence that clinically suitable pharmacological CBP/p300 activation can promote the expression of regeneration-associated genes and axonal growth in a chronic SCI with severe neurological disability.

                Background: Biochemical and biophysical factors jointly regulate the cellular dynamics in many physiological processes. It is therefore imperative to include multiplexed microenvironment cues when employing {in vitro} cell-based assays to model physiological processes. Methods: To meet this need, we have developed a modular platform of 3D cell culture, Modular Control of Microenvironment for Cell Migration and Culture Assay (MC33A), that incorporates directed chemical and mechanical cues in the forms of chemotaxis and contact guidance, respectively. Taking advantage of the functionalities of MC33A, we study the migration and morphology of breast cancer cells in 3D engineered extracellular matrix (ECM) following a serum gradient for chemotaxis. Results: We show that when chemotaxis is facilitated by contact guidance in the same direction as the serum gradient, cells demonstrate dimensional-reduction in their motility and highly elongated ellipsoidal shape. When the direction of ECM alignment diverges from the direction of serum gradient, chemotactic motion is significantly suppressed, and cells are generally more protrusive and rounded in their morphology. Conclusions: These examples demonstrate MC33A as a powerful tool for engineering complex microenvironments of cells that will advance the state-of-the-art of cell-based analysis in drug development, regenerative medicine, and other research areas in bioengineering.

                Background: In language learning, reading is a skill that enables interaction with a text in whatever field of knowledge the learner is pursuing. Readers tend to use strategies such as comprehension, interpretation and conception of decoding written language and texts to enhance their reading capacity. This research explores the reading strategies applied by Saudi English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners and compares the reading abilities of male and female EFL students. Methods: The study interviewed three EFL students about the reading strategies they applied while reading passages and texts. Then an International English Language Testing System (IELTS) reading test was handed over to 26 randomly selected students. Results: The study found that the reading strategies used by the students interviewed involved skimming, scanning, guessing the meaning from context, identifying the mean idea, and summarizing the body of the text in question. Moreover, the study revealed that both male and female students scored low in the IELTS tests that the researchers conducted. The average mean score they reached was 7.15 out of 20. However, even in the low scoring ratio, female students (M=7.69) outperformed male students (M= 6.62) and the difference between them remained significant, P=.000. Conclusions: The study recommends that the language instructors help EFL learners in developing their reading strategies and applying them every time they read any text.

                Background: Staphylococcus aureus is commonly found in dairy cows and is a source of contamination in milk. S. aureus that are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics (especially cefoxitin) are referred to as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The spread of MRSA cannot be separated from sanitation management during milking; it can originate from milk collected from the udder or from the hands of farmers during the milking process. The purpose of this study was to examine the level of MRSA contamination in dairy cow's milk and farmer's hand. Methods: A total of 109 samples of dairy cow’s milk and 41 samples of farmer’s hand swabs were collected at a dairy farm in Probolinggo, East Java, Indonesia. Samples were cultured and purified using mannitol salt agar (MSA). The profile of S. aureus resistance was established by disk diffusion test using a disk of beta-lactam antibiotics, namely oxacillin and cefoxitin. Results: The S. aureus isolates that were resistant to oxacillin and cefoxitin antibiotics were then tested for oxacillin resistance screening agar base (ORSAB) as a confirmation test for MRSA identity. S. aureus isolates suspected to be MRSA were then tested genotypically by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to detect the presence of the mecA gene. The results of the isolation and identification found 80 isolates (53.33%) of S. aureus. The results of the resistance test found that 42 isolates (15%) of S. aureus were resistant to oxacillin and 10 isolates (12.5%) were resistant to cefoxitin. The ORSAB test found as many as 20 isolates (47.62%) were positive for MRSA. In PCR testing to detect the presence of the mecA gene, three isolates (30%) were positive for the mecA gene. Conclusions: This study shows that several S. aureus isolates were MRSA and had the gene encoding mecA in dairy farms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Research data management for bioimaging: the 2021 NFDI4BIOIMAGE community survey [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Knowing the needs of the bioimaging community with respect to research data management (RDM) is essential for identifying measures that enable adoption of the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for microscopy and bioimage analysis data across disciplines. As an initiative within Germany's National Research Data Infrastructure, we conducted this community survey in summer 2021 to assess the state of the art of bioimaging RDM and the community needs. Methods: An online survey was conducted with a mixed question-type design. We created a questionnaire tailored to relevant topics of the bioimaging community, including specific questions on bioimaging methods and bioimage analysis, as well as more general questions on RDM principles and tools. 203 survey entries were included in the analysis covering the perspectives from various life and biomedical science disciplines and from participants at different career levels. Results: The results highlight the importance and value of bioimaging RDM and data sharing. However, the practical implementation of FAIR practices is impeded by technical hurdles, lack of knowledge, and insecurity about the legal aspects of data sharing. The survey participants request metadata guidelines and annotation tools and endorse the usage of image data management platforms. At present, OMERO (Open Microscopy Environment Remote Objects) is the best known and most widely used platform. Most respondents rely on image processing and analysis, which they regard as the most time-consuming step of the bioimage data workflow. While knowledge about and implementation of electronic lab notebooks and data management plans is limited, respondents acknowledge their potential value for data handling and publication. Conclusion: The bioimaging community acknowledges and endorses the value of RDM and data sharing. Still, there is a need for information, guidance, and standardization to foster the adoption of FAIR data handling. This survey may help inspiring targeted measures to close this gap.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess whether post-stroke epilepsy (PSE) is associated with neuroimaging findings of hemosiderin in a case–control study, and whether the addition of hemosiderin markers improves the risk stratification models of PSE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a post-hoc analysis of the PROgnosis of POST-Stroke Epilepsy study enrolling PSE patients at National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, Osaka, Japan, from November 2014 to September 2019. PSE was diagnosed when one unprovoked seizure was experienced &gt;7 days after the index stroke, as proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy. As controls, consecutive acute stroke patients with no history or absence of any late seizure or continuing antiseizure medications at least 3 months after stroke were retrospectively enrolled during the same study period. We examined cortical microbleeds and cortical superficial siderosis (cSS) using gradient-echo T2*-weighted images. A logistic regression model with ridge penalties was tuned using 10-fold cross-validation. We added the item of cSS to the existing models (SeLECT and CAVE) for predicting PSE and evaluated performance of new models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study included 180 patients with PSE (67 women; median age 74 years) and 1,183 controls (440 women; median age 74 years). The cSS frequency was higher in PSE than control groups (48.9% vs 5.7%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Compared with the existing models, the new models with cSS (SeLECT-S and CAVE-S) demonstrated significantly better predictive performance of PSE (net reclassification improvement 0.63 [<i>p</i> = 0.004] for SeLECT-S and 0.88 [<i>p</i> = 0.001] for CAVE-S at the testing data).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cortical superficial siderosis was associated with PSE, stratifying stroke survivors at high risk of PSE. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">MRI Clustering Reveals Three ALS Subtypes With Unique Neurodegeneration Patterns</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to identify subtypes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by comparing patterns of neurodegeneration using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and explore their phenotypes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging in 488 clinically well-characterized patients with ALS and 338 control subjects. Measurements of whole-brain cortical thickness and white matter connectome fractional anisotropy were adjusted for disease-unrelated variation. A probabilistic network-based clustering algorithm was used to divide patients into subgroups of similar neurodegeneration patterns. Clinical characteristics and cognitive profiles were assessed for each subgroup. In total, 512 follow-up scans were used to validate clustering results longitudinally.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The clustering algorithm divided patients with ALS into 3 subgroups of 187, 163, and 138 patients. All subgroups displayed involvement of the precentral gyrus and are characterized, respectively, by (1) pure motor involvement (pure motor cluster [PM]), (2) orbitofrontal and temporal involvement (frontotemporal cluster [FT]), and (3) involvement of the posterior cingulate cortex, parietal white matter, temporal operculum, and cerebellum (cingulate-parietal–temporal cluster [CPT]). These subgroups had significantly distinct clinical profiles regarding male-to-female ratio, age at symptom onset, and frequency of bulbar symptom onset. FT and CPT revealed higher rates of cognitive impairment on the Edinburgh cognitive and behavioral ALS screen (ECAS). Longitudinally, clustering remained stable: at 90.4% of their follow-up visits, patients clustered in the same subgroup as their baseline visit.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>ALS can manifest itself in 3 main patterns of cerebral neurodegeneration, each associated with distinct clinical characteristics and cognitive profiles. Besides the pure motor and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)-like variants of ALS, a new neuroimaging phenotype has emerged, characterized by posterior cingulate, parietal, temporal, and cerebellar involvement.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The simplicity of XGBoost algorithm versus the complexity of Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Networks algorithms in urban forest classification [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The availability of urban forest is under serious threat, especially in developing countries where urbanization is taking place rapidly. Meanwhile, there are many classifier algorithms available to monitor the extent of the urban forest. However, we need to assess the performance of each classifier to understand its complexity and accuracy. Methods: This study proposes a novel procedure using R language with RStudio software to assess four different classifiers based on different numbers of training datasets to classify the urban forest within the campus environment. The normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) were then employed to compare the accuracy of each classifier. Results: This study found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier outperformed the other three classifiers, with an RMSE value of 1.56. While the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were in second, third, and fourth place with RMSE values of 4.33, 6.81, and 7.45 respectively. Conclusions: The XGBoost algorithm is the most suitable for urban forest classification with limited data training. This study is easy to reproduce since the code is available and open to the public.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Biopsychosocial factors associated with depression in the elderly: A systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: One of the most common mental illnesses worldwide and that has significant negative effects on well-being and physical health, is depression. Many factors that affect the occurrence of depression are biopsychosocial. Elderly people have high risk factors for depression. This study aims to review and find a gap in current evidence of biopsychosocial factors affecting depression in the elderly. Methods: We conducted an advanced search on PubMed database between October and November 2021. We screened the bibliographies of the articles from the database search using a set of inclusion criteria: studies with quantitative design; elderly population sample; exploration of at least one biopsychosocial factor; depression as the outcome or dependent variable; written in English; and published between 2011 and 2021. Results: We found 54 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, five papers discussed biopsychosocial factors, 18 discussed biological and psychological/social factors, five discussed psychosocial factors, and the rest of the studies discussed one component of biopsychosocial factors. Biological factors influencing elderly depression include being female, having health problems or low health status, older age, genetics, brain structure, and biomarkers, taking certain drugs, and lack of or inability to carry out daily activities. Psychosocial factors include lack of social support, low education level, financial problems, single/unmarried, lack of contact with family/friends, living alone, low self-perceived health, stressful life events, loneliness, and losing hobbies. From the literature search, it was also found that there are biopsychosocial factors that have not been studied and are expected to be able to make references for future research. From this literature review, we found gaps in the availability of evidence about biopsychosocial factors that require further research. Conclusions: Knowing the biopsychosocial factors that affect them can help to prevent depression in the elderly.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Paravertebral vs. Epidural Analgesia for Liver Surgery (PEALS): Protocol for a randomized controlled pilot study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Perioperative thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is commonly used in hepatectomy patients since it is opioid-sparing and reduces cardiorespiratory complications. However, TEA has a high failure rate and is associated with potentially devastating complications (particularly spinal haematoma) and the risk is likely increased with hepatectomy. Thus, some centres favour systemic opioid-based modalities which, in turn, are associated with inferior analgesia and well-known risks/side-effects. Hence, alternative analgesic methods are desirable. Paravertebral block (PVB) has been used in liver resection with advantages including hemodynamic stability, low failure rates, and low risk of spinal haematoma. Our purpose is to conduct a blinded, pilot RCT with hepatectomy patients randomised to receive TEA or PVB for perioperative analgesia. Our hypothesis is that opioid consumption, time to first analgesic request, and pain scores will be comparable between groups, but PVB patients will require fewer perioperative vasopressors/blood products, and have fewer adverse events and a shorter hospital stay. Methods: With ethics approval, this non-inferiority, pilot RCT with a convenience sample of 50 hepatectomy patients will examine whether PVB imparts analgesia comparable to TEA but with fewer adverse effects. Primary outcomes are surrogates of analgesia for 72 h postoperatively (i.e., opioid consumption, time to first analgesic request and pain scores at rest and with coughing); Secondary outcomes are blood products/fluids administered; side effects/complications until 72 h postoperatively; length of hospital stay. The results will be used to plan a large multicentre trial comparing TEA vs. PVB in hepatectomy patients. This study has a high potential to positively impact the quality/safety of patient care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Pathological fracture in a Li-Fraumeni osteosarcoma patient: "Capasquelet'' femoral reconstruction and tumor vascular analysis with endomucin immunofluorescence multiplexing [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                We describe the case report of an Osteosarcoma patient, with a Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, presenting with a pathological femoral fracture. The patient was treated with a multidisciplinary approach associating neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy with excisional surgery. The femoral reconstruction consisted of a ``Capasquelet'' reconstruction combining an induced membrane and a vascularized fibula allograft allowing a good functional result with an early weight-bearing. We managed to complete our histological analysis in this patient, in order to evaluate the tumor vascularization. Indeed, using the syngeneic osteosarcoma MOS-J mouse model, we highlighted previously that CD31+/\ensuremath{\alpha }-SMA+ vessels may be indicators of vasculature normalization and therefore may be used as specific markers of a good therapeutic response. Thus, we search for its interest in this specific case as preliminary work. The aim was to assess the feasibility and technical validity of the vascularization analysis of a human osteosarcoma tumor specimen. Therefore, we propose an immunohistochemistry methodology  with multiplexed immunofluorescence to assess the vascularization as a promising marker in human osteosarcoma tissue.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal fear engrams modulate ethanol‐induced maladaptive contextual generalization in mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The compounding symptomatology of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and co-occurring mental health disorders gives rise to interactions of maladaptive neurobiological processes, the etiology of which are elusive. Here, we devised an optogenetic strategy aimed at rescuing maladaptive fear processing in male c57BL/6 mice that underwent a chronic ethanol administration and forced abstinence paradigm. In the first experiment, we confirmed that fear acquisition and maladaptive contextual generalization was potentiated in ethanol-exposed mice during fear conditioning and exposure to a novel environment, respectively. In the second experiment, using an activity-dependent tet-tag system, we labeled the neural ensemble selectively activated by contextual fear conditioning in the dorsal hippocampus with an inhibitory opsin to attenuate behavioral dysfunctions resulting from ethanol exposure. We found that acute optogenetic perturbations during exposure to a novel environment suppressed maladaptive generalization in ethanol-exposed mice. These results provide further evidence for a crucial link between ethanol exposure and impaired fear memory processing by providing cellular and behavioral insights into the neural circuitry underlying AUD and maladaptive fear processing.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A special class of neurons in the hippocampal formation broadly known as the spatial cells, whose subcategories include place cells, grid cells, and head direction cells, are considered to be the building blocks of the brain's map of the spatial world. We present a general, deep learning-based modeling framework that describes the emergence of the spatial-cell responses and can also explain responses that involve a combination of path integration and vision. The first layer of the model consists of head direction (HD) cells that code for the preferred direction of the agent. The second layer is the path integration (PI) layer with oscillatory neurons: displacement of the agent in a given direction modulates the frequency of these oscillators. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the PI-cell responses showed the emergence of cells with grid-like spatial periodicity. We show that the Bessel functions could describe the response of these cells. The output of the PI layer is used to train a stack of autoencoders. Neurons of both the layers exhibit responses resembling grid cells and place cells. The paper concludes by suggesting the wider applicability of the proposed modeling framework beyond the two simulated studies.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We hypothesize that hippocampal local field potentials in acetylcholine (ACh)-deficient mutant mice, compared to wild-type (WT) mice, will show lower sensitivity to muscarinic cholinergic antagonist scopolamine (5 mg/kg i.p.) but higher sensitivity to NMDA receptor antagonist 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP, 10 mg/kg i.p.). Recordings were made during walk and awake-immobility (IMM) in WT mice, and in mice with forebrain knockout (KO) of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) gene, or heterozygous knockdown of VAChT gene (KD). Scopolamine or CPP did not significantly alter walk theta frequency, which was higher in KD than WT/KO mice. Scopolamine decreased theta power peak rise during walk in WT/KD mice but not in KO mice, while CPP suppressed theta peak rise more in WT/KO mice than KD mice. During IMM, scopolamine decreased gamma1 (γ1, 30–58 Hz) power more in KD/WT mice than KO mice, while delta (1–4 Hz) power and delta-gamma cross-frequency coherence (CFC) were increased in all mouse groups during IMM or walk. During walk, scopolamine increased delta and beta (13–30 Hz) power and decreased gamma2 (γ2, 62–100 Hz) power and theta-γ2 CFC more in WT/KD than KO mice. Theta-γ2, but not theta-γ1, CFC increased with theta-peak-frequency in WT/KD mice, and was suppressed by scopolamine at high theta (8–10 Hz) frequency; theta-γ2 CFC in KO mice was not significantly altered by scopolamine. CPP decreased beta and gamma power more in KD/KO mice compared to WT mice, while delta power and delta-gamma CFC were increased in all mouse groups. ACh deficiency exacerbates the attenuation of beta and gamma power by CPP. We conclude that both muscarinic and NMDA transmission contribute toward hippocampal theta, beta, and gamma power, and a decrease in gamma power or theta-gamma CFC may be associated with loss of arousal and cognitive functions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a brain region involved in critical cognitive functions including memory, planning, and spatial navigation and is commonly affected in neurodegenerative diseases. Subregions of RSC are typically described as Brodmann areas 29 and 30, which are defined by cytoarchitectural features. Using immunofluorescence, we studied the distributions of neurons immunoreactive for NeuN, latexin, and calcium binding proteins (calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin) in RSC of <i>Carollia perspicillata</i>, Seba's short-tailed fruit bat. We observed that latexin was specifically present in areas 29a and 29b but not 29c and 30. We further identified distribution patterns of calcium binding proteins that group areas 29a and 29b separately from areas 29c and 30. We conclude first that latexin is a useful marker to classify subregions of RSC and second that these subregions contain distinct patterns of neuronal immunoreactivity for calcium binding proteins. Given the long lifespan of <i>Carollia</i>, bat RSC may be a useful model in studying age-related neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Learning‐related changes in cellular activity within mouse dentate gyrus during trace eyeblink conditioning</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Because the dentate gyrus serves as the first site for information processing in the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit, it an important structure for the formation of associative memories. Previous findings in rabbit had recorded populations of cells within dentate gyrus that may bridge the temporal gap between stimuli to support memory formation during trace eyeblink conditioning, an associative learning task. However, this previous work was unable to identify the types of cells demonstrating this type of activity. To explore these changes further, we did in vivo single-neuron recording in conjunction with physiological determination of cell types to investigate the functional role of granule cells, mossy cells, and interneurons in dentate gyrus during learning. Tetrode recordings were performed in young-adult mice during training on trace eyeblink conditioning, a hippocampal-dependent temporal associative memory task. Conditioned mice were able to successfully learn the task, with male mice learning at a faster rate than female mice. In the conditioned group, granule cells tended to show an increase in firing rate during conditioned stimulus presentation while mossy cells showed a decrease in firing rate during the trace interval and the unconditioned stimulus. Interestingly, populations of interneurons demonstrated learning-related increases and decreases in activity that began at onset of the conditioned stimulus and persisted through the trace interval. The current study also found a significant increase in theta power during stimuli presentation in conditioned animals, and this change in theta decreased over time. Ultimately, these data suggest unique involvement of granule cells, mossy cells, and interneurons in dentate gyrus in the formation of a trace associative memory. This work expands our knowledge of dentate gyrus function, helping to discern how aging and disease might disrupt this process.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Effect of intra‐BLA overexpression of IGF‐1 on the expression of a contextual fear memory trace</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), among others are known for their critical involvement in learning and memory processes. IGF-1 regulates cognitive functions, synapse density, neurotransmission, and adult neurogenesis and induces structural and synaptic plasticity-specific changes. Although IGF-1 has been suggested to participate in different memory processes, its role in memories associated with negative emotional experiences still remains to be elucidated. The principal aim of the present study was to test whether IGF-1 overexpression using adenoviral vectors in basolateral amygdala (BLA) influences both the expression and formation of contextual fear memory, as well as the hippocampal structural plasticity associated with such memory trace. We found that IGF-1 overexpression promotes the formation and expression of a specific contextual fear memory trace, and such effect persisted at least 7 days after recall. Moreover, the overexpression of this growth factor in BLA upregulates the activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway in this brain structure. In addition, intra-BLA IGF-1 overexpression causes dorsal hippocampus (DH) structural plasticity modifications promoting changes in the proportion of mature dendritic spines in the CA1 region, after a weak conditioning protocol. The present findings contribute to the knowledge underlying BLA-DH trace memory of fear and reveal important new insights into the neurobiology and neurochemistry of fear acquisition modulated by IGF-1 overexpression. The understanding of how IGF-1 modulates the formation of a fear contextual trace may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies focused on fear, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Interaction of RAGE with α-synuclein fibrils mediates inflammatory response of microglia</a></h4>

              
                Exploring the mechanism underlying the interplay between α-syn and neuroinflammation is important for PD treatment. Long et al. perform a series of biophysical and cellular experiments to demonstrate the structural basis of RAGE-α-syn interaction and the important role of RAGE in PD neuroinflammation. Blockage of the RAGE-α-syn interaction may alleviate α-syn-induced neuroinflammation in PD.

                Using single-cell natural transdifferentiation models in C. elegans, Riva et al. demonstrate that conserved and event-specific mechanisms allow transdifferentiation with or without cell division. Although evolutionary-conserved plasticity factors are required independently of cell division, Wnt signaling activity is context dependent. Dichotomic interactions between SOX-2 and Wnt may control re-differentiation timing.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">GABP couples oncogene signaling to telomere regulation in TERT promoter mutant cancer</a></h4>

              
                TERT promoter mutations are common in human cancer and confer cellular immortality. McKinney et al. describe the interaction between TERT promoter mutations, EGFR amplification, and the cell cycle in glioblastoma. The results demonstrate how proliferation drivers cooperate with telomere maintenance mechanisms to counteract telomere shortening caused by unlimited cell division.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transient cell-in-cell formation underlies tumor relapse and resistance to immunotherapy</a></h4>

              
                Despite the remarkable successes of cancer immunotherapies, the majority of patients will experience only partial response followed by relapse of resistant tumors. While treatment resistance has frequently been attributed to clonal selection and immunoediting, comparisons of paired primary and relapsed tumors in melanoma and breast cancers indicate that they share the majority of clones. Here, we demonstrate in both mouse models and clinical human samples that tumor cells evade immunotherapy by generating unique transient cell-in-cell structures, which are resistant to killing by T cells and chemotherapies. While the outer cells in this cell-in-cell formation are often killed by reactive T cells, the inner cells remain intact and disseminate into single tumor cells once T cells are no longer present. This formation is mediated predominantly by IFNγ-activated T cells, which subsequently induce phosphorylation of the transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and early growth response-1 (EGR-1) in tumor cells. Indeed, inhibiting these factors prior to immunotherapy significantly improves its therapeutic efficacy. Overall, this work highlights a currently insurmountable limitation of immunotherapy and reveals a previously unknown resistance mechanism which enables tumor cells to survive immune-mediated killing without altering their immunogenicity.

                Posterior urethral valves (PUV) are the commonest cause of end-stage renal disease in children, but the genetic architecture of this rare disorder remains unknown. We performed a sequencing-based genome-wide association study (seqGWAS) in 132 unrelated male PUV cases and 23,727 controls of diverse ancestry, identifying statistically significant associations with common variants at 12q24.21 (<i>P</i>=7.8x10<sup>-12</sup>; OR 0.4) and rare variants at 6p21.1 (<i>P</i>=2.0x10<sup>-8</sup>; OR 7.2), that were replicated in an independent European cohort of 395 cases and 4,151 controls. Fine-mapping and functional genomic data mapped these loci to the transcription factor <i>TBX5</i> and planar cell polarity gene <i>PTK7</i>, respectively, the encoded proteins of which were detected in the developing urinary tract of human embryos. We also observed enrichment of rare structural variation intersecting with candidate <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements, particularly inversions predicted to affect chromatin looping (<i>P</i>=3.1x10<sup>-5</sup>). These findings represent the first robust genetic associations of PUV, providing novel insights into the underlying biology of this poorly understood disorder and demonstrate how a diverse ancestry seqGWAS can be used for disease locus discovery in a rare disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Kinesin-1, -2 and -3 motors use family-specific mechanochemical strategies to effectively compete with dynein during bidirectional transport</a></h4>

              
                Bidirectional cargo transport in neurons requires competing activity of motors from the kinesin-1, -2 and -3 superfamilies against cytoplasmic dynein-1. Previous studies demonstrated that when kinesin-1 attached to dynein-dynactin-BicD2 (DDB) complex, the tethered motors move slowly with a slight plus-end bias, suggesting kinesin-1 overpowers DDB but DDB generates a substantial hindering load. Compared to kinesin-1, motors from the kinesin-2 and -3 families display a higher sensitivity to load in single-molecule assays and are thus predicted to be overpowered by dynein complexes in cargo transport. To test this prediction, we used a DNA scaffold to pair DDB with members of the kinesin-1, -2 and -3 families to recreate bidirectional transport in vitro, and tracked the motor pairs using two-channel TIRF microscopy. Unexpectedly, we find that when both kinesin and dynein are engaged and stepping on the microtubule, kinesin-1, -2, and -3 motors are able to effectively withstand hindering loads generated by DDB. Stochastic stepping simulations reveal that kinesin-2 and -3 motors compensate for their faster detachment rates under load with faster reattachment kinetics. The similar performance between the three kinesin transport families highlights how motor kinetics play critical roles in balancing forces between kinesin and dynein, and emphasizes the importance of motor regulation by cargo adaptors, regulatory proteins, and the microtubule track for tuning the speed and directionality of cargo transport in cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Progressive enhancement of kinetic proofreading in T cell antigen discrimination from receptor activation to DAG generation</a></h4>

              
                T cells use kinetic proofreading to discriminate antigens by converting small changes in antigen binding lifetime into large differences in cell activation, but where in the signaling cascade this computation is performed is unknown. Previously, we developed a light-gated immune receptor to probe the role of ligand kinetics in T cell antigen signaling. We found significant kinetic proofreading at the level of the signaling lipid diacylglycerol (DAG) but lacked the ability to determine where the multiple signaling steps required for kinetic discrimination originate in the upstream signaling cascade (Tischer and Weiner, 2019). Here we uncover where kinetic proofreading is executed by adapting our optogenetic system for robust activation of early signaling events. We find the strength of kinetic proofreading progressively increases from Zap70 recruitment to LAT clustering to downstream DAG generation. Leveraging the ability of our system to rapidly disengage ligand binding, we also measure slower reset rates for downstream signaling events. These data suggest a distributed kinetic proofreading mechanism, with proofreading steps both at the receptor and at slower resetting downstream signaling complexes that could help balance antigen sensitivity and discrimination.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bone marrow adipocytes drive the development of tissue invasive Ly6Chigh monocytes during obesity</a></h4>

              
                During obesity and high fat-diet (HFD) feeding in mice, sustained low-grade inflammation includes not only increased pro-inflammatory macrophages in the expanding adipose tissue, but also bone marrow (BM) production of invasive Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes. As BM adiposity also accrues with HFD, we explored the relationship between the gains in BM white adipocytes and invasive Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes <i>in vivo</i> and through <i>ex vivo</i> paradigms. We find a temporal and causal link between BM adipocyte whitening and the Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte surge, preceding the adipose tissue macrophage rise during HFD. Phenocopying this, <i>ex vivo</i> treatment of BM cells with conditioned media from BM adipocytes or from <i>bona fide</i> white adipocytes favoured Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte preponderance. Notably, Ly6C<sup>high</sup> skewing was preceded by monocyte metabolic reprogramming towards glycolysis, reduced oxidative potential and increased mitochondrial fission. In sum, short-term HFD changes BM cellularity, resulting in local adipocyte whitening driving a gradual increase and activation of invasive Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">H3K9me1/2 methylation limits the lifespan of daf-2 mutants in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Histone methylation plays crucial roles in the development, gene regulation and maintenance of stem cell pluripotency in mammals. Recent work shows that histone methylation is associated with aging, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we identified a class of putative histone 3 lysine 9 mono-/di-methyltransferase genes (<i>met-2, set-6, set-19, set-20, set-21, set-32</i> and <i>set-33</i>), mutations in which induce synergistic lifespan extension in the long-lived DAF-2 (IGF-1 receptor) mutant in <i>C. elegans</i>. These putative histone methyltransferase plus <i>daf-2</i> double mutants not only exhibited an average lifespan nearly three times that of wild-type animals and a maximal lifespan of approximately 100 days, but also significantly increased resistance to oxidative and heat stress. Synergistic lifespan extension depends on the transcription factor DAF-16 (FOXO). mRNA-seq experiments revealed that the mRNA levels of DAF-16 Class I genes, which are activated by DAF-16, were further elevated in the <i>daf-2;set</i> double mutants. Among these genes, <i>tts-1</i>, <i>F35E8.7</i>, <i>ins-35</i>, <i>nhr-62</i>, <i>sod-3</i>, <i>asm-2</i> and <i>Y39G8B.7</i> are required for the lifespan extension of the <i>daf-2;set-21</i> double mutant. In addition, treating <i>daf-2</i> animals with the H3K9me1/2 methyltransferase G9a inhibitor also extends lifespan and increases stress resistance. Therefore, investigation of DAF-2 and H3K9me1/2 deficiency-mediated synergistic longevity will contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aging and therapeutic applications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor deficiency yields profound hearing loss through Kv7.4 channel upsurge in auditory neurons and hair cells</a></h4>

              
                Repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST) is a transcriptional repressor that recognizes neuron-restrictive silencer elements in the mammalian genomes in a tissue- and cell-specific manner. The identity of REST target genes and molecular details of how REST regulates them are emerging. We performed conditional null deletion of <i>Rest</i> (cKO), mainly restricted to murine hair cells (HCs) and auditory neurons (aka spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs)). Null-inactivation of full-length REST did not affect the development of normal HCs and SGNs but manifested as progressive hearing loss in adult mice. We found that the inactivation of REST resulted in an increased abundance of K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. Specifically, we found that SGNs and HCs from <i>Rest</i> cKO mice displayed increased K<sub>v</sub>7.4 expression and augmented K<sub>v</sub>7 currents; SGN’s excitability was also significantly reduced. Administration of a compound with K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channel activator activity, fasudil, recapitulated progressive hearing loss in mice. In contrast, inhibition of the K<sub>v</sub>7 channels by XE991 rescued the auditory phenotype of <i>Rest</i> cKO mice. Previous studies identified some loss-of-function mutations within the K<sub>v</sub>7.4-coding gene, <i>Kcnq4</i>, as a causative factor for progressive hearing loss in mice and humans. Thus, the findings reveal that a critical homeostatic K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channel level is required for proper auditory functions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distance estimation from monocular cues in an ethological visuomotor task</a></h4>

              
                In natural contexts, sensory processing and motor output are closely coupled, which is reflected in the fact that many brain areas contain both sensory and movement signals. However, standard reductionist paradigms decouple sensory decisions from their natural motor consequences, and head-fixation prevents the natural sensory consequences of self-motion. In particular, movement through the environment provides a number of depth cues beyond stereo vision that are poorly understood. To study the integration of visual processing and motor output in a naturalistic task, we investigated distance estimation in freely moving mice. We found that mice use vision to accurately jump across a variable gap, thus directly coupling a visual computation to its corresponding ethological motor output. Monocular eyelid suture did not affect gap jumping success, thus mice can use cues that do not depend on binocular disparity and stereo vision. Under monocular conditions, mice altered their head positioning and performed more vertical head movements, consistent with a shift from using stereopsis to other monocular cues, such as motion or position parallax. Finally, optogenetic suppression of primary visual cortex impaired task performance under both binocular and monocular conditions when optical fiber placement was localized to binocular or monocular zone V1, respectively. Together, these results show that mice can use monocular cues, relying on visual cortex, to accurately judge distance. Furthermore, this behavioral paradigm provides a foundation for studying how neural circuits convert sensory information into ethological motor output.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">​Frequency-specific neural signatures of perceptual content and perceptual stability</a></h4>

              
                In the natural environment, we often form stable perceptual experiences from ambiguous and fleeting sensory inputs. Which neural activity underlies the content of perception and which neural activity supports perceptual stability remains an open question. We used a bistable perception paradigm involving ambiguous images to behaviorally dissociate perceptual content from perceptual stability, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure whole-brain neural dynamics in humans. Combining multivariate decoding and neural state-space analyses, we found frequency band-specific neural signatures that underlie the content of perception and promote perceptual stability, respectively. Across different types of images, non-oscillatory neural activity in the slow cortical potential (SCP, &lt;5 Hz) range supported the content of perception. Perceptual stability was additionally influenced by the amplitude of alpha and beta oscillations. In addition, neural activity underlying perceptual memory, which supports perceptual stability when sensory input is temporally removed from view, also encodes elapsed time. Together, these results reveal distinct neural mechanisms that support the content vs. stability of visual perception.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Stability of motor representations after paralysis</a></h4>

              
                Neural plasticity allows us to learn skills and incorporate new experiences. What happens when our lived experiences fundamentally change, such as after a severe injury? To address this question, we analyzed intracortical population activity in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of a tetraplegic adult as she controlled a virtual hand through a brain-computer interface (BCI). By attempting to move her fingers, she could accurately drive the corresponding virtual fingers. Neural activity during finger movements exhibited robust representational structure similar to fMRI recordings of able-bodied individuals' motor cortex, which has previously been shown to reflect able-bodied usage patterns. The finger representational structure was consistent throughout multiple sessions, even though the structure contributed to BCI decoding errors. Within individual BCI movements, the representational structure was dynamic, first resembling muscle activation patterns and then resembling the anticipated sensory consequences. Our results reveal that motor representations in PPC reflect able-bodied motor usage patterns even after paralysis, and BCIs can re-engage these representations to restore lost motor functions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">DNA methylome combined with chromosome cluster-oriented analysis provides an early signature for cutaneous melanoma aggressiveness</a></h4>

              
                Aberrant DNA methylation is a well‑known feature of tumours and has been associated with metastatic melanoma. However, since melanoma cells are highly heterogeneous, it has been challenging to use affected genes to predict tumour aggressiveness, metastatic evolution, and patients' outcomes. We hypothesized that common aggressive hypermethylation signatures should emerge early in tumorigenesis and should be shared in aggressive cells, independent of the physiological context under which this trait arises. We compared paired melanoma cell lines with the following properties: <i>(i)</i> each pair comprises one aggressive counterpart and its parental cell line, and <i>(ii)</i> the aggressive cell lines were each obtained from different host and their environment (human, rat, and mouse), though starting from the same parent cell line. Next, we developed a multi-step genomic pipeline that combines the DNA methylome profile with a chromosome cluster-oriented analysis. A total of 229 differentially hypermethylated genes were commonly found in the aggressive cell lines. Genome localization analysis revealed hypermethylation peaks and clusters, identifying eight hypermethylated gene promoters for validation in tissues from melanoma patients. Five CpG identified in primary melanoma tissues were transformed into a DNA methylation score that can predict survival (Log-rank test, <i>p</i>=0.0008). This strategy is potentially universally applicable to other diseases involving DNA methylation alterations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Group II truncated haemoglobin YjbI prevents reactive oxygen species-induced protein aggregation in Bacillus subtilis</a></h4>

              
                Oxidative stress–mediated formation of protein hydroperoxides can induce irreversible fragmentation of the peptide backbone and accumulation of cross-linked protein aggregates, leading to cellular toxicity, dysfunction, and death. However, how bacteria protect themselves from damages caused by protein hydroperoxidation is unknown. Here we show that YjbI, a group II truncated haemoglobin from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, prevents oxidative aggregation of cell-surface proteins by its protein hydroperoxide peroxidase-like activity, which removes hydroperoxide groups from oxidised proteins. Disruption of the <i>yjbI</i> gene in <i>B. subtilis</i> lowered biofilm water repellence, which associated with the cross-linked aggregation of the biofilm matrix protein TasA. YjbI was localised to the cell surface or the biofilm matrix, and the sensitivity of planktonically grown cells to generators of reactive oxygen species was significantly increased upon <i>yjbI</i> disruption, suggesting that YjbI pleiotropically protects labile cell-surface proteins from oxidative damage. YjbI removed hydroperoxide residues from the model oxidized protein substrate bovine serum albumin and biofilm component TasA, preventing oxidative aggregation <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, the replacement of Tyr<sup>63</sup> near the haem of YjbI with phenylalanine resulted in the loss of its protein peroxidase-like activity, and the mutant gene failed to rescue biofilm water repellency and resistance to oxidative stress induced by hypochlorous acid in the <i>yjbI</i>-deficient strain. These findings provide new insights into the role of truncated haemoglobin and the importance of hydroperoxide removal from proteins in the survival of aerobic bacteria.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Empirical single-cell tracking and cell-fate simulation reveal dual roles of p53 in tumor suppression</a></h4>

              
                The tumor suppressor p53 regulates various stress responses via increasing its cellular levels. The lowest p53 levels occur in unstressed cells; however, the functions of these low levels remain unclear. To investigate the functions, we used empirical single-cell tracking of p53-expressing (Control) cells and cells in which p53 expression was silenced by RNA interference (p53 RNAi). Here we show that p53 RNAi cells underwent more frequent cell death and cell fusion, which further induced multipolar cell division to generate aneuploid progeny. Those results suggest that the low levels of p53 in unstressed cells indeed have a role in suppressing the induction of cell death and the formation of aneuploid cells. We further investigated the impact of p53 silencing by developing an algorithm to simulate the fates of individual cells. Simulation of the fate of aneuploid cells revealed that these cells could propagate to create an aneuploid cell population. In addition, the simulation also revealed that more frequent induction of cell death in p53 RNAi cells under unstressed conditions conferred a disadvantage in terms of population expansion compared with Control cells, resulting in faster expansion of Control cells compared with p53 RNAi cells, leading to Control cells predominating in mixed cell populations. In contrast, the expansion of Control cells, but not p53 RNAi cells, was suppressed when the damage response was induced, allowing p53 RNAi cells to expand their population compared with the Control cells. These results suggest that, although p53 could suppress the formation of aneuploid cells, which could have a role in tumorigenesis, it could also allow the expansion of cells lacking p53 expression when the damage response is induced. p53 may thus play a role in both the suppression and the promotion of malignant cell formation during tumorigenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Ellipse of Insignificance, a refined fragility indexfor ascertaining robustness of results indichotomous outcome trials</a></h4>

              
                There is increasing awareness throughout biomedical science that many results do not withstand the trials of repeat investigation. The growing abundance of medical literature has only increased the urgent need for tools to gauge the robustness and trustworthiness of published science. Dichotomous outcome designs are vital in randomized clinical trials, cohort studies, and observational data for ascertaining differences between experimental and control arms. It has however been shown with tools like the fragility index (FI) that many ostensibly impactful results fail to materialise when even small numbers of patients or subjects in either the control or experimental arms are recoded from event to non-event. Critics of this metric counter that there is no objective means to determine a meaningful FI. As currently used, FI is not multi-dimensional and is computationally expensive. In this work a conceptually similar geometrical approach is introduced, the ellipse of insignificance (EOI). This method yields precise deterministic values for the degree of manipulation or miscoding that can be tolerated simultaneously in both control and experimental arms, allowing for the derivation of objective measures of experimental robustness. More than this, the tool is intimately connected with sensitivity and specificity of the event / non-event tests, and is readily combined with knowledge of test parameters to reject unsound results. The method is outlined here, with illustrative clinical examples.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Network design principle for robust oscillatory behaviors with respect to biological noise</a></h4>

              
                Oscillatory behaviors, which are ubiquitous in transcriptional regulatory networks, are often subject to inevitable biological noise. Thus, a natural question is how transcriptional regulatory networks can robustly achieve accurate oscillation in the presence of biological noise. Here, we search all two- and three-node transcriptional regulatory network topologies for those robustly capable of accurate oscillation against the parameter variability (extrinsic noise) or stochasticity of chemical reactions (intrinsic noise). We find that, no matter what source of the noise is applied, the topologies containing the repressilator with positive autoregulation show higher robustness of accurate oscillation than those containing the activator-inhibitor oscillator, and additional positive autoregulation enhances the robustness against noise. Nevertheless, the attenuation of different sources of noise is governed by distinct mechanisms: the parameter variability is buffered by the long period, while the stochasticity of chemical reactions is filtered by the high amplitude. Furthermore, we analyze the noise of a synthetic human nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling network by varying three different topologies and verify that the addition of a repressilator to the activator-inhibitor oscillator, which leads to the emergence of high-robustness motif—the repressilator with positive autoregulation—improves the oscillation accuracy in comparison to the topology with only an activator-inhibitor oscillator. These design principles may be applicable to other oscillatory circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">FSH-blocking therapeutic for osteoporosis</a></h4>

              
                Pharmacological and genetic studies over the past decade have established the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) as an actionable target for diseases affecting millions, namely osteoporosis, obesity, and Alzheimer's disease. Blocking FSH action prevents bone loss, fat gain and neurodegeneration in mice. We recently developed a first-in-class, humanized, epitope-specific FSH-blocking antibody, MS-Hu6, with a K<sub>D</sub> of 7.52 nM. Using a GLP-compliant platform, we now report the efficacy of MS-Hu6 in preventing and treating osteoporosis in mice and parameters of acute safety in monkeys. Biodistribution studies using <sup>89</sup>Zr-labelled, biotinylated or unconjugated MS-Hu6 in mice and monkeys showed localization to bone and bone marrow. MS-Hu6 displayed a β phase t<sub>½</sub> of 7.5 days (180 hours) in humanized Tg32 mice. We tested 217 variations of excipients using the protein thermal shift assay to generate a final formulation that rendered MS-Hu6 stable in solution upon freeze-thaw and at different temperatures, with minimal aggregation, and without self-, cross-, or hydrophobic interactions or appreciable binding to relevant human antigens. MS-Hu6 showed the same level of 'humanness' as human IgG1 <i>in silico</i> and was non-immunogenic in ELISPOT assays for IL-2 and IFNg in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures. We conclude that MS-Hu6 is efficacious, durable, and manufacturable, and is therefore poised for future human testing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Global chromatin mobility induced by a DSB is dictated by chromosomal conformation and defines the HR outcome</a></h4>

              
                Repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is crucial for genome integrity. A conserved response to DSBs is an increase in chromatin mobility that can be local, at the site of the DSB, or global, at undamaged regions of the genome. Here, we address the function of global chromatin mobility during homologous recombination (HR) of a single, targeted, controlled DSB. We set up a system that tracks HR in vivo over time and show that two types of DSB-induced global chromatin mobility are involved in HR, depending on the position of the DSB. Close to the centromere, a DSB induces global mobility that depends solely on H2A(X) phosphorylation and accelerates repair kinetics, but is not essential. In contrast, the global mobility induced by a DSB away from the centromere becomes essential for HR repair and is triggered by homology search through a mechanism that depends on H2A(X) phosphorylation, checkpoint progression, and Rad51. Our data demonstrate that global mobility is governed by chromosomal conformation and differentially coordinates repair by HR.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A neural mechanism of cognitive reserve: The case of bilingualism</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive Reserve (CR) refers to the preservation of cognitive function in the face of age- or disease-related neuroanatomical decline. While bilingualism is known to contribute to CR, the extent to which, and what particular aspect of, second language experience contributes to CR are debated, and the underlying neural mechanism(s) unknown. Intrinsic functional connectivity reflects experience-dependent neuroplasticity that occurs across timescales ranging from minutes to decades, and may be a neural mechanism underlying CR. To test this hypothesis, we used voxel-based morphometry and resting-state functional connectivity analyses of MRI data to compare structural and functional brain integrity between bilingual and monolingual older adults, matched on cognitive performance using a rigorous propensity score matching technique, and across levels of second language proficiency measured as a continuous variable. Bilingualism, and degree of second language proficiency in particular, were associated with lower grey matter integrity in a hub of the default mode network, a region that is particularly vulnerable to decline in aging and dementia, but preserved functional network organization that resembled the young adult brain. Our findings confirm that lifelong bilingualism contributes to CR through experience-dependent maintenance of optimal functional network structure of the domain-general attentional control network across the lifespan.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Striatal dopamine integrates cost, benefit and motivation</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) release in the ventral and dorsal striatum has been linked to reward processing and motivation, but there are longstanding controversies about whether DA release in these key target structures primarily reflects costs or benefits, and how these signals vary with motivation. Here we apply behavioral economic principles to generate demand curves for rewards while directly measuring DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) via a genetically-encoded sensor. By independently varying costs and benefits, we reveal that DA release in both structures incorporates reward magnitude and sunk cost. Surprisingly, motivation was inversely correlated with reward-evoked DA release; the higher the motivation for rewards the lower the reward-evoked DA release. These relationships between DA release, cost and motivation remained identical when we used optogenetic activation of striatal DA inputs as a reward. Our results reconcile previous disparate findings by demonstrating that during operant tasks, striatal DA release simultaneously encodes cost, benefit and motivation but in distinct manners over different time scales.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A STIM dependent dopamine-insulin axis maintains the larval drive to feed and grow in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Appropriate nutritional intake is essential for organismal survival. In holometabolous insects such as Drosophila melanogaster, the quality and quantity of food ingested as larvae determines adult size and fecundity. Here we have identified a subset of dopaminergic neurons (THD') that maintain the larval motivation to feed. Dopamine release from these neurons requires the ER Ca2+ sensor STIM. Larvae with loss of STIM stop feeding, whereas expression of STIM in THD' neurons rescues feeding, growth and viability of STIM null mutants. Moreover STIM is essential for maintaining excitability and release of dopamine from THD' neurons. Optogenetic stimulation of THD' neurons identified connectivity to neuropeptidergic cells, including median neuro secretory cells that secrete insulin-like peptides. Loss of STIM in THD' cells alters the developmental profile of specific insulin-like peptides including ilp3. Loss of ilp3 partially rescues STIM null mutants and inappropriate expression of ilp3 in larvae affects development and growth. In summary we have identified a novel STIM-dependent dopamine-ILP circuit that regulates developmental changes in larval feeding behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Loss of estrogen unleashing neuro-inflammation increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease in women</a></h4>

              
                The risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women is about 2 times greater than in men. The estrogen hypothesis is being accepted as the essential sex factor causing the sex difference in AD. Also, the recent meta-analysis using large-scale medical records data indicated estrogen replacement therapy. However, the underlying molecular targets and mechanisms explaining this sex difference in AD disease development remain unclear. In this study, we identified that estrogen treatment can strongly inhibition of neuro-inflammation signaling targets, using the systems pharmacology model; and identified ESR1/ESR2 (the receptors of estrogen) are topologically close to the neuroinflammation biomarker genes using signaling network analysis. Moreover, the estrogen level in women decreased to an extremely lower level than in men after age 55. Pooling together the multiple pieces of evidence, it is concluded that the loss of estrogen unleashing neuro-inflammation increases the women's risk of Alzheimer's disease. These analysis results provide novel supporting evidence explaining the potential mechanism of the anti-neuroinflammation role of estrogen causing the sex difference of AD. Medications boosting the direct downstream signaling of ESR1/ESR2, or inhibiting upstream signaling targets of neuroinflammation, like JAK2 inhibitors, on the signaling network can be potentially effective or synergistic combined with estrogen for AD prevention and treatment.

                Increased reactivity of microglia and astrocytes is known to be present at various stages of the Alzheimer's continuum but their relationship with core Alzheimer's disease pathology in the preclinical stages is less clear. We investigated glial reactivity and {beta}-amyloid pathology in cognitively unimpaired APOE {varepsilon}4 homozygotes, heterozygotes and non-carriers using 11C-PK11195 PET (targeting 18-kDa translocator protein), 11C-PiB PET (targeting {beta}-amyloid), brain MRI, and a preclinical cognitive composite (APCC). Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) by and plasma A{beta}1-42/1-40 were measured using single molecule array and immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry, respectively. We observed that (i) 11C-PiB-binding was significantly higher in APOE {varepsilon}4 homozygotes compared with non-carriers in all evaluated regions, (ii) regional 11C-PK11195-binding did not differ between the APOE {varepsilon}4 gene doses or between A{beta}-positive and -negative individuals, and (iii) higher 11C-PK11195-binding and plasma GFAP were associated with lower hippocampal volume, and elevated 11C-PiB-binding and plasma GFAP concentration with lower APCC scores. Increased glial reactivity might emerge in later stages of preclinical Alzheimer's disease in parallel with early neurodegenerative changes.

                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined by common behavioral characteristics, raising the possibility of shared pathogenic mechanisms. Yet, vast clinical and etiological heterogeneity suggests personalized phenotypes. Surprisingly, our iPSC studies find that six individuals from two distinct ASD-subtypes, idiopathic and 16p11.2 deletion, have common reductions in neural precursor cell (NPC) neurite outgrowth and migration even though whole genome sequencing demonstrates no genetic overlap between the datasets. To identify signaling differences that may contribute to these developmental defects, an unbiased phospho-(p)-proteome screen was performed. Surprisingly despite the genetic heterogeneity, hundreds of shared p-peptides were identified between autism subtypes including the mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling alterations were confirmed in all NPCs across both ASD-subtypes, and mTOR modulation rescued ASD phenotypes and reproduced autism defects in controls. Thus, our studies demonstrate that genetically distinct ASD subtypes have common defects in neurite outgrowth and migration which are driven by the shared pathogenic mechanism of mTOR signaling dysregulation.

	<p>Objective: To investigate the angioarchitectural factors associated with postoperative cerebral infarction in ischemic moyamoya disease. Methods: Data on patients who underwent surgery for ischemic MMD from 1 October 2015 to 31 October 2020, at Peking University International Hospital were collected and retrospectively analyzed. General conditions such as patient sex, age, site of surgery, preoperative manifestations such as TIA attack and old cerebral infarction, and seven angioarchitectural factors of the MMD based on DSA were selected and measured. Statistical analysis was performed by the Pearson chi-square statistic, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and multifactor logistic regression analysis. Results: Age (OR, 0.969; 95%CI, 0.939&amp;amp;ndash;1.000; p = 0.049), A1stenosis (OR, 5.843; 95%CI, 1.730&amp;amp;ndash;19.732; p = 0.004), M1stenosis (OR, 6.206; 95%CI, 2.079&amp;amp;ndash;18.526; p = 0.001), PCA anomalies (OR, 4.367; 95%CI, 1.452&amp;amp;ndash;13.129; p = 0.049), Unstable compensation (OR, 5.335; 95%CI, 1.427&amp;amp;ndash;19.948; p = 0.013), TIA (OR, 4.264; 95%CI, 1.844&amp;amp;ndash;9.863; p = 0.001), Old cerebral infarction (OR, 2.972; 95%CI, 1.194&amp;amp;ndash;7.397; p = 0.019). The above seven factors can be used in the regression equation to predict the probability of postoperative cerebral infarction. The prediction accuracy is 90.2%. Conclusions: Age, TIA attack, old cerebral infarction, and five angioarchitectural factors of MMD are strongly associated with postoperative cerebral infarction. Seven factors, including age, TIA attack, old infarction, and four angioarchitectural factors, can be taken to quantify the probability of surgical cerebral infarction in MMD.</p>

	<p>One of the extraordinary characteristics of the biological brain is the low energy expense it requires to implement a variety of biological functions and intelligence as compared to the modern artificial intelligence (AI). Spike-based energy-efficient temporal codes have long been suggested as a contributor for the brain to run on low energy expense. Despite this code having been largely reported in the sensory cortex, whether this code can be implemented in other brain areas to serve broader functions and how it evolves throughout learning have remained unaddressed. In this study, we designed a novel brain&amp;amp;ndash;machine interface (BMI) paradigm. Two macaques could volitionally generate reproducible energy-efficient temporal patterns in the primary motor cortex (M1) by learning the BMI paradigm. Moreover, most neurons that were not directly assigned to control the BMI did not boost their excitability, and they demonstrated an overall energy-efficient manner in performing the task. Over the course of learning, we found that the firing rates and temporal precision of selected neurons co-evolved to generate the energy-efficient temporal patterns, suggesting that a cohesive rather than dissociable processing underlies the refinement of energy-efficient temporal patterns.</p>

	<p>Astronauts returning from long-duration spaceflights experience visual-vestibular conflicts that causes motion sickness, perceptions that the environment is moving when it is not, and problems with walking and other functional tasks. To evaluate whether astronauts will have similar decrements after they land on Mars following exposure to weightlessness, participants were held by a device that offloads their weight, first entirely (0 G), and then partially (0.38 G) or not at all (1 G). Tandem (heel-to-toe) walk on a medium-density foam surface was used to assess the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s walking performance. Two visual conditions in virtual reality were investigated: normal vision and a visual-vestibular conflict generated by disorienting optokinetic stimulation (DOS). Tandem walking performance with DOS was better in 0.38 G compared to 1 G. Tandem walking performance in DOS in 1 G was not significantly different from tandem walking performance after spaceflight or bed rest. The increased tandem walking performance in 0.38 G compared to 1 G was presumably due to an increased cone of stability, allowing a larger amplitude of body sway without resulting in a fall. Tandem walking on a compliant foam surface with a visual-vestibular conflict is a potential analog for simulating postflight dynamic balance deficits in astronauts.</p>

	<p>Depression has become one of the severe mental disorders threatening global human health. In this study, we first used the proteomics approach to obtain the differentially expressed proteins in the liver between naive control and chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) induced depressed mice. We have identified the upregulation of iron binding protein transferrin (TF) in the liver, the peripheral blood, and the brain in CSDS-exposed mice. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database from various mouse models of depression revealed the significantly upregulated transcripts of TF and its receptor TfR1 in multiple brain regions in depressed mice. We also used the recombinant TF administration via the tail vein to detect its permeability through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We demonstrated the permeability of peripheral TF into the brain through the BBB. Together, these results identified the elevated expression of TF and its receptor TfR1 in both peripheral liver and the central brain in CSDS-induced depressed mice, and peripheral administration of TF can be transported into the brain through the BBB. Therefore, our data provide a compelling information for understanding the potential role and mechanisms of the cross-talk between the liver and the brain in stress-induced depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">On the incongruence of genotype-phenotype and fitness landscapes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Malvika Srivastava, Joshua L. Payne</p>

The mapping from genotype to phenotype to fitness typically involves multiple nonlinearities that can transform the effects of mutations. For example, mutations may contribute additively to a phenotype, but their effects on fitness may combine non-additively because selection favors a low or intermediate value of that phenotype. This can cause incongruence between the topographical properties of a fitness landscape and its underlying genotype-phenotype landscape. Yet, genotype-phenotype landscapes are often used as a proxy for fitness landscapes to study the dynamics and predictability of evolution. Here, we use theoretical models and empirical data on transcription factor-DNA interactions to systematically study the incongruence of genotype-phenotype and fitness landscapes when selection favors a low or intermediate phenotypic value. Using the theoretical models, we prove a number of fundamental results. For example, selection for low or intermediate phenotypic values does not change simple sign epistasis into reciprocal sign epistasis, implying that genotype-phenotype landscapes with only simple sign epistasis motifs will always give rise to single-peaked fitness landscapes under such selection. More broadly, we show that such selection tends to create fitness landscapes that are more rugged than the underlying genotype-phenotype landscape, but this increased ruggedness typically does not frustrate adaptive evolution because the local adaptive peaks in the fitness landscape tend to be nearly as tall as the global peak. Many of these results carry forward to the empirical genotype-phenotype landscapes, which may help to explain why low- and intermediate-affinity transcription factor-DNA interactions are so prevalent in eukaryotic gene regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Is cell segregation like oil and water: Asymptotic versus transitory regime</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Florian Franke, Sebastian Aland, Hans-Joachim Böhme, Anja Voss-Böhme, Steffen Lange</p>

Understanding the segregation of cells is crucial to answer questions about tissue formation in embryos or tumor progression. Steinberg proposed that separation of cells can be compared to the separation of two liquids. Such a separation is well described by the Cahn-Hilliard (CH) equations and the segregation indices exhibit an algebraic decay with exponent 1/3 with respect to time. Similar exponents are also observed in cell-based models. However, the scaling behavior in these numerical models is usually only examined in the asymptotic regime and these models have not been directly applied to actual cell segregation data. In contrast, experimental data also reveals other scaling exponents and even slow logarithmic scaling laws. These discrepancies are commonly attributed to the effects of collective motion or velocity-dependent interactions. By calibrating a 2D cellular automaton (CA) model which efficiently implements a dynamic variant of the differential adhesion hypothesis to 2D experimental data from Méhes et al., we reproduce the biological cell segregation experiments with just adhesive forces. The segregation in the cellular automaton model follows a logarithmic scaling initially, which is in contrast to the proposed algebraic scaling with exponent 1/3. However, within the less than two orders of magnitudes in time which are observable in the experiments, a logarithmic scaling may appear as a pseudo-algebraic scaling. In particular, we demonstrate that the cellular automaton model can exhibit a range of exponents ≤1/3 for such a pseudo-algebraic scaling. Moreover, the time span of the experiment falls into the transitory regime of the cellular automaton rather than the asymptotic one. We additionally develop a method for the calibration of the 2D Cahn-Hilliard model and find a match with experimental data within the transitory regime of the Cahn-Hilliard model with exponent 1/4. On the one hand this demonstrates that the transitory behavior is relevant for the experiment rather than the asymptotic one. On the other hand this corroborates the ambiguity of the scaling behavior, when segregation processes can be only observed on short time spans.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bayesian estimation of community size and overlap from random subsamples</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erik K. Johnson, Daniel B. Larremore</p>

Counting the number of species, items, or genes that are shared between two groups, sets, or communities is a simple calculation when sampling is complete. However, when only partial samples are available, quantifying the overlap between two communities becomes an estimation problem. Furthermore, to calculate normalized measures of <i>β</i>-diversity, such as the Jaccard and Sorenson-Dice indices, one must also estimate the total sizes of the communities being compared. Previous efforts to address these problems have assumed knowledge of total community sizes and then used Bayesian methods to produce unbiased estimates with quantified uncertainty. Here, we address communities of unknown size and show that this produces systematically better estimates—both in terms of central estimates and quantification of uncertainty in those estimates. We further show how to use species, item, or gene count data to refine estimates of community size in a Bayesian joint model of community size and overlap.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Synaptic balancing: A biologically plausible local learning rule that provably increases neural network noise robustness without sacrificing task performance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher H. Stock, Sarah E. Harvey, Samuel A. Ocko, Surya Ganguli</p>

We introduce a novel, biologically plausible local learning rule that provably increases the robustness of neural dynamics to noise in nonlinear recurrent neural networks with homogeneous nonlinearities. Our learning rule achieves higher noise robustness without sacrificing performance on the task and without requiring any knowledge of the particular task. The plasticity dynamics—an integrable dynamical system operating on the weights of the network—maintains a multiplicity of conserved quantities, most notably the network’s entire temporal map of input to output trajectories. The outcome of our learning rule is a synaptic balancing between the incoming and outgoing synapses of every neuron. This synaptic balancing rule is consistent with many known aspects of experimentally observed heterosynaptic plasticity, and moreover makes new experimentally testable predictions relating plasticity at the incoming and outgoing synapses of individual neurons. Overall, this work provides a novel, practical local learning rule that exactly preserves overall network function and, in doing so, provides new conceptual bridges between the disparate worlds of the neurobiology of heterosynaptic plasticity, the engineering of regularized noise-robust networks, and the mathematics of integrable Lax dynamical systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comparing human and model-based forecasts of COVID-19 in Germany and Poland</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nikos I. Bosse, Sam Abbott, Johannes Bracher, Habakuk Hain, Billy J. Quilty, Mark Jit, Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 Working Group , Edwin van Leeuwen, Anne Cori, Sebastian Funk</p>

Forecasts based on epidemiological modelling have played an important role in shaping public policy throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This modelling combines knowledge about infectious disease dynamics with the subjective opinion of the researcher who develops and refines the model and often also adjusts model outputs. Developing a forecast model is difficult, resource- and time-consuming. It is therefore worth asking what modelling is able to add beyond the subjective opinion of the researcher alone. To investigate this, we analysed different real-time forecasts of cases of and deaths from COVID-19 in Germany and Poland over a 1-4 week horizon submitted to the German and Polish Forecast Hub. We compared crowd forecasts elicited from researchers and volunteers, against a) forecasts from two semi-mechanistic models based on common epidemiological assumptions and b) the ensemble of all other models submitted to the Forecast Hub. We found crowd forecasts, despite being overconfident, to outperform all other methods across all forecast horizons when forecasting cases (weighted interval score relative to the Hub ensemble 2 weeks ahead: 0.89). Forecasts based on computational models performed comparably better when predicting deaths (rel. WIS 1.26), suggesting that epidemiological modelling and human judgement can complement each other in important ways.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A spatially resolved stochastic model reveals the role of supercoiling in transcription regulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuncong Geng, Christopher Herrick Bohrer, Nicolás Yehya, Hunter Hendrix, Lior Shachaf, Jian Liu, Jie Xiao, Elijah Roberts</p>

In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, translocation of RNA polymerase (RNAP) during transcription introduces supercoiling to DNA, which influences the initiation and elongation behaviors of RNAP. To quantify the role of supercoiling in transcription regulation, we developed a spatially resolved supercoiling model of transcription. The integrated model describes how RNAP activity feeds back with the local DNA supercoiling and how this mechanochemical feedback controls transcription, subject to topoisomerase activities and stochastic topological domain formation. This model establishes that transcription-induced supercoiling mediates the cooperation of co-transcribing RNAP molecules in highly expressed genes, and this cooperation is achieved under moderate supercoiling diffusion and high topoisomerase unbinding rates. It predicts that a topological domain could serve as a transcription regulator, generating substantial transcriptional noise. It also shows the relative orientation of two closely arranged genes plays an important role in regulating their transcription. The model provides a quantitative platform for investigating how genome organization impacts transcription.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Omitting age-dependent mosquito mortality in malaria models underestimates the effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Melissa A. Iacovidou, Priscille Barreaux, Simon E. F. Spencer, Matthew B. Thomas, Erin E. Gorsich, Kat S. Rock</p>

Mathematical models of vector-borne infections, including malaria, often assume age-independent mortality rates of vectors, despite evidence that many insects senesce. In this study we present survival data on insecticide-resistant <i>Anopheles gambiae s.l</i>. from experiments in Côte d’Ivoire. We fit a constant mortality function and two age-dependent functions (logistic and Gompertz) to the data from mosquitoes exposed (treated) and not exposed (control) to insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), to establish biologically realistic survival functions. This enables us to explore the effects of insecticide exposure on mosquito mortality rates, and the extent to which insecticide resistance might impact the effectiveness of ITNs. We investigate this by calculating the expected number of infectious bites a mosquito will take in its lifetime, and by extension the vectorial capacity. Our results show that the predicted vectorial capacity is substantially lower in mosquitoes exposed to ITNs, despite the mosquitoes in the experiment being highly insecticide-resistant. The more realistic age-dependent functions provide a better fit to the experimental data compared to a constant mortality function and, hence, influence the predicted impact of ITNs on malaria transmission potential. In models with age-independent mortality, there is a great reduction for the vectorial capacity under exposure compared to no exposure. However, the two age-dependent functions predicted an even larger reduction due to exposure, highlighting the impact of incorporating age in the mortality rates. These results further show that multiple exposures to ITNs had a considerable effect on the vectorial capacity. Overall, the study highlights the importance of including age dependency in mathematical models of vector-borne disease transmission and in fully understanding the impact of interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Animal models of compression spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Compression spinal cord injuries are a common cause of morbidity in people who experience a spinal cord injury (SCI). Either as a by-product of a traumatic injury or due to nontraumatic conditions such as cervical myelitis, compression injuries are growing in prevalence clinically and many attempts of animal replication have been described within the literature. These models, however, often focus on the traumatic side of injury or mimic short-term injuries that are not representative of the majority of compression SCI. Of this, nontraumatic spinal cord injuries are severely understudied and have an increased prevalence in elderly populations, adults, and children. Therefore, there is a need to critically evaluate the current animal models of compression SCI and their suitability as a method for clinically relevant data that can help reduce morbidity and mortality of SCI. In this review, we reviewed the established and emerging methods of animal models of compression SCI. These models are the clip, balloon, solid spacer, expanding polymer, remote, weight drop, calibrated forceps, screw, and strap methods. These methods showed that there is a large reliance on the use of laminectomy to induce injury. Furthermore, the age range of many studies does not reflect the elderly and young populations that commonly suffer from compression injuries. It is therefore important to have techniques and methods that are able to minimize secondary effects of the surgeries, and are representative of the clinical cases seen so that treatments and interventions can be developed that are specific.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Deep Learning Applications for Acute Stroke Management</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brain imaging is essential to the clinical care of patients with stroke, a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Whereas advanced neuroimaging techniques offer opportunities for aiding acute stroke management, several factors, including time delays, inter-clinician variability, and lack of systemic conglomeration of clinical information, hinder their maximal utility. Recent advances in deep machine learning (DL) offer new strategies for harnessing computational medical image analysis to inform decision making in acute stroke. We examine the current state of the field for DL models in stroke triage. First, we provide a brief, clinical practice-focused primer on DL. Next, we examine real-world examples of DL applications in pixel-wise labeling, volumetric lesion segmentation, stroke detection, and prediction of tissue fate postintervention. We evaluate recent deployments of deep neural networks and their ability to automatically select relevant clinical features for acute decision making, reduce inter-rater variability, and boost reliability in rapid neuroimaging assessments, and integrate neuroimaging with electronic medical record (EMR) data in order to support clinicians in routine and triage stroke management. Ultimately, we aim to provide a framework for critically evaluating existing automated approaches, thus equipping clinicians with the ability to understand and potentially apply DL approaches in order to address challenges in clinical practice.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) caused by vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare adverse effect of adenovirus-based severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines. In March 2021, after autoimmune pathogenesis of VITT was discovered, treatment recommendations were developed. These comprised immunomodulation, non-heparin anticoagulants, and avoidance of platelet transfusion. The aim of this study was to evaluate adherence to these recommendations and its association with mortality.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used data from an international prospective registry of patients with CVT after the adenovirus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. We analyzed possible, probable, or definite VITT-CVT cases included until January 18, 2022. Immunomodulation entailed administration of intravenous immunoglobulins and/or plasmapheresis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ninety-nine patients with VITT-CVT from 71 hospitals in 17 countries were analyzed. Five of 38 (13%), 11 of 24 (46%), and 28 of 37 (76%) of the patients diagnosed in March, April, and from May onward, respectively, were treated in-line with VITT recommendations (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Overall, treatment according to recommendations had no statistically significant influence on mortality (14/44 [32%] vs 29/55 [52%], adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.16–1.19). However, patients who received immunomodulation had lower mortality (19/65 [29%] vs 24/34 [70%], adjusted OR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.06–0.58). Treatment with non-heparin anticoagulants instead of heparins was not associated with lower mortality (17/51 [33%] vs 13/35 [37%], adjusted OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.24–2.04). Mortality was also not significantly influenced by platelet transfusion (17/27 [63%] vs 26/72 [36%], adjusted OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 0.74–6.54).</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>In patients with VITT-CVT, adherence to VITT treatment recommendations improved over time. Immunomodulation seems crucial for reducing mortality of VITT-CVT. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:562–573</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Midlife vascular risk factors (MVRFs) are associated with incident dementia, as are amyloid β (Aβ) deposition and neurodegeneration. Whether vascular and Alzheimer disease-associated factors contribute to dementia independently or interact synergistically to reduce cognition is poorly understood.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities–Positron Emission Tomography study were followed from 1987–1989 (45–64 years old) through 2016–2017 (74–94 years old), with repeat cognitive assessment and dementia adjudication. In 2011–2013, dementia-free participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (with white matter hyperintensity [WMH] and brain volume measurement) and florbetapir (Aβ) positron emission tomography. The relative contributions of vascular risk and injury (MVRFs, WMH volume), elevated Aβ standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), and neurodegeneration (smaller temporoparietal brain regions) to incident dementia were evaluated with adjusted Cox models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In 298 individuals, 36 developed dementia (median follow-up = 4.9 years). Midlife hypertension and Aβ each independently predicted dementia risk (hypertension: hazard ratio [HR] = 2.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16–5.67; Aβ SUVR [per standard deviation (SD)]: HR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.72–3.84), but did not interact significantly, whereas late life diabetes (HR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.18–5.28) and Aβ independently predicted dementia risk. WMHs (per SD: HR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.03–2.20) and Aβ SUVR (HR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.83–3.47) independently contributed to incident dementia, but WMHs lost significance when MVRFs were included. Smaller temporoparietal brain regions were associated with incident dementia, independent of Aβ and MVRFs (HR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.18–4.01).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Midlife hypertension and late life Aβ are independently associated with dementia risk, without evidence for synergy on a multiplicative scale. Given the independent contributions of vascular and amyloid mechanisms, multiple pathways should be considered when evaluating interventions to reduce the burden of dementia.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess the effects of demographics, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities on serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels in people without neurologic disease and establish demographic-specific reference ranges of sNfL.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a representative sample of the US population in which detailed information on demographic, lifestyle, routine laboratory tests, and overall health status are systematically collected. From stored serum samples, we measured sNfL levels using a novel high-throughput immunoassay (Siemens Healthineers). We evaluated the predictive capacity of 52 demographic, lifestyle, comorbidity, anthropometric, or laboratory characteristics in explaining variability in sNfL levels. Predictive performance was assessed using cross-validated <i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup>
<sub>cv</sub>) and forward selection was used to obtain a set of best predictors of sNfL levels. Adjusted reference ranges were derived incorporating characteristics using generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 1,706 NHANES participants (average age: 43.6 ± 14.8 y; 50.6% male, 35% non-white) without neurological disorders. In univariate models, age explained the most variability in sNfL (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup>
<sub>cv</sub> = 26.8%). Multivariable prediction models for sNfL contained three covariates (in order of their selection): age, creatinine, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (standardized β—age: 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43, 0.50; creatinine: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.22; HbA1c: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.11). Adjusted centile curves were derived incorporating identified predictors. We provide an interactive R Shiny application to translate our findings and allow other investigators to use the derived centile curves.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Results will help to guide interpretation of sNfL levels as they relate to neurologic conditions. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:688–698</p>

Among patients with one late seizure (&gt;7 days post-trauma), the risk of seizure recurrence was 62% after 1 year and 82% at 10 years. Competing hazards regression identified age, decompressive hemicraniectomy, and intracranial infection as independent predictors of post-traumatic epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">“Ependymal‐in” Gradient of Thalamic Damage in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Leptomeningeal and perivenular infiltrates are important contributors to cortical grey matter damage and disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). Whereas perivenular inflammation induces vasculocentric lesions, leptomeningeal involvement follows a subpial “surface-in” gradient. To determine whether similar gradient of damage occurs in deep grey matter nuclei, we examined the dorsomedial thalamic nuclei and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 41 postmortem secondary progressive MS cases compared with 5 non-neurological controls and 12 controls with other neurological diseases. CSF/ependyma-oriented gradient of reduction in NeuN<sup>+</sup> neuron density was present in MS thalamic lesions compared to controls, greatest (26%) in subventricular locations at the ependyma/CSF boundary and least with increasing distance (12% at 10 mm). Concomitant graded reduction in SMI31<sup>+</sup> axon density was observed, greatest (38%) at 2 mm from the ependyma/CSF boundary and least at 10 mm (13%). Conversely, gradient of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II<sup>+</sup> microglia density increased by over 50% at 2 mm at the ependyma/CSF boundary and only by 15% at 10 mm and this gradient inversely correlated with the neuronal (<i>R</i> = −0.91, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and axonal (<i>R</i> = −0.79, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) thalamic changes. Observed gradients were also detected in normal-appearing thalamus and were associated with rapid/severe disease progression; presence of leptomeningeal tertiary lymphoid-like structures; large subependymal infiltrates, enriched in CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells and occasionally containing CXCL13<sup>+</sup> CD35<sup>+</sup> follicular dendritic cells; and high CSF protein expression of a complex pattern of soluble inflammatory/neurodegeneration factors, including chitinase-3-like-1, TNFR1, parvalbumin, neurofilament-light-chains and TNF. Substantial “ependymal-in” gradient of pathological cell alterations, accompanied by presence of intrathecal inflammation, compartmentalized either in subependymal lymphoid perivascular infiltrates or in CSF, may play a key role in MS progression.</p>
<h2>Summary for Social Media</h2>
<p>Imaging and neuropathological evidences demonstrated the unique feature of “surface-in” gradient of damage in multiple sclerosis (MS) since early pediatric stages, often associated with more severe brain atrophy and disease progression. In particular, increased inflammation in the cerebral meninges has been shown to be strictly associated with an MS-specific gradient of neuronal, astrocyte, and oligodendrocyte loss accompanied by microglial activation in subpial cortical layers, which is not directly related to demyelination.</p>
<p>To determine whether a similar gradient of damage occurs in deep grey matter nuclei, we examined the potential neuronal and microglia alterations in the dorsomedial thalamic nuclei from postmortem secondary progressive MS cases in combination with detailed neuropathological characterization of the inflammatory features and protein profiling of paired CSF samples.</p>
<p>We observed a substantial “subependymal-in” gradient of neuro-axonal loss and microglia activation in active thalamic lesions of progressive MS cases, in particular in the presence of increased leptomeningeal and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammation. This altered graded pathology was found associated with more severe and rapid progressive MS and increased inflammatory degree either in large perivascular subependymal infiltrates, enriched in B cells, or within the paired CSF, in particular with elevated levels of a complex pattern of soluble inflammatory and neurodegeneration factors, including chitinase 3-like-1, TNFR1, parvalbumin, neurofilament light-chains and TNF.</p>
<p>These data support a key role for chronic, intrathecally compartmentalized inflammation in specific disease endophenotypes. CSF biomarkers, together with advance imaging tools, may therefore help to improve not only the disease diagnosis but also the early identification of specific MS subgroups that would benefit of more personalized treatments.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is often found in stroke patients with determined etiologies. PFO may be the actual cause of stroke in some of them. We determined whether the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke differs with PFO status in stroke patients with determined etiologies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study included consecutive patients with stroke of determined etiology who underwent transesophageal echocardiography. We compared the rates of recurrent cerebral infarction in patients with versus without PFO, and according to PFO-Associated Stroke Causal Likelihood (PASCAL) classification.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 2,314 included patients, 827 (35.7%) had PFO. During a median follow-up of 4.4 years, cerebral infarction recurred in 202 (8.7%). In multivariate modified Cox regression analyses, recurrence of infarction did not significantly differ between patients with PFO and those without PFO (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.64–1.17, <i>p</i> = 0.339). Interaction analysis showed a significant effect of PFO in patients aged &lt;65 years (adjusted <i>p</i> for interaction = 0.090). PFO was independently associated with a decreased risk of recurrent infarction in patients younger than 65 years (HR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.20–0.85, adjusted <i>p</i> = 0.016). Patients with probable PFO-associated stroke on the PASCAL classification had a significantly lower risk of recurrent infarction than those without PFO (HR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.10–0.97, <i>p</i> = 0.044).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Considering the generally low risk of recurrence in PFO-associated stroke, PFO may be the actual cause of stroke in some patients with determined etiologies, especially younger patients or those with PFO features of probable PFO-associated stroke. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:596–606</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of α-synuclein seed amplification assay (αSyn-SAA) in antemortem and postmortem cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of autopsy-confirmed patients with different distributions of pathological αSyn, co-pathologies, and clinical diagnoses.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The αSyn-SAA was used to test antemortem CSF samples from 119 subjects with a variety of clinical syndromes and standardized neuropathological examinations from Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) and University of California San Diego (UCSD; 56 additional postmortem CSF samples available). The αSyn-SAA was also applied to frontal cortex and amygdala homogenates. Sensitivity and specificity were compared across distributions of αSyn pathology. Clinical data and co-pathologies were compared across αSyn-SAA positive and negative groups.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Fifty-three individuals without and 66 with αSyn-pathology (neocortical [n = 38], limbic [n = 7], and amygdala-predominant [n = 21]) were included. There was a sensitivity of 97.8% and specificity of 98.1% of the αSyn-SAA to identify patients with limbic/neocortical pathology from antemortem CSF. Sensitivity to detect amygdala-predominant pathology was only 14.3%. Postmortem CSF and brain tissue αSyn-SAA analyses also showed higher assay positivity in samples from limbic/neocortical cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CSF αSyn-SAA reliably identifies αSyn seeds in patients with diffuse αSyn pathology in the context of co-pathology and non-Lewy body disease (LBD) diagnoses. The analysis of brain homogenates suggests that pathological αSyn in the amygdala might differ from pathological αSyn in the frontal cortex. The αSyn-SAA might facilitate the differential diagnosis of dementias with mixed pathologies. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:650–662</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Human endogenous retroviruses have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) subtype HML-2 envelope (Env) in human neuronal cultures and in transgenic mice results in neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration, and mice expressing HML-2 Env display behavioral and neuromuscular characteristics resembling ALS. This study aims to characterize the neurotoxic properties of HML-2 Env.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Env neurotoxicity was detected in ALS cerebrospinal fluid and confirmed using recombinant Env protein in a cell-based assay and a mouse model. The mechanism of neurotoxicity was assessed with immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry and Western blot, and by screening a panel of inhibitors.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed that recombinant HML-2 Env protein caused neurotoxicity resulting in neuronal cell death, retraction of neurites, and decreased neuronal electrical activity. Injection of the Env protein into the brains of mice also resulted in neuronal cell death. HML-2 Env protein was also found in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with sporadic ALS. The neurotoxic properties of the Env and the cerebrospinal fluid could be rescued with the anti-Env antibody. The Env was found to bind to CD98HC complexed to β1 integrin on the neuronal cell surface. Using a panel of compounds to screen for their ability to block Env-induced neurotoxicity, we found that several compounds were protective and are linked to the β1 integrin pathway.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>HERV-K Env is released extracellularly in ALS and causes neurotoxicity via a novel mechanism. Present results pave the way for new treatment strategies in sporadic ALS. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:545–561</p>

                <h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Baseline variables could be used to guide the administration of additional intravenous alteplase (IVT) before mechanical thrombectomy (MT). The aim of this study was to determine how baseline imaging and demographic parameters modify the effect of IVT on clinical outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Multicenter retrospective cohort study of ischemic stroke patients triaged by multimodal-CT undergoing MT treatment after direct admission to an MT-eligible center. Inverse-probability weighting analysis (IPW) was used to assess the treatment effect of IVT adjusted for baseline variables. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with IPW-weighting and interaction terms for IVT was performed to predict functional independence (mRS 0-2 at 90-days).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>720 patients were included, of which 366 (51%) received IVT. In IPW, the treatment effect of IVT on outcome (mRS 0-2) distinctively varied according to the ASPECTS subgroup (ASPECTS 9-10: +15%, ASPECTS 6-8: +7%, ASPECTS &lt;6: −11%). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, IVT was independently associated with functional independence (aOR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.16-2.14, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and the interaction term was significant for ASPECTS and IVT revealing that IVT was only significantly associated with better outcomes in patients with higher ASPECTS. No other significant baseline variable interaction terms were identified.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>ASPECTS was the only baseline variable that showed a significant interaction with IVT for outcome prediction. Use of IVT prior to MT in patients with an ASPECTS of &lt;6 was not associated with a treatment benefit and should be considered carefully. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:588–595</p>

                <p>Differences in gut microbiota between Parkinson's disease patients and controls seem to depend on multiple—frequently unmeasured—confounders. Monozygotic twins offer a unique model for controlling several factors responsible for interpersonal variation in gut microbiota. Fecal samples from 20 monozygotic twin pairs (n = 40) discordant for Parkinson's disease were studied (metagenomic shotgun analysis). Paired data analysis detected minimal differences in bacterial taxa abundance at species level (<i>Bacteroides pectinophilus</i> [<i>p</i> = 0.037], <i>Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum</i> [<i>p</i> = 0.050], and <i>Bifidobacterium catenulatum</i> [<i>p</i> = 0.025]) and in predicted metabolic pathways (<i>primary bile acid biosynthesis</i> [<i>p</i> = 0.037]). Additional studies are warranted to understand the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:631–636</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To identify the clinical characteristics of the subgroup of benign progressive supranuclear palsy with particularly long disease duration; to define neuropathological determinants underlying variability in disease duration in progressive supranuclear palsy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical and pathological features were compared among 186 autopsy-confirmed cases with progressive supranuclear palsy with ≥10 years and shorter survival times.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The 45 cases (24.2%) had a disease duration of ≥10 years. The absence of ocular motor abnormalities within the first 3 years from disease onset was the only significant independent clinical predictor of longer survival. Histopathologically, the neurodegeneration parameters in each survival group were paralleled anatomically by the distribution of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, whereas the tufted astrocytes displayed anatomically an opposite severity pattern. Most interestingly, we found significantly less coiled bodies in those who survive longer, in contrast to patients with less favorable course.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A considerable proportion of patients had a more ”benign” disease course with ≥10 years survival. They had a distinct pattern and evolution of core symptoms compared to patients with short survival. The inverted anatomical patterns of astrocytic tau distribution suggest distinct implications of these cell types in trans-cellular propagation. The tempo of disease progression appeared to be determined mostly by oligodendroglial tau, where the high degree of oligodendroglial tau pathology might affect neuronal integrity and function on top of neuronal tau pathology. The relative contribution of glial tau should be further explored in cellular and animal models. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:637–649</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to examine the relationship between covert cerebrovascular disease, comprised of covert brain infarction and white matter disease, discovered incidentally in routine care, and subsequent Parkinson disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients were ≥50 years and received neuroimaging for non-stroke indications in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California system from 2009 to 2019. Natural language processing identified incidentally discovered covert brain infarction and white matter disease and classified white matter disease severity. The Parkinson disease outcome was defined as 2 ICD diagnosis codes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>230,062 patients were included (median follow-up 3.72 years). A total of 1,941 Parkinson disease cases were identified (median time-to-event 2.35 years). Natural language processing identified covert cerebrovascular disease in 70,592 (30.7%) patients, 10,622 (4.6%) with covert brain infarction and 65,814 (28.6%) with white matter disease. After adjustment for known risk factors, white matter disease was associated with Parkinson disease (hazard ratio 1.67 [95%CI, 1.44, 1.93] for patients &lt;70 years and 1.33 [1.18, 1.50] for those ≥70 years). Greater severity of white matter disease was associated with increased incidence of Parkinson disease(/1,000 person-years), from 1.52 (1.43, 1.61) in patients without white matter disease to 4.90 (3.86, 6.13) in those with severe disease. Findings were robust when more specific definitions of Parkinson disease were used. Covert brain infarction was not associated with Parkinson disease (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.05 [0.88, 1.24]).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Incidentally discovered white matter disease was associated with subsequent Parkinson disease, an association strengthened with younger age and increased white matter disease severity. Incidentally discovered covert brain infarction did not appear to be associated with subsequent Parkinson disease. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:620–630</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We characterize the content and role of prognostic discussion for infants with neurologic conditions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this descriptive qualitative study, we prospectively enrolled infants (age &lt; 1 year) in the intensive care unit with a neurologic condition anticipated to have ≥1 family conference about prognosis or goals of care. We audiorecorded family conferences as they occurred. We used a rapid-cycle qualitative approach to identify and refine themes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty infants and 61 parents were enrolled; 68 family conferences occurred for 24 infants. The majority of infant cases (n = 23/24, 96%) and conferences (n = 64/68, 94%) included discussion of neurologic prognosis. Common infant diagnoses included prematurity (n = 12, 52%), genetic conditions (n = 9, 35%), and brain malformations (n = 7, 30%). We identified 2 themes relating to the characterization of the infant's prognosis: (1) predictions of impairment and (2) rationale for prognostic predictions. We identified 3 themes characterizing the role of prognostic discussion: (1) aligning parent and clinician understanding of infant outcome, (2) influencing decision-making, and (3) preparing for life at home. We identified 2 themes characterizing discussion of prognostic uncertainty: (1) multilayered types of uncertainty and (2) holding space for hope alongside uncertainty.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this cohort of infants with neurologic conditions and their parents, we identified salient themes characterizing the content and role of discussion about neurologic outcome. Our findings highlight that prognostic discussion focuses on anticipated impairments, informs decision-making, and helps families prepare for home life. Future work should characterize whether these findings align with parent preferences for prognostic disclosure. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:699–709</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) persistence in blood and tissue reservoirs, including the brain, is a major barrier to HIV cure and possible cause of comorbid disease. However, the size and replication competent nature of the central nervous system (CNS) reservoir is unclear. Here, we used the intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) to provide the first quantitative assessment of the intact and defective HIV reservoir in the brain of people with HIV (PWH).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Total, intact, and defective HIV proviruses were measured in autopsy frontal lobe tissue from viremic (n = 18) or virologically suppressed (n = 12) PWH. Total or intact/defective proviruses were measured by detection of HIV <i>pol</i> or the IPDA, respectively, through use of droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). HIV-seronegative individuals were included as controls (n = 6).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Total HIV DNA was present at similar levels in brain tissues from untreated viremic and antiretroviral (ART)-suppressed individuals (median = 22.3 vs 26.2 HIV pol copies/10<sup>6</sup> cells), reflecting a stable CNS reservoir of HIV that persists despite therapy. Furthermore, 8 of 10 viremic and 6 of 9 virally suppressed PWH also harbored intact proviruses in the CNS (4.63 vs 12.7 intact copies/10<sup>6</sup> cells). Viral reservoirs in CNS and matched lymphoid tissue were similar in the composition of intact and/or defective proviruses, albeit at lower levels in the brain. Importantly, CNS resident CD68+ myeloid cells in virally suppressed individuals harbored HIV DNA, directly showing the presence of a CNS resident HIV reservoir.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results demonstrate the first evidence for an intact, potentially replication competent HIV reservoir in the CNS of virally suppressed PWH. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:532–544</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">An Overview of Monkeypox Virus and Its Neuroinvasive Potential</a></h4>

              
                <p>Monkeypox virus (MPV) is an orthopox virus in the <i>Poxviridae</i> family that is currently of international concern. It is endemic to Central and Western Africa with two known viral clades. Various African rodents and primates are likely the natural reservoirs. Zoonotic transmission occurs by direct contact with infected animals (e.g., bites, scratches, slaughtering). Human to human transmission occurs through close contact with infected persons (e.g., respiratory droplets, skin-on-skin, or sexual contact) or fomites. Classically, human MPV disease first has a febrile prodrome with lymphadenopathy followed by a diffuse maculopapular to vesiculopustular skin/mucosal lesion eruption. In the current 2022 outbreak, which is primarily affecting men who have sex with men (MSM) currently, the febrile prodrome may be absent and skin/mucosal lesions may be isolated to the genital and anal regions. Rarely, MPV likely has the potential to be neuroinvasive based on animal models, previous case series, and preliminary reports currently under investigation. Even though neurologic manifestations of human MPV infection are rare, given the sheer numbers of increasing cases throughout the world, neurologists should be prepared to recognize, diagnose, and treat potential neuroinvasive disease or other neurologic symptoms.

                <p>The first case of paralytic poliomyelitis in nearly a decade in the United States (U.S.) was discovered in a 20-year-old unvaccinated male from Rockland County, New York, in July 2022 who developed acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) (1-2). The isolated virus from stool sampling was found to be a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV-2), derived from the oral polio vaccine (OPV). Since the discovery of this case, local wastewater surveillance has revealed evidence of cVDPV-2 in local counties, as well as in New York City (NYC), representing community transmission (2-3). In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, routine vaccination administration has declined globally, with increasing numbers of communities not vaccinated for poliovirus. Now, with evidence of local community transmission, the clinical implication for at-risk unvaccinated individuals is significant. Here, we review the epidemiological origin of this discovered strain of poliovirus, national and international methods of surveillance for poliovirus, and neurological features of poliovirus. We also highlight the opportunities and challenges involved in monitoring suspected cases as well as the unique role neurologists may play in national and global poliomyelitis surveillance.</p>

     alt="Thalamocortical and corticothalamic connections of multiple functional domains in posterior parietal cortex of galagos"/>
<p>The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of galagos contains a series of domains where electrical stimulation evokes different types of complex movements. The medial domains have more connections with the motor thalamus, whereas the lateral domains connect more densely with the posterior thalamus that involves in somatosensory processing.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In prosimian galagos, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is subdivided into a number of functional domains where long-train intracortical microstimulation evoked different types of complex movements. Here, we placed anatomical tracers in multiple locations of PPC to reveal the origins and targets of thalamic connections of four PPC domains for different types of hindlimb, forelimb, or face movements. Thalamic connections of all four domains included nuclei of the motor thalamus, ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei, as well as parts of the sensory thalamus, the anterior pulvinar, posterior and ventral posterior superior nuclei, consistent with the sensorimotor functions of PPC domains. PPC domains also projected to the thalamic reticular nucleus in a somatotopic pattern. Quantitative differences in the distributions of labeled neurons in thalamic nuclei suggested that connectional patterns of these domains differed from each other.</p>

                The mechanisms that underlie the storage of old nontraumatic episodic memories remain enigmatic because of the difficulty in modelling this particular type of memory in humans and animals. Episodic memories combine incidental and occasional What-Where-When/In which context multisensory information and can be stored for long periods of time. Here, using a task in rodents that models human episodic memory, including odour/place/context components, we applied advanced behavioural and computational analyses and brain imaging of c-Fos and Zif268 to characterize remote episodic memories and their engrams for the first time. We show that the content and accuracy of memories vary across individuals and depend on the emotional relationship with odours experienced during episodes. Activated brain networks reflect the nature and content of remote episodic memories and their transformation over time, and emotional cortico-hippocampal networks play critical roles in maintaining vivid memories.

                Cholinergic signaling shapes sound processing and plasticity in the inferior colliculus (IC), the midbrain hub of the central auditory system, but how cholinergic terminals contact and influence individual neuron types in the IC remains largely unknown. Using pharmacology and electrophysiology, we recently found that acetylcholine strongly excites VIP neurons, a class of glutamatergic principal neurons in the IC, by activating 3{beta}4* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Here, we confirm and extend these results using tissue from mice of both sexes. First, we show that mRNA encoding 3 and {beta}4 nAChR subunits is expressed in many neurons throughout the IC, including most VIP neurons, suggesting that these subunits, which are rare in the brain, are important mediators of cholinergic signaling in the IC. Next, by combining fluorescent labeling of VIP neurons and immunofluorescence against the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), we show that individual VIP neurons in the central nucleus of the IC (ICc) are contacted by a large number of cholinergic boutons. Cholinergic boutons were distributed adjacent to the somata and along the full length of the dendritic arbors of VIP neurons, positioning cholinergic signaling to affect synaptic computations arising throughout the somatodendritic compartments of VIP neurons. In addition, cholinergic boutons were observed in close apposition to dendritic spines on VIP neurons, raising the possibility that cholinergic signaling also modulates presynaptic release onto VIP neurons. Together, these results strengthen evidence that cholinergic signaling exerts widespread influence on auditory computations performed by VIP neurons and other neurons in the IC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genomic effects of the glucocorticoid receptor guide the acute stress-induced delayed anxiety and basolateral amygdala spine plasticity in rats</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety, a state related to anticipatory fear, can be adaptive in the face of environmental threats or stressors. However, anxiety can also become persistent and manifest as anxiety- and stress-related disorders, such as generalized anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In rodents, systemic administration of glucocorticoids (GCs) or short-term restraint stress induces anxiety-like behaviors and dendritic branching within the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) ten days later. Additionally, increased arousal-related memory retention mediated by elevated GCs requires concomitant noradrenaline (NE) signaling, both acting in the BLA. It is unknown whether GCs and NE play a role in the delayed acute stress effects on BLA dendritic plasticity and behavior. Here, we show that inhibiting corticosterone (CORT) elevation during the two-hour restraint stress prevents stress-induced increases in delayed anxiety-like behaviors and BLA dendritic spine density in rats. Also, we show that acute stress's behavioral and morphological delayed effects are critically dependent on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) genomic actions in the BLA. Unlike CORT, the pharmacological enhancement of NE signaling in the BLA was insufficient to drive delayed anxiety-related behavior. Nonetheless, the delayed anxiety-like behavior 10 days after acute stress requires NE signaling in the BLA at the time it is expressed. Therefore, we define essential roles for two stress-related hormones acting at two different times, for the late stress consequences: CORT, via GR, immediately at stress; NE, via beta-adrenoceptors, during the expression of delayed behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A multiplex platform to identify mechanisms and modulators of proteotoxicity in neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative disorders are a family of diseases that remain poorly treated despite their growing global health burden. A shared feature of many neurodegenerative disorders is the accumulation of toxic misfolded proteins. To gain insight into the mechanisms and modulators of protein misfolding, we developed a multiplex reverse genetics platform. Using this novel platform 29 cell-based models expressing proteins that undergo misfolding in neurodegeneration were probed against more than a thousand genetic modifiers. The resulting data provide insight into the nature of modifiers that act on multiple misfolded proteins as compared to those that show activity on only one. To illustrate the utility of this platform, we extensively characterized a potent hit from our screens, the human chaperone DNAJB6. We show that DNAJB6 is a general modifier of the toxicity and solubility of multiple amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD)-linked RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), including FUS, TDP-43, and hnRNPA1. Biophysical examination of DNAJB6 demonstrated that it co-phase separates with, and alters the behavior of FUS containing condensates by locking them into a loose gel-like state which prevents their fibrilization. Domain mapping and a deep mutational scan of DNAJB6 support the critical importance for DNAJB6 phase separation in its effects on multiple RNA-binding proteins. Crucially, these studies also suggest that this property can be further tuned to generate novel variants with enhanced activity that might illuminate potential avenues for clinical translation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integrating artificial and biological neural networks to improve animal task performance using deep reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Artificial neural networks have performed remarkable feats in a wide variety of domains. However, artificial intelligence algorithms lack the flexibility, robustness, and generalization power of biological neural networks. Given the different capabilities of artificial and biological neural networks, it would be advantageous to build systems where the two types of networks are directly connected and can synergistically interact. As proof of principle, here we show how to create such a hybrid system and how it can be harnessed to improve animal performance on biologically relevant tasks. Using optogenetics, we interfaced the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans with a deep reinforcement learning agent, enabling the animal to navigate to targets and enhancing its natural ability to search for food. Agents adapted to strikingly different sites of neural integration and learned site-specific activation patterns to improve performance on a target-finding task. The combined animal and agent displayed cooperative computation between artificial and biological neural networks by generalizing target-finding to novel environments. This work constitutes an initial demonstration of how to robustly improve task performance in animals using artificial intelligence interfaced with a living nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inducible CRISPR epigenome systems mimic cocaine induced bidirectional regulation of Nab2 and Egr3</a></h4>

              
                Substance use disorder is a debilitating chronic disease and a leading cause of disability around the world. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a major brain hub that mediates reward behavior. Studies demonstrate exposure to cocaine is associated with molecular and functional imbalance in two NAc medium spiny neuron subtypes (MSNs), dopamine receptor 1 and 2 enriched D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs. Our previous reports showed that repeated cocaine exposure induced transcription factor early growth response 3 (Egr3) mRNA in NAc D1-MSNs, while reducing it in D2-MSNs. Here, we report our findings of repeated cocaine exposure inducing cell subtype specific bidirectional expression of the Egr3 corepressor NGFI-A-binding protein 2 (Nab2). Using CRISPR activation and interference (CRISPRa and CRISPRi) tools combined with Nab2 or Egr3 targeted sgRNAs, we mimicked these bidirectional changes in Neuro2a cells. Furthermore, we investigated D1-MSN and D2-MSN subtype specific expressional changes of histone lysine demethylases Kdm1a, Kdm6a and Kdm5c in NAc after repeated cocaine exposure. Since Kdm1a showed bidirectional expression patterns in D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs, like Egr3, we developed a light inducible Opto-CRISPR-KDM1a system. We were able to downregulate Egr3 and Nab2 transcripts and cause bidirectional expression changes in D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs similar to cocaine exposure in Neuro2A cells. In contrast, our Opto-CRISPR-p300 activation system induced the Egr3 and Nab2 transcripts and caused bidirectional transcription regulations in D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs. Our study sheds light on the expression patterns of Nab2 and Egr3 in specific NAc MSN subtypes in cocaine action and uses CRISPR tools to further mimic these expression patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Vap33/Eph/Vav/Cdc42 complex confers temporal specification to the outgrowth of primary dendrites in Drosophila neurons</a></h4>

              
                The formation of primary dendrites (dendritogenesis) significantly affects the overall orientation and coverage of dendritic arborization, limiting the number and types of inputs a neuron can receive. Previously we reported how a Drosophila motoneuron spatially controls the positioning of dendritogenesis through the Dscam1/Dock/Pak1 pathway; however, how the neuron defines the timing of this process remains elusive. Here we show that the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase provides a temporal cue. We find that, at the onset of dendritogenesis, the Eph receptor recruits the Rho Family GEF Vav to the intracellular domain of Eph, which transiently activates the Cdc42 family of small GTPase. We also show that vap33 (vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein) mutants exhibit defects in Cdc42 activation and dendritic outgrowth, indicating Vap33 may play an upstream role in Eph signaling. Together, our result and previous studies argue that the formation of primary dendrites requires the proximity of active Cdc42 and membrane-anchored Pak1 driven by collaborative action between two distinct signaling complexes, Vap33/Eph/Vav and Dscam1/Dock. Signal integration from multiple input pathways would represent a general mechanism for the spatiotemporal precision of dendrite branch formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Widespread, perception-related information in the human brain scales with levels of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                How does the human brain generate coherent, subjective perceptions--transforming yellow and oblong visual sensory information into the perception of an edible banana? This is a hard problem. The standard viewpoint posits that anatomical and functional networks somehow integrate local, specialized processing across the brain to construct unique percepts. Here, we provide evidence for a novel organizational concept: we uncover task-specific information distributed across the human brain. We use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based decoding models to probe the presence of task-specific information. In doing so, we show that brain regions that are empirically almost entirely task-independent (considered to be "noise"--i.e., t-statistics {approx} 0--in standard univariate fMRI analyses) can decode various tasks, even without statistical learning tools. Thus, task-specific information is present and readily accessible throughout the neocortex, challenging the sensitivity of traditional linear, univariate analytical approaches. Remarkably, even subcortical structures and the cerebellum contain task-specific signals in voxels that would univariately be considered "noise". Finally, using data from an auditory study with different levels of sedation, we show that the widespread signal in regions remote from the primary and secondary sensory cortices (auditory cortex) depends on the level of sedation, suggesting the brain's widespread, task-specific information is related to perception rather than the encoding of the sensory stimulus. Our analysis uncovers task-specific and consciousness level-dependent information across the human brain, which we hypothesize to be the basis for coherent, subjective perceptions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disentangling temporal and rate codes in primate somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Millisecond-scale temporal spiking patterns encode sensory information in the early stages of processing along the neuraxis, but their role in cortex remains controversial. The sense of touch provides a window into temporal coding because tactile neurons often exhibit precise, repeatable, and informative temporal spiking patterns. In somatosensory cortex (S1), for example, responses to skin vibrations exhibit phase-locking that faithfully carries information about vibratory frequency. However, the respective roles of spike timing and rate in frequency coding are confounded because vibratory frequency influences both perceived pitch and magnitude and shapes both the timing and rates of S1 responses. To disentangle these various elements, we measured S1 responses as animals performed a vibratory frequency discrimination task, in which differences in frequency were accompanied by uninformative variations in amplitude. We then assessed the degree to which the strength and timing of S1 responses could account for the animals' ability to perform the frequency discrimination task in the presence of intensity confounds. First, we showed that animals can discriminate frequency, but their performance is biased by vibratory amplitude. Second, rate-based representations of frequency are susceptible to changes in amplitude, but in ways that are inconsistent with the animals' behavior, calling into question a rate-based code for frequency. In contrast, timing-based representations are impervious to changes in amplitude, also inconsistent with the animals' behavior. We show that we can account for the animals' behavior with a model wherein frequency coding relies on a temporal code, but judgments of pitch are biased by perceived magnitude. Our results constitute further evidence for the role of millisecond-scale spike timing in cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex represents abstract visual sequences during a no-report task</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring sequential information is an essential component of our daily lives. Many of these sequences are abstract, in that they do not depend on the individual stimuli, but do depend on an ordered set of rules (e.g., chop then stir when cooking). Despite the ubiquity and utility of abstract sequential monitoring, little is known about its neural mechanisms. Human rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) exhibits specific increases in neural activity (i.e., "ramping") during abstract sequences. Monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been shown to represent sequential information in motor (not abstract) sequence tasks, and contains a sub-region, area 46, with homologous functional connectivity to human RLPFC. To test the prediction that area 46 may represent abstract sequence information, and do so with parallel dynamics to those found in humans, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in monkeys. When monkeys performed no-report abstract sequence viewing, we found that right area 46 responded to both abstract sequential rule and number changes. Interestingly, left area 46 exhibited ramping activation similar to that observed in humans that also indicated abstract sequential rule changes. Together, these results indicate that monkey DLPFC monitors abstract visual sequential information, and may do so through unique, hemisphere-specific neural mechanisms. More generally, these results show that abstract sequences are represented in functionally homologous regions across monkeys and humans.

                A conditioning lesion of the peripheral sensory axon triggers robust central axon regeneration in mammals. We visualize the ASJ neuron of C. elegans with a cell-specific green fluorescent protein reporter driven by a thioredoxin trx-1 promoter and trigger conditioned regeneration by laser surgery or genetic disruption of sensory pathways. Utilizing calibrated fluorescent beads, we demonstrate that these neurons brighten when conditioned, suggesting that trx-1 expression indicates regenerative capacity. We show that trx-1 functionally enhances conditioned regeneration but inhibits non-conditioned regeneration. Finally, six strains isolated in a forward genetic screen for reduced fluorescence also show reduced axon outgrowth. We demonstrate a link between trx-1 expression and the conditioned state that we leverage to rapidly assess regenerative capacity.

                Humans have unique cognitive abilities among primates, including language, but their molecular, cellular, and circuit substrates are poorly understood. We used comparative single nucleus transcriptomics in adult humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, rhesus macaques, and common marmosets from the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) to understand human-specific features of cellular and molecular organization. Human, chimpanzee, and gorilla MTG showed highly similar cell type composition and laminar organization, and a large shift in proportions of deep layer intratelencephalic-projecting neurons compared to macaque and marmoset. Species differences in gene expression generally mirrored evolutionary distance and were seen in all cell types, although chimpanzees were more similar to gorillas than humans, consistent with faster divergence along the human lineage. Microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes showed accelerated gene expression changes compared to neurons or oligodendrocyte precursor cells, indicating either relaxed evolutionary constraints or positive selection in these cell types. Only a few hundred genes showed human-specific patterning in all or specific cell types, and were significantly enriched near human accelerated regions (HARs) and conserved deletions (hCONDELS) and in cell adhesion and intercellular signaling pathways. These results suggest that relatively few cellular and molecular changes uniquely define adult human cortical structure, particularly by affecting circuit connectivity and glial cell function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diverse long-range projections convey position information to the retrosplenial cortex.</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal signals encoding the animal's position, originally discovered in the hippocampus, widely modulate neocortical processing. While it is assumed that these signals depend on hippocampal output, their origin has not been investigated directly. Here, we asked which brain region sends position information to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), a key circuit for navigation and memory. Using two-photon axonal imaging in head-fixed mice performing a spatial task, we performed a comprehensive functional characterization of long-range inputs to agranular RSC. Surprisingly, most long-range pathways convey position information, but with key differences. We found that axons from the secondary motor cortex transmit the most position information. By contrast, axons from the posterior parietal- anterior cingulate- and orbitofrontal cortex and thalamus convey substantially less position information. Axons from the primary- and secondary visual cortex make a negligible contribution. These data show that RSC is a node in a widely distributed ensemble of networks that share position information in a projection-specific manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Physiological constraints on the rapid dopaminergic modulation of striatal reward activity</a></h4>

              
                While the contribution of dopaminergic (DA) neurons to associative learning is firmly established, their importance for influencing imminent behavior on short (subsecond) timescales is less clear. Mechanistically, it is thought that DA neurons drive these behavioral changes because of their ability to rapidly alter striatal spiking activity. However, due to limitations of previous approaches, the straightforward prediction that striatal spiking is rapidly influenced by physiologically relevant DA signals has not been rigorously tested. Here, we monitored changes in spiking responses in the ventral striatum while transiently reducing or increasing DA levels. Contrary to the predicted effect, neither spontaneous nor reward-evoked striatal spiking activity was strongly influenced by optogenetic manipulations, except when DA exceeded reward-matched levels. These findings challenge the view that DA plays a major role in rapidly influencing striatal activity. Finally, they suggest a need to distinguish between the modulatory functions of DA under physiological and supra-physiological conditions.

                Reduced activity of the insulin/IGF signalling (IIS) network extends healthspan and lifespan in mammals and possibly humans. Loss of the Irs1 gene increases survival in mice and causes tissue-specific changes in gene expression. However, the tissues underlying IIS mediated longevity are currently unknown. Here we measured survival and healthspan in male and female animals lacking Irs1 activity specifically in the liver, muscle, fat and brain. Tissue-specific loss of IRS1 did not increase survival, suggesting that lack of Irs1 in more than one tissue is required for lifespan extension. Furthermore, loss of Irs1 in liver, muscle and fat did not improve health at old age. In contrast, loss of neuronal Irs1 increased energy expenditure, locomotion and insulin sensitivity, specifically in old males. Neuronal loss of IRS1 also caused male-specific mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of Atf4 and metabolic adaptations consistent with an activated integrated stress response at old age. Thus, we identified a male-specific brain signature of ageing in response to reduced IIS associated with improved health outcomes at old age.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A neuron that regulates locomotion makes a potential sensory cilium lying over the C. elegans egg-laying apparatus</a></h4>

              
                The neural circuit for C. elegans egg laying has been studied intensively for decades, yet it is not clear that its known components can account for how egg-laying and locomotion behaviors are coordinated. We found that the two PVP neurons, which release neuropeptides that promote roaming locomotion, make previously-undescribed branches that terminate in large wing-shaped endings directly over the egg-laying apparatus. The PVP branches occur in hermaphrodites but not males and develop during the L4 larval stage when the egg-laying system also develops. The PVP wing is located at the junction between the uterus and the vulva, adjacent to neurons that control egg laying, and surrounded by cells that we found label with a glial marker. The morphology of the PVP wing and its envelopment within possible glial cells are consistent with the hypothesis that the PVP wing is a sensory cilium. Although PVP is reported to express sensory receptor homologs, we have been unable to detect PVP expression of more specific markers of neural cilia, and we have also not detected strong PVP defects in the daf-19 mutant, which does show defects in known neural cilia. The PVPs are extraordinarily sensitive to expression of transgenes, which cause developmental and possibly functional defects in these neurons. This has prevented us from recording or manipulating PVP activity to determine its functional roles. Thus, the intriguing hypothesis that PVP is a sensory neuron that might coordinate egg laying and locomotion will remain speculative until better methods to manipulate PVP can be developed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Can neural correlates of encoding explain the context dependence of reward-enhanced memory?</a></h4>

              
                Selective encoding can be studied by manipulating how valuable it is for participants to remember specific stimuli, for instance by varying the monetary reward participants receive for recalling a particular stimulus in a subsequent memory test. It would be reasonable for participants to strategically attend more to high-reward items compared to low-reward items in mixed list contexts, but to attend both types of items equally in pure list contexts, where all items are of equal value. Reward-enhanced memory may be driven by automatic dopaminergic interactions between reward circuitry and the hippocampus and thus be insensitive to list context; or it may be driven by meta-cognitive strategies, and thus context-dependent. We contrasted these alternatives by manipulating list composition, and tracked selective encoding through multiple EEG measures of attention and rehearsal. Reward-enhanced memory depended on list composition: recall of high-reward items was increased in mixed, but not pure, lists. This result and aspects of the recall dynamics confirm predictions of the eCMR (emotional Context Maintenance and Retrieval) model. The power of steady-state visual evoked potentials was lower for high-reward items regardless of list composition, suggesting that high reward decreased visual processing of the stimuli and that ssVEPs may index the modulation of context-to-item associations predicted by eCMR. By contrast, reward modulated the amplitude of Late Positive Potential and Frontal Slow Wave only in mixed lists, mimicking the memory results. Taken together, the results provide evidence for the involvement of both automatic and strategic processes in how selective encoding shapes eventual memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seeing speech: The cerebral substrate of tickertape synesthesia.</a></h4>

              
                Reading acquisition is enabled by deep changes in the brain's visual system and language areas, and in the links subtending their collaboration. Disruption of those plastic processes commonly results in developmental dyslexia. However, atypical development of reading mechanisms may occasionally result in ticker-tape synesthesia (TTS), a condition described by Francis Galton in 1883 wherein individuals "see mentally in print every word that is uttered (...) as from a long imaginary strip of paper". While reading is the bottom-up translation of letters into speech, TTS may be viewed as its opposite, the top-down translation of speech into internally visualized letters. In a series of functional MRI experiments, we studied MK, a man with TTS. We showed that a set of left-hemispheric areas were more active in MK than in controls during the perception of normal than reversed speech, including frontoparietal areas involved in speech processing, and the Visual Word Form Area, an occipitotemporal region subtending orthography. Those areas were identical to those involved in reading, supporting the construal of TTS as upended reading. Using dynamic causal modeling, we further showed that, parallel to reading, TTS induced by spoken words and pseudowords relied on top-down flow of information along distinct lexical and phonological routes, involving the middle temporal and supramarginal gyri, respectively. Future studies of TTS should shed new light on the neurodevelopmental mechanisms of reading acquisition, their variability and their disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distributed coding of evidence accumulation across the mouse brain using microcircuits with a diversity of timescales</a></h4>

              
                The gradual accumulation of noisy evidence for or against options is the main step in the perceptual decision-making process. Using brain-wide electrophysiological recording in mice (Steinmetz et al., 2019), we examined neural correlates of evidence accumulation across multiple brain areas. We demonstrated that the neurons across the brain exhibited ramping-like firing rate activity that was modulated by the strength of evidence. These neurons had distinct properties in their intrinsic timescale, which were organized hierarchically across the brain. Our findings support the existence of evidence accumulation over multiple timescales. Besides variability across brain regions, a heterogeneity of intrinsic timescales was observed within each brain region as well. We demonstrated that this variability reflected the heterogeneity of microcircuit accumulation parameters, such that populations with longer timescales had higher recurrent excitation strength.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Abnormal intrinsic neural timescale in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: The intrinsic neural timescale in a local brain area has been specialized, and the sensory and prefrontal areas have shorter and longer timescales, respectively. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that also exhibits with abnormal neural activity in sensorimotor, visual, and cognitive-related areas. However, it was unclear whether PD patients exhibited abnormal intrinsic timescales and whether PD patients exhibited different temporal feature at different stages. Methods: Here, we estimated the intrinsic timescales using the magnitude of the autocorrelation of intrinsic neural signals by resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data in 74 PD patients, including 44 patients in the early stage (PD-ES) and 30 patients in the late stage (PD-LS), and 73 healthy controls (HC). Results: We identified that the PD group had shorter timescales in bilateral lingual and calcarine gyri, bilateral postcentral and precentral gyri, and the right middle cingulum gyrus than the HC group, which correlated with the age, but not in the HC group. Moreover, shorter timescales in the PD group also correlated with the symptom severity and reduced grey matter volume (GMV). Longer timescale in the right middle frontal gyrus was also found in the PD group than that in the HC group. Increasingly, compared to the HC group, the PD-ES group had longer timescales in the anterior cortical regions, including the left superior and inferior frontal gyri, and the right middle frontal gyrus, whereas the PD-LS group had shorter timescales in the posterior cortical regions, including bilateral calcarine and lingual gyri, which accompanied with more serious cognitive impairments and reduced GMV. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that PD patients exhibit abnormal intrinsic timescales in visual, sensorimotor, and cognitive systems, which might provide new insights for the neural substrate of PD. Distinct patterns of intrinsic timescales in cerebral cortex between the PD-LS and PD-ES groups indicate that intrinsic timescale might be a new neuroimaging biomarker across disease stage in PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">To be and not to be: Wide-field Ca2+ imaging reveals neocortical functional segmentation combines stability and flexibility</a></h4>

              
                The stability and flexibility of the functional parcellation of the cerebral cortex is fundamental to how familiar and novel information is both represented and stored. We leveraged new advances in Ca2+ sensors and microscopy to understand the dynamics of functional segmentation in the dorsal cerebral cortex. We performed wide-field Ca2+ imaging in head-fixed mice and used spatial Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to identify independent spatial sources of Ca2+ fluorescence. The imaging data were evaluated over multiple timescales and discrete behaviors including resting, walking, and grooming. When evaluated over the entire dataset, a set of template independent components (ICs) were identified that were common across behaviors. Template ICs were present across a range of timescales, from days to 30 seconds, although with lower occurrence probability at shorter timescales, highlighting the stability of the functional segmentation. Importantly, unique ICs emerged at the shorter duration timescales that could act to transiently refine the cortical network. When data were evaluated by behavior, both common and behavior-specific ICs emerged. Each behavior is composed of unique combinations of common and behavior-specific ICs. These observations suggest that cerebral cortical functional segmentation exhibits considerable spatial stability over time and behaviors while retaining the flexibility for task-dependent reorganization.

                Socioeconomic status (SES) has been linked to differences in brain structure and psychiatric risk across the lifespan. Despite many neuropsychiatric disorders emerging in childhood, few studies have examined the influence of SES on brain aging and psychopathology in youth. We re-analyzed relative brain age (RBA) data from the Healthy Brain Network to examine the influence of SES components (parent education, occupation, household income-to-needs ratio (INR), public assistance enrollment) on RBA. RBA was previously determined using covariation patterns for cortical morphology, white, and subcortical gray matter volumes without SES in predictive models. We also examined associations between RBA and psychiatric symptoms (child behavior checklist). Full case analysis included 470 youth (5-17 years; 61.3% male), self-identifying as White (55%), African American (15%), Hispanic (9%), or multiracial (17.2%). Mean household income was 3.95+/-2.33 (Mean+/-SD) times the federal poverty threshold. Multiple linear regression examined if 1) SES components associated with RBA, and 2) RBA associated with psychiatric symptoms. Models covaried for sex, scan location, and parent psychiatric diagnoses. RBA associated with public assistance (p = 0.03), parent occupation (p = 0.01), and parent psychiatric diagnosis (p = 0.01), but not with INR and parent education. Parent occupation (p = 0.02) and RBA (p = 0.04) associated with CBCL anxiety/depression scores. Components of SES associated with brain aging, underscoring the risk of omitting these factors in developmental brain research. Further, delayed brain aging was associated with low parental occupational prestige and child anxiety/depression scores, suggesting a possible biological pathway from SES to mental health risk.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disturbing standing balance evokes an error-related negativity</a></h4>

              
                The error-related negativity (ERN) is a neural correlate of error monitoring often used to investigate individual differences in developmental, pathological, and adaptive contexts. However, limited experimental control over errors presents several confounds to its measurement. An experimentally controlled disturbance to standing balance evokes the balance N1, which we previously suggested may share underlying mechanisms with the ERN. We test the possibility of shared underlying mechanisms by testing whether the balance N1 and ERN are associated in amplitude across individuals within two populations across the adult lifespan (N=21 young adults and N=20 older adults). ERNs were measured in two versions of an arrow flanker task where responses were entered by the hand (ERN-hand) or feet (ERN-foot). The balance N1 was evoked by sudden slip-like movements of the floor beneath a standing participant. The ERNs and the balance N1 showed good to excellent internal consistency and were correlated in amplitude in both populations. One principal component accounted for approximately 80% of variance as being shared across the three evoked responses within each group, but the association between the ERN-hand and ERN-foot remained significant when the balance N1 was included in the model. The results suggest the balance N1 and ERN share mechanisms underlying individual differences in error monitoring. Balance perturbations may therefore provide a well-controlled method for examining individual differences in the neural system that monitors errors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Role of Frontal Eye Field in Saccadic Mixed-strategy Decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Game theory can predict the distribution of choices in aggregate during mixed-strategy games, yet the neural process mediating individual probabilistic choices remains poorly understood. Here, we examined the role of frontal eye field (FEF) in a decision-making task when macaques were trained to play a mixed-strategic game Matching Pennies against a computer opponent. Neuronal activities of FEF neurons predicted the animals' upcoming saccadic choices and these activities became increasingly more selective as the choice deadline approached. Subthreshold electrical micro-stimulation applied in FEF also biased choices. Extended stimulation biased choices towards the preferred FEF vector whereas early termination of stimulation biased choices away from the preferred FEF vector. By contrast, micro-stimulation biased choices in the preferred direction during a non-strategic perceptual luminance discrimination task. We conclude that FEF is causally contributing to mixed-strategy decision-making process although the timing of FEF activation contributes to the decision process in a more non-linear manner during strategic compared to perceptual decision-making.

                Abnormal amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) abnormal accumulation and oxidative stress play important roles in Alzheimer' disease (AD). Quercetin has been reported to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and thus of therapeutic interests for neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the mechanisms by which quercetin exerts neuroprotective effects in murine neuroblastoma N2a cells stably expressing human Swedishh mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP). Quercetin treatment exhibited low cytoxicity, attenuated APP expression and APP-induced oxidative neurotoxicity in N2a/APP cells. We found that quercetin effected via the down-regulation of phospho-extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (p-ERK1/2) pathway and up-regulation of phospho-protein kinase B (p-AKT) pathway in N2a/APP cells. In addition, quercetin ameliorated the elevated levels of reactive oxygen species using DCFH-DA flow-cytometry in N2a/APP cells, lipid peroxidation using (4-HNE), and DNA oxidation (8-OHdG assays). Quercetin ameliorated the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential using JC-1 fluorescence assay in N2a/APP cells in a dose-dependent mannor. In conclusion, we domenstrated the neuroprotective effects of quercetin against the APP expression induced oxidative neurotoxicity, impairment of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress through inactivation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and activation of AKT signaling pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A T1R-independent mechanism for responses to hyperosmotic sugars involves a carbonic anhydrase-sensitive mechanism in Type III receptor cells</a></h4>

              
                Recent findings from our laboratory demonstrated that the rostral nucleus of solitary tract (rNST) retains some responsiveness to glutamate (MSG+amiloride-MSGa) and sugars in mice lacking the canonical T1R receptors for these tastants. Here, we recorded from the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) in mice lacking the T1R1+T1R3 heterodimer (KO1+3), using warm stimuli to optimize sugar responses and employing extended concentrations and pharmacological agents to probe mechanisms. MSGa+IMP responses were not synergized in KO1+3 mice but responses to MSGa were similar to those in B6 (WT) mice. Glutamate responses in the neurons tested were unaffected by topical application of an mGluR4 antagonist. PBN T1R-independent sugar responses, including those to concentrated glucose, were more evident than in rNST. Sugar responses were undiminished by phlorizin, an inhibitor of SGLT, a component of a hypothesized alternative glucose-sensing mechanism. There were no sugar/umami "best" neurons in KO1+3 mice, and instead, sugars activated cells that displayed acid and amiloride-insensitive NaCl responses. In WTs, concentrated sugars activated "sugar/umami" cells but also electrolyte-sensitive neurons. The efficacy of hyperosmotic sugars for driving neurons broadly responsive to electrolytes implied an origin from Type III taste bud cells. To test this, we used the carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor dorzolamide (DRZ), previously shown to inhibit amiloride-insensitive sodium responses arising from Type III cells. Dorzolamide had no effect on sugar-elicited responses in WT sugar/umami PBN neurons but strongly suppressed them in WT and KO electrolyte-generalist neurons. These findings suggest a novel T1R-independent mechanism for hyperosmotic sugars, involving a CA-dependent mechanism in Type-III taste bud cells.

                Primates readily learn new visual objects, with neurons in the inferior temporal cortex exhibiting diminished visual responses to familiar stimuli. The mechanisms of visual plasticity expressed within a neural population are largely unknown. Here we used chronic microwire electrodes in a face-selective cortical area in the macaque to longitudinally track cohorts of neurons across several weeks of exposure to novel faces. Neurons showed gradual adaptation in their late-phase visual responses, with cell-specific time constants ranging from two to twenty days. These time constants were governed by the number of testing days rather than by the cumulative number of stimulus exposures. This gradual buildup of altered visual responses may serve as an internal and graded mark of stimulus familiarity, a central component of visual recognition.

                Activity across prefrontal cortical populations represents stimuli in a low-dimensional manifold that often undergoes transformations during the execution of cognitive tasks. These dynamics are commonly thought to be determined by whatever cognitive operation is being performed at the time, for example, rotation of stimulus representation in population activity during working memory is thought to reduce interference by subsequent distractors. The assumption that cognitive operations dictate stimulus transformations has not yet been tested experimentally. Here we show that the activity space of prefrontal neurons in naive monkeys exhibits significant rotations, some aspects of which remain remarkably unchanged after training to perform working memory tasks. Training does induce changes in population dynamics, which further distinguish correct and error trials during task execution. Our results reveal automatic functions of prefrontal neural circuits that form the substrate of cognitive flexibility.

                Acute stress has a profound effect on attention selection, however, it remains unclear how acute stress affects target enhancement and distractor suppression in attention selection. The current study aimed to investigated the acute stress effect on target enhancement and distractor suppression in a visual search task by using ERP. The stress response was successfully induced as indexed by the activation of HPA and the subjective affect rating. Crucially, acute stress group showed significant smaller N2pc than the control group in the high-salience distractor condition, no significant differences of Pd was observed, which indicated that actue stress disrupts the target enhancement rather than the distractor suppression in attention selection. The detrimental effects might attribute to the impairing function of prefrontal cortex. The current study provide clear evidences of the impairment of target enhancement under acute stress, and reveal the cognitive mechanism of acute stress effects on attention selection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Computational Model of Learning Flexible Navigation in a Maze by Layout-Conforming Replay of Place Cells</a></h4>

              
                Recent experimental observations have shown that the reactivation of hippocampal place cells (PC) during sleep or immobility depicts trajectories that can go around barriers and can flexibly adapt to a changing maze layout. Such layout-conforming replay sheds a light on how the activity of place cells supports the learning of flexible navigation in a dynamically changing maze. However, existing computational models of replay fall short of generating layout-conforming replay, restricting their usage to simple environments, like linear tracks or open fields. In this paper, we propose a computational model that generates layout-conforming replay and explains how such replay drives the learning of flexible navigation in a maze. First, we propose a Hebbian-like rule to learn the inter-PC synaptic strength during exploring a maze. Then we use a continuous attractor network (CAN) with feedback inhibition to model the interaction among place cells and hippocampal interneurons. The activity bump of place cells drifts along a path in the maze, which models layout-conforming replay. During replay in rest, the synaptic strengths from place cells to striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) are learned by a novel dopamine-modulated three-factor rule to store place-reward associations. During goal-directed navigation, the CAN periodically generates replay trajectories from the animal's location for path planning, and the trajectory leading to a maximal MSN activity is followed by the animal. We have implemented our model into a high-fidelity virtual rat in the MuJoCo physics simulator. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that its superior flexibility during navigation in a maze is due to a continuous re-learning of inter-PC and PC-MSN synaptic strength.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Loss of LRP1 from GABAergic neurons impairs short-term memory function</a></h4>

              
                Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) plays an important role in regulating energy homeostasis, the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, and metabolic signal transport across the brain, while its dysfunction has been associated with cognitive decline, dementia, and Alzheimers disease. However, the impact of LRP1 in GABAergic neurons on neurodegeneration and memory is poorly understood. Mice lacking LRP1 in GABAergic neurons (Vgat-Cre; LRP1loxP/loxP) were subjected to behavioral tests for memory and learning. Here we show that the loss of LRP1 in GABAergic neurons causes significant impairment in short-term memory. The spatial Y-maze test revealed that Vgat-Cre; LRP1loxP/loxP mice exhibited decreased travel distance and duration in the novel arm compared to the controls (LRP1loxP/loxP mice). A reduction in correct responses to find the escape platform in the water T-maze test was found when LRP1 is absent in GABAergic neurons. Moreover, the distance and duration in the novel arm as well as the performance of the reversal water T-maze test were negatively correlated with body weight as well as serum levels of leptin, insulin, and ApoJ. Mice lacking LRP1 in GABAergic neurons displayed decreased freezing time in the contextual and cued fear conditioning test. Histopathological evaluation of the hippocampus revealed that Vgat-Cre; LRP1loxP/loxP mice had greater neuronal necrosis and neuroinflammation than those of LRP1loxP/loxP mice. These findings suggest that LRP1 in GABAergic neurons may play a crucial role in maintaining normal memory function and could be a molecular target for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurofibromin 1 mediates sleep depth in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Neural regulation of sleep and metabolic homeostasis are critical in many aspects of human health. Despite extensive epidemiological evidence linking sleep dysregulation with obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, little is known about the neural and molecular basis for the integration of sleep and metabolic function. The RAS GTPase-activating gene Neurofibromin (Nf1) has been implicated in the regulation of sleep and metabolic rate, raising the possibility that it serves to integrate these processes, but the effects on sleep consolidation and physiology remain poorly understood. A key hallmark of sleep depth in mammals and flies is a reduction in metabolic rate during sleep. Here, we use indirect calorimetry to define the role of Nf1 on sleep-dependent changes in metabolic rate. Flies lacking Nf1 fail to suppress metabolic rate during sleep, raising the possibility that loss of Nf1 prevents flies from integrating sleep and metabolic state. Sleep of Nf1 mutant flies is fragmented with a reduced arousal threshold in Nf1 mutants, suggesting Nf1 flies fail to enter deep sleep. The effects of Nf1 on sleep can be localized to a subset of neurons expressing the GABA receptor Rdl. Selective knockdown of Nf1 in Rdl-expressing neurons increases gut permeability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the gut, suggesting a critical role for deep sleep in gut homeostasis. Together, these findings suggest Nf1 acts in GABA-sensitive neurons to modulate sleep depth in Drosophila.

	<p>Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of liquid embolization agents for treating various hemorrhagic peripheral intracranial aneurysms. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 38 patients who suffered from hemorrhagic peripheral intracranial aneurysms and were treated with liquid embolization agents. We used the modified Rankin scale for follow-up at 6 months postoperatively, and digital subtraction angiography follow-up was performed 6 months postoperatively. Results: Of the 38 patients (ten of simple peripheral intracranial aneurysms, six of Moyamoya disease (MMD), and 22 of arteriovenous malformation (AVM)), posterior circulation accounted for the most significant proportion (57.9%), followed by anterior circulation (21.1%) and intranidal aneurysms (21.1%). Intraoperative hemorrhage occurred in four cases, postoperative cerebral infarction occurred in four cases, two patients encountered microcatheter retention, and intraoperative thrombosis took place in the basilar artery of a patient with an arteriovenous malformation. A postoperative hemorrhage occurred in only one patient. At 6-month follow-up, 84.2% of patients had good prognosis outcomes, and 13.5% had poor outcomes. Conclusion: Liquid embolization agents are effective for hemorrhagic peripheral intracranial aneurysms; however, safety depends on the subtypes. For peripheral hemorrhagic aneurysms in MMD, the vessel architecture must be carefully evaluated before embolization.</p>

	<p>Background: The APOE4 allele is a genetic risk factor for developing late-onset Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Previous work by our group revealed that female APOE4 homozygotes with Lewy body (LB) pathology were more likely to experience psychosis compared to female APOE4 non-carriers, whereas in males there was no APOE4 dose-dependent significant effect. The objective of this study was to refine our previous findings by adjusting for covariates and determining the probability of an APOE4 sex-mediated effect on psychosis. Methods: Neuropathologically confirmed AD patients with LB pathology (n = 491) and without LB pathology (n = 716) were extracted from the National Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Coordinating Center (NACC). Patients were classified as psychotic if they scored positively for delusions and/or hallucinations on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Analysis consisted of a preliminary unadjusted binary logistic regression and a Generalized Additive binary logistic regression Model (GAM) to predict the relationship between APOE4 status and sex on the presence of psychosis in both cohorts, adjusting for age, education and MMSE. Results: In the cohort with LB pathology, female APOE4 homozygotes were significantly more likely to experience psychosis compared to female APOE4 non-carriers (OR = 4.15, 95%CI [1.21, 14.2], p = 0.023). Female heterozygotes were also more likely to experience psychosis compared to female APOE4 non-carriers, but to a lesser extent (OR = 2.37, 95%CI [1.01, 5.59], p = 0.048). There was no significant difference in males with LB pathology or in any sex in the cohort without LB pathology. Conclusions: Sex and zygosity influence the effect of APOE4 on psychosis in neuropathologically confirmed AD patients, with the effect being limited to females with LB pathology.</p>

	<p>New approaches in aphasia rehabilitation have recently identified the crucial role of executive functions (EFs) in language recovery, especially for people with severe aphasia (PWSA). Indeed, EFs include high-order cognitive abilities such as planning and problem solving, which enable humans to adapt to novel situations and are essential for everyday functional communication. In a randomized double-blind crossover design, twenty chronic Italian PWSA underwent ten days of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (20 min, 2 mA) over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Two conditions were considered, i.e., anodal and sham, while performing four types of cognitive training (alertness, selective attention, visuo-spatial working memory, and planning), all of which were related to executive functions. After anodal tDCS, a greater improvement in selective attention, visuospatial working memory and planning abilities was found compared to the sham condition; this improvement persisted one month after the intervention. Importantly, a significant improvement was also observed in functional communication, as measured through the Communication Activities of Daily Living Scale, in noun and verb naming, in auditory and written language comprehension tasks and in executive function abilities. This evidence emphasizes, for the first time, that tDCS over the right DLPFC combined with executive training enhances functional communication in severe aphasia.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The cingulo-opercular network is composed of two distinct sub-systems</a></h4>

              
                The cingulo-opercular (CO) network and its two best studied regions - the dorsal anterior cingulate and anterior insula - have been linked to task control, but also implicated in many additional processes across cognitive, social, and emotional domains. However, most prior work investigating the CO network has used a group-average approach, which may mix signals across nearby regions that vary across individuals. Here, we reevaluate the CO network's role in task control with both task and rest fMRI, using regions with a high probability of CO network agreement across individuals. Hierarchical clustering analyses suggest heterogeneity in the CO network's task response properties, with one sub-system (CO1) showing consistency with prior task control characterizations while another sub-system (CO2) has weak task control responses, but preserved ties to pain and motor functions. Resting-state connectivity confirms subtle differences in the architecture of these two sub-systems. This evidence suggests that, when individual variation in network locations is addressed, the CO network includes (at least) two linked sub-systems with differential roles in task control and other cognitive/motor/interoceptive responses, which may help explain varied accounts of its functions. We propose that this fractionation may reflect expansion of primary CO body-oriented control functions to broader domain-general contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive compensation of arcuate fasciculus lateralization in developmental dyslexia</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have reported anomalies in the arcuate fasciculus (AF) lateralization in developmental dyslexia (DD). Still, the relationship between AF lateralization and literacy skills in DD remains largely unknown. The purpose of our study is to investigate the relationship between the lateralization of the AF anterior segment (AFAS), AF long segment (AFLS), and AF posterior segment (AFPS) in connection to literacy skills in DD. The participants included 26 children with dyslexia and 31 age-matched children in the control group. High angular diffusion imaging, combined with spherical deconvolution tractography, was used to reconstruct the AF. Connectivity measures of hindrance-modulated oriented anisotropy (HMOA) were computed for each of the three segments of the AF: anterior segment (AFAS), long segment (AFLS), and posterior segment (AFPS). The lateralization index (LI) of each AF segment was calculated by (right HMOA - left HMOA) / (right HMOA + left HMOA). Results showed that the LIs of AFAS and AFLS were positively correlated with reading accuracy in children with dyslexia. Specifically, the LI of AFAS was positively correlated with text and nonword reading accuracy, while the LI of AFLS accounted for word reading accuracy. The results suggest adaptive compensation of arcuate fasciculus lateralization in developmental dyslexia and functional dissociation of the anterior segment and long segment in the compensation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Children's syntax is supported by the maturation of BA44 at 4 years, but of the posterior STS at 3 years of age</a></h4>

              
                Within the first years of life, children learn major aspects of their native language. However, the ability to process complex sentence structures, a core faculty in human language called syntax, has been found to emerge only slowly. A milestone in the acquisition of syntax is reached around the age of 4, when children learn a variety of syntactic concepts, including, for example, subordinate clauses. Here, we ask which maturational changes in the child's brain underlie the emergence of syntactic abilities around this critical age. We relate markers of cortical brain maturation to 3- and 4-year-olds' syntactic in contrast to other language abilities. Our results show that distinct cortical brain areas support syntax in the two age groups: While 3-year-old children's syntactic abilities were associated with increased surface area in the most posterior part of the left superior temporal sulcus, 4-year-old children showed an association with cortical thickness in the left posterior part of Broca's area, i.e. BA44. The present findings suggest that syntactic abilities rely on the maturation of distinct cortical regions in 3- compared to 4-year-olds. The observed shift to more mature regions involved in syntax may underlie the behavioral milestones in syntax acquisition around 4 years of age.
