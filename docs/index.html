                Circular RNAs (circRNAs), once thought to be a result of splicing errors, have been found to be involved in various molecular processes and the pathology of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, circRNA expression was found to be altered by lifestyle habits, such as smoking cigarettes. Past studies have revealed that the rate of smoking remains high in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this study, we isolated total RNA from uninfected T-cells that have been exposed to cigarette smoke and compared the expression levels of circRNAs to those of T-cells that were not exposed to cigarette smoke. We identified certain circRNAs that were upregulated or downregulated in T-cells when exposed to cigarette smoke. These data indicate that the study of circRNAs is warranted within the context of HIV.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-114/v2?src=rss">An integrative review on physical restraint in adult critical care unit [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Physical restraints (PRs) are frequently used in adult critical care units to protect staff and prevent self-harm, despite the fact that they represent significant safety risks. Restraint complications may have an impact on the patient’s long- and short-term outcomes. This integrative review aimed to meticulously evaluate existing evidence pertaining to physical restraint practices in adult critical care settings. The review was specifically geared towards examining the prevalence of PR, identifying influential factors, elucidating the role of nurses in PR implementation, exploring nurses’ experiences in caring for patients under restraint, and scrutinizing the complications associated with PR application Method This integrative review included the studies published between January 2009 and December 2019 and the literature search was conducted in July 2020. The databases searched included EBSCOhost, Ovid, ProQuest, PubMed, Wiley Online Library, SCOPUS, and ScienceDirect. The keywords included in the search were restraint, critical care, intensive care, ICU, mechanical ventilation, intubation, nursing, and experience. A checklist based on the CASP checklist and the JBI Critical Appraisal Tool was used to assess the methodological quality. Results The findings were evaluated and summarized into seven key topics after twenty-one publications were found to be evaluated. i) High prevalence of PR application in adult critical care unit; ii) determinants of PR applications; iii) types of PR in adult critical care units; iv) decision maker of PR; v) moral and ethical dilemma in PR application; vi) awareness and guidelines for PR applications; vii) common complications and use of sedation, analgesics, antipsychotic drugs in PR application. Conclusion The number of days PR is used is related to the risk of an adverse event. In order to standardize nursing practice, ICU nurses require greater training on the ideas of PR use. Evidence-based recommendations will assist critical care nurses in making the best judgments possible concerning the use of PR.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-918/v2?src=rss">Mutational profile of primary clear cell renal cell carcinoma predicts recurrence and potential candidacy for adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The risk of recurrence after nephrectomy for primary clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is estimated in daily practice solely based on clinical criteria. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic relevance of common somatic mutations with respect to tumor aggressiveness and outcomes of ccRCC patients after definitive treatment. Methods Primary tumors from 37 patients with ccRCC who underwent radical nephrectomy were analyzed for presence of somatic mutations using a 15-gene targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. Associations to histopathologic characteristics and outcomes were investigated in the study cohort (n=37) and validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ccRCC cohort (n=451). Results VHL was the most frequently mutated gene (51%), followed by PBRM1 (27%), BAP1 (13%), SETD2 (13%), KDM5C (5%), ATM (5%), MTOR (5%), and PTEN (3%). One-third of patients did not have any somatic mutations within the 15-gene panel. The vast majority of tumors harboring no mutations at all or VHL-only mutations (51%) were more frequently of smaller size (pT1-2) and earlier stage (I/II), whereas presence of any other gene mutations in various combinations with or without VHL was enriched in larger (pT3) and higher stage tumors (III) (p=0.02). No recurrences were noted in patients with unmutated tumors or VHL-only mutations as opposed to three relapses in patients with non-VHL somatic mutations (p=0.06). Presence of somatic mutations in PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2, KDM5C, ATM, MTOR, or PTEN genes in 451 TCGA ccRCC patients was associated with a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) compared to those with unaltered tumors (q=0.01). Conclusions Preliminary findings from this ongoing study support the prognostic value of non-VHL mutations including PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2, KDM5C, ATM, MTOR, and PTEN in primary ccRCC tumors as surrogates of earlier recurrence and potential selection for adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0476-23.2024?rss=1">Facilitating the Sharing of Electrophysiology Data Analysis Results Through In-Depth Provenance Capture</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientific research demands reproducibility and transparency, particularly in data-intensive fields like electrophysiology. Electrophysiology data are typically analyzed using scripts that generate output files, including figures. Handling these results poses several challenges due to the complexity and iterative nature of the analysis process. These stem from the difficulty to discern the analysis steps, parameters, and data flow from the results, making knowledge transfer and findability challenging in collaborative settings. Provenance information tracks data lineage and processes applied to it, and provenance capture during the execution of an analysis script can address those challenges. We present Alpaca (Automated Lightweight Provenance Capture), a tool that captures fine-grained provenance information with minimal user intervention when running data analysis pipelines implemented in Python scripts. Alpaca records inputs, outputs, and function parameters and structures information according to the W3C PROV standard. We demonstrate the tool using a realistic use case involving multichannel local field potential recordings of a neurophysiological experiment, highlighting how the tool makes result details known in a standardized manner in order to address the challenges of the analysis process. Ultimately, using Alpaca will help to represent results according to the FAIR principles, which will improve research reproducibility and facilitate sharing the results of data analyses.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0511-23.2024?rss=1">Individualized Closed-Loop Acoustic Stimulation Suggests an Alpha Phase Dependence of Sound Evoked and Induced Brain Activity Measured with EEG Recordings</a></h4>

              
                <p>Following repetitive visual stimulation, post hoc phase analysis finds that visually evoked response magnitudes vary with the cortical alpha oscillation phase that temporally coincides with sensory stimulus. This approach has not successfully revealed an alpha phase dependence for auditory evoked or induced responses. Here, we test the feasibility of tracking alpha with scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and play sounds phase-locked to individualized alpha phases in real-time using a novel end-point corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT) algorithm implemented on a research device. Based on prior work, we hypothesize that sound-evoked and induced responses vary with the alpha phase at sound onset and the alpha phase that coincides with the early sound-evoked response potential (ERP) measured with EEG. Thus, we use each subject&rsquo;s individualized alpha frequency (IAF) and individual auditory ERP latency to define target trough and peak alpha phases that allow an early component of the auditory ERP to align to the estimated poststimulus peak and trough phases, respectively. With this closed-loop and individualized approach, we find opposing alpha phase-dependent effects on the auditory ERP and alpha oscillations that follow stimulus onset. Trough and peak phase-locked sounds result in distinct evoked and induced post-stimulus alpha level and frequency modulations. Though additional studies are needed to localize the sources underlying these phase-dependent effects, these results suggest a general principle for alpha phase-dependence of sensory processing that includes the auditory system. Moreover, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using individualized neurophysiological indices to deliver automated, closed-loop, phase-locked auditory stimulation. </p>

                Background Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) represent a growing global health concern, necessitating comprehensive investigations into their prevalence and resistance mechanisms. This study protocol focuses on detecting carbapenemase genes, including blaVIM, blaNDM, blaKPC, blaIPM, and blaOXA-48, in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli from a tertiary hospital in Eastern India. The rise of carbapenem resistance poses challenges to effective antimicrobial therapy and infection control strategies. Methods Conducted at the Department of Microbiology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, the study employs a cross-sectional design from July 2022 to December 2023. The sample size calculation follows Daniel’s formula, considering a non-response rate of 10%. Modified Carbapenem Inactivation Method (mCIM) and EDTA-Modified Carbapenem Inactivation Method (eCIM) will be used for phenotypic detection, along with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for genotypic confirmation. Antibiotic susceptibility testing using the Kirby-Bauer Disk Diffusion method will complement resistance profiling. Expected Outcome Anticipated outcomes include insights into the efficacy of mCIM and eCIM in detecting carbapenem resistance, the prevalence of carbapenemase genes in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, and the antibiotic resistance pattern of carbapenemase-producing CRE. This study aims to provide valuable data for guiding empirical treatment strategies and reinforcing infection control measures in the region.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-635/v1?src=rss">Comparative observational study on diagnostic utility of impulse oscillometry vs spirometry in obstructive airway diseases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Obstructive airway diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, pose significant global health challenges. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management. Although Spirometry has traditionally been the cornerstone of diagnostics, Impulse Oscillometry (IOS) has emerged as a promising alternative. This study aims to compare the diagnostic performance of Spirometry and IOS in patients attending the Respiratory Medicine Department at the Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital, Sawangi, India. Methods A Comparative Observational Study was conducted between August 2022 and August 2024, enrolling patients who met specific inclusion criteria. Data were collected through a comprehensive medical history, clinical examination, routine blood tests, chest radiography, High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), spirometry, and IOS. Key parameters, including Forced expiratory volume in the first second FEV1, FEV1/FVC (Forced Expiratory Volume), (Forced Expiratory Volume) FVC, (Forced Expiratory Flow) FEF 25-75 for Spirometry, and R5, R20, fres, X5, and AX for IOS, were analyzed using the Chi-Square Test and Student’s t-test with SPSS 27.0 and GraphPad Prism 7.0. Expected outcome The study included 130 participants with the primary objective of evaluating IOS’s diagnostic advantages of IOS over spirometry. Our findings demonstrate that IOS offers enhanced sensitivity for diagnosing early small airway diseases, which is a crucial factor for early diagnosis in both pediatric and adult populations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-634/v1?src=rss">Association of intradialytic hypertension and antihypertensive medication use in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis: a prospective observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background In patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, intradialytic hypertension and intradialytic hypotension are the common complications. The study aimed to collect and assess intradialytic Blood Pressure (BP) complications and their association with different factors, including BP medication. Methods This was a prospective observational study, conducted at the hemodialysis center in a teaching hospital in the UAE, that provide a specialist’s care for the patients receiving ongoing hemodialysis. Patient demographics, medications used, lab data and the peridialytic BP (pre-, intra-, and post-) dialytic BP were collected for a period of 6 months. SPSS Version 29, Armonk, NY was used for statistical analysis. Pearson Chi-square test and Fischer’s Exact test were used to compare the association between categorical variables to intradialytic hypertension and hypotension. Results Blood pressure data was collected from 47 hemodialysis patients for a total of 2616 hemodialysis sessions during the 6 months study period. Beta-blockers (68%) and calcium channel blockers (66%) were the commonly used antihypertensive medications in the study population. Intradialytic hypertension events were diagnosed in 49 hemodialysis sessions and intradialytic hypotension was diagnosed in 23 hemodialysis sessions. On comparing the effect of antihypertensive medication to the occurrence of intradialytic BP complications, ARBs and alpha-1 blockers showed no association to intradialytic hypertension, but beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers use were associated with increased number of intradialytic hypertension events (p-value <0.05). On the other hand, antihypertensive medication use showed no association with intradialytic hypotension. Conclusions Patients using ARBs or alpha-1 blockers had higher intradialytic hypertension events. Beta-blocker and calcium channel users had lower intradialytic hypertension events. Antihypertensive use showed no association with intradialytic hypotension events.

                <p>by Kris Sankaran, Pratheepa Jeganathan</p>

Time series studies of microbiome interventions provide valuable data about microbial ecosystem structure. Unfortunately, existing models of microbial community dynamics have limited temporal memory and expressivity, relying on Markov or linearity assumptions. To address this, we introduce a new class of models based on transfer functions. These models learn impulse responses, capturing the potentially delayed effects of environmental changes on the microbial community. This allows us to simulate trajectories under hypothetical interventions and select significantly perturbed taxa with False Discovery Rate guarantees. Through simulations, we show that our approach effectively reduces forecasting errors compared to strong baselines and accurately pinpoints taxa of interest. Our case studies highlight the interpretability of the resulting differential response trajectories. An R package, mbtransfer, and notebooks to replicate the simulation and case studies are provided.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012165">Threshold-awareness in adaptive cancer therapy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by MingYi Wang, Jacob G. Scott, Alexander Vladimirsky</p>

Although adaptive cancer therapy shows promise in integrating evolutionary dynamics into treatment scheduling, the stochastic nature of cancer evolution has seldom been taken into account. Various sources of random perturbations can impact the evolution of heterogeneous tumors, making performance metrics of any treatment policy random as well. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for selecting optimal adaptive treatment policies under randomly evolving tumor dynamics. The goal is to improve the cumulative “cost” of treatment, a combination of the total amount of drugs used and the total treatment time. As this cost also becomes random in any stochastic setting, we maximize the probability of reaching the treatment goals (tumor stabilization or eradication) without exceeding a pre-specified cost threshold (or a “budget”). We use a novel Stochastic Optimal Control formulation and Dynamic Programming to find such “threshold-aware” optimal treatment policies. Our approach enables an efficient algorithm to compute these policies for a range of threshold values simultaneously. Compared to treatment plans shown to be optimal in a deterministic setting, the new “threshold-aware” policies significantly improve the chances of the therapy succeeding under the budget, which is correlated with a lower general drug usage. We illustrate this method using two specific examples, but our approach is far more general and provides a new tool for optimizing adaptive therapies based on a broad range of stochastic cancer models.

                <p>by Jeremy VanderDoes, Claire Marceaux, Kenta Yokote, Marie-Liesse Asselin-Labat, Gregory Rice, Jack D. Hywood</p>

Tumor microenvironments (TMEs) contain vast amounts of information on patient’s cancer through their cellular composition and the spatial distribution of tumor cells and immune cell populations. Exploring variations in TMEs between patient groups, as well as determining the extent to which this information can predict outcomes such as patient survival or treatment success with emerging immunotherapies, is of great interest. Moreover, in the face of a large number of cell interactions to consider, we often wish to identify specific interactions that are useful in making such predictions. We present an approach to achieve these goals based on summarizing spatial relationships in the TME using spatial <i>K</i> functions, and then applying functional data analysis and random forest models to both predict outcomes of interest and identify important spatial relationships. This approach is shown to be effective in simulation experiments at both identifying important spatial interactions while also controlling the false discovery rate. We further used the proposed approach to interrogate two real data sets of Multiplexed Ion Beam Images of TMEs in triple negative breast cancer and lung cancer patients. The methods proposed are publicly available in a companion R package funkycells.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23612?af=R">Dynamics of spike transmission and suppression between principal cells and interneurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Synaptic excitation and inhibition are essential for neuronal communication. However, the variables that regulate synaptic excitation and inhibition in the intact brain remain largely unknown. Here, we examined how spike transmission and suppression between principal cells (PCs) and interneurons (INTs) are modulated by activity history, brain state, cell type, and somatic distance between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons by applying cross-correlogram analyses to datasets recorded from the dorsal hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of 11 male behaving and sleeping Long Evans rats. The strength, temporal delay, and brain-state dependency of the spike transmission and suppression depended on the subregions/layers. The spike transmission probability of PC–INT excitatory pairs that showed short-term depression versus short-term facilitation was higher in CA1 and lower in CA3. Likewise, the intersomatic distance affected the proportion of PC–INT excitatory pairs that showed short-term depression and facilitation in the opposite manner in CA1 compared with CA3. The time constant of depression was longer, while that of facilitation was shorter in MEC than in CA1 and CA3. During sharp-wave ripples, spike transmission showed a larger gain in the MEC than in CA1 and CA3. The intersomatic distance affected the spike transmission gain during sharp-wave ripples differently in CA1 versus CA3. A subgroup of MEC layer 3 (EC3) INTs preferentially received excitatory inputs from and inhibited MEC layer 2 (EC2) PCs. The EC2 PC–EC3 INT excitatory pairs, most of which showed short-term depression, exhibited higher spike transmission probabilities than the EC2 PC–EC2 INT and EC3 PC–EC3 INT excitatory pairs. EC2 putative stellate cells exhibited stronger spike transmission to and received weaker spike suppression from EC3 INTs than EC2 putative pyramidal cells. This study provides detailed comparisons of monosynaptic interaction dynamics in the hippocampal–entorhinal loop, which may help to elucidate circuit operations.</p>

                Introduction Diarrhea is a significant health problem in the Third World. Identification of the pathogen that causes diarrhea is vital for measures to prevent and control this disease. There are also very few reports of diarrhea in Sudan. Our study aimed to determine the Prevalence of specific protozoan pathogens (Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium parvum., and Giardia spp) in children in Khartoum, Sudan. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among children under five years of age who were hospitalized with acute diarrhea between April and December 2014. Diarrheal stool samples were collected and E. histolytica, C. parvum, and Giardia spp were examined using multiplex real-time PCR. Results Four hundred and thirty-seven children with acute diarrheawere included in this study; the higher Prevalence of diarrhea was in the age less than ≤ 2 years old (403,92.2%). The male-to-female ratio in this study was 1:1.7. infection with intestinal parasite was found in 155 (35.5%) cases, and co-infection was detected in 16 (10.3%) cases. Giardia spp(18.8%) and C. parvum (15.8 %) were the most frequently identified parasites, followed by E. histolytica (0.9). The parasite infection rate was highest and lowest in the under 2-year-old group (92.3%) and the 2–4-year-old group (7.3%). The infection rate was higher in boys (67.1%) than in girls (32.9%). The incidence of protozoan infection was higher in the rainy season (August to December) (92.2%), corresponding with that in the dry Season (April to June). (7.8%). Discussion Our present study demonstrated the high prevalence of Giardia spp and C. parvum in children with diarrhea in the Khartoum region and the usefulness of the multiplex real-time method in disclosing pathogenic protozoal agents. Our result highlighted the necessity of developing intervention measurement and control strategies to deal with childhood parasitic diarrhea in this region.

                In the 21st century, impact of social media, particularly Social Networking Sites (SNSs) has been linked to a wide range of human beliefs and expectations. Growing body of research has indicated that body image concerns along with exercise motivation and social comparison are on the rise among young adults. The present study aimed to examine the sex difference in body image, exercise motivation and social comparison among people who use Instagram in the age group 20-30. A total of 212 participants (men=106, women=106) aged 20-30 years, who are users of Instagram completed Body Self Image Questionnaire Short Form as a measure of Body image, Exercise Motivation Inventory – 2 as a measure of Exercise Motivation and Instagram as a Tool for Social Comparison as a measure of Social Comparison. Results showed that a significant difference in body image exist across gender with body image issues higher among females and significant difference in exercise motivation across gender with exercise motivation higher among males. No sex differences were seen in social comparison. It was concluded that body image concerns are higher among females and the drive for exercise is higher among males who used Instagram. It was found that body image concerns were higher among people who exercised regularly as well as among those who followed fitness related pages on Instagram as compared to those who did not. These results provide an insight into the sex differences between the variables and future directions can be aimed at conducting an in-depth analysis using body image, exercise motivation and social comparison.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92844">Identification and characterization of intermediate states in mammalian neural crest cell epithelial to mesenchymal transition and delamination</a></h4>

              
                Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular process that converts epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells with migratory potential in developmental and pathological processes. Although originally considered a binary event, EMT in cancer progression involves intermediate states between a fully epithelial and a fully mesenchymal phenotype, which are characterized by distinct combinations of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. This phenomenon has been termed epithelial to mesenchymal plasticity (EMP), however, the intermediate states remain poorly described and it’s unclear whether they exist during developmental EMT. Neural crest cells (NCC) are an embryonic progenitor cell population that gives rise to numerous cell types and tissues in vertebrates, and their formation and delamination is a classic example of developmental EMT. However, whether intermediate states also exist during NCC EMT and delamination remains unknown. Through single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse embryos, we identified intermediate NCC states based on their transcriptional signature and then spatially defined their locations in situ in the dorsolateral neuroepithelium. Our results illustrate the importance of cell cycle regulation and functional role for the intermediate stage marker <i>Dlc1</i> in facilitating mammalian cranial NCC delamination and may provide new insights into mechanisms regulating pathological EMP.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89025">Distance and grid-like codes support the navigation of abstract social space in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                People form impressions about others during daily social encounters and infer personality traits from others' behaviors. Such trait inference is thought to rely on two universal dimensions: competence and warmth. These two dimensions can be used to construct a ‘social cognitive map’ organizing massive information obtained from social encounters efficiently. Originating from spatial cognition, the neural codes supporting the representation and navigation of spatial cognitive maps have been widely studied. Recent studies suggest similar neural mechanism subserves the map-like architecture in social cognition as well. Here we investigated how spatial codes operate beyond the physical environment and support the representation and navigation of social cognitive map. We designed a social value space defined by two dimensions of competence and warmth. Behaviorally, participants were able to navigate to a learned location from random starting locations in this abstract social space. At the neural level, we identified the representation of distance in the precuneus, fusiform gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus. We also found partial evidence of grid-like representation patterns in the medial prefrontal cortex and entorhinal cortex. Moreover, the intensity of grid-like response scaled with the performance of navigating in social space and social avoidance trait scores. Our findings suggest a neurocognitive mechanism by which social information can be organized into a structured representation, namely cognitive map and its relevance to social well-being.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83527">A chronic signaling TGFb zebrafish reporter identifies immune response in melanoma</a></h4>

              
                Developmental signaling pathways associated with growth factors such as TGFb are commonly dysregulated in melanoma. Here we identified a human TGFb enhancer specifically activated in melanoma cells treated with TGFB1 ligand. We generated stable transgenic zebrafish with this TGFb Induced Enhancer driving green fluorescent protein (<i>TIE:EGFP</i>). <i>TIE:EGFP</i> was not expressed in normal melanocytes or early melanomas but was expressed in spatially distinct regions of advanced melanomas. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that <i>TIE:EGFP<sup>+</sup></i> melanoma cells down-regulated interferon response while up-regulating a novel set of chronic TGFb target genes. ChIP-sequencing demonstrated that AP-1 factor binding is required for activation of chronic TGFb response. Overexpression of <i>SATB2</i>, a chromatin remodeler associated with tumor spreading, showed activation of TGFb signaling in early melanomas. Confocal imaging and flow cytometric analysis showed that macrophages localize to <i>TIE:EGFP<sup>+</sup></i> regions and preferentially phagocytose <i>TIE:EGFP<sup>+</sup></i> melanoma cells compared to <i>TIE:EGFP<sup>-</sup></i> melanoma cells. This work identifies a TGFb induced immune response and demonstrates the need for the development of chronic TGFb biomarkers to predict patient response to TGFb inhibitors.

">Time-varying synergy/redundancy dominance in the human cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Recent work has emphasized the ubiquity of higher-order interactions in brain function. These interactions can be characterized as being either redundancy or synergy-dominated by the heuristic O-information [1]. Though the O-information can be decomposed into local values to measure the synergy-redundancy dominance at each point in a time series [2] no such analysis of fMRI dynamics has been carried out. Here we analyze the moment-to-moment synergy and redundancy dominance of the fMRI BOLD signal during rest for 95 unrelated subjects. We present results from several interaction sizes. The whole brain is rarely synergy-dominated, with some subjects never experiencing a whole-brain synergistic moment. Randomly sampled subsets of many sizes reveal that subsets that are the most redundancy dominated on average exhibit both the most synergistic and most redundant time points. Exhaustive calculation of the optimally synergistic and optimally redundant triads further emphasizes this finding, with recurrent nodes frequently belonging to a single coherent functional system. We find that when a triad is momentarily synergistic, it is often split between two instantaneously co-fluctuating communities, but is collectively co-fluctuating when it is momentarily redundant. After optimizing for synergy and redundancy in subsets of size five to seventy-five, we show that this effect is consistent across interaction sizes. Additionally, we find notable temporal structure in all optimized redundant and synergistic subsets: higher order redundant and synergistic interactions change smoothly in time and recur more than expected by chance.

">A common neural signature between genetic and environmental risk</a></h4>

              
                Not everyone is equally likely to experience mental illness. What is the contribution of an individuals genetic background, or experiences of childhood adversity, to that likelihood? And how do these dimensions of risk interact at the level of the brain? We investigated the relationship between genetic liability for mental illness, childhood adversity, and cortico-limbic connectivity in a large developmental sample drawn from the ABCD cohort. First, we used Canonical Correlation Analysis to uncover two genetic dimensions of mental health using polygenic risk scores for ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, and Psychosis. The first dimension represented liability for broad psychopathology which positively correlated with adversity, while the second represented neurodevelopmental-specific risk which negatively interacted with adversity. Next, we investigated the cortico-limbic signature of adversity and genetic liability using Partial Least Squares. We found that the neural correlates of adversity broadly mirrored those of genetic liability, with adversity capturing most of the shared variance. These novel findings suggest that genetic and environmental risk overlap in the neural connections that underlie behavioural symptomatology.

">Microglia target synaptic sites early during excitatory circuit disassembly in neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                During development, microglia prune excess synapses to refine neuronal circuits. In neurodegeneration, the role of microglia-mediated synaptic pruning in circuit remodeling and dysfunction is important for developing therapies aimed at modulating microglial function. Here we analyzed the role of microglia in the synapse disassembly of degenerating postsynaptic neurons in the inner retina. After inducing transient intraocular pressure elevation to injure retinal ganglion cells, microglia increase in number, shift to ameboid morphology, and exhibit greater process movement. Furthermore, due to the greater number of microglia, there is increased colocalization of microglia with synaptic components throughout the inner plexiform layer and with excitatory synaptic sites along individual ganglion cell dendrites. Microglia depletion partially restores ganglion cell function, suggesting that microglia activation may be neurotoxic in early neurodegeneration. Our results demonstrate the important role of microglia in synapse disassembly in degenerating circuits, highlighting their recruitment to synaptic sites early after neuronal injury.

">δ-containing GABAA receptors on parvalbumin interneurons modulate neuronal excitability and network dynamics in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                In medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV) interneurons regulate excitability and microcircuit oscillatory activity important for cognition. Although PV interneurons inhibit pyramidal neurons, they themselves express {delta} subunits of GABAA receptors important for slow inhibition. However, the specific contribution of {delta}-containing GABAA receptors to the function of PV interneurons in mPFC is unclear. We explored cellular, synaptic, and local-circuit activity in PV interneurons and pyramidal neurons in mouse mPFC after selectively deleting {delta} subunits in PV interneurons (cKO mice). In current-clamp recordings, cKO PV interneurons exhibited a higher frequency of action potentials and higher input resistance than wild type (WT) PV interneurons. Picrotoxin increased firing and GABA decreased firing in WT PV interneurons but not in cKO PV interneurons. The {delta}-preferring agonist THIP reduced spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in WT pyramidal neurons but not in cKO pyramidal neurons. In WT slices, depolarizing the network with 400 nM kainate increased firing of pyramidal neurons but had little effect on PV interneuron firing. By contrast, in cKO slices kainate recruited PV interneurons at the expense of pyramidal neurons. At the population level, kainate induced broadband increases in local field potentials in WT but not cKO slices. These results on cells and the network can be understood through increased excitability of cKO PV interneurons. In summary, our study demonstrates that {delta}-containing GABAA receptors in mPFC PV interneurons play a crucial role in regulating their excitability and the phasic inhibition of pyramidal neurons, elucidating intricate mechanisms governing cortical circuitry.

">Deep brain stimulation induces white matter remodeling and functional changes to brain-wide networks</a></h4>

              
                Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an emerging therapeutic option for treatment resistant neurological and psychiatric disorders, most notably depression. Despite this, little is known about the anatomical and functional mechanisms that underlie this therapy. Here we targeted stimulation to the white matter adjacent to the subcallosal anterior cingulate cortex (SCC-DBS) in macaques, modeling the location in the brain proven effective for depression. We demonstrate that SCC-DBS has a selective effect on white matter macro- and micro-structure in the cingulum bundle distant to where stimulation was delivered. SCC-DBS also decreased functional connectivity between subcallosal and posterior cingulate cortex, two areas linked by the cingulum bundle and implicated in depression. Our data reveal that white matter remodeling as well as functional effects contribute to DBS's therapeutic efficacy.

">Potassium-selective channelrhodopsins can exert hyper- or depolarizing effects in excitable cells of Caenorhabditis elegans, depending on experimental condition</a></h4>

              
                One of the most frequent applications of optogenetic tools is for depolarization and stimulation of excitable cells such as neurons and muscles. Equally important, but less frequently used, are inhibitory tools that suppress activity through cellular hyperpolarization. These tools often rely on chloride conductance. Yet, in vivo, re- and hyperpolarization is typically mediated by potassium. In recent years, light-gated ion channels with a high preference for potassium were identified (Kalium channelrhodopsins, KCRs), and their inhibitory potential described in different organisms. Here, we characterized HcKCR1 and WiChR, in cholinergic neurons and muscles of Caenorhabditis elegans. Hyperpolarization of these cell types both induces muscle relaxation and, consequently, an elongation of the animals. Thus, we analyzed body length before, during, and after illumination, to assess KCR effectiveness, and to benchmark stimulation parameters like light intensity and duration. For HcKCR1 in cholinergic neurons, continuous illumination at high light intensities (1-4.5 mW/mm) evoked only a transient elongation, while stimulation at 0.1 mW/mm could maintain inhibition for the duration of the stimulus in some transgenic strains. For animals expressing WiChR in body wall muscle cells or cholinergic neurons, we again observed brief hyperpolarization during continuous illumination, however, still during the stimulus, this changed to body contraction, corresponding to depolarization. This effect was long lasting, and required dozens of seconds for reversion, but could be reduced by pulsed illumination and fully avoided by less efficient channel activation using green or orange light. Hence, KCRs can be applied to hyperpolarize C. elegans cells, but require optimized illumination parameters.

">TS-AI: A deep learning pipeline for multimodal subject-specific parcellation with task contrasts synthesis</a></h4>

              
                Accurate mapping of brain functional subregions at an individual level is crucial. Task-based functional MRI (tfMRI) captures subject-specific activation patterns during various functions and behaviors, facilitating the individual localization of functionally distinct subregions. However, acquiring high-quality tfMRI is time-consuming and resource-intensive in both scientific and clinical settings. The present study proposes a two-stage network model, TS-AI, to individualize an atlas on cortical surfaces through the prediction of tfMRI data. TS-AI first synthesizes a battery of task contrast maps for each individual by leveraging tract-wise anatomical connectivity and resting-state networks. These synthesized maps, along with feature maps of tract-wise anatomical connectivity and resting-state networks, are then fed into an end-to-end deep neural network to individualize an atlas. TS-AI enables the synthesized task contrast maps to be used in individual parcellation without the acquisition of actual task fMRI scans. In addition, a novel feature consistency loss is designed to assign vertices with similar features to the same parcel, which increases individual specificity and mitigates overfitting risks caused by the absence of individual parcellation ground truth. The individualized parcellations were validated by assessing test-retest reliability, homogeneity, and cognitive behavior prediction using diverse reference atlases and datasets, demonstrating the superior performance and generalizability of TS-AI. Sensitivity analysis yielded insights into region-specific features influencing individual variation in functional regionalization. In addition, TS-AI identified accelerated shrinkage in the medial temporal and cingulate parcels during the progression of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting its potential in clinical research and applications.

">Is subjective perceptual similarity metacognitive?</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual similarity is a cornerstone for human learning and generalization. However, in assessing the similarity between two stimuli differing in multiple dimensions, it is not well-defined which feature(s) one should focus on. The problem has accordingly been considered ill-posed. We hypothesize that similarity judgments may be, in a sense, metacognitive: The stimuli rated as subjectively similar are those that are in fact more challenging for oneself to discern in practice, in near-threshold settings (e.g., psychophysics experiments). This self-knowledge about one's own perceptual capacities provides a quasi-objective ground truth as to whether two stimuli should be judged as similar. To test this idea, we measure perceptual discrimination capacity between face pairs, and ask subjects to rank the similarity between them. Based on pilot data, we hypothesize a positive association between perceptual discrimination capacity and subjective dissimilarity, with this association being importantly specific to each individual.

                The brain exhibits remarkable neuronal diversity which is critical for its functional integrity. From the sheer number of cell types emerging from extensive transcriptional, morphological, and connectome datasets, the question arises of how the brain is capable of generating so many unique identities. Terminal selectors are transcription factors hypothesized to determine the final identity characteristics in post-mitotic cells. Which transcription factors function as terminal selectors and the level of control they exert over different terminal characteristics are not well defined. Here, we establish a novel role for the transcription factor broad as a terminal selector in Drosophila melanogaster. We capitalize on existing large sequencing and connectomics datasets and employ a comprehensive characterization of terminal characteristics including Perturb-seq and whole-cell electrophysiology. We find a single isoform broad-z4 serves as the switch between the identity of two visual projection neurons LPLC1 and LPLC2. Broad-z4 is natively expressed in LPLC1, and is capable of transforming the transcriptome, morphology, and functional connectivity of LPLC2 cells into LPLC1 cells when perturbed. Our comprehensive work establishes a single isoform as the smallest unit underlying an identity switch, which may serve as a conserved strategy replicated across developmental programs.

">A novel monomeric amyloid β-activated signaling pathway regulates brain development via inhibition of microglia</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) forms aggregates in the Alzheimers disease brain and is well known for its pathological roles. Recent studies show that it also regulates neuronal physiology in the healthy brain. Whether A{beta} also regulates glial physiology in the normal brain, however, has remained unclear. In this article, we describe the discovery of a novel signaling pathway activated by the monomeric form of A{beta} that plays essential roles in the regulation of microglial activity and the assembly of neocortex during development. We find that activation of this pathway depends on the function of amyloid precursor (APP) and heterotrimeric G proteins in microglia and inhibits microglial immune activation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Genetic disruption of this pathway during neocortical development results in microglial dysregulation and excessive matrix proteinase activation, leading to basement membrane degradation, neuronal ectopia, and laminar disruption. These results uncover a previously unknown function of A{beta} as a negative regulator of brain microglia and substantially elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation. Considering the prominence of A{beta} and neuroinflammation in the pathology of Alzheimers disease, they also highlight a potentially overlooked role of A{beta} monomer depletion in the development of the disease.

">Cell- and state-specific plasticity of striatal glutamatergic synapses is critical to the expression of levodopa-induced dyskinesia</a></h4>

              
                Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a debilitating complication of symptomatic therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD). Although there is compelling evidence that striatal pathophysiology is a major driver of LID, the circuit-specific mechanisms contributing to dysfunction remain obscure. This lack of clarity is reflected in the limited options for diminishing established LID. To address this gap, molecular, cellular, and behavioral strategies were used to interrogate striatal indirect pathway spiny projection neurons (iSPNs) in a mouse model of LID. These studies revealed that LID induction led to an upregulation of GluN2B-containing N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) specifically at iSPN glutamatergic synapses. This up-regulation was correlated with increased numbers of "silent" glutamatergic synapses in the hours after levodopa treatment. In this "off-state", long-term potentiation (LTP) of iSPN glutamatergic synapses was readily induced and this induction was blocked by antagonists of adenosine type 2 receptors (A2aRs) or GluN2B-containing NMDARs. Systemic administration of the A2aR antagonist tozedenant at the beginning of the off-state significantly reduced the development of LID. More importantly, specifically knocking down the expression of GRIN2B mRNA in iSPNs dramatically attenuated both development and expression of LID, without compromising the beneficial effects of levodopa on movement. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that dyskinesiogenic doses of levodopa trigger cell-specific synaptic adaptations during the off-state that make an important contribution to the network pathophysiology underlying LID and suggest that targeting GluN2B-containing NMDARs in iSPNs could be therapeutically useful.

                In this study, we investigated the role of 17-estradiol in lifespan extension and its potential side effects for long-term administration. Pooled hypothalami from aged male Norway brown rats treated with 17-estradiol (O.T), aged male controls (O), and young male controls (Y) were subjected to single-nucleus transcriptomic sequencing (snRNA-seq). To evaluate the effects of 17-estradiol in anti-aging in neurons, supervised clustering on neurons by neuropeptides and their receptors were used to evaluate the responses of each neuron subtype during aging and after 17-estradiol treatment. The elevated cellular metabolism, stresses and decreased synaptic activity in neurons initiated by aging were remarkably attenuated by 17-estradiol. Assessment of changes in neuron populations showed that neurons related to food intake, reproduction, blood pressure, stress response and electrolyte balance were sensitive to 17-estradiol treatment. 17-estradiol treatment not only increased Oxytocin (Oxt), but also increased the activity of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, evidenced by significantly elevated levels of plasma Gnrh, bioavailable testosterone, and decreased estradiol. Elevated Gnrh1 was verified to be one of the causal effects mediating the role of 17-estradiol in energy homeostasis, neural synapse, and stress response. Notably, Crh neurons displayed most prominently senescent phenotype among all checked neuron subtypes in O.T, which may be a potential side effect of 17-estradiol treatment. Therefore, HPG axis and energy metabolism may be key targets of 17-estradiol in male lifespan extension. Additionally, supervised clustering of neurons was shown to be a useful method to assess the responses to treatment among different neuron subtypes in the hypothalamus.

">A larval zebrafish model of TBI: Optimizing the dose of neurotrauma for discovery of treatments and aetiology</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are diverse with heterogeneous injury pathologies, which creates challenges for the clinical treatment and prevention of secondary pathologies such as post-traumatic epilepsy and subsequent dementias. To develop pharmacological strategies that treat TBI and prevent complications, animal models must capture the spectrum of TBI severity to better understand pathophysiological events that occur during and after injury. To address such issues, we improved upon our recent larval zebrafish TBI paradigm emphasizing titrating to different injury levels. We observed coordination between an increase in injury level and clinically relevant injury phenotypes including post-traumatic seizures (PTS) and tau aggregation. This preclinical TBI model is simple to implement, allows dosing of injury levels to model diverse pathologies, and can be scaled to medium- or high-throughput screening.

">Detection of latent brain states from baseline neural activity in the amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The amygdala responds to a large variety of socially and emotionally salient environmental and interoceptive stimuli. The context in which these stimuli occur determines their social and emotional significance. In canonical neurophysiological studies, the fast-paced succession of stimuli and events induce phasic changes in neural activity. During inter-trial intervals neural activity is expected to return to a stable and relatively featureless baseline. Context, such as the presence of a social partner, or the similarity of trials in a blocked design, induces brain states that can transcend the fast-paced succession of stimuli and can be recovered from the baseline firing rate of neurons. Indeed, the baseline firing rates of neurons in the amygdala change between blocks of trials of gentle grooming touch, delivered by a trusted social partner, and non-social airflow stimuli, delivered by a computer-controlled air valve. In this experimental paradigm, the presence of the groomer alone was sufficient to induce small but significant changes in baseline firing rates. Here, we examine local field potentials (LFP) recorded during these baseline periods to determine whether context was encoded by network dynamics that emerge in the local field potentials from the activity of large ensembles of neurons. We found that machine learning techniques can reliably decode social vs. non-social context from spectrograms of baseline local field potentials. Notably, decoding accuracy improved significantly with access to broad-band information. No significant differences were detected between the nuclei of the amygdala that receive direct or indirect inputs from areas of the prefrontal cortex known to coordinate flexible, context-dependent behaviors. The lack of nuclear specificity suggests that context-related synaptic inputs arise from a shared source, possibly interoceptive inputs that signal the sympathetic- vs. parasympathetic-dominated states characterizing non-social and social blocks, respectively.

">Deriving connectivity from spiking activity in biophysical cortical microcircuits</a></h4>

              
                Inferring detailed cortical microcircuit connectivity is essential for uncovering how information is processed in the brain. A common method in vivo uses short-lag spike cross-correlations to derive putative monosynaptic connections between pairs of neurons, but previous studies did not address confounds of physiological large-scale networks such as correlated firing and inactive neurons. We tested connectivity derivation methods on ground-truth spiking data from detailed models of human cortical microcircuits in different layers and between key neuron types. We showed that physiological oscillations in the large-scale microcircuits hindered derivation accuracy, which was improved using a shorter cross-correlogram analysis window. We then showed that connection derivation was poor in cortical layer 2/3 microcircuits compared to layer 5, due to low firing rates and inactive neurons. General stimulation strategies for layer 2/3 microcircuits led to only a moderate improvement in derivation performance, due to a trade-off between the proportions of inactive neurons and overactive neurons, indicating the need for more refined strategies. Lastly, we showed that derivation of inhibitory connections from somatostatin interneurons targeting distal dendrites required a longer timescale of cross-correlation lags. Our results identify key physiological challenges and methods to improve accuracy in deriving connections from spiking activity in large-scale neuronal microcircuits.

">Top-Down Modulation of Visual Action Perception: Distinct Task Effects in the Action Observation Network</a></h4>

              
                Perceiving others' actions is essential for survival and social interaction. Cognitive neuroscience research has identified a network of brain regions crucial to visual action perception, known as the Action Observation Network (AON), comprising the posterior superior temporal cortex (pSTS), posterior parietal cortex, and premotor cortex. Recent research highlights the importance of integrating top-down processes, such as attention, to gain a deeper understanding of action perception. This study investigates how attention modulates the AON during human action perception. We conducted a two-session fMRI experiment with 27 participants. They viewed eight videos of pushing actions, varying in actor (female vs. male), effector (hand vs. foot), and target (human vs. object). In the first session, participants focused on specific features of the videos (actor, effector, or target). In the second, they passively viewed the videos. From the passive viewing session data, we defined regions of interest (ROIs) in the pSTS, parietal, and premotor cortices for each hemisphere. We then performed model-based representational similarity analysis (RSA) and decoding analysis. RSA results showed that only the task model, among all tested models, exhibited a significant correlation with neural representational similarity matrices (RDMs) across all ROIs, indicating a specific alignment between AON nodes and the ongoing task. Decoding analysis further showed that different task types uniquely affected each AON node, indicating feature- and region-specific interactions. These findings underscore that top-down attentional processes significantly alter neural representations within the AON, highlighting the dynamic interplay between attention and action perception in the brain.

">Evidence for auditory stimulus-specific adaptation but not deviance detection in larval zebrafish brains</a></h4>

              
                Animals receive a constant stream of sensory input, and detecting changes in this sensory landscape is critical to their survival. One signature of change detection in humans is the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN), a neural response to unexpected stimuli that deviate from a predictable sequence. This process requires the auditory system to adapt to specific repeated stimuli while remaining sensitive to novel input (stimulus-specific adaptation). MMN was originally described in humans, and equivalent responses have been found in other mammals and birds, but it is not known to what extent this deviance detection circuitry is evolutionarily conserved. Here we present the first evidence for stimulus-specific adaptation in the brain of a teleost fish, using whole-brain calcium imaging of larval zebrafish at single-neuron resolution with selective plane illumination microscopy. We found frequency-specific responses across the brain with variable response amplitudes for frequencies of the same volume, and created a loudness curve to model this effect. We presented an auditory 'oddball' stimulus in an otherwise predictable train of pure tone stimuli, and did not find a population of neurons with specific responses to deviant tones that were not otherwise explained by stimulus-specific adaptation. Further, we observed no deviance responses to an unexpected omission of a sound in a repetitive sequence of white noise bursts. These findings extend the known scope of auditory adaptation and deviance responses across the evolutionary tree, and lay groundwork for future studies to describe the circuitry underlying auditory adaptation at the level of individual neurons.

">FINCA disease mouse model exhibits altered behaviour and immune response</a></h4>

              
                Fibrosis, neurodegeneration and cerebral angiomatosis (FINCA) is a childhood-onset multi-organ neurodevelopmental disorder associated with multi-organ manifestations and recurrent infections. The disease is caused by variants in NHLRC2 initiating a cascade of unknown pathological events. Previously, we have demonstrated that despite the significant decrease at the molecular level, the compound heterozygosity of knock out and p.Asp148Tyr alleles in NHLRC2 does not lead to a severe phenotype in mice. Here, we analysed the behavioural and immunological phenotype of the FINCA mice and studied the molecular pathways affected by p.Asp148Tyr in NHLRC2 using mouse and human-derived cell culture models. The FINCA mice displayed a mild hyperactivity and deficient early immune response when challenged with LPS leading to altered cytokine responses, including IFN{gamma}, IL-12, and TNF. By comparing gene expression and putative interaction partners affected by p.Asp148Tyr , we identified Rho GTPase signalling as the common pathway. Altogether, these results establish a multi-dimensional impact of the p.Asp148Tyr variant in NHLRC2. Knowledge of the molecular pathways affected by NHLRC2 and the natural course of FINCA disease progression are instrumental for the development of effective therapeutics.

">Disruption of sustained attention and orbitofrontal cortex engagement by incoming social media messages vary as a function of problematic social media use</a></h4>

              
                Background Smartphones and social media have become ubiquitous in our lives, and while debates about their negative impact on mental health, addictive potential, and disruptive effects on daily activities have surged, neurobiological evidence remains scarce. Here, we investigated whether the behavioral and neural effects of interference of continuous attention by incoming social media messages on WeChat varies according to its problematic use as assessed via an addiction framework. Methods N = 60 healthy individuals were stratified based on their level of problematic WeChat usage as measured by the WeChat Addiction Scale (WAS): LOW (15 males and 15 females) and HIGH (15 males and 15 females) addictive tendencies. Participants underwent an AX-Continuous Performance Task (AX-CPT) with WeChat-associated (incoming message) and neutral auditory distractors as well as a no distractor condition. Concurrent functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) assessments of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were implemented to determine the underlying neurofunctional mechanisms. Results On the behavioral level the HIGH group demonstrated faster reaction times during the WeChat and no distractor condition compared to the LOW group. Exploratory analyses indicated that the WeChat distraction decreased left lateral OFC activity in the LOW but enhanced activity in this region in the HIGH group. Conclusion Against our hypotheses WeChat distraction enhanced behavioral performance specially in individual with a tendency for problematic WeChat use, with the neural data pointing to less suppression of the OFC in individuals with a tendency for problematic usage. Findings underscore the complexity of the potential effects of new technology on daily live and indicate that addiction models might not be simply extendable to problematic social media usage.

">The impact of heterogeneous spatial autocorrelation on comparisons of brain maps</a></h4>

              
                It is increasingly common to statistically compare macroscopic brain maps to assess how spatially similar they are. Due to the presence of spatial autocorrelation, statistical inference can be challenging; to address this, random permutation approaches based on null models are widely used. Here, we show how that the presence of heterogeneity in the spatial autocorrelation across brain maps may affect statistical inference in common approaches for spatially correlated maps. In response, we highlight the need to explicitly model spatial processes, including non-stationarity , for more accurate statistical inference. We illustrate how a Bayesian spatial regression approach can be applied to compare functional and structural cortical brain maps, even in the presence of heterogeneity. By explicitly modelling spatial processes underlying the data, a much wider and more sophisticated range of neurobiological questions can be answered about the relationship between brain maps than with current approaches.

                Music-based interventions are a common feature in long-term care with clinical reports highlighting music's ability to engage individuals with complex diagnoses. While these findings are promising, normative findings from healthy controls are needed to disambiguate treatment effects unique to pathology and those seen in healthy aging. The present study examines brain network dynamics during music listening in a sample of healthy older adults before and after a music-based intervention. We found intervention effects from hidden Markov model-estimated fMRI network data. Following the intervention, participants demonstrated greater occupancy (the amount of time a network was occupied) in a temporal-mesolimbic network. We conclude that network dynamics in healthy older adults are sensitive to music-based interventions. We discuss these findings' implications for future studies with individuals with neurodegeneration.

">Individual differences distinguish mechanisms underlying contextual size illusions</a></h4>

              
                Previous research suggests the magnitudes of the Ebbinghaus, Delboeuf, Ponzo, and tilt illusion all depend on the cortical distance between the neural representations of target stimuli and the surrounding context. However, several psychophysical studies found no compelling association between these illusions, calling this hypothesis into question. Here we ask if these discrepant reports could arise from methodological differences between these studies. We ran a battery of visual size illusion and basic discrimination tasks with carefully matched geometric properties, using a classical forced choice design. Ebbinghaus and Delboeuf illusion magnitudes are strongly correlated, consistent with the idea that they reflect the same underlying mechanism. Ponzo illusion magnitude also correlates with these two illusions, despite to a lesser extent, indicative that both shared and independent factors govern these illusions. Interestingly, the classical arrowhead version of the Mueller-Lyer illusion does not correlate with any of the other illusions or the ability to discriminate line length. This suggests that an altogether separate process underlies this perceptual effect. We further demonstrate that presenting stimuli briefly with central fixation critically affects measurements of the Ebbinghaus illusion. Taken together, our findings therefore highlight the importance of experimental parameters when probing relationships between perceptual effects and their links to neural processing.

">Early Developmental Origins of Cortical Disorders Modeled in Human Neural Stem Cells</a></h4>

              
                The implications of the early phases of human telencephalic development, involving neural stem cells (NSCs), in the etiology of cortical disorders remain elusive. Here, we explored the expression dynamics of cortical and neuropsychiatric disorder-associated genes in datasets generated from human NSCs across telencephalic fate transitions in vitro and in vivo. We identified risk genes expressed in brain organizers and sequential gene regulatory networks across corticogenesis revealing disease-specific critical phases, when NSCs are more vulnerable to gene dysfunctions, and converging signaling across multiple diseases. Moreover, we simulated the impact of risk transcription factor (TF) depletions on different neural cell types spanning the developing human neocortex and observed a spatiotemporal-dependent effect for each perturbation. Finally, single-cell transcriptomics of newly generated autism-affected patient-derived NSCs in vitro revealed recurrent alterations of TFs orchestrating brain patterning and NSC lineage commitment. This work opens new perspectives to explore human brain dysfunctions at the early phases of development.

">Frontal Cortex Hyperactivation and Gamma Desynchrony in Fragile X Syndrome: Correlates of Auditory Hypersensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an X-linked disorder that often leads to intellectual disability, anxiety, and sensory hypersensitivity. While sound sensitivity (hyperacusis) is a distressing symptom in FXS, its neural basis is not well understood. It is postulated that hyperacusis may stem from temporal lobe hyperexcitability or dysregulation in topdown modulation. Studying the neural mechanisms underlying sound sensitivity in FXS using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) is challenging because the temporal and frontal regions have overlapping neural projections that are difficult to differentiate. To overcome this challenge, we conducted EEG source analysis on a group of 36 individuals with FXS and 39 matched healthy controls. Our goal was to characterize the spatial and temporal properties of the response to an auditory chirp stimulus. Our results showed that males with FXS exhibit excessive activation in the frontal cortex in response to the stimulus onset, which may reflect changes in top-down modulation of auditory processing. Additionally, during the chirp stimulus, individuals with FXS demonstrated a reduction in typical gamma phase synchrony, along with an increase in asynchronous gamma power, across multiple regions, most strongly in temporal cortex. Consistent with these findings, we observed a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio, estimated by the ratio of synchronous to asynchronous gamma activity, in individuals with FXS. Furthermore, this ratio was highly correlated with performance in an auditory attention task. Compared to controls, males with FXS demonstrated elevated bidirectional frontotemporal information flow at chirp onset. The evidence indicates that both temporal lobe hyperexcitability and disruptions in top-down regulation play a role in auditory sensitivity disturbances in FXS. These findings have the potential to guide the development of therapeutic targets and back-translation strategies.

                Studies of the adult mouse brain have benefited from three-dimensional atlases providing a standard frame of reference for data analysis and integration. Extending these resources to the developing mouse brain has been challenging due to the need to integrate time as a dimension of the atlas. To address this, we present the Developmental Mouse Brain Atlas, a four-dimensional atlas encompassing each postnatal day from 4 to 56.

">Peak alpha frequency is not significantly altered by five days of experimental pain and repetitive transcranial stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) holds promise as a non-invasive pain treatment. Given the link between individual peak alpha frequency (PAF) of resting-state electroencephalographic recordings and pain sensitivity, and the potential for rTMS to modulate PAF, we investigated these relationships through a secondary analysis of established rTMS-induced analgesia in an experimental model of sustained muscle pain. In a randomised, single-blind, sham-controlled experiment, 30 healthy adults underwent either active (n=15) or sham (n=15) high-frequency rTMS (20 min) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for five consecutive days following induction of sustained experimental pain by nerve growth factor (NGF) injected into the right extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle. The pain intensity was assessed daily for 14 days on a numerical rating scale (NRS). PAF of the resting state electroencephalography (5 min) was assessed before and one day after the five rTMS treatment days. The pre-registered analysis revealed no significant changes in PAF following five consecutive days of active (from 9.90 +/- 0.39 Hz to 9.95 +/- 0.38 Hz) or sham (from 9.86 +/- 0.44 Hz to 9.81 +/- 0.35 Hz) rTMS, suggesting that the impact of rTMS on NGF-induced pain is independent of PAF modulation. However, exploratory analysis indicated an association between the absolute difference of baseline PAF to 10 Hz (i.e. the rTMS frequency) and higher NRS pain ratings at Day 5 in participants receiving active rTMS. This suggests that rTMS is more efficient when delivered close to the individual PAF and necessitates further exploration of PAF's role in rTMS-induced pain relief.

">Kynurenic acid inflammatory signaling expands in primates and impairs prefrontal cortical cognition</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive deficits from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) dysfunction are common in neuroinflammatory disorders, including long-COVID, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, and have been correlated with kynurenine inflammatory signaling. Kynurenine is further metabolized to kynurenic acid (KYNA) in brain, where it blocks NMDA and 7-nicotinic receptors (nic-7Rs). These receptors are essential for neurotransmission in dlPFC, suggesting that KYNA may cause higher cognitive deficits in these disorders. The current study found that KYNA and its synthetic enzyme, KAT II, have greatly expanded expression in primate dlPFC in both glia and neurons. Local application of KYNA onto dlPFC neurons markedly reduced the delay-related firing needed for working memory via actions at NMDA and nic-7Rs, while inhibition of KAT II enhanced neuronal firing in aged macaques. Systemic administration of agents that reduce KYNA production similarly improved cognitive performance in aged monkeys, suggesting a therapeutic avenue for the treatment of cognitive deficits in neuroinflammatory disorders.

">Cerebrospinal Fluid Dynamics: Uncovering Alternative Blood Vessel Clearance Mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                The pathways that run along the olfactory nerves crossing the cribriform plate and connecting to lymphatic vessels in the nasal cavity, have been identified as a crucial route for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow. However, the presence of a CSF efflux pathway through blood vessels in this region has yet to be clarified. This study aimed to elucidate the anatomical connections between the subarachnoid space and the bloodstream at the nasal epithelium and the venous drainage routes of the nasal epithelium in mice. Our findings demonstrated that CSF tracers could be drained not only through lymphatic vessels in the nasal cavity and cervical lymph nodes (CLNs), but also through the blood vessels in this area that extend to its venous drainage routes, including the facial and jugular veins. Additionally, we showed that ligation of CLNs neither impeded the influx and efflux of CSF tracers nor exacerbated Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathology in AD mice. Our work reveals a previously unrecognized pathway for CSF drainage through blood vessels within the nasal mucosa. These findings provide insight into the efficient removal of waste products, facilitating optimal functioning of neural tissue within the susceptible tissue of our brains.

">Electrophysiology and Morphology of Human Cortical Supragranular Pyramidal Cells in a Wide Age Range</a></h4>

              
                The basic excitatory neurons of the cerebral cortex, the pyramidal cells, are the most important signal integrators for the local circuit. They have quite characteristic morphological and electrophysiological properties that are known to be largely constant with age in the young and adult cortex. However, the brain undergoes several dynamic changes throughout life, such as in the phases of early development and cognitive decline in the aging brain. We set out to search for intrinsic cellular changes in supragranular pyramidal cells across a broad age range: from birth to 85 years of age and we found differences in several biophysical properties between defined age groups. During the first year of life, subthreshold and suprathreshold electrophysiological properties changed in a way that shows that pyramidal cells become less excitable with maturation, but also become temporarily more precise. According to our findings, the morphological features of the three-dimensional reconstructions from different life stages showed consistent morphological properties and systematic dendritic spine analysis of an infantile and an old pyramidal cell showed clear significant differences in the distribution of spine shapes. Overall, the changes that occur during development and aging may have lasting effects on the properties of pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex. Understanding these changes is important to unravel the complex mechanisms underlying brain development, cognition and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

">A sensorimotor-association axis of thalamocortical connection development</a></h4>

              
                Human cortical development follows a sensorimotor-to-association sequence during childhood and adolescence. The brain's capacity to enact this sequence over decades indicates that it relies on intrinsic mechanisms to regulate inter-regional differences in the timing of cortical maturation, yet regulators of human developmental chronology are not well understood. Given evidence from animal models that thalamic axons modulate windows of cortical plasticity, here we evaluate the overarching hypothesis that structural connections between the thalamus and cortex help to coordinate cortical maturational heterochronicity during youth. We first introduce, cortically annotate, and anatomically validate a new atlas of human thalamocortical connections using diffusion tractography. By applying this atlas to three independent youth datasets (ages 8-23 years; total N = 2,676), we reproducibly demonstrate that thalamocortical connections develop along a maturational gradient that aligns with the cortex's sensorimotor-association axis. Associative cortical regions with thalamic connections that take longest to mature exhibit protracted expression of neurochemical, structural, and functional markers indicative of higher circuit plasticity as well as heightened environmental sensitivity. This work highlights a central role for the thalamus in the orchestration of hierarchically organized and environmentally sensitive windows of cortical developmental malleability.

	<p>Objective: To characterize the cognitive profile of long COVID-19 subjects and its possible association with clinical symptoms, emotional disturbance, biomarkers, and disease severity. Methods: We performed a single-center cross-sectional cohort study. Subjects between 20 and 60 years old with confirmed COVID-19 infection were included. The assessment was performed 6 months following hospital or ambulatory discharge. Excluded were those with prior neurocognitive impairment and severe neurological/neuropsychiatric disorders. Demographic and laboratory data were extracted from medical records. Results: Altogether, 108 participants were included, 64 were male (59.25%), and the mean age was 49.10 years. The patients were classified into four groups: non-hospitalized (NH, n = 10), hospitalized without Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or oxygen therapy (HOSPI, n = 21), hospitalized without ICU but with oxygen therapy (OXY, n = 56), and ICU (ICU, n = 21) patients. In total, 38 (35.18%) reported Subjective Cognitive Complaints (SCC). No differences were found considering illness severity between groups. Females had more persistent clinical symptoms and SCC than males. Persistent dyspnea and headache were associated with higher scores in anxiety and depression. Persistent fatigue, anxiety, and depression were associated with worse overall cognition. Conclusions: No cognitive impairment was found regarding the severity of post-COVID-19 infection. SCC was not associated with a worse cognitive performance, but with higher anxiety and depression. Persistent clinical symptoms were frequent independent of illness severity. Fatigue, anxiety, and depression were linked to poorer cognitive function. Tests for attention, processing speed, and executive function were the most sensitive in detecting cognitive changes in these patients.</p>

	<p>High-frequency magnetic stimulation (HFMS) applied directly to the hippocampal slice preparation in vitro induces activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and metaplasticity. In addition, changes in synaptic transmission following HFMS involve the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR). Here, we asked whether a short period of HFMS (5 &amp;amp;times; 10 delta-burst trains, duration of ~1 min) could alter mGluR5-mediated depression at Schaffer collateral&amp;amp;ndash;CA1 synapses in the acute brain slice preparation at 30 min after HFMS. To this end, we obtained field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slopes from Schaffer collateral&amp;amp;ndash;CA1 synapses after HFMS or control. First, we demonstrated that activity-dependent plasticity following HFMS depends on the slice orientation towards the magnetic coil indicating specific ion fluxes induced by magnetic fields. Second, we found that the mGluR5-specific agonist (RS)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine reduced the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slopes in control slices but rather enhanced them in HFMS-treated slices. In contrast, the compound (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine acting at both mGluR1 and mGluR5 reduced fEPSP slopes in both control and HFMS-treated slices. Importantly, the mGluR-dependent effects were independent from the slice-to-coil orientation indicating that asynchronous glutamate release could play a role. We conclude that a short period of HFMS inhibits subsequently evoked mGluR5-dependent depression at Schaffer collateral&amp;amp;ndash;CA1 synapses. This could be relevant for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in psychiatric disorders such as major depression.</p>

	<p>Background: Schizophrenia is a mental disorder affecting approximately 0.32% of the global population, according to the World Health Organization. Antipsychotic medications are used to treat this condition by inhibiting D2 dopamine and 5HT2 serotonin receptors. The selection of the appropriate mode of delivery for these drugs is based on factors such as patient adherence, clinical presentation, and patient preferences. However, additional drivers of treatment selection are required in clinical practice. Mounting evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. NLR, a cost-effective biomarker of inflammation, has increased in several psychiatric conditions and may represent a valid method for studying the inflammatory stage in schizophrenia, relapse, and the first episode of psychosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether there are any variations in NLR values between patients given oral antipsychotics and those given long-acting antipsychotics. Methods: The study included 50 individuals with schizophrenia, either acute or in the follow-up phase. NLR was obtained by calculating the ratio of absolute neutrophil count (cells/&amp;amp;mu;L) and absolute lymphocyte count (cells/&amp;amp;mu;L). Results: Patients on long-acting antipsychotics exhibited significantly lower mean NLR scores (1.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.7) compared to those on oral antipsychotics (2.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.3) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions: NLR appears promising as a neuroinflammatory biomarker. This study reveals significantly lower NLR values in patients on long-acting antipsychotics, which may signify reduced systemic inflammation and improved adherence.</p>

	<p>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is characterized by a weakening of the small- and medium-sized cerebral arteries, as their smooth muscle cells are progressively replaced with acellular amyloid &amp;amp;beta;, increasing vessel fragility and vulnerability to microhemorrhage. In this context, an aberrant overactivation of the complement system would further aggravate this process. The surface protein CD59 protects most cells from complement-induced cytotoxicity, but expression levels can fluctuate due to disease and varying cell types. The degree to which CD59 protects human cerebral vascular smooth muscle (HCSM) cells from complement-induced cytotoxicity has not yet been determined. To address this shortcoming, we selectively blocked the activity of HCSM-expressed CD59 with an antibody, and challenged the cells with complement, then measured cellular viability. Unblocked HCSM cells proved resistant to all tested concentrations of complement, and this resistance decreased progressively with increasing concentrations of anti-CD59 antibody. Complete CD59 blockage, however, did not result in a total loss of cellular viability, suggesting that additional factors may have some protective functions. Taken together, this implies that CD59 plays a predominant role in HCSM cellular protection against complement-induced cytotoxicity. The overexpression of CD59 could be an effective means of protecting these cells from excessive complement system activity, with consequent reductions in the incidence of microhemorrhage. The precise extent to which cellular repair mechanisms and other complement repair proteins contribute to this resistance has yet to be fully elucidated.</p>

	<p>This review aims to analyze the current literature to identify articles related to the role of nurses and, in general, the nursing management of patients suffering from medication overuse headache (MOH), a globally spread disease. We specifically argue for non-pharmacological approaches to pain management, such as multidisciplinary team approaches, holistic treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy and exercise. For this review, we investigated international scientific databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and Embase, in the period between 2000 and 2024. We observed a wealth of scientific articles related to MOH, but a poverty of articles relating to the nursing management of headache. The research included the presence of academic-level training for nurses, whereas there are few institutions that train competent professionals in both pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of MOH patients. Nursing assessment and assistance strategies are indicated to plan tailored treatment paths related to the specific needs of these patients.</p>

	<p>People seeking asylum are susceptible to head injury (HI) due to exposure to various forms of violence including war, torture, or interpersonal violence. Yet, the extents to which clinicians assess HI, and if so, what the associated characteristics are, are not well known. We analyzed 200 U.S.-based medico-legal affidavits using descriptive, multivariate regression, and thematic analysis. Head injury was documented in 38% of affidavits. Those who experienced physical violence were eight times likelier to experience HI than those who did not experience physical violence. Five themes emerged: (1) HI occurred commonly in the context of interpersonal violence (44%), followed by militarized violence (33%); (2) mechanisms of HI included direct blows to the head and asphyxiation, suggesting potential for both traumatic brain injury and brain injury from oxygen deprivation; (3) HI was often recurrent and concurrent with other physical injuries; (4) co-morbid psychiatric and post-concussive symptoms made it challenging to assess neurological and psychiatric etiologies; and (5) overall, there was a paucity of assessments and documentation of HI and sequelae. Among individuals assessed for asylum claims, HI is common, often recurrent, occurring in the context of interpersonal violence, and concurrent with psychological and other physical trauma. Physical violence is an important risk factor for HI, which should be assessed when physical violence is reported.</p>

	<p>Palatine and pharyngeal tonsil hypertrophy may lead to dysfunction of the auditory tube due to a propensity for infection, potentially giving rise to otitis media. This is a quantitative and longitudinal study, developed from 2019 to 2021, at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP). The studied sample comprised 15 participants aged 5 to 12 years (mean 7.9 years), 12 male and 3 female, arranged into two groups: children diagnosed with pharyngeal and/or palatine tonsil hypertrophy who were candidates for surgery (G1), and children who were later evaluated after surgery (G2). As part of the test, an otoscopy and measurements of logoaudiometry, pure-tone threshold audiometry, wideband tympanometry (ambient and peak pressure), and otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs and DPOAEs, both at ambient and peak pressure) were all performed. There were statistically significant differences between phases in pure-tone audiometry, in terms of 226 Hz tympanometry, wideband tympanometry in peak pressure conditions, in the amplitude measurement TEOAEs in both pressure conditions, in DPOAEs in ambient pressure conditions, and in the signal/noise measurement in both pressures in DPOAEs. Overall, it was found that hearing tests were different for subjects with palatine and pharyngeal tonsil hypertrophy compared to the post-surgical group.</p>

                Background Climate change, largely triggered by human-induced greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, seems unstoppable. There was a strong rebound of anthropogenic emissions of CO2, the preponderant GHG in terms of contribution to global warming, around the world after the COVID-19 lockdown. Also, there is still no widely accepted international treaty on curbing the anthropogenic emissions of CH4 and N2O, the second and third predominant GHG, respectively, so far. Thereby, prima facie, in respect to mitigating climate change, currently, humans have no aces up their sleeves. It seems that current temperature rise is not high enough to take alarm until the occurrence of tipping point. Policy Climate-related international treaties, such as 2016 Paris agreement, are compromises among conflicting geopolitical pressures. However, currently, the climate treaties show little mandatory binding force on the signatories who are able to violate and then get off scot-free, thus may end up like a nostrum. Throughout the European history, I find that the only way, if at all, to achieve the peace or obedience of a treaty is via balancing powers, embodied in Bismarck’s Realpolitik of Germany and Richelieu’s Raison d'état of France. Similarly, the Chinese history in East Asia proved the significance of unadulterated ideological neutrality and Darwinian adaptability in the kaleidoscope of evolving circumstances in maintaining order and enforcement of international treaties through balancing the power of rivalries to constrain ever-recurring challengers for equilibrium. Recommendations A successful policy needs to make a thorough analysis of all relevant factors to form a long-term strategic notion. Then, statesmen need to distill an array of nebulous, always contradictory options into a tenacious, controllable direction. Thereby, I suggest that, for better curbing global warming, climate agreements or climate club be incorporated into an overall geopolitical framework among the international communities.

                Background This study delves into the cultural portrayal of teachers in Vietnam, a subject critical to understanding the broader role of educators in shaping societal and educational values. Through an analysis of song lyrics, the research aims to uncover how the professional identity of teachers is reflected and shaped within the unique cultural context of Vietnam. Methods A qualitative approach underpins this study, utilizing theoretical frameworks such as Constructivist Grounded Theory, Sociocultural Theory, Symbolic Interactionism, and Hermeneutic Phenomenology. Twelve Vietnamese songs specifically about teachers were selected for analysis. These songs were carefully chosen to provide a diverse and representative sample of the cultural portrayal of teachers in Vietnam. The project spanned from January 1st until February 21st, 2024. Results The analysis revealed several key themes that collectively characterize the professional identity of Vietnamese teachers. These include ‘Sacrifice and Dedication,’ highlighting the commitment and perseverance of teachers; ‘Respect and Reverence,’ reflecting the deep societal respect for the teaching profession; ‘Nurturing and Inspiration,’ depicting teachers as cultivators of dreams and moral values; ‘Enduring Impact and Memory,’ emphasizing the long-lasting influence of teachers on their students; ‘Teacher as a Guiding Figure,’ portraying the role of teachers as key moral and cultural guides; and ‘Emotional Connection and Affection,’ underlining the deep emotional bonds between teachers and students. Conclusions The study’s findings underscore the significant role of cultural and emotional factors in shaping the professional identity of teachers in Vietnam. These themes highlight the multifaceted role of teachers that transcends academic teaching, involving personal development, cultural transmission, and emotional nurturing. The implications of these findings are far-reaching, suggesting that educational policies and teacher education programs need to consider these cultural and emotional dimensions. Additionally, the study highlights the power of cultural artifacts, like music, in reflecting and shaping societal values and professional identities.

                Introduction Cervical cancer is a significant global health concern, especially in low- and middle-income countries with limited access to preventive healthcare. India’s vast rural population amplifies the challenge, demanding immediate action. Despite advancements, cervical cancer remains prevalent among underserved rural communities, hindered by barriers to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) screening uptake, including socioeconomic and financial constraints. This study aims to evaluate the economic challenges encountered by rural women when accessing HPV screening. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1502 women aged 30 to 45 in Pondicherry, India, utilizing the Andersen Model as a conceptual framework. Household questionnaires gathered data on HPV screening expenses, including patient travel costs, productivity loss, and companion costs. The analysis utilized regression models, to identify the factors impacting the economic challenges associated with accessing HPV screening. Results Employment status and higher education significantly increase total costs by 73.483 (p < 0.001) and 90.169 units (p < 0.001) respectively. Income level, though with a minimal coefficient (B = 0.000), shows a significant effect (p = 0.019) on total costs. Longer travel hours raise costs by 5.129 units (p < 0.001), while having a companion increases costs by 106.095 units (p = 0.004). Prolonged patient time at Primary Health Center (PHC) contributes to a 2.357-unit increase in costs (p < 0.001). Conclusions The study highlights the multifaceted economic challenges faced by rural populations accessing HPV screening for cervical cancer prevention in India. Notwithstanding diverse demographics and varying proximity to healthcare facilities, individuals encounter significant barriers such as travel time and associated costs. Addressing these challenges necessitates targeted interventions to reduce socioeconomic disparities and improve healthcare accessibility for vulnerable populations, thereby advancing cervical cancer prevention efforts and promoting health equity in rural communities.

                Objectives The primary objective of this systematic review was to identify the optimal timing for immunizing pregnant women to confer the most protection by reducing the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza or influenza-like illness in infants less than 6 months of age. Currently, there are gaps in research regarding the timing of administration during the gestational period to provide maximum immunogenicity to the infant. The research question being addressed is: ‘When considering immunization of pregnant mothers with the influenza vaccine, implementing a vaccination program during which trimester in pregnancy would optimize benefits for infants less than 6 months of age in terms of the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness?’ Design Systematic review/Meta-analysis Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCT’s) and observational studies comparing health outcomes of infants and children up to 6 months of age born to women who received inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy with mothers who did not receive the vaccine or received a control vaccine. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed influenza infection in infants. Secondary outcome measures included influenza –like illness diagnosed by a clinician and acute respiratory illness. Results 7 studies were included: 2 primary RCT’s and 5 observational studies (prospective and retrospective cohort studies).5 of the 7 studies were suitable to be included in the quantitative synthesis part and and were compared. Forrest plot analysis revealed that vaccinating pregnant mothers in the second and third trimester when compared with any trimester (1,2 and 3) (OR 0.18 vs. 0.65) conferred less protection, promoting vaccination in the first trimester. Conclusions Vaccinating pregnant mothers in the first trimester conferred greater protection to infants than any other trimester.

                A common outcome of analysing RNA-Seq data is the detection of biological pathways with significantly altered activity between the conditions under investigation. Whilst many strategies test for over-representation of genes, showing changed expression within pre-defined gene-sets, these analyses typically do not account for gene-gene interactions encoded by pathway topologies, and are not able to directly predict the directional change of pathway activity. To address these issues we have developed sSNAPPY,now available as an R/Bioconductor package, which leverages pathway topology information to compute pathway perturbation scores and predict the direction of change across a set of pathways. Here, we demonstrate the use of sSNAPPY by applying the method to public scRNA-seq data, derived from ovarian cancer patient tissues collected before and after chemotherapy. Not only were we able to predict the direction of pathway perturbations discussed in the original study, but sSNAPPY was also able to detect significant changes of other biological processes, yielding far greater insight into the response to treatment. sSNAPPY represents a novel pathway analysis strategy that takes into consideration pathway topology to predict impacted biology pathways, both within related samples and across treatment groups. In addition to not relying on differentially expressed genes, the method and associated R package offers important flexibility and provides powerful visualisation tools.

Small populations (e.g., hospitals, schools or workplaces) are characterised by high contact heterogeneity and stochasticity affecting pathogen transmission dynamics. Empirical individual contact data provide unprecedented information to characterize such heterogeneity and are increasingly available, but are usually collected over a limited period, and can suffer from observation bias. We propose an algorithm to stochastically reconstruct realistic temporal networks from individual contact data in healthcare settings (HCS) and test this approach using real data previously collected in a long-term care facility (LTCF). Our algorithm generates full networks from recorded close-proximity interactions, using hourly inter-individual contact rates and information on individuals’ wards, the categories of staff involved in contacts, and the frequency of recurring contacts. It also provides data augmentation by reconstructing contacts for days when some individuals are present in the HCS without having contacts recorded in the empirical data. Recording bias is formalized through an observation model, to allow direct comparison between the augmented and observed networks. We validate our algorithm using data collected during the i-Bird study, and compare the empirical and reconstructed networks. The algorithm was substantially more accurate to reproduce network characteristics than random graphs. The reconstructed networks reproduced well the assortativity by ward (first–third quartiles observed: 0.54–0.64; synthetic: 0.52–0.64) and the hourly staff and patient contact patterns. Importantly, the observed temporal correlation was also well reproduced (0.39–0.50 vs 0.37–0.44), indicating that our algorithm could recreate a realistic temporal structure. The algorithm consistently recreated unobserved contacts to generate full reconstructed networks for the LTCF. To conclude, we propose an approach to generate realistic temporal contact networks and reconstruct unobserved contacts from summary statistics computed using individual-level interaction networks. This could be applied and extended to generate contact networks to other HCS using limited empirical data, to subsequently inform individual-based epidemic models.

                <p>by Jente Willaert, Kaat Desloovere, Anja Van Campenhout, Lena H. Ting, Friedl De Groote</p>

Balance impairments are common in cerebral palsy. When balance is perturbed by backward support surface translations, children with cerebral palsy have increased co-activation of the plantar flexors and tibialis anterior muscle as compared to typically developing children. However, it is unclear whether increased muscle co-activation is a compensation strategy to improve balance control or is a consequence of reduced reciprocal inhibition. During translational perturbations, increased joint stiffness due to co-activation might aid balance control by resisting movement of the body with respect to the feet. In contrast, during rotational perturbations, increased joint stiffness will hinder balance control as it couples body to platform rotation. Therefore, we expect increased muscle co-activation in response to rotational perturbations if co-activation is caused by reduced reciprocal inhibition but not if it is merely a compensation strategy. We perturbed standing balance by combined backward translational and toe-up rotational perturbations in 20 children with CP and 20 TD children. Perturbations induced forward followed by backward movement of the center of mass. We evaluated reactive muscle activity and the relation between center of mass movement and reactive muscle activity using a linear feedback model based on center of mass kinematics. In typically developing children, perturbations induced plantar flexor balance correcting muscle activity followed by tibialis anterior balance correcting muscle activity, which was driven by center of mass movement. In children with cerebral palsy, the switch from plantar flexor to tibialis anterior activity was less pronounced than in typically developing children due to increased muscle co-activation of the plantar flexors and tibialis anterior throughout the response. Our results thus suggest that a reduction in reciprocal inhibition causes muscle co-activation in reactive standing balance in children with CP.

                <p>by Seoyoung Ahn, Hossein Adeli, Gregory J. Zelinsky</p>

Humans are extremely robust in our ability to perceive and recognize objects—we see faces in tea stains and can recognize friends on dark streets. Yet, neurocomputational models of primate object recognition have focused on the initial feed-forward pass of processing through the ventral stream and less on the top-down feedback that likely underlies robust object perception and recognition. Aligned with the generative approach, we propose that the visual system actively facilitates recognition by reconstructing the object hypothesized to be in the image. Top-down attention then uses this reconstruction as a template to bias feedforward processing to align with the most plausible object hypothesis. Building on auto-encoder neural networks, our model makes detailed hypotheses about the appearance and location of the candidate objects in the image by reconstructing a complete object representation from potentially incomplete visual input due to noise and occlusion. The model then leverages the best object reconstruction, measured by reconstruction error, to direct the bottom-up process of selectively routing low-level features, a top-down biasing that captures a core function of attention. We evaluated our model using the MNIST-C (handwritten digits under corruptions) and ImageNet-C (real-world objects under corruptions) datasets. Not only did our model achieve superior performance on these challenging tasks designed to approximate real-world noise and occlusion viewing conditions, but also better accounted for human behavioral reaction times and error patterns than a standard feedforward Convolutional Neural Network. Our model suggests that a complete understanding of object perception and recognition requires integrating top-down and attention feedback, which we propose is an object reconstruction.

                <p>by Benjamin V. Ineichen, Eva Furrer, Servan L. Grüninger, Wolfgang E. Zürrer, Malcolm R. Macleod</p>

There is an ongoing debate about the value of animal experiments to inform medical practice, yet there are limited data on how well therapies developed in animal studies translate to humans. We aimed to assess 2 measures of translation across various biomedical fields: (1) The proportion of therapies which transition from animal studies to human application, including involved timeframes; and (2) the consistency between animal and human study results. Thus, we conducted an umbrella review, including English systematic reviews that evaluated the translation of therapies from animals to humans. Medline, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched from inception until August 1, 2023. We assessed the proportion of therapeutic interventions advancing to any human study, a randomized controlled trial (RCT), and regulatory approval. We meta-analyzed the concordance between animal and human studies. The risk of bias was probed using a 10-item checklist for systematic reviews. We included 122 articles, describing 54 distinct human diseases and 367 therapeutic interventions. Neurological diseases were the focus of 32% of reviews. The overall proportion of therapies progressing from animal studies was 50% to human studies, 40% to RCTs, and 5% to regulatory approval. Notably, our meta-analysis showed an 86% concordance between positive results in animal and clinical studies. The median transition times from animal studies were 5, 7, and 10 years to reach any human study, an RCT, and regulatory approval, respectively. We conclude that, contrary to widespread assertions, the rate of successful animal-to-human translation may be higher than previously reported. Nonetheless, the low rate of final approval indicates potential deficiencies in the design of both animal studies and early clinical trials. To ameliorate the efficacy of translating therapies from bench to bedside, we advocate for enhanced study design robustness and the reinforcement of generalizability.

                <p>by Annafrancesca Rigato, Huicheng Meng, Claire Chardes, Adam Runions, Faris Abouakil, Richard S. Smith, Loïc LeGoff</p>

The polygonal shape of cells in proliferating epithelia is a result of the tensile forces of the cytoskeletal cortex and packing geometry set by the cell cycle. In the larval <i>Drosophila</i> epidermis, two cell populations, histoblasts and larval epithelial cells, compete for space as they grow on a limited body surface. They do so in the absence of cell divisions. We report a striking morphological transition of histoblasts during larval development, where they change from a tensed network configuration with straight cell outlines at the level of adherens junctions to a highly folded morphology. The apical surface of histoblasts shrinks while their growing adherens junctions fold, forming deep lobules. Volume increase of growing histoblasts is accommodated basally, compensating for the shrinking apical area. The folded geometry of apical junctions resembles elastic buckling, and we show that the imbalance between the shrinkage of the apical domain of histoblasts and the continuous growth of junctions triggers buckling. Our model is supported by laser dissections and optical tweezer experiments together with computer simulations. Our analysis pinpoints the ability of histoblasts to store mechanical energy to a much greater extent than most other epithelial cell types investigated so far, while retaining the ability to dissipate stress on the hours time scale. Finally, we propose a possible mechanism for size regulation of histoblast apical size through the lateral pressure of the epidermis, driven by the growth of cells on a limited surface. Buckling effectively compacts histoblasts at their apical plane and may serve to avoid physical harm to these adult epidermis precursors during larval life. Our work indicates that in growing nondividing cells, compressive forces, instead of tension, may drive cell morphology.

                <p>by Bianca A. Schuster, Sophie Sowden, Alicia J. Rybicki, Dagmar S. Fraser, Clare Press, Lydia Hickman, Peter Holland, Jennifer L. Cook</p>

Difficulties in reasoning about others’ mental states (i.e., mentalising/Theory of Mind) are highly prevalent among disorders featuring dopamine dysfunctions (e.g., Parkinson’s disease) and significantly affect individuals’ quality of life. However, due to multiple confounding factors inherent to existing patient studies, currently little is known about whether these sociocognitive symptoms originate from aberrant dopamine signalling or from psychosocial changes unrelated to dopamine. The present study, therefore, investigated the role of dopamine in modulating mentalising in a sample of healthy volunteers. We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled procedure to test the effect of the D2/D3 antagonist haloperidol on mental state attribution, using an adaptation of the Heider and Simmel (1944) animations task. On 2 separate days, once after receiving 2.5 mg haloperidol and once after receiving placebo, 33 healthy adult participants viewed and labelled short videos of 2 triangles depicting mental state (involving mentalistic interaction wherein 1 triangle intends to cause or act upon a particular mental state in the other, e.g., surprising) and non-mental state (involving reciprocal interaction without the intention to cause/act upon the other triangle’s mental state, e.g., following) interactions. Using Bayesian mixed effects models, we observed that haloperidol decreased accuracy in labelling both mental and non-mental state animations. Our secondary analyses suggest that dopamine modulates inference from mental and non-mental state animations via independent mechanisms, pointing towards 2 putative pathways underlying the dopaminergic modulation of <i>mental</i> state attribution: action representation and a shared mechanism supporting mentalising and emotion recognition. We conclude that dopaminergic pathways impact Theory of Mind, at least indirectly. Our results have implications for the neurochemical basis of sociocognitive difficulties in patients with dopamine dysfunctions and generate new hypotheses about the specific dopamine-mediated mechanisms underlying social cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95209">A microRNA that controls the emergence of embryonic movement</a></h4>

              
                Movement is a key feature of animal systems, yet its embryonic origins are not fully understood. Here, we investigate the genetic basis underlying the embryonic onset of movement in <i>Drosophila</i> focusing on the role played by small non-coding RNAs (microRNAs, miRNAs). To this end, we first develop a quantitative behavioural pipeline capable of tracking embryonic movement in large populations of fly embryos, and using this system, discover that the <i>Drosophila</i> miRNA <i>miR-2b-1</i> plays a role in the emergence of movement. Through the combination of spectral analysis of embryonic motor patterns, cell sorting and RNA in situs, genetic reconstitution tests, and neural optical imaging we define that miR-2b-1 influences the emergence of embryonic movement by exerting actions in the developing nervous system. Furthermore, through the combination of bioinformatics coupled to genetic manipulation of miRNA expression and phenocopy tests we identify a previously uncharacterised (but evolutionarily conserved) chloride channel encoding gene – which we term <i><span class="underline">Mo</span>vement Modula<span class="underline">tor</span></i> (<i>Motor</i>) – as a genetic target that mechanistically links <i>miR-2b-1</i> to the onset of movement. Cell-specific genetic reconstitution of <i>miR-2b-1</i> expression in a null miRNA mutant background, followed by behavioural assays and target gene analyses, suggest that <i>miR-2b-1</i> affects the emergence of movement through effects in sensory elements of the embryonic circuitry, rather than in the motor domain. Our work thus reports the first miRNA system capable of regulating embryonic movement, suggesting that other miRNAs are likely to play a role in this key developmental process in <i>Drosophila</i> as well as in other species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89004">Sex-biased regulatory changes in the placenta of native highlanders contribute to adaptive fetal development</a></h4>

              
                Compared with lowlander migrants, native Tibetans have a higher reproductive success at high altitude though the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we compared the transcriptome and histology of full-term placentas between native Tibetans and Han migrants. We found that the placental trophoblast shows the largest expression divergence between Tibetans and Han, and Tibetans show decreased immune response and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Remarkably, we detected a sex-biased expression divergence, where the male-infant placentas show a greater between-population difference than the female-infant placentas. The umbilical cord plays a key role in the sex-biased expression divergence, which is associated with the higher birth weight of the male newborns of Tibetans. We also identified adaptive histological changes in the male-infant placentas of Tibetans, including larger umbilical artery wall and umbilical artery intima and media, and fewer syncytial knots. These findings provide valuable insights into the sex-biased adaptation of human populations, with significant implications for medical and genetic studies of human reproduction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97902">A CDK1 phosphorylation site on Drosophila PAR-3 regulates neuroblast polarisation and sensory organ formation</a></h4>

              
                The generation of distinct cell fates during development depends on asymmetric cell division of progenitor cells. In the central and peripheral nervous system of <i>Drosophila</i>, progenitor cells respectively called neuroblasts or sensory organ precursors use PAR polarity during mitosis to control cell fate determination in their daughter cells. How polarity and the cell cycle are coupled, and how the cell cycle machinery regulates PAR protein function and cell fate determination is poorly understood. Here, we generate an analog sensitive allele of CDK1 and reveal that its partial inhibition weakens but does not abolish apical polarity in embryonic and larval neuroblasts and leads to defects in polarisation of fate determinants. We describe a novel <i>in vivo</i> phosphorylation of Bazooka, the <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of PAR-3, on Serine180, a consensus CDK phosphorylation site. In some tissular contexts, phosphorylation of Serine180 occurs in asymmetrically dividing cells but not in their symmetrically dividing neighbours. In neuroblasts, Serine180 phosphomutants disrupt the timing of basal polarisation. Serine180 phosphomutants also affect the specification and binary cell fate determination of sensory organ precursors as well as Baz localisation during their asymmetric cell divisions. Finally, we show that CDK1 phosphorylates Serine-S180 and an equivalent Serine on human PAR-3 <i>in vitro</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87297">Brain age has limited utility as a biomarker for capturing fluid cognition in older individuals</a></h4>

              
                One well-known biomarker candidate that supposedly helps capture fluid cognition is Brain Age, or a predicted value based on machine-learning models built to predict chronological age from brain MRI. To formally evaluate the utility of Brain Age for capturing fluid cognition, we built 26 age-prediction models for Brain Age based on different combinations of MRI modalities, using the Human Connectome Project in Aging (n=504, 36–100 years old). First, based on commonality analyses, we found a large overlap between Brain Age and chronological age: Brain Age could uniquely add only around 1.6% in explaining variation in fluid cognition over and above chronological age. Second, the age-prediction models that performed better at predicting chronological age did NOT necessarily create better Brain Age for capturing fluid cognition over and above chronological age. Instead, better-performing age-prediction models created Brain Age that overlapped larger with chronological age, up to around 29% out of 32%, in explaining fluid cognition. Third, Brain Age missed around 11% of the total variation in fluid cognition that could have been explained by the brain variation. That is, directly predicting fluid cognition from brain MRI data (instead of relying on Brain Age and chronological age) could lead to around a 1/3-time improvement of the total variation explained. Accordingly, we demonstrated the limited utility of Brain Age as a biomarker for fluid cognition and made some suggestions to ensure the utility of Brain Age in explaining fluid cognition and other phenotypes of interest.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89782">Base editing strategies to convert CAG to CAA diminish the disease-causing mutation in Huntington’s disease</a></h4>

              
                An expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene (<i>HTT</i>) causes Huntington’s disease (HD). Since the length of uninterrupted CAG repeat, not polyglutamine, determines the age-at-onset in HD, base editing strategies to convert CAG to CAA are anticipated to delay onset by shortening the uninterrupted CAG repeat. Here, we developed base editing strategies to convert CAG in the repeat to CAA and determined their molecular outcomes and effects on relevant disease phenotypes. Base editing strategies employing combinations of cytosine base editors and guide RNAs (gRNAs) efficiently converted CAG to CAA at various sites in the CAG repeat without generating significant indels, off-target edits, or transcriptome alterations, demonstrating their feasibility and specificity. Candidate BE strategies converted CAG to CAA on both expanded and non-expanded CAG repeats without altering <i>HTT</i> mRNA and protein levels. In addition, somatic CAG repeat expansion, which is the major disease driver in HD, was significantly decreased in the liver by a candidate BE strategy treatment in HD knock-in mice carrying canonical CAG repeats. Notably, CAG repeat expansion was abolished entirely in HD knock-in mice carrying CAA-interrupted repeats, supporting the therapeutic potential of CAG-to-CAA conversion strategies in HD and potentially other repeat expansion disorders.

	<p>Rotenone (RTN) induces neurotoxicity and motor dysfunction in rats, mirroring the pathophysiological traits of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), including striatal oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and changes in neural structure. This makes RTN a valuable model for PD research. Berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid recognized for its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, was evaluated for its ability to counteract RTN-induced impairments. Rats received subcutaneous RTN at 0.5 mg/kg for 21 days, resulting in weight loss and significant motor deficits assessed through open-field, bar catalepsy, beam-crossing, rotarod, and grip strength tests. BBR, administered orally at 30 or 100 mg/kg doses, one hour prior to RTN exposure for the same duration, effectively mitigated many of the RTN-induced motor impairments. Furthermore, BBR treatment reduced RTN-induced nitric oxide (NO) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, bolstered antioxidative capacity, enhanced mitochondrial enzyme activities (e.g., succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), ATPase, and the electron transport chain (ETC)), and diminished striatal neuroinflammation and apoptosis markers. Notably, the co-administration of trigonelline (TGN), an inhibitor of the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, significantly attenuated BBR&amp;amp;rsquo;s protective effects, indicating that BBR&amp;amp;rsquo;s neuroprotective actions are mediated via the Nrf2 pathway. These results underscore BBR&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential in ameliorating motor impairments akin to PD, suggesting its promise in potentially delaying or managing PD symptoms. Further research is warranted to translate these preclinical findings into clinical settings, enhancing our comprehension of BBR&amp;amp;rsquo;s therapeutic prospects in PD.</p>

                <p>Memory reactivation during sleep is thought to facilitate memory consolidation. Most sleep reactivation research has examined how reactivation of specific facts, objects, and associations benefits their overall retention. However, our memories are not unitary, and not all features of a memory persist in tandem over time. Instead, our memories are transformed, with some features strengthened and others weakened. Does sleep reactivation drive memory transformation? We leveraged the Targeted Memory Reactivation technique in an object category learning paradigm to examine this question. Participants (20 female, 14 male) learned three categories of novel objects, where each object had unique, distinguishing features as well as features shared with other members of its category. We used a real-time EEG protocol to cue the reactivation of these objects during sleep at moments optimized to generate reactivation events. We found that reactivation improved memory for distinguishing features while worsening memory for shared features, suggesting a differentiation process. The results indicate that sleep reactivation does not act holistically on object memories, instead supporting a transformation where some features are enhanced over others.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/24/e0163242024?rss=1">A Reconsideration of the Core and Matrix Classification of Thalamocortical Projections</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 1998, Jones suggested a classification of thalamocortical projections into core and matrix divisions (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B18">Jones, 1998</cross-ref>). In this classification, core projections are specific, topographical, innervate middle cortical layers, and serve to transmit specific information to the cortex for further analysis; matrix projections, in contrast, are diffuse, much less topographic, innervate upper layers, especially Layer 1, and serve a more global, modulatory function, such as affecting levels of arousal. This classification has proven especially influential in studies of thalamocortical relationships. Whereas it may be the case that a clear subset of thalamocortical connections fit the core motif, since they are specific, topographic, and innervate middle layers, we argue that there is no clear evidence for any single class that encompasses the remainder of thalamocortical connections as is claimed for matrix. Instead, there is great morphological variation in connections made by thalamocortical projections fitting neither a core nor matrix classification. We thus conclude that the core/matrix classification should be abandoned, because its application is not helpful in providing insights into thalamocortical interactions and can even be misleading. As one example of the latter, recent suggestions indicate that core projections are equivalent to first-order thalamic relays (i.e., those that relay subcortical information to the cortex) and matrix to higher-order relays (i.e., those that relay information from one cortical area to another), but available evidence does not support this relationship. All of this points to a need to replace the core/matrix grouping with a more complete classification of thalamocortical projections.</p>

                <p>General anesthetics disrupt brain network dynamics through multiple pathways, in part through postsynaptic potentiation of inhibitory ion channels as well as presynaptic inhibition of neuroexocytosis. Common clinical general anesthetic drugs, such as propofol and isoflurane, have been shown to interact and interfere with core components of the exocytic release machinery to cause impaired neurotransmitter release. Recent studies however suggest that these drugs do not affect all synapse subtypes equally. We investigated the role of the presynaptic release machinery in multiple neurotransmitter systems under isoflurane general anesthesia in the adult female <I>Drosophila</I> brain using live-cell super&ndash;resolution microscopy and optogenetic readouts of exocytosis and neural excitability. We activated neurotransmitter-specific mushroom body output neurons and imaged presynaptic function under isoflurane anesthesia. We found that isoflurane impaired synaptic release and presynaptic protein dynamics in excitatory cholinergic synapses. In contrast, isoflurane had little to no effect on inhibitory GABAergic or glutamatergic synapses. These results present a distinct inhibitory mechanism for general anesthesia, whereby neuroexocytosis is selectively impaired at excitatory synapses, while inhibitory synapses remain functional. This suggests a presynaptic inhibitory mechanism that complements the other inhibitory effects of these drugs.</p>

                <p>Acetylcholine is a robust neuromodulator of the limbic system and a critical regulator of arousal and emotions. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala (AMY) are key limbic structures that are both densely innervated by cholinergic afferents and interact with each other for emotional regulation. The ACC is composed of functionally distinct dorsal (A24), rostral (A32), and ventral (A25) areas that differ in their connections with the AMY. The structural substrates of cholinergic modulation of distinct ACC microcircuits and outputs to AMY are thought to depend on the laminar and subcellular localization of cholinergic receptors. The present study examines the distribution of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, m1 and m2, on distinct excitatory and inhibitory neurons and on AMY-targeting projection neurons within ACC areas, via immunohistochemistry and injections of neural tracers into the basolateral AMY in adult rhesus monkeys of both sexes. We found that laminar densities of m1+ and m2+ expressing excitatory and inhibitory neurons depended on area and cell type. Among the ACC areas, ventral subgenual ACC A25 exhibited greater m2+ localization on presynaptic inhibitory axon terminals and greater density of m1+ and m2+ expressing AMY-targeting (tracer+) pyramidal neurons. These patterns suggest robust cholinergic disinhibition and potentiation of amygdalar outputs from the limbic ventral ACC, which may be linked to the hyperexcitability of this subgenual ACC area in depression. These findings reveal the anatomical substrate of diverse cholinergic modulation of specific ACC microcircuits and amygdalar outputs that mediate cognitive&ndash;emotional integration and dysfunctions underlying stress and affective disorders.</p>

                <p>Understanding the function of the human brain requires determining basic properties of synaptic transmission in human neurons. One of the most fundamental parameters controlling neurotransmitter release is the presynaptic action potential, but its amplitude and duration remain controversial. Presynaptic action potentials have so far been measured with high temporal resolution only in a limited number of vertebrate but not in human neurons. To uncover properties of human presynaptic action potentials, we exploited recently developed tools to generate human glutamatergic neurons by transient expression of Neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) in pluripotent stem cells. During maturation for 3 to 9&nbsp;weeks of culturing in different established media, the proportion of cells with multiple axon initial segments decreased, while the amount of axonal tau protein and neuronal excitability increased. Super-resolution microscopy revealed the alignment of the pre- and postsynaptic proteins, Bassoon and Homer. Synaptic transmission was surprisingly reliable at frequencies of 20, 50, and 100&nbsp;Hz. The synchronicity of synaptic transmission during high-frequency transmission increased during 9&nbsp;weeks of neuronal maturation. To analyze the mechanisms of synchronous high-frequency glutamate release, we developed direct presynaptic patch-clamp recordings from human neurons. The presynaptic action potentials had large overshoots to ~25&nbsp;mV and short durations of ~0.5&nbsp;ms. Our findings show that Ngn2-induced neurons represent an elegant model system allowing for functional, structural, and molecular analyses of glutamatergic synaptic transmission with high spatiotemporal resolution in human neurons. Furthermore, our data predict that glutamatergic transmission is mediated by large and rapid presynaptic action potentials in the human brain.</p>

                <p>Structural differences along the hippocampal long axis are believed to underlie meaningful functional differences. Yet, recent data-driven parcellations of the hippocampus subdivide the hippocampus into a 10-cluster map with anterior-medial, anterior-lateral, and posteroanterior-lateral, middle, and posterior components. We tested whether task and experience could modulate this clustering using a spatial learning experiment where male and female participants were trained to virtually navigate a novel neighborhood in a Google Street View-like environment. Participants were scanned while navigating routes early in training and after a 2&nbsp;week training period. Using the 10-cluster map as the ideal template, we found that participants who eventually learn the neighborhood well have hippocampal cluster maps consistent with the ideal&mdash;even on their second day of learning&mdash;and their cluster mappings do not deviate over the 2&nbsp;week training period. However, participants who eventually learn the neighborhood poorly begin with hippocampal cluster maps inconsistent with the ideal template, though their cluster mappings may become more stereotypical after the 2&nbsp;week training. Interestingly this improvement seems to be route specific: after some early improvement, when a new route is navigated, participants' hippocampal maps revert back to less stereotypical organization. We conclude that hippocampal clustering is not dependent solely on anatomical structure and instead is driven by a combination of anatomy, task, and, importantly, experience. Nonetheless, while hippocampal clustering can change with experience, efficient navigation depends on functional hippocampal activity clustering in a stereotypical manner, highlighting optimal divisions of processing along the hippocampal anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes.</p>

                <p>Despite the known behavioral benefits of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, discrete neural oscillatory events in human scalp electroencephalography (EEG) linked with behavior have not been discovered. This knowledge gap hinders mechanistic understanding of the function of sleep, as well as the development of biophysical models and REM-based causal interventions. We designed a detection algorithm to identify bursts of activity in high-density, scalp EEG within theta (4&ndash;8&nbsp;Hz) and alpha (8&ndash;13&nbsp;Hz) bands during REM sleep. Across 38 nights of sleep, we characterized the burst events (i.e., count, duration, density, peak frequency, amplitude) in healthy, young male and female human participants (38; 21F) and investigated burst activity in relation to sleep-dependent memory tasks: hippocampal-dependent episodic verbal memory and nonhippocampal visual perceptual learning. We found greater burst count during the more REM-intensive second half of the night (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05), longer burst duration during the first half of the night (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05), but no differences across the night in density or power (<I>p</I> &gt; 0.05). Moreover, increased alpha burst power was associated with increased overnight forgetting for episodic memory (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, we show that increased REM theta burst activity in retinotopically specific regions was associated with better visual perceptual performance. Our work provides a critical bridge between discrete REM sleep events in human scalp EEG that support cognitive processes and the identification of similar activity patterns in animal models that allow for further mechanistic characterization.</p>

Moreover, cytokine treatment changed astrocytic morphology with more complexity in <I>APOE3</I>/<I>3</I> astrocytes, but not in <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch astrocytes, indicating resilience of the rare variant to a reactive state. Interestingly, we observed robust morphological alterations containing more intricate processes when cocultured with iPSC-derived cortical neurons, in which <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch astrocytes reduced complexity compared with <I>APOE3</I>/<I>3</I> astrocytes. To assess the impacts of tau propagation effects, we next developed a sophisticated and sensitive assay utilizing cortical neurons derived from human iPSCs, previously generated from donors of both sexes. We showed that <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch astrocytes effectively mitigated tau propagation within iPSC-derived neurons. This study provides important experimental evidence of the characteristic functions exhibited by <I>APOE3Ch/3Ch</I> astrocytes, thereby offering valuable insights for the advancement of novel clinical interventions in AD research.</p>

                <p>Faces and bodies are processed in separate but adjacent regions in the primate visual cortex. Yet, the functional significance of dividing the whole person into areas dedicated to its face and body components and their neighboring locations remains unknown. Here we hypothesized that this separation and proximity together with a normalization mechanism generate clutter-tolerant representations of the face, body, and whole person when presented in complex multi-category scenes. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a fMRI study, presenting images of a person within a multi-category scene to human male and female participants and assessed the contribution of each component to the response to the scene. Our results revealed a clutter-tolerant representation of the whole person in areas selective for both faces and bodies, typically located at the border between the two category-selective regions. Regions exclusively selective for faces or bodies demonstrated clutter-tolerant representations of their preferred category, corroborating earlier findings. Thus, the adjacent locations of face- and body-selective areas enable a hardwired machinery for decluttering of the whole person, without the need for a dedicated population of person-selective neurons. This distinct yet proximal functional organization of category-selective brain regions enhances the representation of the socially significant whole person, along with its face and body components, within multi-category scenes.</p>

                <p>Reinforcement learning is a theoretical framework that describes how agents learn to select options that maximize rewards and minimize punishments over time. We often make choices, however, to obtain symbolic reinforcers (e.g., money, points) that are later exchanged for primary reinforcers (e.g., food, drink). Although symbolic reinforcers are ubiquitous in our daily lives, widely used in laboratory tasks because they can be motivating, mechanisms by which they become motivating are less understood. In the present study, we examined how monkeys learn to make choices that maximize fluid rewards through reinforcement with tokens. The question addressed here is how the value of a state, which is a function of multiple task features (e.g., the current number of accumulated tokens, choice options, task epoch, trials since the last delivery of primary reinforcer, etc.), drives value and affects motivation. We constructed a Markov decision process model that computes the value of task states given task features to then correlate with the motivational state of the animal. Fixation times, choice reaction times, and abort frequency were all significantly related to values of task states during the tokens task (<I>n</I> = 5 monkeys, three males and two females). Furthermore, the model makes predictions for how neural responses could change on a moment-by-moment basis relative to changes in the state value. Together, this task and model allow us to capture learning and behavior related to symbolic reinforcement.</p>

                <p>The 40&nbsp;Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR), an oscillatory brain response to periodically modulated auditory stimuli, is a promising, noninvasive physiological biomarker for schizophrenia and related neuropsychiatric disorders. The 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR might be amplified by synaptic interactions in cortical circuits, which are, in turn, disturbed in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we tested whether the 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR in the human auditory cortex depends on two key synaptic components of neuronal interactions within cortical circuits: excitation via N-methyl-aspartate glutamate (NMDA) receptors and inhibition via gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) receptors. We combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings with placebo-controlled, low-dose pharmacological interventions in the same healthy human participants (13 males, 7 females). All participants exhibited a robust 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR in auditory cortices, especially in the right hemisphere, under a placebo. The GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor&ndash;agonist lorazepam increased the amplitude of the 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR, while no effect was detectable under the NMDA blocker memantine. Our findings indicate that the 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR in the auditory cortex involves synaptic (and likely intracortical) inhibition via the GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor, thus highlighting its utility as a mechanistic signature of cortical circuit dysfunctions involving GABAergic inhibition.</p>

                <p>Visual crowding refers to the phenomenon where a target object that is easily identifiable in isolation becomes difficult to recognize when surrounded by other stimuli (distractors). Many psychophysical studies have investigated this phenomenon and proposed alternative models for the underlying mechanisms. One prominent hypothesis, albeit with mixed psychophysical support, posits that crowding arises from the loss of information due to pooled encoding of features from target and distractor stimuli in the early stages of cortical visual processing. However, neurophysiological studies have not rigorously tested this hypothesis. We studied the responses of single neurons in macaque (one male, one female) area V4, an intermediate stage of the object-processing pathway, to parametrically designed crowded displays and texture statistics-matched metameric counterparts. Our investigations reveal striking parallels between how crowding parameters&mdash;number, distance, and position of distractors&mdash;influence human psychophysical performance and V4 shape selectivity. Importantly, we also found that enhancing the salience of a target stimulus could alleviate crowding effects in highly cluttered scenes, and this could be temporally protracted reflecting a dynamical process. Thus, a pooled encoding of nearby stimuli cannot explain the observed responses, and we propose an alternative model where V4 neurons preferentially encode salient stimuli in crowded displays. Overall, we conclude that the magnitude of crowding effects is determined not just by the number of distractors and target&ndash;distractor separation but also by the relative salience of targets versus distractors based on their feature attributes&mdash;the similarity of distractors and the contrast between target and distractor stimuli.</p>

                <p>Sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (SARM1) is an inducible NADase that localizes to mitochondria throughout neurons and senses metabolic changes that occur after injury. Minimal proteomic changes are observed upon either SARM1 depletion or activation, suggesting that SARM1 does not exert broad effects on neuronal protein homeostasis. However, whether SARM1 activation occurs throughout the neuron in response to injury and cell stress remains largely unknown. Using a semiautomated imaging pipeline and a custom-built deep learning scoring algorithm, we studied degeneration in both mixed-sex mouse primary cortical neurons and male human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons in response to a number of different stressors. We show that SARM1 activation is differentially restricted to specific neuronal compartments depending on the stressor. Cortical neurons undergo SARM1-dependent axon degeneration after mechanical transection, and SARM1 activation is limited to the axonal compartment distal to the injury site. However, global SARM1 activation following vacor treatment causes both cell body and axon degeneration. Context-specific stressors, such as microtubule dysfunction and mitochondrial stress, induce axonal SARM1 activation leading to SARM1-dependent axon degeneration and SARM1-independent cell body death. Our data reveal that compartment-specific SARM1&ndash;mediated death signaling is dependent on the type of injury and cellular stressor.</p>

                Background The spirochaete Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, which causes the infectious disease syphilis, can be spread through sexual contact or perinatal transmission. In recent years, cases of syphilis have increased, especially among individuals engaging in behaviour that makes them more vulnerable (condomless sex and multiple sexual partners). Condylomata acuminata (external genital warts) is one of the most common viral sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Individuals who are behaviourally vulnerable are also highly prone to two or more STIs. Our case exemplifies the occurrence of two STIs in a young man who was behaviourally vulnerable to acquiring STIs. Case We report a case of a 21-year-old year old heterosexual man presenting with concomitant primary syphilis and genital warts. He presented with a painless genital ulcer and warty growths on his glans penis. Examination showed a painless indurated ulcer and multiple genital warts. Serology was positive for quantitative Venereal disease research laboratory test (1:16 titre). The patient was diagnosed with two concomitant STIs. He was treated as per the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for primary syphilis and podophyllin resin for genital warts. After four weeks, the genital ulcer showed complete healing and there was a significant reduction of genital warts. Conclusions Individuals with multiple sexual partners engaging in sexual activity without the use of prevention tools are at a greater chance of acquiring two or more STIs. To reduce concomitant transmission, preventive measures against genital ulcer diseases like syphilis, herpes, and chancroid, such as early identification and treatment, and condom distribution, must be strengthened as part of national STI prevention. Patients with two or more STIs should be followed regularly to assess the progress of infection and should be offered timely medical treatment.

                Background Tumor budding is defined as a single cell or a cluster of up to five tumor cells at the invasion front of all oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cases. Tumor budding is considered as a marker of many important events in oral carcinoma, including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, metastasis, and for further prognosis. Methods A total of 30 clinically and histopathologically diagnosed cases of OSCC were retrieved from the archival of the Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology. After assessing the sections for the presence of tumor budding (TB), it is further categorized into high-intensity TB and low-intensity TB. Results We found a strong association between lymph node metastasis and histopathological grading in the current study. There was no association between TB and a patient’s survival rate. Conclusions This study emphasizes the significance of tumor budding, its relevance to prognosis, and reproducibility, as well as the significance of its evaluation and incorporation into routine surgical pathology practice in the management of OSCC. As a result, we believe that tumor budding is a crucial factor in determining tumor behavior.

                Objective This study aimed to establish the factor structure and reliability of the evaluation instrument measuring monkeypox (Mpox) knowledge, perception and beliefs of health threat in students of the health area in two universities of Peru during 2022. Methods The methodology used was psychometric in nature. The study variable on knowledge of monkeypox was based on the instrument made by Ricco et al., carried out with health professionals, adjusted to Peru and administered to 416 students. Results The results showed adequate goodness-of-fit indicators with RMSEA and SRMR coefficients lower than 0.08 and a TLI lower than 0.90 and adequate reliability values for knowledge of monkeypox (KR20=0.70 and α=0.73), with the perception of health threats being the one with the highest reliability (α=0.88 and Ω=0.89). Conclusions Having instruments that accurately reflect the knowledge, perception and beliefs of health students will make it possible to contribute significantly to the prevention, control and management of this disease and, at the same time, be prepared to address other challenges of public health in the future.

                Sebaceous carcinoma is an extremely rare malignant disease and it is more aggressive when it occurs in the eyelids and orbit. It can mimic several benign lesions, resulting in diagnostic delay. We present a case of sebaceous carcinoma in a 50-year-old male who presented with complaints of swelling of the upper eyelid, which was followed by appearance of an ulcerative growth over the eyelid. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports showed an ulcerated mass in the left periorbital and orbital region appearing heterogeneously hyperintense. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showed malignant epithelial differentiation which was followed by exenteration of the eyeball. Histopathology showed the rare diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma. The disease has a poor prognosis as the entity is associated with increased morbidity and if not detected early it can metastasize to other organs which may be fatal sometimes.

                Background Antimalarial drug resistance is a major challenge hampering malaria control and elimination. About three-quarters of Eritrea’s population resides in the malaria-endemic western lowlands of the country. Plasmodium falciparum, the leading causative parasite species, has developed resistance to basically all antimalarials. Continued surveillance of drug resistance using genetic markers provides important molecular data for treatment policies which complements clinical studies, and strengthens control efforts. This study sought to genotype point mutations associated with P. falciparum resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and artemisinin, in dried-blood spots from three hospitals in the western lowlands of Eritrea. Methods Dried-blood spot samples were collected from patients visiting Adi Quala, Keren and Gash Barka Hospitals, between July and October, 2014. The patients were followed up after treatment with first line artesunate-amodiaquine, and dried-blood spots were collected on day three after treatment. Nested polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing techniques were employed to genotype point mutations in the Pfdhfr (PF3D7_0417200), Pfdhps (PF3D7_0810800) and PfK13 (PF3D7_1343700) partial gene regions. Results Sequence data analyses of PCR-positive isolates found wild-type artemisinin haplotypes associated with resistance (Y493Y, R539R, I543I) in three isolates, whereas four mutant antifolate haplotypes associated with resistance were observed in six isolates. These included the triple-mutant Pfdhfr (S108N, C59R, N51I) haplotype, the double-mutant Pfdhfr (N51I, S108N) haplotype, the single-mutant Pfdhfr (K540E) haplotype, and the mixed-mutant Pfdhfr-Pfdhps (S108N, N51I + K540E) haplotype. Other findings observed were, a rare non-synonymous Pfdhfr V45A mutation in four isolates, and a synonymous Pfdhps R449R in one isolate. Conclusions The mutant antifolate haplotypes observed indicate a likely existence of full SP resistance. Further studies can be carried out to estimate the prevalence of SP resistance. The wild-type artemisinin haplotypes observed suggest artemisinin is still an effective treatment. Continuous monitoring of point mutations associated with delayed parasite clearance in ART clinical studies is recommended.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-626/v1?src=rss">Effect of mindfulness training in adjunct to conventional physiotherapy on pain, function, and mindfulness attention awareness score in recreational long distance runners with patellofemoral pain syndrome: A randomized controlled trial protocol [version 1</a></h4>

              
                Background The Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) poses a significant challenge in sports medicine due to its multifactorial etiology involving both physiological and psychological factors. Though widely used, conventional physiotherapy approaches often yield limited efficacy and high recurrence rates. Mindfulness-based interventions have emerged as promising adjuncts in managing various musculoskeletal conditions, offering potential benefits in pain management, coping strategies, and overall well-being. However, their efficacy in addressing PFPS remains underexplored, particularly in the context of recreational long-distance runners. This study investigates the effects of integrating mindfulness training as an adjunct to conventional physiotherapy on pain intensity, functional outcomes, and mindfulness awareness in recreational long-distance runners with PFPS. Methods Eligible individuals will be assigned randomly to either Group A (Mindfulness Training + Conventional Physiotherapy) or Group B (Conventional Physiotherapy). Outcome measures, such as the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and knee joint position sense using a goniometer will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Mindfulness training will encompass a variety of techniques integrated with conventional physiotherapy sessions. Result This study has the potential to offer an enhanced treatment strategy that considers both the physical and psychological aspects of Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS), potentially improving outcomes and well-being for recreational long-distance runners.

                Background As there is high expense of treatment and potential long-term consequences including chronic ankle instability (CAI), lateral ankle sprains (LAS) are common among athletes and represent a substantial healthcare burden. In terms of preventing more injuries and encouraging a full recovery, traditional treatments frequently fall short. Methods At the Department of Sports Physiotherapy, futsal athletes with grade I and grade II lateral ankle sprains will participate in a parallel-group, 1:1 allocation ratio trial. Individuals who fulfil the eligibility requirements will be randomized at random to either the experimental or control group. Conventional physiotherapy treatments will be administered to the control group, and IVR sessions utilizing certain games will be administered to the experimental group in addition to the same therapies. The Y Balance Tool is used to measure dynamic balance, the X Sens MVN system is used to measure vertical jump, and the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) is used to assess static balance. Result This study aims to offer a new way to improving results for futsal players recovering from lateral ankle sprains by utilizing IVR technology in conjunction with traditional physiotherapy. The results could lead to the creation of more efficient sports-related injury rehabilitation programs, which would improve athlete performance and lessen the incidence of ankle sprains in athletic populations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-624/v1?src=rss">The association between non-communicable diseases and COVID-19 severity and mortality among infected hospitalized healthcare workers in 29 countries: a cohort study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Due to occupational exposure, healthcare workers (HCWs) have a higher risk of Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) infection than the general population. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) may increase the risk of COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality among HCWs, potentially reducing the available health workforce. We examined the association between NCDs and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality among infected HCWs. Methods This cohort study used data from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) database. HCWs hospitalized between January 2020 and January 2023 due to clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were eligible for inclusion. Variables collected included demographic data, comorbidities, and hospitalization outcomes. Descriptive statistics were reported using mean/standard deviation (SD), median/interquartile range (IQR), or frequencies and proportions. For each NCD, the relative risk of death, adjusted for age and sex, was calculated using log-binomial regression as well as the population-attributable fraction. Results There were 17,502 HCWs, 95.7% of whom had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The majority were female (66.5%) and the mean age (SD) was 49.8 (14.3) years. Roughly, half (51.42%) of HCWs had no comorbidities, 29.28% had one comorbidity, 14.68% had 2 comorbidities and <5% had ≥3 comorbidities. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (49.40%) and cardiovascular disease (36.90%). Approximately one-fifth of the HCWs had severe COVID-19 (16.95%) and 10.68% of the HCWs with COVID-19 died. Being ≥45 years old, male gender, smoking, obesity, and certain NCDs increased the risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Obesity and diabetes mellitus were the leading risk factors in terms of the population-attributable risk for COVID-19 severity (6.89%) and mortality (36.00%) respectively. Conclusions Many HCWs with COVID-19 had one or more NCDs. Obesity and diabetes mellitus increased COVID-19 severity and mortality risk. Reducing the prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus would yield the biggest reduction in COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality among HCWs.

                <p>by Yu Zhu, Babak Momeni</p>

Host-associated resident microbiota can protect their host from pathogens—a community-level trait called colonization resistance. The effect of the diversity of the resident community in previous studies has shown contradictory results, with higher diversity either strengthening or weakening colonization resistance. To control the confounding factors that may lead to such contradictions, we use mathematical simulations with a focus on species interactions and their impact on colonization resistance. We use a mediator-explicit model that accounts for metabolite-mediated interactions to perform <i>in silico</i> invasion experiments. We show that the relationship between colonization resistance and species richness of the resident community is not monotonic because it depends on two underlying trends as the richness of the resident community increases: a decrease in instances of augmentation (invader species added, without driving out resident species) and an increase in instances of displacement (invader species added, driving out some of the resident species). These trends hold consistently under different parameters, regardless of the number of compounds that mediate interactions between species or the proportion of the facilitative versus inhibitory interactions among species. Our results show a positive correlation between resistance and diversity in low-richness communities and a negative correlation in high-richness communities, offering an explanation for the seemingly contradictory trend in the resistance-diversity relationship in previous reports.

Restrictions of cross-border mobility are typically used to prevent an emerging disease from entering a country in order to slow down its spread. However, such interventions can come with a significant societal cost and should thus be based on careful analysis and quantitative understanding on their effects. To this end, we model the influence of cross-border mobility on the spread of COVID-19 during 2020 in the neighbouring Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. We investigate the immediate impact of cross-border travel on disease spread and employ counterfactual scenarios to explore the cumulative effects of introducing additional infected individuals into a population during the ongoing epidemic. Our results indicate that the effect of inter-country mobility on epidemic growth is non-negligible essentially when there is sizeable mobility from a high prevalence country or countries to a low prevalence one. Our findings underscore the critical importance of accurate data and models on both epidemic progression and travel patterns in informing decisions related to inter-country mobility restrictions.

                <p>by Jakob Jordan, João Sacramento, Willem A. M. Wybo, Mihai A. Petrovici, Walter Senn</p>

A fundamental function of cortical circuits is the integration of information from different sources to form a reliable basis for behavior. While animals behave as if they optimally integrate information according to Bayesian probability theory, the implementation of the required computations in the biological substrate remains unclear. We propose a novel, Bayesian view on the dynamics of conductance-based neurons and synapses which suggests that they are naturally equipped to optimally perform information integration. In our approach apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials. These are parametrized by local quantities, the effective reversal potentials and membrane conductances. We formally demonstrate that under these assumptions the somatic compartment naturally computes the corresponding posterior. We derive a gradient-based plasticity rule, allowing neurons to learn desired target distributions and weight synaptic inputs by their relative reliabilities. Our theory explains various experimental findings on the system and single-cell level related to multi-sensory integration, which we illustrate with simulations. Furthermore, we make experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity.

CRISPR-Cas12a, often regarded as a precise genome editor, still requires improvements in specificity. In this study, we used a GFP-activation assay to screen 14 new Cas12a nucleases for mammalian genome editing, successfully identifying 9 active ones. Notably, these Cas12a nucleases prefer pyrimidine-rich PAMs. Among these nucleases, we extensively characterized Mb4Cas12a obtained from <i>Moraxella bovis CCUG 2133</i>, which recognizes a YYN PAM (Y = C or T). Our biochemical analysis demonstrates that Mb4Cas12a can cleave double-strand DNA across a wide temperature range. To improve specificity, we constructed a SWISS-MODEL of Mb4Cas12a based on the FnCas12a crystal structure and identified 8 amino acids potentially forming hydrogen bonds at the target DNA-crRNA interface. By replacing these amino acids with alanine to disrupt the hydrogen bond, we tested the influence of each mutation on Mb4Cas12a specificity. Interestingly, the F370A mutation improved specificity with minimal influence on activity. Further study showed that Mb4Cas12a-F370A is capable of discriminating single-nucleotide polymorphisms. These new Cas12a orthologs and high-fidelity variants hold substantial promise for therapeutic applications.

                <p>by Yassine Cherrak, Miguel Angel Salazar, Koray Yilmaz, Markus Kreuzer, Wolf-Dietrich Hardt</p>

The gastrointestinal tract is densely colonized by a polymicrobial community known as the microbiota which serves as primary line of defence against pathogen invasion. The microbiota can limit gut-luminal pathogen growth at different stages of infection. This can be traced to specific commensal strains exhibiting direct or indirect protective functions. Although these mechanisms hold the potential to develop new approaches to combat enteric pathogens, they remain far from being completely described. In this study, we investigated how a mouse commensal <i>Escherichia coli</i> can outcompete <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium (<i>S</i>. Tm). Using a salmonellosis mouse model, we found that the commensal <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> 8178 strain relies on a trojan horse trap strategy to limit <i>S</i>. Tm expansion in the inflamed gut. Combining mutants and reporter tools, we demonstrated that inflammation triggers the expression of the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> 8178 antimicrobial microcin H47 toxin which, when fused to salmochelin siderophores, can specifically alter <i>S</i>. Tm growth. This protective function was compromised upon disruption of the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> 8178 <i>tonB</i>-dependent catecholate siderophore uptake system, highlighting a previously unappreciated crosstalk between iron intake and microcin H47 activity. By identifying the genetic determinants mediating <i>S</i>. Tm competition, our work not only provides a better mechanistic understanding of the protective function displayed by members of the gut microbiota but also further expands the general contribution of microcins in bacterial antagonistic relationships. Ultimately, such insights can open new avenues for developing microbiota-based approaches to better control intestinal infections.
