     alt="A Neuropeptide Signaling Network That Regulates Developmental Timing and Systemic Growth in Drosophila"/>
<p>Anatomical as well as genetic analyses were performed to elucidate the role of neurons that produce neuropeptides called Hugin peptides in the larval central nervous system of the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Results suggest that Hugin peptides regulate developmental timing and body size via neurons that produce prothoracicotropic hormone.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Animals sense chemical cues such as nutritious and noxious stimuli through the chemosensory system and adapt their behavior, physiology, and developmental schedule to the environment. In the <i>Drosophila</i> central nervous system, chemosensory interneurons that produce neuropeptides called Hugin (Hug) peptides receive signals from gustatory receptor neurons and regulate feeding behavior. Because Hug neurons project their axons to the higher brain region within the protocerebrum where dendrites of multiple neurons producing developmentally important neuropeptides are extended, it has been postulated that Hug neurons regulate development through the neuroendocrine system. In this study, we show that Hug neurons interact with a subset of protocerebrum neurons that produce prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) and regulate the onset of metamorphosis and systemic growth. Loss of the <i>hug</i> gene and silencing of Hug neurons caused a delay in larval-to-prepupal transition and an increase in final body size. Furthermore, deletion of Hug receptor-encoding genes also caused developmental delay and body size increase, and the phenotype was restored by expressing Hug receptors in PTTH-producing neurons. These results indicate that Hug neurons regulate developmental timing and body size via PTTH-producing neurons. This study provides a basis for understanding how chemosensation is converted into neuroendocrine signaling to control insect growth and development.</p>

Abstract: Neuropsychology of artificial intelligence focuses on synthetic neural cog nition as a new type of study object within cognitive psychology. With the goal of making artificial neural networks of language models more explainable, this approach involves transposing concepts from cognitive psychology to the interpretive construction of artificial neural cognition. The human cognitive concept involved here is categorization, serving as a heuristic for thinking about the process of segmentation and construction of reality carried out by the neural vectors of synthetic cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11885">Body Maps for Feeling of Creativity in Musical Chord Progression</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.11885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how musical stimuli evoke feelings of creativity through predictive mechanisms, while also examining the role of interoceptive bodily sensations, particularly those linked to the heart and stomach regions. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between interoceptive sensibility and the intensity of the feeling of creativity. By employing body-mapping assessments and emotional evaluations on 353 participants exposed to various chord progressions, we revealed the critical role of heart sensations in eliciting feelings of creativity. Our findings indicate that musical chord progressions characterized by high uncertainty and surprise generated heightened feelings of creativity alongside increased arousal. Notably, heart sensations correlated positively with the feeling of creativity, suggesting the crucial role of interoceptive bodily sensations in the experience of creativity. In contrast, the feelings of beauty and valence were more strongly influenced by predictable, low-uncertainty progressions, suggesting that the feelings of creativity may operate through a somewhat different cognitive mechanism than that of beauty and valence. This study highlights the complex interplay between bodily sensations and feelings of creativity based on predictive processing. By framing creativity within the framework of interoception, our research contributes to a deeper understanding of the emotional and embodied processes that shape the experience of creativity. Future research should explore these relationships to enrich our comprehension of creativity in both artistic endeavors and everyday life.

                arXiv:2408.00770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new illusion that challenges our understanding of stereo vision. The illusion consists of a larger circle at 50cm, and smaller circle in front of it at 40cm, with constant angular sizes throughout. We move the larger circle forward by 10cm (to 40cm) and then back again (to 50cm). The question is, what distance should we move the smaller circle forward and back to maintain a constant perceived separation in depth between the circles? Constant physical distance (10cm) or constant retinal disparity (6.7cm)? Observers choose constant disparity. We therefore argue the 'Linton Stereo Illusion' appears to suggest that perceived stereo depth reflects retinal disparities rather than 3D geometry.

                arXiv:2402.14701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The therapeutic working alliance is a critical factor in predicting the success of psychotherapy treatment. Traditionally, working alliance assessment relies on questionnaires completed by both therapists and patients. In this paper, we present COMPASS, a novel framework to directly infer the therapeutic working alliance from the natural language used in psychotherapy sessions. Our approach utilizes advanced large language models (LLMs) to analyze transcripts of psychotherapy sessions and compare them with distributed representations of statements in the working alliance inventory. Analyzing a dataset of over 950 sessions covering diverse psychiatric conditions including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and suicidal tendencies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in providing fine-grained mapping of patient-therapist alignment trajectories and offering interpretability for clinical psychiatry and in identifying emerging patterns related to the condition being treated. By employing various deep learning-based topic modeling techniques in combination with prompting generative language models, we analyze the topical characteristics of different psychiatric conditions and their evolution at a turn-level resolution. This combined framework enhances the understanding of therapeutic interactions, enabling timely feedback for therapists regarding the quality of therapeutic relationships and providing interpretable insights to improve the effectiveness of psychotherapy.

                arXiv:2410.11886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates whether the hexagonal structure of grid cells provides any performance benefits or if it merely represents a biologically convenient configuration. Utilizing the Vector-HaSH content addressable memory model as a model of the grid cell -- place cell network of the mammalian brain, we compare the performance of square and hexagonal grid cells in tasks of storing and retrieving spatial memories. Our experiments across different path types, path lengths and grid configurations, reveal that hexagonal grid cells perform similarly to square grid cells with respect to spatial representation and memory recall. Our results show comparable accuracy and robustness across different datasets and noise levels on images to recall. These findings suggest that the brain's use of hexagonal grids may be more a matter of biological convenience and ease of implementation rather than because they provide superior performance over square grid cells (which are easier to implement in silico).

                arXiv:2410.12023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel neural network approach, LARP (Learned Articulated Rigid body Physics), to model the dynamics of articulated human motion with contact. Our goal is to develop a faster and more convenient methodological alternative to traditional physics simulators for use in computer vision tasks such as human motion reconstruction from video. To that end we introduce a training procedure and model components that support the construction of a recurrent neural architecture to accurately simulate articulated rigid body dynamics. Our neural architecture supports features typically found in traditional physics simulators, such as modeling of joint motors, variable dimensions of body parts, contact between body parts and objects, and is an order of magnitude faster than traditional systems when multiple simulations are run in parallel. To demonstrate the value of LARP we use it as a drop-in replacement for a state of the art classical non-differentiable simulator in an existing video-based reconstruction framework and show comparative or better 3D human pose reconstruction accuracy.

                arXiv:2410.12188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel lattice-based methodology for incorporating multidimensional constraints into continuous decision variables within a genetic algorithm (GA) framework. The proposed approach consolidates established transcription techniques for crossover of continuous decision variables, aiming to leverage domain knowledge and guide the search process towards feasible regions of the design space. This work offers a robust and general purpose lattice-based GA that is applicable to a broad range of optimization problems. Monte Carlo analysis demonstrates that lattice-based methods find solutions two orders of magnitude closer to optima in fewer generations. The effectiveness of the lattice-based approach is showcased through two illustrative multi-objective design problems: (1) optimal telescope placement for astrophotography and (2) optimal design of a satellite constellation for maximizing ground station access. The optimal telescope placement example shows that lattice-based methods converge to the Pareto front in 15% fewer generations than traditional methods. The orbit design example shows that lattice-based methods discover an order of magnitude more Pareto-optimal solutions than traditional methods in a highly constrained design space. Overall, the results show that the lattice-based method exhibits enhanced exploration capabilities, traversing the solution space more comprehensively and achieving faster convergence compared to conventional GAs.

                arXiv:2410.11923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This paper aims to enhance bearing fault diagnosis in industrial machinery by introducing a novel method that combines Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This approach captures both spatial and temporal dependencies within sensor data, improving the accuracy of bearing fault detection under various conditions. Methodology: The proposed method converts time series sensor data into graph representations. GAT captures spatial relationships between components, while LSTM models temporal patterns. The model is validated using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Dataset, which includes data under different horsepower levels and both normal and faulty conditions. Its performance is compared with methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Isolation Forest (IForest) and GNN-based method for bearing fault detection (GNNBFD). Findings: The model achieved outstanding results, with precision, recall, and F1-scores reaching 100\% across various testing conditions. It not only identifies faults accurately but also generalizes effectively across different operational scenarios, outperforming traditional methods. Originality: This research presents a unique combination of GAT and LSTM for fault detection, overcoming the limitations of traditional time series methods by capturing complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Its superior performance demonstrates significant potential for predictive maintenance in industrial applications.

Abstract: We describe a proposal for increasing the effective clock speed of a thermodynamic computer, by altering the interaction scale of the units within the computer and introducing to the computer an additional source of noise. The resulting thermodynamic computer program is equivalent to the original computer program, but runs at a higher clock speed. This approach offers a way of increasing the speed of thermodynamic computing while preserving the fidelity of computation.

                arXiv:2405.03293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to accelerate the Bayesian inference process, focusing specifically on the nested sampling algorithms. Bayesian inference plays a crucial role in cosmological parameter estimation, providing a robust framework for extracting theoretical insights from observational data. However, its computational demands can be substantial, primarily due to the need for numerous likelihood function evaluations. Our proposed method utilizes the power of deep learning, employing feedforward neural networks to approximate the likelihood function dynamically during the Bayesian inference process. Unlike traditional approaches, our method trains neural networks on-the-fly using the current set of live points as training data, without the need for pre-training. This flexibility enables adaptation to various theoretical models and datasets. We perform simple hyperparameter optimization using genetic algorithms to suggest initial neural network architectures for learning each likelihood function. Once sufficient accuracy is achieved, the neural network replaces the original likelihood function. The implementation integrates with nested sampling algorithms and has been thoroughly evaluated using both simple cosmological dark energy models and diverse observational datasets. Additionally, we explore the potential of genetic algorithms for generating initial live points within nested sampling inference, opening up new avenues for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of Bayesian inference methods.

">Representations of stimulus meaning in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The ability to discriminate and categorize the meaning of environmental stimuli and respond accordingly is essential for survival. The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) controls emotional and motivated behaviors in response to environmental cues and is hypothesized to do so in part by deciphering the positive or negative quality of these cues. Yet, what features of the environment are represented in the activity patterns of vCA1 neurons, and whether the positive or negative meaning of a stimulus is present at this stage, remains unclear. Here, using 2-photon calcium imaging across six different experimental paradigms, we consistently found that vCA1 ensembles encode the identity, sensory features, and intensity of learned and innately salient stimuli, but not their overall valence. These results offer a reappraisal of vCA1 function, wherein information corresponding to individual stimulus features and their behavioral saliency predominates, while valence-related information is attached elsewhere.

">Temporally delayed representations in alpha and beta rhythms in higher-order cortical networks track increasing relational integration demands</a></h4>

              
                Relational reasoning is the ability to infer and understand the relations between multiple elements. In humans, this ability supports higher cognitive functions and is linked to fluid intelligence. Relational complexity (RC) is a cognitive framework that offers a generalisable method for classifying the complexity of reasoning problems. To date, increased RC has been linked to static patterns of brain activity supported by the frontoparietal system, but limited work has assessed the multivariate spatiotemporal dynamics that code for RC. To address this, we conducted representational similarity analysis in two independent neuroimaging datasets (Dataset 1 fMRI, n=40; Dataset 2 EEG, n=45), where brain activity was recorded while participants completed a visuospatial reasoning task that included different levels of RC (Latin Square Task). Our findings revealed that, spatially, RC representations were widespread, peaking in brain networks associated with higher-order cognition (frontoparietal, dorsal-attention, and cingulo-opercular). Temporally, RC was represented in the 2.5 - 4.1 seconds post-stimuli window and emerged in the alpha and beta frequency range. Finally, multimodal fusion analysis revealed the information carried in the representation is concordant with the theorised RC model relative to a model of cognitive effort in higher-order cortical networks. Altogether, the results further our understanding of what information is held during relational processing, highlight the spatially distributed nature of RC representations, and emphasise the importance of late frequency-resolved neural processes to resolve RC. Significance statement: Assessing cognitive abilities in human reasoning requires a cognitive framework that can define the complexity of a problem. Relational complexity (RC) theory has emerged as a robust framework, parameterising complexity based on the number of relations that must be processed in parallel to solve a problem's underlying relational representation. To investigate where or when the brain codes for this cognitive abstraction, our study examined multimodal whole-brain activity during short reasoning problems at various complexity levels. We found that higher-cortical networks coded a representation tracking the transition between complexity demands, emerging during late-stage cognitive processing. Our findings provide neuroscientific evidence for a neural coding of relational complexity, pinpointing the frequency-resolved dynamics associated with these mechanisms.

">Understanding Neuronal Diversity: Role of Input Dynamics and Selectivity</a></h4>

              
                The diversity of neurons in the brain is traditionally studied through morphological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic features. However, because neurons function as spatiotemporal filters of the presynaptic activity patterns, the input dynamics should contribute to neuronal diversity. We tested this hypothesis in barrel cortical neurons using a classical 'step-and-hold' input and a rich dynamical input mimicking input from a presynaptic network. We found that the stimulus type strongly determines classification. To understand this input dependence further, we systematically compared which attributes are the most informative about neuronal heterogeneity by performing classifications based on four different attribute sets that capture 1) action potential features, 2) passive biophysical features, 3) adaptation, and 4) linear input filter using the Spike Triggered Average (STA). We compared the variance explained by the shared structure across these four attribute sets. We observed that the linear input filter explains the highest amount of private variance and thus is the most informative about neuronal heterogeneity. These results demonstrate the importance of the interplay between the input dynamics and the postsynaptic neuron's linear input filter for understanding functional neuronal diversity.

	<p>Background: The evaluation of evidence, which frequently takes the form of scientific evidence, necessitates the input of experts in relevant fields. The results are presented as expert opinions or expert evaluations, which are generally accepted as a reliable representation of the facts. A further issue that remains unresolved though is the process of evaluating the expertise and knowledge of an expert in the first instance. In general, earned certificates, grades and other objective criteria are typically regarded as representative documentation to substantiate an expert status. However, there is a possibility that these may not always be sufficiently representative. Objectives: The goal of the present study was to provide evidence that the neural processing of law-relevant and law-irrelevant terms varies significantly between participants who have received training in the field of law (experts) and those who have not (novices). Methods: To this end, changes in brain activity were recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) during visual presentations of terms belonging to five different categories (fake right, democracy, filler word, basic right and rule of law). Event-related potentials (ERPs) were subsequently averaged for each category and subjected to statistical analysis. Results: The results clearly demonstrate that participants trained in law processed fake rights and filler words in a similar manner. Furthermore, both of these conditions elicited different levels of brain activity compared to all law-relevant terms. This was not the case in participants who had not received legal training. The brains of untrained participants processed all five term categories in a strikingly similar manner. In light of prior knowledge regarding language processing, the primary focus was on two distinct electrode locations: one in the left posterior region, and the other in the left frontal region. In both locations, the most prominent differences in brain activity elicited by the aforementioned term categories in law-trained participants occurred approximately 450 milliseconds after stimulus onset. The results were further corroborated by a repeated-measures ANOVA and subsequent t-tests, which also demonstrated the absence of this effect in law-untrained participants. Conclusions: The findings of this study provide empirical evidence that brain activity measurements, in particular ERPs, can be used to distinguish between experts trained in a specific field of expertise and novices in that field. Such findings have the potential to facilitate objective assessments of expertise, enabling comparisons between experts and novices that extend beyond traditional criteria such as qualifications and experience. Instead, individuals can be evaluated based on their cognitive processes, as observed through brain activity.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Speaker race and the listener&amp;amp;rsquo;s language experience (i.e., monolinguals vs. bilinguals) have both been shown to influence accent intelligibility independently. Speaker race specifically is thought to be informed by learned experiences (exemplar model) or individual biases and attitudes (bias-based model). The current study investigates speaker race and the listener&amp;amp;rsquo;s language experience simultaneously as well as listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; attitudes toward non-native speakers and their ability to identify the accent. Methods: Overall, 140 White English monolinguals and 140 English/Norwegian bilinguals transcribed 60 Mandarin-accented English sentences presented in noise in the context of a White or East Asian face. Following sentence transcription, participants were asked to rate the strength of the accent heard and completed a short questionnaire that assessed their accent identification ability and their language usage, proficiency, familiarity, and attitudes. Results: Results show that a listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; ability to identify an accent and their attitudes toward non-native speakers had a significant impact on accent intelligibility and accentedness ratings. Speaker race by itself did not play a role in accent intelligibility and accentedness ratings; however, we found evidence that speaker race interacted with participants&amp;amp;rsquo; accent identification scores and attitudes toward non-native speakers, and these interactions differed as a function of language experience. Conclusions: Our results suggest that bilinguals&amp;amp;rsquo; sociolinguistic processing may be more in line with a bias-based model than monolinguals.</p>

                <p>Two-photon calcium imaging allows for the activity readout of large populations of neurons at single cell resolution in living organisms, yielding new insights into how the brain processes information. Holographic optogenetics allows us to trigger activity of this population directly, raising the possibility of injecting information into a living brain. Optogenetic triggering of activity that mimics "natural" information, however, requires identification of stimulation targets based on real-time analysis of the functional network. We have developed NeuroART (Neuronal Analysis in Real Time), software that provides real-time readout of neuronal activity integrated with downstream analysis of correlations and synchrony and of sensory metadata. On the example of auditory stimuli, we demonstrate real-time inference of the contribution of each neuron in the field of view to sensory information processing. To avoid the limitations of microscope hardware and enable collaboration of multiple research groups, NeuroART taps into microscope data streams without the need for modification of microscope control software and is compatible with a wide range of microscope platforms. NeuroART also integrates the capability to drive a spatial light modulator (SLM) for holographic photostimulation of optimal stimulation targets, enabling real-time modification of functional networks. Neurons used for photostimulation experiments were extracted from Sprague Dawley rat embryos of both sexes.</p>

                <p>Advances in single-cell technologies have led to the discovery and characterization of new brain cell types, which in turn lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we present a detailed analysis of single-nucleus (sn)RNA-seq data for three stages of AD from middle temporal gyrus and compare it with snRNA-seq data from the prefrontal cortices from individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD). We observed a significant decrease in both inhibitory and excitatory neurons, in general agreement with previous reports. We observed several cell-type&ndash;specific gene expressions and pathway dysregulations that delineate AD stages. Endothelial and vascular leptomeningeal cells showed the greatest degree of gene expression changes. Cell-type&ndash;specific evidence of neurodegeneration was seen in multiple neuronal cell types particularly in somatostatin and Layer 5 extratelencephalic neurons, among others. Evidence of inflammatory responses was seen in non-neuronal cells, particularly in intermediate and advanced AD. We observed common perturbations in AD and AUD, particularly in pathways, like transcription, translation, apoptosis, autophagy, calcium signaling, neuroinflammation, and phosphorylation, that imply shared transcriptional pathogenic mechanisms and support the role of excessive alcohol intake in AD progression. Major AUD gene markers form and perturb a network of genes significantly associated with intermediate and advanced AD. Master regulator analysis from AUD gene markers revealed significant correlation with advanced AD of transcription factors that have implications in intellectual disability, neuroinflammation, and other neurodegenerative conditions, further suggesting a shared nexus of transcriptional changes between AD and AUD.</p>

                <p>Reelin, a secreted glycoprotein, plays a crucial role in guiding neocortical neuronal migration, dendritic outgrowth and arborization, and synaptic plasticity in the adult brain. Reelin primarily operates through the canonical lipoprotein receptors apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (Apoer2) and very low-density lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr). Reelin also engages with noncanonical receptors and unidentified coreceptors; however, the effects of which are less understood. Using high-throughput tandem mass tag (TMT) liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we identified both shared and unique intracellular pathways activated by Reelin through its canonical and noncanonical signaling in primary murine neurons of either sex during dendritic growth and arborization. We observed pathway cross talk related to regulation of cytoskeleton, neuron projection development, protein transport, and actin filament-based process. We also found enriched gene sets exclusively by the noncanonical Reelin pathway including protein translation, mRNA metabolic process, and ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis suggesting Reelin fine-tunes neuronal structure through distinct signaling pathways. A key discovery is the identification of aldolase A, a glycolytic enzyme and actin-binding protein, as a novel effector of Reelin signaling. Reelin induced de novo translation and mobilization of aldolase A from the actin cytoskeleton. We demonstrated that aldolase A is necessary for Reelin-mediated dendrite growth and arborization in primary murine neurons and mouse brain cortical neurons. Interestingly, the function of aldolase A in dendrite development is independent of its known role in glycolysis. Altogether, our findings provide new insights into the Reelin-dependent signaling pathways and effector proteins that are crucial for dendritic development.</p>

                <p>Cochlear hair cells (HCs) sense sound waves and allow us to hear. Loss of HCs will cause irreversible sensorineural hearing loss. It is well known that DNA damage repair plays a critical role in protecting cells in many organs. However, how HCs respond to DNA damage and how defective DNA damage repair contributes to hearing loss remain elusive. In this study, we showed that cisplatin induced DNA damage in outer hair cells (OHCs) and promoted OHC loss, leading to hearing loss in mice of either sex. Cisplatin induced the expression of Brca1, a DNA damage repair factor, in OHCs. Deficiency of Brca1 induced OHC and hearing loss, and further promoted cisplatin-induced DNA damage in OHCs, accelerating OHC loss. This study provides the first in vivo evidence demonstrating that cisplatin mainly induces DNA damage in OHCs and that BRCA1 promotes repair of DNA damage in OHCs and prevents hearing loss. Our findings not only demonstrate that DNA damage&ndash;inducing agent generates DNA damage in postmitotic HCs but also suggest that DNA repair factors, like BRCA1, protect postmitotic HCs from DNA damage&ndash;induced cell death and hearing loss.</p>

                <p>Human sleep exhibits multiple, recurrent temporal regularities, ranging from circadian rhythms to sleep stage cycles and neuronal oscillations during nonrapid eye movement sleep. Moreover, recent evidence revealed a functional role of aperiodic activity, which reliably discriminates different sleep stages. Aperiodic activity is commonly defined as the spectral slope <I></I> of the 1/frequency (1/f<sup></sup>) decay function of the electrophysiological power spectrum. However, several lines of inquiry now indicate that the aperiodic component of the power spectrum might be better characterized by a superposition of several decay processes with associated timescales. Here, we determined multiple timescales, which jointly shape aperiodic activity using human intracranial electroencephalography. Across three independent studies (47 participants, 23 female), our results reveal that aperiodic activity reliably dissociated sleep stage-dependent dynamics in a regionally specific manner. A principled approach to parametrize aperiodic activity delineated several, spatially and state-specific timescales. Lastly, we employed pharmacological modulation by means of propofol anesthesia to disentangle state-invariant timescales that may reflect physical properties of the underlying neural population from state-specific timescales that likely constitute functional interactions. Collectively, these results establish the presence of multiple intrinsic timescales that define the electrophysiological power spectrum during distinct brain states.</p>

                <p>We recently demonstrated that transient attenuation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, can both prevent and reverse pain associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), a severe side effect of cancer chemotherapy, for which treatment options are limited. Given the reduced efficacy of opioid analgesics to treat neuropathic, compared with inflammatory pain, the cross talk between nociceptor TLR4 and mu-opioid receptors (MORs), and that MOR and TLR4 agonists induce hyperalgesic priming (priming), which also occurs in CIPN, we determined, using male rats, whether (1) antisense knockdown of nociceptor MOR attenuates CIPN, (2) and attenuates the priming associated with CIPN, and (3) CIPN also produces opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). We found that intrathecal MOR antisense prevents and reverses hyperalgesia induced by oxaliplatin and paclitaxel, two common clinical chemotherapy agents. Oxaliplatin-induced priming was also markedly attenuated by MOR antisense. Additionally, intradermal morphine, at a dose that does not affect nociceptive threshold in controls, exacerbates mechanical hyperalgesia (OIH) in rats with CIPN, suggesting the presence of OIH. This OIH associated with CIPN is inhibited by interventions that reverse Type II priming [the combination of an inhibitor of Src and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)], an MOR antagonist, as well as a TLR4 antagonist. Our findings support a role of nociceptor MOR in oxaliplatin-induced pain and priming. We propose that priming and OIH are central to the symptom burden in CIPN, contributing to its chronicity and the limited efficacy of opioid analgesics to treat neuropathic pain.</p>

                <p>The visual world is richly adorned with texture, which can serve to delineate important elements of natural scenes. In anesthetized macaque monkeys, selectivity for the statistical features of natural texture is weak in V1, but substantial in V2, suggesting that neuronal activity in V2 might directly support texture perception. To test this, we investigated the relation between single cell activity in macaque V1 and V2 and simultaneously measured behavioral judgments of texture. We generated stimuli along a continuum between naturalistic texture and phase-randomized noise and trained two macaque monkeys to judge whether a sample texture more closely resembled one or the other extreme. Analysis of responses revealed that individual V1 and V2 neurons carried much less information about texture naturalness than behavioral reports. However, the sensitivity of V2 neurons, especially those preferring naturalistic textures, was significantly closer to that of behavior compared with V1. The firing of both V1 and V2 neurons predicted perceptual choices in response to repeated presentations of the same ambiguous stimulus in one monkey, despite low individual neural sensitivity. However, neither population predicted choice in the second monkey. We conclude that neural responses supporting texture perception likely continue to develop downstream of V2. Further, combined with neural data recorded while the same two monkeys performed an orientation discrimination task, our results demonstrate that choice-correlated neural activity in early sensory cortex is unstable across observers and tasks, untethered from neuronal sensitivity, and therefore unlikely to directly reflect the formation of perceptual decisions.</p>

                <p>The GluN3A subunit of <I>N</I>-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) plays an established role in synapse development, but its contribution to neural circuits in the adult brain is less clear. Recent work has demonstrated that in select cell populations, GluN3A assembles with GluN1 to form GluN1/GluN3A receptors that are insensitive to glutamate and instead serve as functional excitatory glycine receptors (eGlyRs). Our understanding of these eGlyRs, and how they contribute to intrinsic excitability and synaptic communication within relevant networks of the developing and the mature brain, is only beginning to be uncovered. Here, using male and female mice, we demonstrate that GluN3A subunits are enriched in the adult ventral hippocampus (VH), where they localize to synaptic and extrasynaptic sites and can assemble as functional eGlyRs on CA1 pyramidal cells. GluN3A expression was barely detectable in the adult dorsal hippocampus (DH). We also observed a high GluN2B content in the adult VH, characterized by slow NMDAR current decay kinetics and a high sensitivity to the GluN2B-containing NMDAR antagonist ifenprodil. Interestingly, the GluN2B enrichment in the adult VH was dependent on GluN3A as GluN3A deletion accelerated NMDAR decay and reduced ifenprodil sensitivity in the VH, suggesting that GluN3A expression can regulate the balance of conventional NMDAR subunit composition at synaptic sites. Lastly, we found that GluN3A knock-out also enhanced both NMDAR-dependent calcium influx and NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation in the VH. Together, these data reveal a novel role for GluN3A and eGlyRs in the control of ventral hippocampal circuits in the mature brain.</p>

                <p>When faced with danger, human beings respond with a repertoire of defensive behaviors, including freezing and active avoidance. Previous research has revealed a pattern of physiological responses, characterized by heart rate bradycardia, reduced visual exploration, and heightened sympathetic arousal in reaction to avoidable threats, suggesting a state of attentive immobility in humans. However, the electrocortical underpinnings of these behaviors remain largely unexplored. To investigate the visuocortical components of attentive immobility, we recorded parieto-occipital alpha activity, along with eye movements and autonomic responses, while participants awaited either an avoidable, inevitable, or no threat. To test the robustness and generalizability of our findings, we collected data from a total of 101 participants (76 females, 25 males) at two laboratories. Across sites, we observed an enhanced suppression of parieto-occipital alpha activity during avoidable threats, in contrast to inevitable or no threat trials, particularly toward the end of the trial that prompted avoidance responses. This response pattern coincided with heart rate bradycardia, centralization of gaze, and increased sympathetic arousal. Furthermore, our findings expand on previous research by revealing that the amount of alpha suppression, along with centralization of gaze, and heart rate changes predict the speed of motor responses. Collectively, these findings indicate that when individuals encounter avoidable threats, they enter a state of attentive immobility, which enhances perceptual processing and facilitates action preparation. This state appears to reflect freezing-like behavior in humans.</p>

                <p>Rodent jaws evolved structurally to support dual functionality, for either biting or chewing food. Rodent hands also function dually during food handling, for actively manipulating or statically holding food. How are these oral and manual functions coordinated? We combined electrophysiological recording of muscle activity and kilohertz kinematic tracking to analyze masseter and hand actions as mice of both sexes handled food. Masseter activity was organized into two modes synchronized to hand movement modes. In holding/chewing mode, mastication occurred as rhythmic (~5&nbsp;Hz) masseter activity while the hands held food below the mouth. In oromanual/ingestion mode, bites occurred as lower-amplitude aperiodic masseter events that were precisely timed to follow regrips (by ~200&nbsp;ms). Thus, jaw and hand movements are flexibly coordinated during food handling: uncoupled in holding/chewing mode and tightly coordinated in oromanual/ingestion mode as regrip&ndash;bite sequences. Key features of this coordination were captured in a simple model of hierarchically orchestrated mode-switching and intramode action sequencing. We serendipitously detected an additional masseter-related action, tooth sharpening, identified as bouts of higher-frequency (~13&nbsp;Hz) rhythmic masseter activity, which was accompanied by eye displacement, including rhythmic proptosis, attributable to masseter contractions. Collectively, the findings demonstrate how a natural, complex, and goal-oriented activity is organized as an assemblage of distinct modes and complex actions, adapted for the divisions of function arising from anatomical structure. These results reveal intricate, high-speed coordination of disparate effectors and show how natural forms of dexterity can serve as a model for understanding the behavioral neurobiology of multi-body-part coordination.</p>

                <p>Vertebrate nervous systems use the axon initial segment (AIS) to initiate action potentials and maintain neuronal polarity. The microtubule-associated protein tripartite motif containing 46 (TRIM46) was reported to regulate axon specification, AIS assembly, and neuronal polarity through the bundling, or fasciculation, of microtubules in the proximal axon. However, these claims are based on TRIM46 knockdown in cultured neurons. To investigate TRIM46 function in vivo, we examined male and female TRIM46 knock-out mice. Contrary to previous reports, we find that TRIM46 is dispensable for axon specification and AIS formation. TRIM46 knock-out mice are viable, have normal behavior, and have normal brain structure. Thus, TRIM46 is not required for AIS formation, axon specification, or nervous system function. However, we confirm that TRIM46 is required for microtubule fasciculation. We also show TRIM46 enrichment in the first ~100&nbsp;&mu;m of axon occurs independently of ankyrinG (AnkG) in vivo, although AnkG is required to restrict TRIM46 only to the AIS. Our results highlight the need for further investigation of the mechanisms by which the AIS and microtubules interact to shape neuronal structure and function.</p>

                <p>Neural responses are naturally variable from one moment to the next, even when the stimulus is held constant. What factors might underlie this variability in neural population activity? We hypothesized that spontaneous fluctuations in cortical stimulus representations are created by changes in arousal state. We tested the hypothesis using a combination of fMRI, probabilistic decoding methods, and pupillometry. Human participants (20 female, 12 male) were presented with gratings of random orientation. Shortly after viewing the grating, participants reported its orientation and gave their level of confidence in this judgment. Using a probabilistic fMRI decoding technique, we quantified the precision of the stimulus representation in the visual cortex on a trial-by-trial basis. Pupil size was recorded and analyzed to index the observer's arousal state. We found that the precision of the cortical stimulus representation, reported confidence, and variability in the behavioral orientation judgments varied from trial to trial. Interestingly, these trial-by-trial changes in cortical and behavioral precision and confidence were linked to pupil size and its temporal rate of change. Specifically, when the cortical stimulus representation was more precise, the pupil dilated more strongly prior to stimulus onset and remained larger during stimulus presentation. Similarly, stronger pupil dilation during stimulus presentation was associated with higher levels of subjective confidence, a secondary measure of sensory precision, as well as improved behavioral performance. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that spontaneous fluctuations in arousal state modulate the fidelity of the stimulus representation in the human visual cortex, with clear consequences for behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-997/v2?src=rss">A practical approach to febrile cancer patients:  Diagnostic stewardship in Oncology units [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Cancer and cytotoxic chemotherapy used for its treatment predispose to severe and often fatal infections. Prompt diagnosis and timely antibiotic therapy are crucial, with delays in therapy initiation having high mortality. Complete blood count (CBC) is an inexpensive, standardized, and preliminary investigation for the management and follow-up of cancer patients with diagnostic and prognostic value. Method We studied the types of infections associated with various cancers treated with chemotherapy, their etiologies and susceptibility patterns, and the hematological profile of these patients as predictors of infection. Results A total of 21 patients (12 solid and 9 hematological malignancies) presented with 31 febrile episodes. White Blood cell count (2079 cells/cu. mm), percentage of neutrophils (52.9%), absolute neutrophil (137.5 cells/cu. mm), and platelet count (1,77,507 cells/cu. mm) were significantly lower in the 11 patients with febrile neutropenia. The absolute lymphocyte count (412.7 cells/cu. mm) was reduced with a strikingly low Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (6.07) in patients with neutropenia. Laboratory and radiological evidence were present in 14/15 episodes of hematological malignancies (p-0.218) whereas unexplained clinical sepsis was common in solid malignancies (p-0.0202). The majority of documented infections were bacterial, caused by gram-negative bacilli, often showing multi-drug resistance. Infectious etiologies were identified in 71.4% of the patients with febrile neutropenia for >5days. Bacterial infections developed within 2 days of neutropenia, whereas viral and fungal infections manifested in prolonged neutropenia. Multi-site infections and higher mortality rates were observed in patients with febrile neutropenia. (p<0.04) Conclusion Febrile neutropenia is a common complication among patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer, with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Early, rapid, and accurate diagnosis is key to prompt intervention. Hematological parameters such as Total Leukocyte count, platelet count, NLR, and Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio are promising biomarkers in conjunction with morphological changes in neutrophils, thus proving that CBC and peripheral smears are simple, easily available, cost-effective, and highly dependable screening tools, especially in resource-poor settings.

                <p>by Wei Liu, Huaqin He, Davide Chicco</p>

Over the past two decades, extensive studies, particularly in cancer analysis through large datasets like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have aimed at improving patient therapies and precision medicine. However, limited overlap and inconsistencies among gene signatures across different cohorts pose challenges. The dynamic nature of the transcriptome, encompassing diverse RNA species and functional complexities at gene and isoform levels, introduces intricacies, and current gene signatures face reproducibility issues due to the unique transcriptomic landscape of each patient. In this context, discrepancies arising from diverse sequencing technologies, data analysis algorithms, and software tools further hinder consistency. While careful experimental design, analytical strategies, and standardized protocols could enhance reproducibility, future prospects lie in multiomics data integration, machine learning techniques, open science practices, and collaborative efforts. Standardized metrics, quality control measures, and advancements in single-cell RNA-seq will contribute to unbiased gene signature identification. In this perspective article, we outline some thoughts and insights addressing challenges, standardized practices, and advanced methodologies enhancing the reliability of gene signatures in disease transcriptomic research.

                Many studies report the importance of using feces as source sample for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19 symptoms but who are negative to oropharyngeal/ nasopharyngeal tests. Here, we report the case of an asymptomatic child whose family members had negative results with the rapid antigen nasopharyngeal swab tests. The 21-month-old child presented with fever, diarrhea, bilateral conjunctivitis, and conspicuous lacrimation. In this study, analysis for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal samples by using Luminex technology allowed accurate detection of the presence of the viral RNA in the feces of the child and of all her relatives, which thus resulted to be positive but asymptomatic. It is the first time that SARS-CoV-2- is observed inside the bacteria of the human gut microbiome and outside a matrix resembling extracellular bacterial lysates, in agreement with a bacteriophage mechanism with the images obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), post-embedding immunogold, and by fluorescence microscope. In addition to the typical observations of respiratory symptoms, accurate evaluation of clinical gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, combined with efficient highly sensitive molecular testing on feces, represent an efficient approach for detecting SARS-CoV-2, and for providing the correct therapy in challenging COVID-19 cases, like the one here reported.

                Background Nurses play an essential role in patient care, and nurse-patient relationship are a fundamental aspect of healthcare delivery. Research has indicated that oncology nurses are particularly susceptible to burnout. However, there is limited research on nurse burnout in oncology, particularly in the Arab Muslim world. Objective This study aimed to investigate burnout among oncology nurses and analyze its association with professional and sociodemographic factors. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with oncology nurses at the Salah Azaiz Institute. We assessed socio-demographic data, work variables, job satisfaction, and burnout using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Results Of the nurses surveyed, 78 responded correctly to the questionnaire. The median age of participants was 37 years, with a predominance of females (52.6%). The median duration of oncology work was 11 years. Regarding job satisfaction, 30.8% were somewhat dissatisfied, and 24.4% were not satisfied. The prevalence of burnout was 89.9%, with 73.1% experiencing high levels of emotional exhaustion, 48.7% high levels of depersonalization, and 25.6% a low level of personal accomplishment. Personal medical and psychiatric history, along with job satisfaction, emerged as the strongest predictors of burnout in the multivariate analysis. Conclusion This study highlights the significant prevalence of burnout among nurses in oncology settings. In Tunisia, there is an urgent need to prioritize the psychological well-being of oncology nurses. Preventive strategies should emphasize enhancing working conditions to reduce these risks.

                Background Hormonal changes in pregnancy and their induced effect on periodontal health are well documented. The present study is aimed at the potential repercussions of multiple pregnancies on periodontal health. Materials and methods Our study utilized data from key sections of the NHANES. All the pertaining and relevant data for the study is collected. Our exposure variable was the number of pregnancies, and the outcome variable was periodontal disease. The number of pregnancies is classified as one, two, three, four, or more. Age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, poverty/income ratio, marital status, and other variables. Multiple logistic regression models were employed to assess the impact of multiple pregnancies on periodontal disease. Result The crude and multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that none of the variables were significantly associated with the prevalence of periodontitis. In univariate analysis, patients with one or two pregnancies had higher odds of experiencing periodontitis (OR 1.154, 95% CI 0.748-1.779), (OR 1.464, 95% CI 0.864-2.483) respectively. However, these associations did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion Within the limitation of the study, there is no significant relationship between parity and the prevalence of periodontitis, the longitudinal study may be warranted to delve deeper into any potential associations.

                The use of big data analytics (BDAs) allows for the collection, management, and analysis of large volumes of data, which helps in making real-time decisions. This study aims to assess how the application of BDA impacts the performance of healthcare supply chain management (HCSCMP). Through a systematic literature review, the research explores how BDA enhances efficiency within healthcare supply chains (HCSCs) and identifies the critical factors enabling successful BDA implementation. A comprehensive search strategy was employed to analyze 65 papers, resulting in the inclusion of 39 studies published between 2016 and 2023. The review revealed a preference for literature reviews and questionnaires as the primary research methods. The findings indicate that BDA significantly improves HCSCs' efficiency, particularly in real-time decision-making and operational management. However, successful BDA implementation depends on addressing critical enablers and overcoming associated challenges.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the longitudinal dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) under B-cell depleting therapy (BCDT) and their capacity to prognosticate future progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) events.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 362 pwMS (1,480 samples) starting BCDT in the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Cohort were included. sGFAP levels in 2,861 control persons (4,943 samples) provided normative data to calculate adjusted Z scores.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Elevated sGFAP levels (Z score &gt;1) at 1 year were associated with a higher hazard for PIRA (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.80 [95% CI: 1.17–2.78]; <i>p</i> = 0.0079) than elevated sNfL levels (HR, 1.45 [0.95–2.24], <i>p</i> = 0.0886) in a combined model. Independent of PIRA events, sGFAP levels longitudinally increased by 0.49 Z score units per 10 years follow-up (estimate, 0.49 [0.29, 0.69], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). In patients experiencing PIRA, sGFAP Z scores were 0.52 Z score units higher versus stable patients (0.52 [0.22, 0.83], <i>p</i> = 0.0009). Different sNfL Z score trajectories were found in pwMS with versus without PIRA (interaction <i>p</i> = 0.0028), with an average decrease of 0.92 Z score units per 10 years observed without PIRA (−0.92 [−1.23, −0.60], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), whereas levels in patients with PIRA remained high.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Elevated sGFAP and lack of drop in sNfL after BCDT start are associated with increased risk of future PIRA. These findings provide a rationale for combined monitoring of sNfL and sGFAP in pwMS starting BCDT to predict the risk of PIRA, and to use sGFAP as an outcome in clinical trials aiming to impact on MS progressive disease biology.

                DVE-1 is well recognized as a key regulator of mitoUPR in C. elegans. However, Sheng et al. show that DVE-1 can affect longevity through various pathways independent of mitoUPR. These longevity pathways reduce DVE-1 nuclear accumulation and promote its cytosolic translocation, indicating a role for cytosolic DVE-1 in lifespan regulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90624">Supercomputer framework for reverse engineering firing patterns of neuron populations to identify their synaptic inputs</a></h4>

              
                In this study, we develop new reverse engineering (RE) techniques to identify the organization of the synaptic inputs generating firing patterns of populations of neurons. We tested these techniques in silico to allow rigorous evaluation of their effectiveness, using remarkably extensive parameter searches enabled by massively-parallel computation on supercomputers. We chose spinal motoneurons as our target neural system, since motoneurons process all motor commands and have well-established input-output properties. One set of simulated motoneurons was driven by 300,000+ simulated combinations of excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory inputs. Our goal was to determine if these firing patterns had sufficient information to allow RE identification of the input combinations. Like other neural systems, the motoneuron input-output system is likely non-unique. This non-uniqueness could potentially limit this RE approach, as many input combinations can produce similar outputs. However, our simulations revealed that firing patterns contained sufficient information to sharply restrict the solution space. Thus, our RE approach successfully generated estimates of the actual simulated patterns of excitation, inhibition, and neuromodulation, with variances accounted for ranging from 75–90%. It was striking that nonlinearities induced in firing patterns by the neuromodulation inputs did not impede RE, but instead generated distinctive features in firing patterns that aided RE. These simulations demonstrate the potential of this form of RE analysis. It is likely that the ever-increasing capacity of supercomputers will allow increasingly accurate RE of neuron inputs from their firing patterns from many neural systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92982">Hypothalamic representation of the imminence of predator threat detected by the vomeronasal organ in mice</a></h4>

              
                Animals have the innate ability to select optimal defensive behaviors with appropriate intensity within specific contexts. The vomeronasal organ (VNO) serves as a primary sensory channel for detecting predator cues by relaying signals to the medial hypothalamic nuclei, particularly the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), which directly controls defensive behavioral outputs. Here, we demonstrate that cat saliva contains predator cues that signal the imminence of predator threat and modulate the intensity of freezing behavior through the VNO in mice. Cat saliva activates VNO neurons expressing the V2R-A4 subfamily of sensory receptors, and the number of VNO neurons activated in response to saliva correlates with both the freshness of saliva and the intensity of freezing behavior. Moreover, the number of VMH neurons activated by fresh, but not old, saliva positively correlates with the intensity of freezing behavior. Detailed analyses of the spatial distribution of activated neurons, as well as their overlap within the same individual mice, revealed that fresh and old saliva predominantly activate distinct neuronal populations within the VMH. Collectively, this study suggests that there is an accessory olfactory circuit in mice that is specifically tuned to time-sensitive components of cat saliva, which optimizes their defensive behavior to maximize their chance of survival according to the imminence of threat.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97896">Negative regulation of APC/C activation by MAPK-mediated attenuation of Cdc20Slp1 under stress</a></h4>

              
                Mitotic anaphase onset is a key cellular process tightly regulated by multiple kinases. The involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in this process has been established in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts. However, the detailed regulatory cascade remains elusive, and it is also unknown whether the MAPK-dependent mitotic regulation is evolutionarily conserved in the single-cell eukaryotic organisms such as fission yeast (<i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>). Here, we show that two MAPKs in <i>S. pombe</i> indeed act in concert to restrain anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) activity upon activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). One MAPK, Pmk1, binds to and phosphorylates Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>, the co-activator of APC/C. Phosphorylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> by Pmk1, but not by Cdk1, promotes its subsequent ubiquitylation and degradation. Intriguingly, Pmk1-mediated phosphorylation event is also required to sustain SAC under environmental stress. Thus, our study establishes a new underlying molecular mechanism of negative regulation of APC/C by MAPK upon stress stimuli, and provides a previously unappreciated framework for regulation of anaphase entry in eukaryotic cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92201">A Plasmodium falciparum MORC protein complex modulates epigenetic control of gene expression through interaction with heterochromatin</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic control of gene expression is critical for blood stage development of malaria parasites. Here, we used multi-omic analyses to investigate transcriptional regulation by the chromatin-associated microrchidia protein, MORC, during asexual blood stage development of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>. We show that <i>Pf</i>MORC (PF3D7_1468100) interacts with a suite of nuclear proteins, including APETALA2 (ApiAP2) transcription factors (<i>Pf</i>AP2-G5, <i>Pf</i>AP2-O5, <i>Pf</i>AP2-I, PF3D7_0420300, PF3D7_0613800, PF3D7_1107800, and PF3D7_1239200), a DNA helicase DS60 (PF3D7_1227100), and other chromatin remodelers (<i>Pf</i>CHD1 and <i>Pf</i>EELM2). Transcriptomic analysis of <i>Pf</i>MORC<sup>HA-glmS</sup> knockdown parasites revealed 163 differentially expressed genes belonging to hypervariable multigene families, along with upregulation of genes mostly involved in host cell invasion. In vivo genome-wide chromatin occupancy analysis during both trophozoite and schizont stages of development demonstrates that <i>Pf</i>MORC is recruited to repressed, multigene families, including the <i>var</i> genes in subtelomeric chromosomal regions. Collectively, we find that <i>Pf</i>MORC is found in chromatin complexes that play a role in the epigenetic control of asexual blood stage transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99282">Intestinal microbiome dysbiosis increases Mycobacteria pulmonary colonization in mice by regulating the Nos2-associated pathways</a></h4>

              
                Increasing researches reveal gut microbiota was associated with the development of tuberculosis (TB). How to prevent or reduce <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> colonization in the lungs is a key measure to prevent TB. However, the data on gut microbiota preventing <i>Mycobacterium</i> colonization in the lungs were scarce. Here, we established the clindamycin-inducing intestinal microbiome dysbiosis and fecal microbial transplantation models in mice to identify gut microbiota’s effect on <i>Mycobacterium</i>’s colonization in the mouse lungs and explore its potential mechanisms. The results showed that clindamycin treatment altered the diversity and composition of the intestinal bacterial and fungal microbiome, weakened the trans-kingdom network interactions between bacteria and fungi, and induced gut microbiome dysbiosis in the mice. Gut microbiota dysbiosis increases intestinal permeability and enhances the susceptibility of <i>Mycobacterium</i> colonization in the lungs of mice. The potential mechanisms were gut microbiota dysbiosis altered the lung transcriptome and increased <i>Nos2</i> expression through the ‘gut–lung axis’. <i>Nos2</i> high expression disrupts the intracellular antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory environment by increasing the concentration of nitric oxide, decreasing the levels of reactive oxygen species and <i>Defb1</i> in the cells, and promoting <i>Mycobacteria</i> colonization in the lungs of mice. The present study raises a potential strategy for reducing the risks of <i>Mycobacteria</i> infections and transmission by regulating the gut microbiome balance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96543">PVN-mPFC OT projections modulate pup-directed pup care or attacking in virgin mandarin voles</a></h4>

              
                Many species of animals exhibit caregiving or aggression toward conspecific offspring. The neural mechanisms underlying the infanticide and pup care remain poorly understood. Here, using monogamous mandarin voles (<i>Microtus mandarinus</i>), we found that more oxytocin (OT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) were activated during pup caring than infanticide. Optogenetic activation of OT neurons in the PVN facilitated pup caring in male and female mandarin voles. In infanticide voles, optogenetic activation of PVN OT cells or PVN-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) OT projection fibers prolonged latency to approach and attack pups, whereas inhibition of these OT neurons or projections facilitated approach and infanticide. Optogenetic activation of PVN OT neuron projections to the mPFC in males shortened the latency to approach and retrieve pups and facilitated the initiation of pup care, but produced no effects on pup-care females. In addition, OT release in the mPFC increased upon approaching and retrieving pups, and decreased upon attacking pups. Intraperitoneal injection of OT promoted pup care and inhibited infanticide behavior. It is suggested that the OT system, especially PVN OT neurons projecting to mPFC, modulates pup-directed behaviors and OT can be used to treat abnormal behavioral responses associated with some psychological diseases such as depression and psychosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95371">Rabphilin-3A negatively regulates neuropeptide release, through its SNAP25 interaction</a></h4>

              
                Neuropeptides and neurotrophins are stored in and released from dense core vesicles (DCVs). While DCVs and synaptic vesicles (SVs) share fundamental SNARE/SM proteins for exocytosis, a detailed understanding of DCV exocytosis remains elusive. We recently identified the RAB3-RIM1 pathway to be essential for DCV, but not SV exocytosis, highlighting a significant distinction between the SV and DCV secretory pathways. Whether RIM1 is the only RAB3 effector that is essential for DCV exocytosis is currently unknown. In this study, we show that rabphilin-3A (RPH3A), a known downstream effector of RAB3A, is a negative regulator of DCV exocytosis. Using live-cell imaging at single-vesicle resolution with RPH3A deficient hippocampal mouse neurons, we show that DCV exocytosis increased threefold in the absence of RPH3A. RAB3A-binding deficient RPH3A lost its punctate distribution, but still restored DCV exocytosis to WT levels when re-expressed. SNAP25-binding deficient RPH3A did not rescue DCV exocytosis. In addition, we show that RPH3A did not travel with DCVs, but remained stationary at presynapses. RPH3A null neurons also had longer neurites, which was partly restored when ablating all regulated secretion with tetanus neurotoxin. Taken together, these results show that RPH3A negatively regulates DCV exocytosis, potentially also affecting neuron size. Furthermore, RAB3A interaction is required for the synaptic enrichment of RPH3A, but not for limiting DCV exocytosis. Instead, the interaction of RPH3A with SNAP25 is relevant for inhibiting DCV exocytosis.

">Building neurovascular tissue from autologous blood for modeling brain-activity</a></h4>

              
                There are no faithful individualized stem cell-based bioengineered neuro-vascularized models that can recapitulate the physiological hemodynamic phenomenon of neuro-vascular coupling (NVC)- the principal behind BOLD (blood oxygen level- dependent) signal in functional neuroimaging, thereby dissuading the research in exploring the brain activity-based investigative studies in neurological/neurosensory diseases. This encouraged us to establish a preclinical optoacoustic (Hb/dHb hemoglobin/deoxyhemoglobin) imaging-competent in vitro neuro-vascularized model by employing a novel cellular reprograming PITTRep (Plasma Induced Transcriptomics/ epi-Transcriptomics Reprograming) approach. The current reprograming approach is based on coaxing autologous blood components to ecto-mesodermal lineage intermediates that can subsequently self-pattern into neurovascular tissue by harnessing the hemorheological properties of RBCs. The nature of blood flow is non-Newtonian and is a function of RBC concentration /haematocrit when they flow through the regions of low shear rates as seen in cerebral microcirculation. The current reprograming approach is a modification of our previous cellular reprograming approach that employed a Newtonian plasma fluid. We tested a potential (yet completely unexplored) hypothesis of haemodynamic reprograming by leveraging the fluid mechanic feature of blood erythrocytes as seen in thrombus formation during cerebral ischemic stroke, that is characterized by physiologically intriguing yet clinically meaningful neurological recovery during an early time window. Intriguingly, post-stroke heightened neuroplasticity marked by dendrites, synapses, astrogliosis, microglia activation, and growth factor signaling is accompanied by adult neurogenesis, that is otherwise a non-resilient phenomenon. The current study attempted to induce a post stroke-like (adult) neurogenesis with functional synaptogenesis by instructing autologous blood components into thrombus formation by incorporation of erythrocytes in varying concentrations. The induction of neuro-vascularized niches (NVNs) and functional neuro vascular coupling (NVC) was characterized by confocal microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, proteomic profiling, and Hb/dHb spectra based optoacoustic imaging. The blood thrombus formation was checked by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), and switching of adult to embryonic hemoglobin was confirmed by hemoglobin typing. We also attempted to establish patient-specific neuro-vascularized niches from autologous blood of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) patients. The individualized neovascularised tissues are intended to be employed for investigating deregulated synaptic plasticity/ long term potentiation underlying poor auditory comprehension outcomes in school going kids suffering from SNHL that greatly compromises their academic performance and socio-behavioural-cognitive development. The attendant multiomics of patient-specific NVNs may have potential implications in developing potential stem cell based therapies for neurosensory and cerebrovascular diseases.

">Perceptual Expertise and Attention: An Exploration using Deep Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual expertise and attention are two important factors that enable superior object recognition and task performance. While expertise enhances knowledge and provides a holistic understanding of the environment, attention allows us to selectively focus on task-related information and suppress distraction. It has been suggested that attention operates differently in experts and in novices and much remains unknown. This study investigates the relationship between perceptual expertise and attention using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are shown to be good models of primate visual pathways. Two CNN models were trained to become experts in either face or scene recognition, and the effect of attention on performance was evaluated in tasks involving complex stimuli, such as merged images containing superimposed faces and scenes. The goal was to explore how feature-based attention (FBA) influences recognition within and outside the models' domain of expertise. Results showed that each model performed better in its area of expertise and that FBA further enhanced task performance only within the domain of expertise, increasing performance by up to 35% in scene recognition and 15% in face recognition. However, attention had reduced or negative effects when applied outside the model's expertise domain. Neural unit-level analysis revealed that expertise leads to stronger neuronal tuning towards category-specific features and sharper tuning curves, reflected in greater representational dissimilarity between targets and distractors, which, according to the biased competition model of attention, reduces competition and leads to enhanced performance. These findings highlight the critical role of neural tuning at the single neuron level as well as at the level of multivariate neural representations in distinguishing the effects of attention in experts and in novices and demonstrate that CNNs can be used fruitfully as computational models for addressing neuroscience questions not practical with the empirical methods.

">Enhanced Hippocampal Spare Capacity in Q175DN Mice Despite Elevated mHTT Aggregation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder causing severe motor, cognitive, and psychiatric impairments, primarily affecting the striatum, which is crucial for movement and cognition. However, the role of the hippocampus in HD-related learning and memory deficits remains unclear. Objective: This study investigates the association between mHTT aggregation and neuropathology in the striatum and hippocampus of two HD mouse models. Methods: We performed a comparative analysis of neuropathology between zQ175 and in-house generated Q175DN mice, focusing on HTT aggregation, neuronal and glial pathology, chaperone expression, and synaptic density in both brain regions. Results: Q175DN mice exhibited increased mHTT aggregation in both the striatum and hippocampus compared to zQ175. Striatal neurons showed greater vulnerability to mHTT accumulation than hippocampal neurons in Q175DN, despite high mHTT levels in both regions. Interestingly, the Q175DN hippocampus displayed increased synaptic density, reduced Iba1+ microglia density, and elevated HSF1 levels in specific hippocampal subregions compared to zQ175 and neuropathology did not correlate with HTT aggregation. Conclusions: Q175DN mice are instrumental in elucidating the varying susceptibilities of striatal and other neuronal types to mHTT toxicity. The high spare capacity of the HD hippocampus suggests that cognitive deficits in HD may stem from striatal dysfunction or other brain regions involved in cognition, rather than from hippocampal degeneration.

">Dissociation of movement and outcome representations in metacognition of agency</a></h4>

              
                We studied the role of movement and outcome information in forming metacognitive representations of agency. Participants completed a goal-oriented task, a virtual version of a ball-throwing game. In two conditions, we manipulated either the visual representation of the throwing movement or its distal outcome (the resulting ball flight/trajectory). We measured participants' accuracy in a discrimination agency task, as well as confidence in their responses and tested for differences in the electrophysiological (EEG) signal using linear mixed effect models. We found no mean differences between participants' metacognitive efficiency between conditions, but we also found that metacognitive sensitivity did not correlate between the two conditions, suggesting a dissociation in their underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, exploratory analyses pointed toward a difference in the EEG signal between the two conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that while movement and outcome information contribute equally to participants sense of agency, they may do so through distinct underlying processes.

">ATP-gated P2x7 receptor is a major channel type at type II auditory nerves and required for hearing sensitivity efferent controlling and noise protection</a></h4>

              
                Hearing sensitivity and noise protection are mediated and determined by negative feedback of the cochlear efferent system. Type II auditory nerves (ANs) innervate outer hair cells (OHCs) in the cochlea and provide an input to this efferent control. However, little is known about underlying channel information. Here, we report that ATP-gated P2x7 receptor had a predominant expression at type II ANs and the synaptic areas under inner hair cells and OHCs with lateral and medial olivocochlear efferent nerves. Knockout (KO) of P2x7 increased hearing sensitivity with enhanced acoustic startle response (ASR), auditory brainstem response (ABR), and cochlear microphonics (CM) by increasing OHC electromotility, an active cochlear amplifier in mammals. P2x7 KO also increased susceptibility to noise. Middle level noise exposure could impair active cochlear mechanics resulting in permanent hearing loss in P2x7 KO mice. These data demonstrate that P2x7 receptors have a critical role in type II AN function and the cochlear efferent system to control hearing sensitivity; deficiency of P2x7 receptors can impair the cochlear efferent suppression leading to hearing oversensitivity and susceptibility to noise.

">Trade-off between search costs and accuracy in oculomotor and manual search tasks</a></h4>

              
                Humans must weigh various factors when choosing between competing courses of action. In case of eye movements, for example, a recent study demonstrated that the human oculomotor system trades off the temporal costs of eye movements against their perceptual benefits, when choosing between competing visual search targets. Here, we compared such trade-offs between different effectors. Participants were shown search displays with targets and distractors from two stimulus sets. In each trial, they chose which target to search for, and, after finding it, discriminated a target feature. Targets differed in their search costs (how many target-similar distractors were shown) and discrimination difficulty. Participants were rewarded or penalized based on whether the target's feature was discriminated correctly. Additionally, participants were given limited time to complete trials. Critically, they inspected search items either by eye movements only or by manual actions (tapping a stylus on a tablet). Results show that participants traded off search costs and discrimination difficulty of competing targets for both effectors, allowing them to perform close to the predictions of an ideal observer model. However, behavioral analysis and computational modelling revealed that oculomotor search performance was more strongly constrained by decision-noise (what target to choose) and sampling-noise (what information to sample during search) than manual search. We conclude that the trade-off between search costs and discrimination accuracy constitutes a general mechanism to optimize decision-making, regardless of the effector used. However, slow-paced manual actions are more robust against the detrimental influence of noise, compared to fast-paced eye movements.

">Behavioral and neural alterations of the ventral tegmental area by Cafeteria diet exposure in rats</a></h4>

              
                The brain reward system is essential for regulating appetitive and consummatory behaviors in response to various incentive stimuli. Junk food, known for its high palatability, is particularly associated with the potential for excessive consumption. While previous studies have shown that excessive junk food intake can impact reward circuitry, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Additionally, it is unknown whether the functionality of this brain system is similarly altered in response to other natural rewards. In this study, we used fiber photometry combined with a behavioral reward test to investigate how six weeks of excessive cafeteria (CAF) diet consumption affects VTA neural activity and behavioral responses to food and sexual rewards in sexually experienced female rats. For the first time, we demonstrate that prolonged exposure to a CAF diet decreases interest in a food reward, resulting in reduced consumption. These behavioral changes were accompanied by diminished neural activity in the VTA. Similarly, but to a lesser extent, reductions in VTA activity responses were observed in response to a sexual partner, although no significant behavioral differences were detected during sexual interactions. Furthermore, a two-week reversal diet of standard chow was insufficient to restore VTA neural activity in CAF-exposed animals, which continued to show decreased VTA responses to both food rewards and sexual partners. Our findings suggest that prolonged junk food exposure leads to desensitization of the VTA, a key node in the brain's reward circuitry, resulting in reduced responsiveness to natural rewards.

">Prefoldin 5 is a microtubule-associated protein that suppresses Tau-aggregation and neurotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies represent a major class of neurodegenerative disorders associated with intracellular aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein Tau. To identify molecular modulators of Tau toxicity, we used a genetic screen to identify protein chaperones whose RNAi-mediated knockdown could modulate hTauV337M-induced eye-ommatidial degeneration in Drosophila. This screen identified the Prefoldins Pfdn5 and Pfdn6 as strong modifiers of hTauV337M cytotoxicity. Consistent with the known function of Pfdn as a cotranslational chaperone for tubulin, Pfdn5 mutants showed substantially reduced levels of tubulin monomer. However, additional microtubule-related functions were indicated by the robust unexpected association of Pfdn5 with axonal microtubules in vivo, as well as binding with stabilized microtubules in biochemical assays. Loss of Pfdn5 resulted in neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) defects similar to those previously described in hTau-expressing flies: namely, increased supernumerary boutons and fewer microtubule loops within mature presynaptic boutons. Significantly, synaptic phenotypes caused by hTauV337M overexpression were also strongly enhanced in a Pfdn5 mutant background. Consistent with a role in modulating Tau toxicity, not only did loss of Pfdn5 result in increased accumulations of Tau-aggregates in hTauV337M expressing neurons, but also neuronal overexpression of Prefoldin strikingly ameliorated age-dependent neurodegeneration and memory deficits induced by pathological hTau. Together, these and other observations described herein: (a) provide new insight into Prefoldin-microtubule interactions; (b) point to essential posttranslational roles for Pfdn5 in controlling Tau-toxicity in vivo; and (c) demonstrate that Pfdn5 overexpression is sufficient to restrict Tau-induced neurodegeneration.

">Human Brain-Wide Activation of Sleep Rhythms</a></h4>

              
                During sleep, our brain undergoes highly synchronized activity, orchestrated by distinct neural rhythms. Little is known about the associated brain activation during these sleep rhythms, and even less about their functional implications. In this study, we investigated the brain-wide activation underlying human sleep rhythms by employing simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 107 participants during overnight sleep. We identified a significant coupling between slow oscillations (SO) and spindle events during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, particularly at the UP-state of SOs. This coupling was associated with increased activation in the thalamus and hippocampus, showing a brain-wide activation that resembles episodic memory processing, yet is distinctly dissociated from task-related activation. Moreover, this SO-spindle coupling was linked to a selective increase in functional connectivity from the hippocampus to the thalamus, and from the thalamus to the neocortex, particularly the medial prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that the thalamus plays a crucial role in coordinating the hippocampal-cortical dialogue during sleep.

">Implied motion guides neither gaze following nor intention attribution</a></h4>

              
                The gaze beam hypothesis (GBH) of gaze following posits that the other's eyes emit imaginary beams of moving energy travelling to the other's object of attention, drawing the observer's attention to the same object. This idea was initially supported by behavioral experiments showing a motion aftereffect (MAE), indicated by longer reaction times in detecting motion direction after viewing a cartoon face looking at an object in the same direction. However, this effect could also be expected if the observer used gaze direction to assume an intentional link between the looker and the object, envisioning directed actions toward the latter. To critically compare the two hypotheses, we tested whether an MAE could be induced by having human subjects detect motion direction after viewing various cue images, designed to differentiate the explanatory power of the two. Cues either suggested a connection between an agent and an object through the agent's gaze or an object-oriented intention by the presence of equipment in the agent's hand, without the agent directly looking at the object. Using Bayesian statistics, our findings provided strong evidence against both hypotheses at the population level, as reaction time modulations did not align with the MAE, leading us to reject motion adaptation as the underlying mechanism for gaze following but also intention attribution. As on an individual level we observed highly diverse effects, with some compatible with one or the other hypothesis, we assume that individual subjects may resort to different perceptual strategies based on different scene interpretations.

">Dynamic Multiday Seizure Cycles in a Tetanus Toxin Rat Model of Epilepsy: Evolving Rhythms and Implications for Prediction</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent, unpredictable seizures that impose significant challenges in daily management and treatment. One emerging area of interest is the identification of seizure cycles, including multiday patterns, which may offer insights into seizure prediction and treatment optimization. This study investigated multiday seizure cycles in a Tetanus Toxin (TT) rat model of epilepsy. Six TT-injected rats were observed over a 40-day period, with continuous EEG monitoring to record seizure events. Wavelet transform analysis revealed significant multiday cycles in seizure occurrences, with periods ranging from 4 to 7 days across different rats. Synchronization Index (SI) analysis demonstrated variable phase locking, with some rats showing strong synchronization of seizures with specific phases of the cycle. Importantly, the study revealed that these seizure cycles are dynamic and evolve over time, with some rats exhibiting shifts in cycle periods during the recording period. This suggests that the underlying neural mechanisms driving these cycles may change as the epileptic state progresses. The identification of stable and evolving multiday rhythms in seizure activity, independent of external factors, highlights a potential intrinsic biological basis for seizure timing. These findings offer promising avenues for improving seizure forecasting and designing personalized, timing-based therapeutic interventions in epilepsy. Future research should explore the underlying neural mechanisms and clinical applications of multiday seizure cycles.

                Objective: Accelerated biological aging is a plausible and modifiable determinant of dementia burden facing minoritized communities, but is not well-studied in these historically underrepresented populations. Our objective was to preliminarily characterize relationships between telomere length and cognitive health among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) and Black/African American (B/AA) middle-aged and older adults. Methods: This study included data on telomere length and neuropsychological test performance from 187 participants, enrolled in one of two community-based cognitive aging cohorts and who identified their primary race as AI/AN or B/AA. Results: Nested multivariable regression models revealed preliminary evidence for associations between telomere length and cognitive performance, and these associations were partially independent of chronological age. Discussion: Small sample size limited estimate precision, however, findings suggest future work on telomere length and cognitive health in underrepresented populations at high risk for dementia is feasible and valuable as a foundation for social and behavioral intervention research.

">Treadmill step training promotes corticospinal tract plasticity after incomplete spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injury (SCI) often impairs motor functions such as voluntary movement and fine motor control, with the corticospinal tract (CST) being a crucial pathway affected. While CST-targeted rehabilitation, such as treadmill training, supports motor recovery, gaps remain in understanding the topographical changes within the CST and how they correlate with behavioral outcomes. In this study, we utilized a custom Emx1Cre;LSL-SynGFP mouse line to quantify CST plasticity following moderate contusion SCI, both with and without exercise (treadmill) training. Fluorescent labeling of cortical synapses allowed for detailed visualization of descending CST rewiring, and we assessed its relationship to behavioral outcomes, including kinematics analysis and motivational state. Mice were stratified by motivational state using the Progressive Ratio Assay, and locomotor recovery was evaluated through the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS), joint/limb kinematics, and Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) analysis. Our findings indicate that treadmill training enhances CST rewiring, especially in highly motivated animals, leading to increased synaptic density in the ventral horn and improved BMS subscores. Motivation further influenced specific kinematic parameters, such as toe clearance, while treadmill training significantly improved speed by reducing the stance phase. Results suggest that while treadmill training induces broad beneficial outcomes, motivation may fine-tune recovery, influencing neural circuit and behavioral changes. This suggests multiple mechanisms converge to promote recovery - those we cannot control and those we can. These results underscore the combined role of task-specific training and also perhaps motivation in driving CST plasticity and functional recovery after SCI.

">Network mechanisms in rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism</a></h4>

              
                Background: Rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP) is a rare neurological disorder caused by mutations in the ATP1A3 gene. Symptoms are characterized by a dystonia-parkinsonism. Recently, experimental studies have shown that the pathophysiology of the disease is based on a combined dysfunction of the cerebellum (CB) and basal ganglia (BG) and that blocking their interaction can alleviate the symptoms. The underlying network mechanisms have not been studied so far. Objective: Our aim was to characterize neuronal network activity in the BG and CB and motor cortex in the ouabain model of RDP by site-specific infusion of ouabain. Methods: Rats were chronically infused with ouabain either in the CB, striatum (STR) or at both places simultaneously. Motor behavior was scored using published rating systems. Parallel in vivo recordings of local field potentials (LFP) from M1, deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) were performed. Data were compared to untreated controls. Results: Ouabain infusion into the cerebellum produced severe dystonia that was associated with increased high-frequency gamma oscillations in the DCNs, which were subsequently transmitted to the BG and M1. Striatal infusion led to parkinsonism and elevated beta-oscillations in SNr that were transmitted to the CB and M1. The simultaneous application of STRs and CB with ouabain resulted in dystonia-parkinsonism and increased beta oscillations in BG, CB, and M1. Conclusion: We demonstrate that symptom-specific beta and gamma oscillations can be transmitted between the BG and CB, which is likely to be very important for the understanding of disease mechanisms.

">Paroxysmal Slow Wave Events as a diagnostic and predictive biomarker for post-traumatic epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major global health concern, affecting more than 40 million people annually. While most cases are mild and present with light symptoms, repeated mild injuries can result in delayed brain pathologies, including cognitive decline, neuropsychiatric complications, and post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). PTE refers to recurring, unprovoked seizures occurring at least one week after TBI. While the link between moderate to severe TBI and PTE is well established, the epileptogenesis after repetitive mild TBI (rmTBI) is seldom studied. Currently, there are no biomarkers to identify those at risk of developing PTE, and its diagnosis is challenging. Here, we used a rat model to study PTE following rmTBI and assessed human EEG data to identify potential biomarkers for PTE. We employed a closed head TBI model to induce rmTBI, and recorded brain activity using electrocorticography (ECoG) between 2- and 6-months post-injury. Behavioral assessments and post-mortem analysis were also conducted. In humans, we analyzed EEG recordings from the Temple University database to investigate the potential of EEG-derived features for diagnosing PTE. At 6 months post injury, 70% of rmTBI animals developed PTE, compared to 22% in the control group (P=0.01). While neurological assessments following injury did not predict PTE, paroxysmal slow wave events (PSWEs) were found to be a reliable biomarker for PTE prediction. In humans, the percentage time in PSWEs was significantly elevated in PTE patients with epileptiform activity. In conclusion, we suggest PSWEs as a non-invasive, cost-effective biomarker for PTE in rodents and human patients.

">Deficient Memory, Long-Term Potentiation and Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity in Galectin-4-KO Mice.</a></h4>

              
                Intestinal infections trigger inflammation and can contribute to degenerative and cognitive brain pathologies through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Galectin-4 is an intestinal lectin key in the control of pathogenic bacterial infections. Here we report that galectin-4 deficient mice (Lgals4-KO) show an altered intestinal commensal microbiota in the absence of pathogens, defining a new role of galectin-4 in the modulation of commensal bacteria. Strikingly, Lgals4-KO mice present a deficient memory formation, and impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in vivo and ex vivo. Furthermore, Lgals4-KO neurons show a reduced activation of the AMPA receptor and of the CaMKII upon chemically induced LTP in vitro. These mice also display significantly lower dendritic spine density and shorter spine length in hippocampal dendrites, as well as an increased area of the postsynaptic densities, all coherent with an alteration of the synaptic function. In all, our results demonstrate that the absence of galectin-4 induces synaptic dysfunctions and memory impairment, along with changes in gut microbial composition, suggesting that variations in endogenous intestinal microbiota may cause or contribute to such neurological pathologies.

">A Cortical Site that Encodes Vocal Expression and Reception</a></h4>

              
                Socially effective vocal communication requires brain regions that encode expressive and receptive aspects of vocal communication in a social context-dependent manner. Here, we combined a novel behavioral assay with microendoscopy to interrogate neuronal activity in the posterior insula (pIns) in socially interacting mice as they switched rapidly between states of vocal expression and reception. We found that distinct but spatially intermingled subsets of pIns neurons were active during vocal expression and reception. Notably, pIns activity during vocal expression increased prior to vocal onset and was also detected in congenitally deaf mice, pointing to a motor signal. Furthermore, receptive pIns activity depended strongly on social cues, including female odorants. Lastly, tracing experiments reveal that deep layer neurons in the pIns directly bridge the auditory thalamus to a midbrain vocal gating region. Therefore, the pIns is a site that encodes vocal expression and reception in a manner that depends on social context.

">Glymphatic system health in early Alzheimer's disease and its relationship to sleep, cognition and CSF biomarkers.</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: The glymphatic system is thought to facilitate waste clearance from the brain during sleep. Impairment in this system may underpin the elevated deposition of pathological proteins in neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Putative glymphatic system activity has been measured with contrast-enhanced, serial MRI, revealing slower clearance in people who are sleep deprived. It is important that these methods are used to understand changes to glymphatic function in people with early-stage AD. METHODS: Twenty-four individuals with mild cognitive impairment were recruited. N=20 had CSF biomarker data, with 16 meeting criteria for AD positivity (AD+). Participants underwent polysomnography, cognitive testing and serial T1 MRI with intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agent, diffusion tensor imaging along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS index), and core AD CSF biomarkers collection. Rate (over 24hrs) and efficiency (the amount of tracer cleared after 28hrs relative to uptake after 4hrs) of GCBA clearance were measured. RESULTS: Faster/more efficient GBCA clearance was associated with shorter sleep latency. In AD+ participants faster 24hr clearance of GBCA was associated with a lower ratio of AB1-42/AB1-40 in the CSF. In addition, better clearance efficiency was associated with greater levels of AB-40, lower levels of AB1-42, and a smaller ratio of AB-142/AB1-40 in the CSF. Higher DTI-ALPS indicated better cognitive performance and, unexpectedly, higher tau levels. However, it was not associated with GCBA clearance. CONCLUSIONS: We show, for the first time in humans, that glymphatic system function is associated with AD-related changes to sleep, cognition and core AD biomarker concentrations in CSF. However, for AD biomaker concentrations, these relationships are not in the expected direction: higher concentrations and lower AB1-42/AB1-40 ratio were associated with faster or more efficient clearance of GCBA. We suggest that increased neurodegeneration in those with elevated levels of tau and AB1-40 may paradoxically increase glymphatic activity locally to brain regions with more atrophy relative to less, but not in a way that improves sleep or cognition. In fact, larger extracellular spaces may exacerbate the spread of tau via the glymphatic system and therefore accelerate the progression of AD.

">Differential contribution of P73+ Cajal-Retzius cells and Reelin to cortical morphogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Cajal-Retzius cells (CRs) are a peculiar neuronal type within the developing mammalian cerebral cortex. One of their best documented feature is the robust secretion of Reln, a glycoprotein essential for the establishment of cortical layers through the control of radial migration of glutamatergic neurons. We previously identified Gmnc as a critical fate determinant for P73+ CRs subtypes from the hem, septum and thalamic eminence. In Gmnc-/- mutants, P73+ CRs are initially produced, cover the telencephalic vesicle but undergo massive apoptosis resulting in their complete depletion at mid-corticogenesis. Here we investigated the consequence of such a CRs depletion on dorsal cortex lamination and hippocampal morphogenesis. We found preplate splitting occurs normally in Gmnc-/- mutants but is followed by defective radial migration arrest in the dorsal cortex, altered cellular organization in the lateral cortex, aberrant hippocampal progenitor proliferation resulting in abnormal CA1 folding and lack of vasculature development in the hippocampal fissure. We then performed conditional Reln deletion in P73+ CRs to evaluate its relative contribution and found that only radial migration defects were recapitulated. We concluded that at mid-corticogenesis, CRs-derived Reln is required for radial migration arrest and additionally identified Reln-independent functions for CRs in the control of hippocampal progenitor proliferation and vessel remodelling.

">Synchrony dynamics underlie irregular neocortical spiking</a></h4>

              
                Cortical neurons are characterized by their variable spiking patterns. We challenge prevalent theories for the origin of spiking variability. We examine the specific hypothesis that cortical synchrony drives spiking variability in vivo. Using dynamic clamp, we demonstrate that intrinsic neuronal properties do not contribute substantially to spiking variability, but rather spiking variability emerges from weakly synchronous network drive. With large-scale electrophysiology we quantify the degree of synchrony and its time scale in cortical networks in vivo. We demonstrate that physiological levels of synchrony are sufficient to generate irregular responses found in vivo. Further, this synchrony shifts over timescales ranging from 25 to 200 ms, depending on the presence of external sensory input. Such shifts occur when the network moves from spontaneous to driven modes, leading naturally to a decline in response variability as observed across cortical areas. Finally, while individual neurons exhibit reliable responses to physiological drive, different neurons respond in a distinct fashion according to their intrinsic properties, contributing to stable synchrony across the neural network.

">Reward-driven adaptation of movements requires strong recurrent basal ganglia-cortical loops</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia (BG), a set of subcortical nuclei involved in motor control, sensorimotor integration, and procedural learning, modulate movement through tonic inhibition of thalamo-cortical networks. While essential for sensorimotor integration and learning, the BG are not necessary for executing well-learned movements. During skill learning, they guide behavioral corrections via dopamine-dependent cortico-striatal plasticity, but these corrections become BG-independent as modifications occur in the motor cortex. Existing models of BG function often overlook the feedback dynamics of cortico-BG-thalamo-cortical loops, and do not address the relative role of cortex and the BG in the generation and adaptation of movement. In this work, we develop a theoretical model of this multiregional network, integrating anatomical, physiological, and behavioral evidence to explore how its dynamics shape movement execution and reward-based adaptation. We show that the BG-thalamo-cortical network influences motor output through three key factors: (i) the rich dynamics of its closed-loop architecture, (ii) attractor dynamics from recurrent cortical connections, and (iii) classical reinforcement learning via dopamine-dependent cortico-striatal plasticity. Our study highlights that efficient visuomotor adaptation requires strong feedback from the BG to the cortex. Finally, we propose a mechanism for initial movement learning through motor babbling. This model suggests the BG-cortical network shapes motor output through its intricate closed-loop dynamics and cortico-striatal dopamine-dependent plasticity.

">Diversity of ancestral brainstem noradrenergic neurons across species and multiple biological factors</a></h4>

              
                The brainstem region, locus coeruleus (LC), has been remarkably conserved across vertebrates. Evolution has woven the LC into wide-ranging neural circuits that influence functions as broad as autonomic systems, the stress response, nociception, sleep, and high-level cognition among others. Given this conservation, there is a strong possibility that LC activity is inherently similar across species, and furthermore that age, sex, and brain state influence LC activity similarly across species. The degree to which LC activity is homogenous across these factors, however, has never been assessed due to the small sample size of individual studies. Here, we pool data from 20 laboratories (1,855 neurons) and show diversity across both intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as species, age, sex and brain state. We use a negative binomial regression model to compare activity from male monkeys, and rats and mice of both sexes that were recorded across brain states from brain slices ex vivo or under different anesthetics or during wakefulness in vivo. LC activity differed due to complex interactions of species, sex, and brain state. The LC became more active during aging, independent of sex. Finally, in contrast to the foundational principle that all species express two distinct LC firing modes ("tonic" or "phasic"), we discovered great diversity within spontaneous LC firing patterns. Different factors were associated with higher incidence of some firing modes. We conclude that the activity of the evolutionarily-ancient LC is not conserved. Inherent differences due to age and species-sex-brain state interactions have implications for understanding the role of LC in species-specific naturalistic behavior, as well as in psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease, immunology, and metabolic disorders.

">Synaptic targets and cellular sources of CB1 cannabinoid receptor and vesicular glutamate transporter-3 expressing nerve terminals in relation to GABAergic neurons in the human cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) regulates synaptic transmission through presynaptic receptors in nerve terminals, and its physiological roles are of clinical relevance. The cellular sources and synaptic targets of CB1-expressing terminals in the human cerebral cortex are undefined. We demonstrate a variable laminar pattern of CB1-immunorective axons and electron microscopically show that CB1-positive GABAergic terminals make type-2 synapses innervating dendritic shafts (69%), dendritic spines (20%) and somata (11%) in neocortical layers 2-3. Of the CB1-immunopositive GABAergic terminals, 25% were vesicular-glutamate-transporter-3 (VGLUT3)-immunoreactive, suggesting GABAergic/glutamatergic co-transmission on dendritic shafts. In vitro recorded and labelled VGLUT3 or CB1-positive GABAergic interneurons expressed cholecystokinin, vasoactive-intestinal-polypeptide and calretinin, had diverse firing, axons and dendrites, and included rosehip, neurogliaform and basket cells, but not double bouquet or axo-axonic cells. CB1-positive interneurons innervated pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons. Most glutamatergic synaptic terminals formed type-1 synapses and some were positive for CB1 receptor concentrated in the presynaptic active zone, unlike in GABAergic terminals. From the sampled VGLUT3-positive terminals, 60% formed type-1 synapses with dendritic spines (80%) or shafts (20%) and 52% were also positive for VGLUT1, suggesting intracortical origin. Some VGLUT3-positive terminals were immunopositive for vesicular-monoamine-transporter-2, suggesting 5-HT/glutamate co-transmission. Overall, the results show that CB1 regulates GABA release mainly to dendritic shafts of both pyramidal cells and interneurons, and predict CB1-regulated co-release of GABA and glutamate from single cortical interneurons. We also demonstrate the co-existence of multiple vesicular glutamate transporters in a select population of terminals probably originating from cortical neurons and innervating dendritic spines in the human cerebral cortex.

                Understanding how threats in environments drive fear memory formation is crucial to understanding how organisms adapt to changing environments and treat threat-related disorders such as PTSD. Despite decades of pioneering work using the Pavlovian conditioning model, our understanding has been limited because only one type (an electric shock) among diverse threats has been exclusively used. We developed a threat conditioning paradigm by utilizing a looming visual threat as an unconditioned stimulus (US) in mice and identified a distinct threat conditioning circuit. Parabrachial CGRP neurons were required for conditioning and memory retrieval. Their upstream neurons in the posterior insular cortex (pIC) responded to looming stimuli and projections of these neurons to the parabrachial nucleus induced aversive affective states and drove conditioning. But the pIC to PBN pathway was dispensable for foot-shock conditioning. Our findings provide insights into how a simple pattern of non-nociceptive visual stimuli can induce aversive states and drive fear memory formation.

">Optical profiling of NMDA receptor molecular diversity at synaptic and extrasynaptic sites</a></h4>

              
                NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels that play essential roles in brain development and function. NMDARs exist as multiple subtypes that differ in their subunit composition, distribution and signaling properties, with GluN1/GluN2A (GluN2A diheteromers), GluN1/GluN2B (GluN2B diheteromers) and GluN1/2A/2B (GluN2A/2B triheteromers) receptors prevailing. Studying these subtypes separately has proved difficult due to the limited specificity of available pharmacological and genetic approaches. Here, we designed a photoswitchable tool (Opto2B) enabling specific and reversible modulation of GluN2B diheteromers (while other receptor subtypes remain unaffected). Using Opto2B, we were able to establish the differential contribution of GluN2B diheteromers relative to GluN2A-receptors (GluN2A diheteromers and GluN2A/2B triheteromers) to synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR pools. In young postnatal CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells, extrasynaptic NMDARs are exclusively composed of GluN2B diheteromers, whereas GluN2A subunits already populate synaptic sites. In adult CA1 cells, GluN2A-receptors predominate at both sites, with no preferential contribution of GluN2B diheteromers to extrasynaptic currents. Our study clarifies decades of controversial research and paves the way for interrogating NMDAR signaling diversity with unprecedented molecular and spatio-temporal resolution.

">Enhancing cortico-motoneuronal projections for vocalization in mice</a></h4>

              
                Several hypotheses have been proposed on the anatomical brain differences that endow some species with the rare ability of vocal learning, a critical component of spoken language. One long-standing thus far untested hypothesis is that a robust direct projection from motor cortex layer 5 neurons to brainstem vocal motor neurons enables fine motor control of vocal laryngeal musculature in vocal learners. This connection has been proposed to form from specialized expression of axon guidance genes in human speech layer 5 neurons and the equivalent songbird neurons of the robust nucleus of the arcopallium. Here we generated mice with conditional knock-down of an axon-guidance receptor PLXNA1 in motor cortex layer 5 neurons, to recapitulate the human and songbird brain expression patterns. These mice showed enhanced layer 5 cortical projections to brainstem vocal motor neurons, increased functional connectivity to phonatory muscles, and displayed a wider range of vocal abilities depending on developmental and social contexts. Our findings are consistent with the theory that direct vocal cortico-motoneuronal projections influence vocal behaviors.

">Diversification of Dentate Gyrus Granule Cell Subtypes is Regulated by Neuregulin1 Nuclear Back Signaling.</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal heterogeneity is a defining feature of the developing mammalian brain, but the mechanisms regulating the diversification of closely related cell types remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the heterogeneity of dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells (GCs) and the influence of a psychosis associated V321L mutation in Neuregulin1 (Nrg1) on GC subtype composition. Using morpho-electric characterization, single-nucleus gene expression, and chromatin accessibility profiling, we identified distinct morphological and molecular features of typical GCs and a rare subtype known as semilunar granule cells (SGCs). The V321L mutation disrupts Nrg1 nuclear back-signaling, resulting in an overabundance of SGC-like cells. We discovered pseudotime gene expression trajectories suggesting the potential for GC-to-SGC transitions, supported by the accessibility of SGC-specific genes in other GCs. Intriguingly, we found an increase in SGC-marker expression over the adolescence to adulthood transition window in wild-type mice, coinciding with a decline in Nrg1 nuclear back-signaling capacity. This suggests that intact Nrg1 signaling suppresses SGC-like fate acquisition, and that its natural downregulation may underlie the emergence of SGC-like cells during postnatal development. Similarly, a pathological block of nuclear back signaling by the V321L mutation in Nrg1, may result in acquisition of the SGC-like fate due to loss of the repressive mechanisms maintained by intact nuclear back signaling. Our findings reveal a novel role for Nrg1 in maintaining DG cell-type composition and suggest that disrupted subtype regulation may contribute to disease-associated changes in DG GC morphology and function. Understanding these mechanisms provides new insights into mechanisms of cell-type diversity and its potential role in psychiatric pathology.

	<p>Background: Cell-based therapies for drug-resistant epilepsy using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived inhibitory interneurons are now in early-phase clinical trials, building on findings from trials in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (HD). Graft rejection and the need for immunosuppressive therapy post-transplantation pose potential barriers to more epilepsy patients becoming potential candidates for inhibitory interneurons transplantation surgery. Objectives: The present literature review weighs the evidence for and against human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mediated graft rejection in PD and HD and examines the potential advantages and drawbacks to five broad approaches to cell-based therapies, including autologous cell culture and transplantation, in vivo reprogramming of glial cells using viral vectors, allogeneic transplantation using off-the-shelf cell lines, transplantation using inhibitory interneurons cultured from HLA-matched cell lines, and the use of hypoimmunogenic-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived inhibitory interneurons. The impact of surgical technique and associated needle trauma on graft rejection is also discussed. Methods: Non-systematic literature review. Results: While cell-based therapies have enjoyed early successes in treating a host of central nervous system disorders, the immunologic reaction against surgical procedures and implanted materials has remained a major obstacle. Conclusions: Adapting cell-based therapies using iPSC-derived inhibitory interneurons for epilepsy surgery will similarly require surmounting the challenge of immunogenicity.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) technologies have revolutionized cranial neurosurgery by overlaying digital information onto the surgical field, enhancing visualization, precision, and training. These technologies enable the real-time integration of preoperative imaging data, aiding in better decision-making and reducing operative risks. Despite challenges such as cost and specialized training needs, AR and MR offer significant benefits, including improved surgical outcomes and personalized surgical plans based on individual patient anatomy. Materials and Methods: This study describes three intracranial surgeries using AR and MR technologies at Hospital &amp;amp;Aacute;ngeles Universidad, Mexico City, in 2023. Surgeries were performed with VisAR software 3 version and Microsoft HoloLens 2, transforming DICOM images into 3D models. Preoperative MRI and CT scans facilitated planning, and radiopaque tags ensured accurate image registration during surgery. Postoperative outcomes were assessed through clinical and imaging follow-up. Results: Three intracranial surgeries were performed with AR and MR assistance, resulting in successful outcomes with minimal postoperative complications. Case 1 achieved 80% tumor resection, Case 2 achieved near-total tumor resection, and Case 3 achieved complete lesion resection. All patients experienced significant symptom relief and favorable recoveries, demonstrating the precision and effectiveness of AR and MR in cranial surgery. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the successful use of AR and MR in cranial surgery, enhancing precision and clinical outcomes. Despite challenges like training and costs, these technologies offer significant benefits. Future research should focus on long-term outcomes and broader applications to validate their efficacy and cost-effectiveness in neurosurgery.</p>

	<p>Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is an electrophysiologic pathological state in which a wave of depolarization in the cerebral cortex is followed by the suppression of spontaneous neuronal activity. This transient spread of neuronal depolarization on the surface of the cortex is the hallmark of CSD. Numerous investigations have demonstrated that transmembrane ion transport, astrocytic ion clearing and fatigue, glucose metabolism, the presence of certain genetic markers, point mutations, and the expression of the enzyme responsible for the production of various arachidonic acid derivatives that participate in the inflammatory response, namely, cyclooxygenase (COX), all influence CSD. Here, we explore the associations between CSD occurrence in the cortex and various factors, including how CSD is related to migraines, how the glucose state affects CSD, the effect of TBI and its relationship with CSD and glucose metabolism, how different markers can be measured to determine the severity of CSD, and possible connections to oligemia, orexin, and leptin.</p>

	<p>Introduction: This article provides an overview of several experimental models, including in vivo, genetics, chemical, knock-in, knock-out, electrical, in vitro, and optogenetics models, that have been employed to investigate epileptogenesis. The present review introduces a novel categorization of these models, taking into account the fact that the most recent classification that gained widespread acceptance was established by Fisher in 1989. A significant number of such models have become virtually outdated. Objective: This paper specifically examines the models that have contributed to the investigation of partial seizures, generalized seizures, and status epilepticus. Discussion: A description is provided of the primary features associated with the processes that produce and regulate the symptoms of various epileptogenesis models. Numerous experimental epilepsy models in animals have made substantial contributions to the investigation of particular brain regions that are capable of inducing seizures. Experimental models of epilepsy have also enabled the investigation of the therapeutic mechanisms of anti-epileptic medications. Typically, animals are selected for the development and study of experimental animal models of epilepsy based on the specific form of epilepsy being investigated. Conclusions: Currently, it is established that specific animal species can undergo epileptic seizures that resemble those described in humans. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that a comprehensive assessment of all forms of human epilepsy has not been feasible. However, these experimental models, both those derived from channelopathies and others, have provided a limited comprehension of the fundamental mechanisms of this disease.</p>

	<p>Background: Occupational therapy (OT) is an essential component of patient care, and it is especially beneficial if focused on meaningful activities. For ataxic patients, traditional procedures are currently the most efficient, although without specific guidelines and suggestions for virtual reality integration. In this context, this study proposes Hybrid Smart Rehabilitation (HSR) based on mixed reality (MR) as an aid in overcoming limitations of the traditional OT procedures. Methods: MR-HSR is designed specifically for ataxic patients and developed in Unity with the Holographic Remoting setting for run-time intervention on the scene. The subject reaches a book and grabs it with their hand inside a holographic guide with audio-visive feedback. Hand trajectories acquired from eight ataxic patients and eight healthy subjects were compared and new variables were analyzed to evaluate the performance. The Trust in Automation questionnaire was submitted to assess the opinion of the patients. Results: Patients confirmed their trust in the developer and in the improvement that this system can bring to their rehabilitation. The &amp;amp;ldquo;total time&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;sway area&amp;amp;rdquo; of the trajectory were statistically significant and, together with the deviation of the trajectory from the main axis of the guide, although not statistically significant, made it possible to build a classifier. Conclusions: The patient-specific MR-HSR can be considered as an integrative tool for assessing the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s condition by analyzing new quantitative variables which, if matched to the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), could be the basis of a new index to assess the progressiveness of ataxia.</p>

                Background Helicobacter pylori and intestinal parasites are well-known for their high prevalence in children, especially in developing countries. However, their concomitant infections are poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between intestinal parasites and H. pylori among hospitalized children and adolescents with upper gastrointestinal complaints in Northern Lebanon. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 297 hospitalized pediatric patients, aged between 1 and 15 years, who presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. The socio-demographic, lifestyle, and gastrointestinal characteristics of all participants were analyzed. Fresh stool samples were collected and screened for the presence of intestinal parasites and H. pylori infections. Results 6.4% of the patients were positive for intestinal parasitic infections, 5.4% were positive for H. pylori infection, and 11.8% were co-infected. The results of the Chi-square test showed that H. pylori infection is significantly associated with parasitic infection but not with a particular species. The most frequent coinfection was H. pylori-Entamoeba histolytica (77.1%). Moreover, H. pylori infection was associated with overcrowding and infrequent washing of vegetables before eating. The prevalence of co-infections increased in patients of mothers with a primary educational level or less. In regards to clinical characteristics, our findings showed a statistically significant relationship between i) gastric reflux and H. pylori, and ii) severe diarrhea and parasitic infection. Conclusion Our data highlighted the association between H. pylori and intestinal parasitic infections. Thus, H. pylori detection could be taken into consideration while screening for parasitic infections in children and adolescents.

                Introduction Rotator cuff (RC) tears are the most common and disabling musculoskeletal ailments among patients with shoulder pain. Although most individuals show improvement in function and pain following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR), a subgroup of patients continue to suffer from persistent shoulder pain following the surgical procedure. Identifying these factors is important in planning preoperative management to improve patient outcomes. Objective This scoping review aims to identify biological factors, psychological factors, and social determinants of health contributing to the development of persistent pain in individuals after the ARCR procedure. Inclusion criteria All prospective and retrospective longitudinal studies reporting the risk factors contributing to persistent pain three months or longer after the ARCR surgery will be considered for this scoping review. Methods Our review will adhere to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review methodology. Four electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Scopus will be searched for studies in the English language. Additional studies can be found by conducting a citation analysis of the included studies. Title and abstract screening will be performed by two independent reviewers following the inclusion criteria, a third reviewer will be consulted about any differences. Next, full-text screening will be conducted, and the remaining search results will be reviewed to extract data, as well as to synthesize findings from all research. An overview of findings will be depicted in tabular format accompanied with a narrative summary of various factors contributing to persistent pain.

                Political or economic interests have led to an empirical zonal delimitation, and the deficient use of Geographic Information Systems does not allow the specific characterisation of the territories. This article aims to determine the spatial analysis of the urban expansion areas of the canton of Tisaleo by integrating Geographic Information Systems, using a quantitative research method. The main components analysed are: the situational diagnosis of the canton through the characterisation of its biophysical component, its human settlements and the public system of facilities and social services that support it. Based on this information, an interrelation of the data collected is carried out to complement a spatial analysis with GIS software (ArcGis/QGis, ESRI, 2018). The results show that in the canton of Tisaleo there are areas suitable for urban growth, but their limits are overdimensioned, i.e. they include areas that do not have the aptitude to be urbanised, as well as rural areas that have the characteristics to be considered urban.

                Background Immediate Dentin Sealing (IDS) is a technique that applies an adhesive layer immediately after tooth preparation, prior to the placement of indirect restorations. This method is gaining attention due to its potential to improve the bond strength and mechanical properties of restorations, particularly in the posterior region where restorations endure significant masticatory forces. The objectif of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effect of IDS on the fracture strength of indirect posterior restorations. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted in four databases: Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and PubMed. Inclusion criteria focused on in vitro studies involving human teeth with indirect posterior restorations, published between 2014 and 2023. Studies using IDS were compared to those using conventional methods. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool, and a meta-analysis was performed with a random-effects model. The standard mean difference and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare fracture strength, with I2 statistics assessing heterogeneity. Forest and funnel plots were employed to visualize results and publication bias, respectively. Discussion The results indicate that IDS generally enhances the fracture strength of indirect posterior restorations, particularly with ceramic materials like lithium disilicate. However, the effectiveness of IDS varies depending on the material and restoration type. While some studies demonstrated improved fracture resistance with IDS, others showed minimal benefit, especially with composite restorations. Additionally, IDS improved marginal adaptation and internal fit but increased the risk of severe failures, such as root fractures.

                Electrocardiograms (ECGs) can be affected by various factors and technical problems. It is rare for an artefact to be the cause of ST-segment elevation, especially in asymptomatic patients. An important distinction between true ST segment elevation caused by myocardial infarction and an artefact is that the baseline elevation in an artefact may begin before or after the appearance of the QRS complex. When confronted with an abnormal ECG with suspicious waveform contours and possibly only one completely normal limb lead, the diagnosis of arterial pulse artefact should be considered. It is important to exclude subjective assessments unless they are clearly labelled as such. When encountering an abnormal ECG with suspicious waveform contours and possibly only one completely normal limb lead, the diagnosis of arterial pulse artefact should be considered.

                Invasive sino-orbital fungal infection is an uncommon, yet severe condition that predominantly affects individuals with compromised immune systems. In this study, we report the case of a 5-month-old immunocompetent infant who exhibited persistent dacryocystitis despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Subsequently, the patient developed ethmoiditis, orbital subperiosteal abscess, and ulceration of the hard palate. Mycological and histological samples were indicative of Candida infections. The patient underwent sinus surgery and surgical debridement, along with antifungal therapy. The treatment was successful, and the follow-up was uneventful for up to 6 months. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of invasive sino-orbital candidiasis in an immunocompetent infant with dacryocystitis as the entry point. This study explores the clinical features, management approaches, and outcomes of this potentially fatal disease.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been widely applied in the neuroimaging field to discover genetic variants associated with brain-related traits. So far, almost all GWASs conducted in neuroimaging genetics are performed on univariate quantitative features summarized from brain images. On the other hand, powerful deep learning technologies have dramatically improved our ability to classify images. In this study, we proposed and implemented a novel machine learning strategy for systematically identifying genetic variants that lead to detectable nuances on Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). For a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), if MRI images labeled by genotypes of this SNP can be reliably distinguished using machine learning, we then hypothesized that this SNP is likely to be associated with brain anatomy or function which is manifested in MRI brain images. We applied this strategy to a catalog of MRI image and genotype data collected by the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) consortium. From the results, we identified novel variants that show strong association to brain phenotypes.

Owing to its specialised methodology, palaeoecology is often regarded as a separate field from ecology, even though it is essential for understanding long-term ecological processes that have shaped the ecosystems that ecologists study and manage. Despite advances in ecological modelling, sample dating, and proxy-based reconstructions facilitating direct comparison of palaeoecological data with neo-ecological data, most of the scientific knowledge derived from palaeoecological studies remains siloed. We surveyed a group of palaeo-researchers with experience in crossing the divide between palaeoecology and neo-ecology, to develop Ten Simple Rules for publishing your palaeoecological research in non-palaeo journals. Our 10 rules are divided into the preparation phase, writing phase, and finalising phase when the article is submitted to the target journal. These rules provide a suite of strategies, including improved networking early in the process, building effective collaborations, transmitting results more efficiently and cross-disciplinary, and integrating concepts and methodologies that appeal to ecologists and a wider readership. Adhering to these Ten Simple Rules can ensure palaeoecologists’ findings are more accessible and impactful among ecologists and the wider scientific community. Although this article primarily shows examples of how palaeoecological studies were published in journals for a broader audience, the rules apply to anyone who aims to publish outside specialised journals.

                <p>by Dmitry R. Lyamzin, Andrea Alamia, Mohammad Abdolrahmani, Ryo Aoki, Andrea Benucci</p>

In natural behaviors, multiple neural signals simultaneously drive activation across overlapping brain networks. Due to limitations in the amount of data that can be acquired in common experimental designs, the determination of these interactions is commonly inferred via modeling approaches, which reduce overfitting by finding appropriate regularizing hyperparameters. However, it is unclear whether these hyperparameters can also be related to any aspect of the underlying biological phenomena and help interpret them. We applied a state-of-the-art regularization procedure—automatic locality determination—to interacting neural activations in the mouse posterior cortex associated with movements of the body and eyes. As expected, regularization significantly improved the determination and interpretability of the response interactions. However, regularizing hyperparameters also changed considerably, and seemingly unpredictably, from animal to animal. We found that these variations were not random; rather, they correlated with the variability in visually evoked responses and with the variability in the state of arousal of the animals measured by pupillometry—both pieces of information that were not included in the modeling framework. These observations could be generalized to another commonly used—but potentially less informative—regularization method, ridge regression. Our findings demonstrate that optimal model hyperparameters can be discovery tools that are informative of factors not a priori included in the model’s design.

                <p>by Rachel S. Clein, Megan R. Warren, Joshua P. Neunuebel</p>

Intraspecies aggression has profound ecological and evolutionary consequences, as recipients can suffer injuries, decreases in fitness, and become outcasts from social groups. Although animals implement diverse strategies to avoid hostile confrontations, the extent to which social influences affect escape tactics is unclear. Here, we used computational and machine-learning approaches to analyze complex behavioral interactions as mixed-sex groups of mice, <i>Mus musculus</i>, freely interacted. Mice displayed a rich repertoire of behaviors marked by changes in behavioral state, aggressive encounters, and mixed-sex interactions. A distinctive behavioral sequence consistently occurred after aggressive encounters, where males in submissive states quickly approached and transiently interacted with females immediately before the aggressor engaged with the same female. The behavioral sequences were also associated with substantially fewer physical altercations. Furthermore, the male’s behavioral state could be predicted by distinct features of the behavioral sequence, such as kinematics and the latency to and duration of male–female interactions. More broadly, our work revealed an ethologically relevant escape strategy influenced by the presence of females that may serve as a mechanism for de-escalating social conflict and preventing consequential reductions in fitness.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Sex differences in the association between cardiovascular risk factors and the incident all-cause dementia and the subtype Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk are unclear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants (n = 4,171, 54% women, aged 55 to 69 years) were included at baseline and followed up to 40 years. The Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (FSRP) was dichotomized into 2 levels (cutoff: 75th percentile of the FSRP z-scores). Cause-specific hazard models, with death as a competing event, and restricted mean survival time (RMST) model were used to analyze the association between FSRP levels and incident all-cause dementia and AD. Interactions between FSRP and sex were estimated, followed by a sex-stratified analysis to examine the sex modification effect.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>High FSRP was significantly associated with all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.25, robust 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21 to 1.29, <i>p &lt;</i> 0.001) and AD (HR = 1.58, robust 95% CI = 1.57 to 1.59, <i>p &lt;</i> 0.001) in cause-specific hazard models. High FSRP was significantly associated with incident dementia (HR = 2.81, robust 95% CI = 2.75 to 2.87, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and AD (HR = 2.96, robust 95% CI = 2.36 to 3.71, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) in women, but not in men. Results were consistent in the RMST models. Current diabetes and high systolic blood pressure as FSRP components were significantly associated with dementia and AD in women but not in men.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>High FSRP in mid- to early late life is a critical risk factor for all-cause dementia and AD, particularly in women. Sex-specific interventions and further research to elucidate underlying mechanisms are warranted. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The discovery of adult-born granule cells (aDGCs) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus has raised questions regarding how they develop, incorporate into the hippocampal circuitry, and contribute to learning and memory. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology to investigate the intrinsic and synaptic excitability of mouse aDGCs as they matured, enabled by using a tamoxifen-induced genetic label to birth date the aDGCs at different animal ages. Importantly, we also undertook immunofluorescence studies of the expression of the immediate early gene Egr1 and compared these findings with the electrophysiology data in the same animals. We examined two groups of animals, with aDGC birthdating when the mice were 2 months and at 7–9 months of age. In both groups, cells 4 weeks old had lower thresholds for current-evoked action potentials than older cells but fired fewer spikes during long current pulses and responded more poorly to synaptic activation. aDGCs born in both 2 and 7–9-month-old mice matured in their intrinsic excitability and synaptic properties from 4–12 weeks postgenesis, but this occurred more slowly for the older age animals. Interestingly, this pattern of intrinsic excitability changes did not correlate with the pattern of Egr1 expression. Instead, the development of Egr1 expression was correlated with the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. These results suggest that in order for aDGCs to fully participate in hippocampal circuitry, as indicated by Egr1 expression, they must have developed enough synaptic input, in spite of the greater input resistance and reduced firing threshold that characterizes young aDGCs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96626">The Smc5/6 complex counteracts R-loop formation at highly transcribed genes in cooperation with RNase H2</a></h4>

              
                The R-loop is a common transcriptional by-product that consists of an RNA-DNA duplex joined to a displaced strand of genomic DNA. While the effects of R-loops on health and disease are well established, there is still an incomplete understanding of the cellular processes responsible for their removal from eukaryotic genomes. Here, we show that a core regulator of chromosome architecture -the Smc5/6 complex- plays a crucial role in the removal of R-loop structures formed during gene transcription. Consistent with this, budding yeast mutants defective in the Smc5/6 complex and enzymes involved in R-loop resolution show strong synthetic interactions and accumulate high levels of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in their chromosomes. Importantly, we demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex acts on specific types of RNA-DNA hybrid structures <i>in vivo</i> and promotes R-loop degradation by the RNase H2 enzyme <i>in vitro</i>. Collectively, our results reveal a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of toxic R-loops formed at highly transcribed genes and telomeres.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94795">Early steps of protein disaggregation by Hsp70 chaperone and class B J-domain proteins are shaped by Hsp110</a></h4>

              
                Hsp70 is a key cellular system counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation, associated with stress, ageing, and disease. Hsp70 solubilises aggregates and aids protein refolding through substrate binding and release cycles regulated by co-chaperones: J-domain proteins (JDPs) and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). Here, we elucidate the collaborative impact of Hsp110 NEFs and different JDP classes throughout Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing. We show that Hsp110 plays a major role at initial stages of disaggregation, determining its final efficacy. The NEF catalyses the recruitment of thick Hsp70 assemblies onto aggregate surface, which modifies aggregates into smaller species more readily processed by chaperones. Hsp70 stimulation by Hsp110 is much stronger with class B than class A JDPs and requires the auxiliary interaction between class B JDP and the Hsp70 EEVD motif. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP-Hsp70 interaction. Such destabilisation of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface might improve disaggregation, but also lead to the inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum. Thus, balanced interplay between the co-chaperones and Hsp70 is critical to unlock its disaggregating potential.

                Litter decomposition is expected to be positively associated with precipitation despite evidence that decomposers of varying sizes have different moisture dependencies. We hypothesized that higher tolerance of macro-decomposers to aridity may counterbalance the effect of smaller decomposers, leading to similar decomposition rates across climatic gradients. We tested this hypothesis by placing plant litter baskets of different mesh sizes in seven sites along a sharp precipitation gradient, and by characterizing the macro-decomposer assemblages using pitfall trapping. We found that decomposers responded differently to precipitation levels based on their size. Microbial decomposition increased with precipitation in the winter while macro-decomposition peaked in arid sites during the summer. This led to similar overall decomposition rates across the gradient except in hyper-arid sites. Macro-decomposer richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in arid environments. Our findings highlight the importance of macro-decomposition in arid-lands, possibly resolving the dryland decomposition conundrum, and emphasizing the need to contemplate decomposer size when investigating zoogeochemical processes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98844">Ih block reveals separation of timescales in pyloric rhythm response to temperature changes in Cancer borealis</a></h4>

              
                Motor systems operate over a range of frequencies and relative timing (phase). We studied the role of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (I<sub>h</sub>) in regulating these features in the pyloric rhythm of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, <i>Cancer borealis,</i> as temperature was altered from 11°C to 21°C. Under control conditions, rhythm frequency increased monotonically with temperature, while the phases of the pyloric dilator (PD), lateral pyloric (LP), and pyloric (PY) neurons remained constant. Blocking I<sub>h</sub> with cesium (Cs<sup>+</sup>) phase advanced PD offset, LP onset, and LP offset at 11°C, and the latter two further advanced as temperature increased. In Cs<sup>+</sup> the frequency increase with temperature diminished and the Q<sub>10</sub> of the frequency dropped from ~1.75 to ~1.35. Unexpectedly in Cs<sup>+</sup>, the frequency dynamics became non-monotonic during temperature transitions; frequency initially dropped as temperature increased, then rose once temperature stabilized, creating a characteristic ‘jag’. Interestingly, these jags persisted during temperature transitions in Cs<sup>+</sup> when the pacemaker was isolated by picrotoxin, although the temperature-induced change in frequency recovered to control levels. Overall, these data suggest that I<sub>h</sub> plays an important role in maintaining smooth transitory responses and persistent frequency increases by different mechanisms in the pyloric circuitry during temperature fluctuations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95678">A new potential strategy for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma treatment by generating serum-based antibodies from tumor-exposed mice</a></h4>

              
                Current cancer treatment strategies continue to face significant challenges, primarily due to tumor relapse, drug resistance, and low treatment efficiency. These issues arise because certain tumor cells adapt to the host immune microenvironment and evade the immune system. This study presents a new cancer immunotherapy strategy using serum-based antibodies from mice exposed to mouse cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (mCSCC). The experiment was conducted in three stages. In the first stage, mCSCC cells were isolated and expanded cultured from DMBA/TPA-induced mCSCC. In the second stage, these expanded tumor cells were injected into healthy mice to stimulate the production of anti-tumor antibodies. In the final stage, therapeutic serum was extracted from these healthy mice and reintroduced into the tumor-bearing mice. An ELISA assay was utilized to analyze the levels of p53, Bcl-xL, NF-κB, and Bax. The results showed that the serum treatment not only reduced tumor volume but also reversed changes in p53, Bcl-xL, NF-κB, and Bax. In conclusion, this study developed a new immunotherapeutic strategy for treating mCSCC. However, further research is needed to fully comprehend the mechanism of this serum treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97754">Light-driven synchronization of optogenetic clocks</a></h4>

              
                Synthetic genetic oscillators can serve as internal clocks within engineered cells to program periodic expression. However, cell-to-cell variability introduces a dispersion in the characteristics of these clocks that drives the population to complete desynchronization. Here, we introduce the optorepressilator, an optically controllable genetic clock that combines the repressilator, a three-node synthetic network in <i>E. coli</i>, with an optogenetic module enabling to reset, delay, or advance its phase using optical inputs. We demonstrate that a population of optorepressilators can be synchronized by transient green light exposure or entrained to oscillate indefinitely by a train of short pulses, through a mechanism reminiscent of natural circadian clocks. Furthermore, we investigate the system’s response to detuned external stimuli observing multiple regimes of global synchronization. Integrating experiments and mathematical modeling, we show that the entrainment mechanism is robust and can be understood quantitatively from single cell to population level.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92464">Heat Shock Factor 1 forms nuclear condensates and restructures the yeast genome before activating target genes</a></h4>

              
                In insects and mammals, 3D genome topology has been linked to transcriptional states yet whether this link holds for other eukaryotes is unclear. Using both ligation proximity and fluorescence microscopy assays, we show that in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>Heat Shock Response</i> (<i>HSR</i>) genes dispersed across multiple chromosomes and under the control of Heat Shock Factor (Hsf1) rapidly reposition in cells exposed to acute ethanol stress and engage in concerted, Hsf1-dependent intergenic interactions. Accompanying 3D genome reconfiguration is equally rapid formation of Hsf1-containing condensates. However, in contrast to the transience of Hsf1-driven intergenic interactions that peak within 10–20 min and dissipate within 1 hr in the presence of 8.5% (v/v) ethanol, transcriptional condensates are stably maintained for hours. Moreover, under the same conditions, Pol II occupancy of <i>HSR</i> genes, chromatin remodeling, and RNA expression are detectable only later in the response and peak much later (&gt;1 hr). This contrasts with the coordinate response of <i>HSR</i> genes to thermal stress (39°C) where Pol II occupancy, transcription, histone eviction, intergenic interactions, and formation of Hsf1 condensates are all rapid yet transient (peak within 2.5–10 min and dissipate within 1 hr). Therefore, Hsf1 forms condensates, restructures the genome and transcriptionally activates <i>HSR</i> genes in response to both forms of proteotoxic stress but does so with strikingly different kinetics. In cells subjected to ethanol stress, Hsf1 forms condensates and repositions target genes before transcriptionally activating them.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Age-related decline in balance and postural control is common in healthy elders and is escalated in aging adults with stroke. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as one of the promising brain stimulations adjoining therapeutic exercise to enhance the recovery of balance and motor functions in persons with and without neurological disorders. This review aims to summarize and compare the available evidence of the tDCS on improving balance in the older adults without neurological disorders and the older adults with stroke. Methods: The Ovid (Medline) database was searched from its inception through to 06/15/2024 for randomized controlled trials investigating tDCS for improving balance in older adults with and without stroke. Results: Overall, 20 appropriate studies (including 271 stroke subjects and 259 healthy older adults) were found. The data indicate mixed results of tDCS for improving balance in older adults with and without stroke. Conclusions: Based on current research evidence, we have not found a specific tDCS protocol that is more effective than other tDCS protocols for improving balance and postural control in healthy older adults and older adults with stroke. Further research should explore the ideal tDCS approach, possibly in conjunction with standard interventions, to optimize postural control and balance in healthy older adults and older adults with stroke.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: This study investigates the classification of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) using electroencephalography (EEG) Short-Time Fourier-Transform (STFT) spectrograms and audio Mel-spectrogram data of 52 subjects. The objective is to develop a multimodal classification model that integrates audio and EEG data to accurately identify depressive tendencies. Methods: We utilized the Multimodal open dataset for Mental Disorder Analysis (MODMA) and trained a pre-trained Densenet121 model using transfer learning. Features from both the EEG and audio modalities were extracted and concatenated before being passed through the final classification layer. Additionally, an ablation study was conducted on both datasets separately. Results: The proposed multimodal classification model demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving an Accuracy of 97.53%, Precision of 98.20%, F1 Score of 97.76%, and Recall of 97.32%. A confusion matrix was also used to evaluate the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s effectiveness. Conclusions: The paper presents a robust multimodal classification approach that outperforms state-of-the-art methods with potential application in clinical diagnostics for depression assessment.</p>

                Background Outdoor and indoor air temperature affects human health and wellbeing. Climate change projections suggest that global temperatures will continue to increase, and this poses a threat to health. Buildings (for housing and business purposes) that can protect humans from the adverse effects of temperature are essential, especially in the context of climate change. Method In this cross-sectional study, we measured the indoor temperature inside shipping containers comprising a seven-storey block of apartments and businesses in Johannesburg, South Africa for 14 days. We assessed indoor temperature and relative humidity; evaluated measured temperatures in relation to thresholds known to be associated with adverse health risks; and sought to understand heat-health perceptions and symptoms of people living and working in shipping container units. Results Median indoor apparent temperature (AT) (a combination of temperature and relative humidity) was 16°C with values ranging from 6°C (observed at 8:00) to 42°C (observed at 17:00). Insulated units had temperatures between 2°C and 9°C cooler than the uninsulated unit. Heat-health risks from AT exposure were likely in all units, although there was variation in the number of occurrences that AT measurements exceeded the four symptom bands of caution, extreme caution, danger and extreme danger. Indoor AT was found to be 7°C higher on average when compared to outdoor AT. Some participants believed that their units were hot during hot weather and most people opened windows or did nothing during hot weather. Few participants reported experiencing adverse heat-health impacts, except for experiencing headaches (58%) and feeling tired or weak (40%). Conclusion Residents, tenants, or business owners using shipping containers should consider insulation installation and adequate windows/air conditioning for ventilation, especially in hot climates. Further research and awareness regarding heat-health risks of living or working in these spaces is needed.

                Introduction Throughout history and up until the present, there has been a medicine shortage. In the early 1920s, there was a shortage of insulin, which is when drug scarcity first appeared in the records. Drug shortages are now more prevalent globally than they were back then. The goal of this essay is to pinpoint the key components that make up a definition for medication shortages and to pinpoint the circumstances that should be considered when reporting drug shortages in databases. Understanding the factors that led certain organizations to create their own definition of a medicine shortage was crucial for achieving these goals. The pharmaceutical regulatory environment can be connected to several reasons why there are medication shortages, including parallel trading, quality standards, and business choices to halt or reduce manufacturing. The many rules governing medicine shortages have not yet been the subject of a thorough investigation. This protocol’s objective is to analyze the pertinent legislative and regulatory frameworks in the European pharmaceutical system that affect medication shortages. The objectives of the study will be the non–availability of drugs at an outpatient pharmacy and to analyze the reason of non–availability of drugs. Methods An observational study will be adopted in this study. It includes a collection of data from the patient coming to the outpatient pharmacy of AVBRH Sawangi (Meghe) Wardha. Expected result It can lead to delayed treatment for patients seeking alternative medication. It can also lead to increased healthcare costs if patients seek alternative treatments that are more expensive or require additional medical care. The unavailability of drugs can also lead to frustration and anxiety for patients who need medication to manage their health condition. It can also negatively impact the reputation of the hospital.

                Past research aimed at service recovery has focused on actions that are taken to retain customers, and the possibility of overcoming the mistakes of service delivery, though the multidimensional nature of the service recovery process has begun to move beyond the complaint handling process. In this paper, we identify the most important issues addressed in service recovery and present a framework for addressing them. We used an extensive integrative review methodology. Between 1988 and 2017 the number of articles in these journals was kept between 26 and 30. The majority took a business perspective to study services recovery, while a minority took an inter-disciplinarity perspective. The study’s findings are expected to provide insights into the antecedents and consequences of service recovery performance, particularly how job resources and demands influence employee burnout and work engagement, which in turn affect service recovery performance and customer perceptions of justice. The research aims to contribute to the discourse on service recovery by building a multi-level model that explains the service recovery performance of frontline employees and the impact of the service recovery system on customer justice perceptions. Thus, this research is expected to contribute to robust conclusions on the antecedents and consequences of employee service recovery performance nested within the unit-level construct, i.e., the service recovery system.

                Background Over the past few decades, World Health Organization (WHO) has made massive efforts to promote the development of a vaccine against Lassa virus (LASV), one of the top ten priority pathogens for research and development under the WHO R&D Blueprint for Emerging Infections. To date, several vaccines are at different stages of development. In this scenario, a validated and standardised assay to measure LASV neutralising antibodies is urgently needed for vaccine development and comparison. Methods The neutralisation assay remains the gold standard for determining antibody efficacy. Here we have proposed a safe and validated pseudotyped neutralisation assay for LASV, taking advantage of the development of the first WHO International Standard and Reference Panel for Anti-Lassa Fever (NIBSC code 21/332). Results and Conclusions The proposed results demonstrate that the pseudotyped luciferase neutralisation assay is a specific serological test for the measurement of LASV neutralising antibodies without cross-reacting with standard sera specific for heterologous viral infections. In addition, the assay is accurate, precise, and linear according to criteria and statistical analyses defined and accepted by international guidelines.

                Background Globalization has expanded the scope of business with many companies relying on the contribution of expatriates to fill skills gap in foreign business operations, transferring management knowledge, launching new operations, and coordinating activities on a global scale. Expatriates, however, face challenges that stem from cultural differences. Their commitment levels depend on how well and how quickly they adjust to the unfamiliar culture(s) of the host country. Methods This study sought to investigate the implications of work factors on commitment of expatriates working in selected mission hospitals in Kenya. It was anchored on the provisions of the Three-Component Commitment and International Adjustment theories and a randomly selected sample of 112 respondents from a target population of 156 medical expatriates. Results and conclusions The results depicted that work-related factors significantly affected employee commitment (β= -1.033, p=0.000). To conclude, we argue that employee commitment amongst expatriates can be enhanced through work factors’ cross-cultural adjustment. We further recommend setting up of cross-cultural adjustment policies for expatriate workers within the workplace, particularly in mission hospitals.

                Background In completely edentulous patients, maintaining the patient’s temporomandibular joint (TMJ) health and intraoral components is very essential, which can be achieved by an accurate interocclusal record, which can be taken by various materials and also at various stages. Simulation of the temporomandibular joint anatomy and mandibular movements is possible on a semi-adjustable articulator, which is widely used in prosthodontics. Transferring the record on articulator is a critical step in the fabrication of complete dentures, so it should be done precisely to reduce chair side time and also to avoid complications for patients. This study examines which material is more accurate and records which stage gives more precision by comparing the Condylar guidance on radiographs. This is because it is a relatively consistent bony landmark and can be used to correlate with clinical methods in terms of verification. The objective is to determine the inter occlusal records created during the Jaw Relation stage and Try-in using reinforced wax and Polyvinyl siloxane and compare these values to the condylar guidance obtained by orthopantomogram (OPG). Methods Recording the Condylar Guidance value on OPG by tracing the Glenoid fossa, Articular eminence, and the Frankfurt Horizontal Plane. Followed by conventional steps in making complete dentures at jaw relation and try-in stage. We will record values of condylar guidance with the two different Interocclusal record materials. Expected result It will help the clinicians to gain knowledge about obtaining precise condylar inclination angle by using suitable interocclusal record materials. Conclusions This study will help us to obtain condylar inclination, which in turn helps the patient’s satisfaction as it preserves the intraoral components and health of TMJ.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1228/v1?src=rss">Recycling of collagen from solid tannery waste and prospective utilization as adhesives. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract This study explores the innovative potential of recycled collagen derived from tannery waste for use in high-performance adhesive formulations. The leather industry generates significant amounts of solid waste, primarily from chromium-tanned leather, which poses substantial environmental challenges. Recent advancements in recycling techniques have opened new avenues for repurposing this waste, particularly through collagen extraction, which comprises about 30-35% of tannery residues. This research systematically reviews the methods and applications of collagen extraction, highlighting the material’s versatility and environmental benefits when used as a bio-adhesive. The review identifies key challenges such as low water resistance, shear strength, and adhesiveness in collagen-based adhesives compared to synthetic counterparts. However, innovative solutions are emerging, including the incorporation of silane coupling agents and cross-linking technologies that significantly improve the water resistance and mechanical properties of these adhesives. Economic analyses further support the viability of using tannery waste-derived collagen in adhesive production, aligning with global sustainability goals and reducing reliance on petrochemical-based adhesives. Despite these advancements, the transition from laboratory research to commercial applications remains a significant challenge. Current studies primarily focus on small-scale experiments, with limited pilot-scale studies available. Nonetheless, the potential for collagen-based adhesives to replace harmful chemicals in industrial applications is promising, especially in sectors requiring biodegradable and non-toxic materials. This review concludes that while significant progress has been made, further research is necessary to overcome existing limitations and fully realize the commercial potential of collagen-based adhesives derived from tannery waste.

                Background Each year, over 340,000 diabetic patients across the world travel to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj pilgrimage. As they carried out important rituals, several complications might be encountered, particularly foot lesions. We’ve been therefore interested, through this study, in the assessment of podiatric risk in diabetic pilgrims. Methods A prospective longitudinal study was conducted in the region of Sousse, Tunisia. The evaluation of diabetic patients preparing for the pilgrimage was conducted in two phases, before and after the pilgrimage. Results Forty-three diabetic patients planning to perform pilgrimage were included in the study. Post-pilgrimage clinical exams revealed hyperkeratosis (96.8%) and superficial fungal infections (61.3%) as the most common podiatric lesions. Foot ulcers attributed to trauma from walking were found in 7% of patients. Our data showed a significant association between foot ulcer risk and lower total cholesterol (p=0.02), HDL cholesterol (p=0.02), LDL cholesterol (p=0.01), as well as higher triglyceride levels (p=0.04) only in univariate analysis. Other diabetes-related risk factors did not show significant correlations. Conclusion Given the increased risk of foot lesions in diabetic pilgrims, a thorough assessment and tailored management based on individual risk levels are essential before, during, and after the pilgrimage.

                Background The crisis in research culture is well documented, covering issues such as a tendency for quantity over quality, unhealthy competitive environments, and assessment based on publications, journal prestige and funding. In response, research institutions need to assess their own practices to promote and advocate for change in the current research ecosystem. The purpose of the scoping review was to explore ‘What does the evidence say about the ‘problem’ with ‘poor’ research culture, what are the benefits of ‘good’ research culture, and what does ‘good’ look like?’ Aims To examine the peer-reviewed and grey literature to explore the interplay between research culture, open research, career paths, recognition and rewards, and equality, diversity, and inclusion, as part of a larger programme of activity for a research institution. Methods A scoping review was undertaken. Six databases were searched along with grey literature. Eligible literature had relevance to academic research institutions, addressed research culture, and were published between January 2017 to May 2022. Evidence was mapped and themed to specific categories. The search strategy, screening and analysis took place between April-May 2022. Results 1666 titles and abstracts, and 924 full text articles were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 253 articles met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. A purposive sampling of relevant websites was drawn from to complement the review, resulting in 102 records included in the review. Key areas for consideration were identified across the four themes of job security, wellbeing and equality of opportunity, teamwork and interdisciplinary, and research quality and accountability. Conclusions There are opportunities for research institutions to improve their own practice, however institutional solutions cannot act in isolation. Research institutions and research funders need to work together to build a more sustainable and inclusive research culture that is diverse in nature and supports individuals’ well-being, career progression and performance.

                Introduction Although relatively uncommon, osteoradionecrosis (ORN) remains a serious complication following radiotherapy. Various therapeutic approaches, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), are utilized in managing ORN. This study aims to evaluate the role of HBOT in ORN management and to identify predictive factors influencing the evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT. Methods This retrospective study includes 46 patients who received HBOT for head and neck ORN between 2017 and 2020. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=36) included those with regression or stabilization of ORN, while Group 2 (n=10) comprised patients with worsening lesions. We performed a statistical study in order to identify factors influencing ORN progression under treatment. Results ORN affected the mandible in 93.5% of patients, the maxilla in 2 cases, and the skull base in 4 cases. All patients received HBOT, with an average of 44.65 sessions. Pre-operative HBOT was administered in 17% of cases, and post-operative HBOT was given in 42% of cases. After at least 20 sessions, ORN regressed in 33% of cases, stabilized in 45%, and worsened in 22%. Analysis of factors influencing ORN progression on the univariate study revealed significant associations with high blood pressure (p=0.046), larger tumor size (p=0.004), advanced tumor stages (p=0.048), mean radiation dose (p=0.002), delays between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.045), and the location of ORN within the mandible (p=0.049). Additionally, the number of HBOT sessions significantly affected ORN evolution, with more sessions correlating with better outcomes (p=0.001). In the multivariate analysis, variables such as the average interval between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.043) as well as the number of HBOT sessions (p=0.040) emerged as significant influencers of ORN evolution. Conclusion Our study provides valuable insights into the management of ORN by identifying key predictors that influence the post-therapeutic evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT.

                Background Pakistan served as a host for more than 1.4 million Afghan refugees for more than 40 years. Access to health care is the most important issue faced by refugees, because they might be at a higher risk for certain diseases. This risk can be attributed to a lack of awareness of health care facilities, health beliefs, inadequate hygiene, cultural differences, and malnutrition. Health of individuals is closely associated with their quality of life. Quality of life over the whole lifespan is pivotal to overall life satisfaction. It includes physical wellbeing, mental health, education, occupation, income, personal safety, as well as (religious) freedom. Until now, the health status of Afghan refugees has never been comprehensively investigated in Pakistan. Therefore, an assessment in this regard is needed to explore their health-related quality of life, for securing their human right to health. Methods A cross-sectional study has been designed to describe and explain the health-related quality of life of Afghan refugees in Pakistan. Multistage cluster sampling was applied for selection of study participants. The number of respondents from two regions in Pakistan was drawn through a proportionate sampling technique. A quantitative research method using pre-validated questionnaires was used for data collection. The questionnaire included items to assess well-being, mental health, health literacy, and factors affecting health and health care. Descriptive analysis was used, whereas inferential statistical tests (binary logistic regression model) was also performed. The study received ethically permission by the Advanced Studies and Research Board of the University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. Discussion The assessment of Afghan refugee’s quality of life in Pakistan should lead to recommendations disseminated to public and health care officials. This evidence is needed for policymaking related to adequate measures for improving health conditions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

                Background Regular exercise during pregnancy improves fetal and mother outcomes unless contraindicated. Despite being generally safe and beneficial, non-participation in prenatal activity is relatively common among most of the Asian countries due to multiple reasons. In India, findings related to maternal physical activity and its determinant are scant. Objective The objective of this study is to assess the physical activity level and associated factors among pregnant women attending maternal healthcare services in Dakshina Kannada District in India. Method A multi-center community-based cross-sectional study was conducted recruiting 424 pregnant women attending the maternal healthcare facilities at four taluks of Dakshina Kannada district in Karnataka state, India. A structured questionnaire that collected information on socio-demographic, and maternal characteristics was used and the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire tool was used to determine the physical activity during pregnancy. Logistic regression model was used to determine the predictor variables. Results The prevalence of physical inactivity was 40.33%. Physical activity is favorable among pregnant women aged between 25 to 29 years, residing in an urban locality, diploma or graduation and being housewife. Determinants of physical inactivity during pregnancy were sedentary occupation (AOR 7.22, 95% CI 2.2, 23.4), low family income (AOR 3.16, 95% CI 1.414, 7.054), having one child (AOR 5.4, 95% CI 1.3, 22.2), during 2nd trimester (AOR 2.513, 95% CI 1.5, 4.23) and self-reported lack of time (AOR 2.884, 95% CI 1.410, 5.901). Conclusion and recommendation A moderate proportion of pregnant women reported physical inactivity during pregnancy in the Dakshina Kannada district, Karnataka. Physical inactivity was associated with sedentary employment, low income, number of children, trimester, and time constraints. Measures should be undertaken to promote the importance of recommended levels of physical activity, enhance access, and support system targeting pregnant women.

                <p>by Jorge Fernandez-de-Cossio-Diaz, Guido Uguzzoni, Kévin Ricard, Francesca Anselmi, Clément Nizak, Andrea Pagnani, Olivier Rivoire</p>

Exquisite binding specificity is essential for many protein functions but is difficult to engineer. Many biotechnological or biomedical applications require the discrimination of very similar ligands, which poses the challenge of designing protein sequences with highly specific binding profiles. Experimental methods for generating specific binders rely on <i>in vitro</i> selection, which is limited in terms of library size and control over specificity profiles. Additional control was recently demonstrated through high-throughput sequencing and downstream computational analysis. Here we follow such an approach to demonstrate the design of specific antibodies beyond those probed experimentally. We do so in a context where very similar epitopes need to be discriminated, and where these epitopes cannot be experimentally dissociated from other epitopes present in the selection. Our approach involves the identification of different binding modes, each associated with a particular ligand against which the antibodies are either selected or not. Using data from phage display experiments, we show that the model successfully disentangles these modes, even when they are associated with chemically very similar ligands. Additionally, we demonstrate and validate experimentally the computational design of antibodies with customized specificity profiles, either with specific high affinity for a particular target ligand, or with cross-specificity for multiple target ligands. Overall, our results showcase the potential of leveraging a biophysical model learned from selections against multiple ligands to design proteins with tailored specificity, with applications to protein engineering extending beyond the design of antibodies.

A tight regulation of morphogen production is key for morphogen gradient formation and thereby for reproducible and organised organ development. Although many genetic interactions involved in the establishment of morphogen production domains are known, the biophysical mechanisms of morphogen source formation are poorly understood. Here we addressed this by focusing on the morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in the vertebrate neural tube. Shh is produced by the adjacently located notochord and by the floor plate of the neural tube. Using a data-constrained computational screen, we identified different possible mechanisms by which floor plate formation can occur, only one of which is consistent with experimental data. In this mechanism, the floor plate is established rapidly in response to Shh from the notochord and the dynamics of regulatory interactions within the neural tube. In this process, uniform activators and Shh-dependent repressors are key for establishing the floor plate size. Subsequently, the floor plate becomes insensitive to Shh and increases in size due to tissue growth, leading to scaling of the floor plate with neural tube size. In turn, this results in scaling of the Shh amplitude with tissue growth. Thus, this mechanism ensures a separation of time scales in floor plate formation, so that the floor plate domain becomes growth-dependent after an initial rapid establishment phase. Our study raises the possibility that the time scale separation between specification and growth might be a common strategy for scaling the morphogen gradient amplitude in growing organs. The model that we developed provides a new opportunity for quantitative studies of morphogen source formation in growing tissues.

From a game of darts to neurorehabilitation, the ability to explore and fine tune our movements is critical for success. Past work has shown that exploratory motor behaviour in response to reinforcement (reward) feedback is closely linked with the basal ganglia, while movement corrections in response to error feedback is commonly attributed to the cerebellum. While our past work has shown these processes are dissociable during adaptation, it is unknown how they uniquely impact exploratory behaviour. Moreover, converging neuroanatomical evidence shows direct and indirect connections between the basal ganglia and cerebellum, suggesting that there is an interaction between reinforcement-based and error-based neural processes. Here we examine the unique roles and interaction between reinforcement-based and error-based processes on sensorimotor exploration in a neurotypical population. We also recruited individuals with Parkinson’s disease to gain mechanistic insight into the role of the basal ganglia and associated reinforcement pathways in sensorimotor exploration. Across three reaching experiments, participants were given either reinforcement feedback, error feedback, or simultaneously both reinforcement & error feedback during a sensorimotor task that encouraged exploration. Our reaching results, a re-analysis of a previous gait experiment, and our model suggests that in isolation, reinforcement-based and error-based processes respectively boost and suppress exploration. When acting in concert, we found that reinforcement-based and error-based processes interact by mutually opposing one another. Finally, we found that those with Parkinson’s disease had decreased exploration when receiving reinforcement feedback, supporting the notion that compromised reinforcement-based processes reduces the ability to explore new motor actions. Understanding the unique and interacting roles of reinforcement-based and error-based processes may help to inform neurorehabilitation paradigms where it is important to discover new and successful motor actions.

                <p>by Philip Greulich</p>

The fate choices of stem cells between self-renewal and differentiation are often tightly regulated by <i>juxtacrine</i> (cell-cell contact) signalling. Here, we assess how the interplay between cell division, cell fate choices, and juxtacrine signalling can affect the macroscopic ordering of cell types in self-renewing epithelial sheets, by studying a simple spatial cell fate model with cells being arranged on a 2D lattice. We show in this model that if cells commit to their fate directly upon cell division, macroscopic patches of cells of the same type emerge, if at least a small proportion of divisions are symmetric, except if signalling interactions are laterally inhibiting. In contrast, if cells are first ‘licensed’ to differentiate, yet retaining the possibility to return to their naive state, macroscopic order only emerges if the signalling strength exceeds a critical threshold: if then the signalling interactions are laterally inducing, macroscopic patches emerge as well. Lateral inhibition, on the other hand, can in that case generate periodic patterns of alternating cell types (checkerboard pattern), yet only if the proportion of symmetric divisions is sufficiently low. These results can be understood theoretically by an analogy to phase transitions in spin systems known from statistical physics.

                <p>by Ankur Kamboj, Rajiv Ranganathan, Xiaobo Tan, Vaibhav Srivastava</p>

Conventional approaches to enhance movement coordination, such as providing instructions and visual feedback, are often inadequate in complex motor tasks with multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). To effectively address coordination deficits in such complex motor systems, it becomes imperative to develop interventions grounded in a model of human motor learning; however, modeling such learning processes is challenging due to the large DoFs. In this paper, we present a computational motor learning model that leverages the concept of motor synergies to extract low-dimensional learning representations in the high-dimensional motor space and the internal model theory of motor control to capture both fast and slow motor learning processes. We establish the model’s convergence properties and validate it using data from a target capture game played by human participants. We study the influence of model parameters on several motor learning trade-offs such as speed-accuracy, exploration-exploitation, satisficing, and flexibility-performance, and show that the human motor learning system tunes these parameters to optimize learning and various output performance metrics.

                <p>by Frans Nordén, Behzad Iravani, Martin Schaefer, Anja L. Winter, Mikael Lundqvist, Artin Arshamian, Johan N. Lundström</p>

A core function of the olfactory system is to determine the valence of odors. In humans, central processing of odor valence perception has been shown to take form already within the olfactory bulb (OB), but the neural mechanisms by which this important information is communicated to, and from, the olfactory cortex (piriform cortex, PC) in humans are not known. To assess communication between the 2 nodes, we simultaneously measured odor-dependent neural activity in the OB and PC from human participants while obtaining trial-by-trial valence ratings. By doing so, we could determine when subjective valence information was communicated, what kind of information was transferred, and how the information was transferred (i.e., in which frequency band). Support vector machine (SVM) learning was used on the coherence spectrum and frequency-resolved Granger causality to identify valence-dependent differences in functional and effective connectivity between the OB and PC. We found that the OB communicates subjective odor valence to the PC in the gamma band shortly after odor onset, while the PC subsequently feeds valence-related information back to the OB in the beta band. Decoding accuracy was better for negative than positive valence, suggesting a focus on negative valence. Critically, we replicated these findings in an independent data set using additional odors across a larger perceived valence range. Combined, these results demonstrate that the OB and PC communicate levels of subjective odor pleasantness across multiple frequencies, at specific time points, in a direction-dependent pattern in accordance with a two-stage model of odor processing.

                <p>by Mohammad Marhabaie, Tammy H. Wharton, Sung Yun Kim, Robin P. Wharton</p>

The translational repressor Nanos (Nos) regulates a single target, maternal <i>hunchback</i> (<i>hb)</i> mRNA, to govern abdominal segmentation in the early <i>Drosophila</i> embryo. Nos is recruited to sites in the 3′ UTR of <i>hb</i> mRNA in collaboration with the sequence-specific RNA-binding protein Pumilio (Pum); on its own, Nos has no binding specificity. Nos is expressed at other stages of development, but very few mRNA targets that might mediate its action at these stages have been described. Nor has it been clear whether Nos is targeted to other mRNAs in concert with Pum or via other mechanisms. In this report, we identify mRNAs targeted by Nos via 2 approaches. First, we identify mRNAs depleted upon expression of a chimera bearing Nos fused to the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) factor Upf1. We find that, in addition to <i>hb</i>, Upf1-Nos depletes approximately 2,600 mRNAs from the maternal transcriptome in early embryos. Virtually all of these appear to be targeted in a canonical, <i>hb</i>-like manner in concert with Pum. In a second, more conventional approach, we identify mRNAs that are stabilized during the maternal zygotic transition (MZT) in embryos from <i>nos</i><sup>-</sup> females. Most (86%) of the 1,185 mRNAs regulated by Nos are also targeted by Upf1-Nos, validating use of the chimera. Previous work has shown that 60% of the maternal transcriptome is degraded in early embryos. We find that maternal mRNAs targeted by Upf1-Nos are hypoadenylated and inefficiently translated at the ovary–embryo transition; they are subsequently degraded in the early embryo, accounting for 59% of all destabilized maternal mRNAs. We suggest that the late ovarian burst of Nos represses a large fraction of the maternal transcriptome, priming it for later degradation by other factors in the embryo.

Inhibitory interneurons are pivotal components of cortical circuits. Beyond providing inhibition, they have been proposed to coordinate the firing of excitatory neurons within cell assemblies. While the roles of specific interneuron subtypes have been extensively studied, their influence on pyramidal cell synchrony in vivo remains elusive. Employing an all-optical approach in mice, we simultaneously recorded hippocampal interneurons and pyramidal cells and probed the network influence of individual interneurons using optogenetics. We demonstrate that CA1 interneurons form a functionally interconnected network that promotes synchrony through disinhibition during awake immobility, while preserving endogenous cell assemblies. Our network model underscores the importance of both cell assemblies and dense, unspecific interneuron connectivity in explaining our experimental findings, suggesting that interneurons may operate not only via division of labor but also through concerted activity.

                <p>by Kevin Yuswan, Xiaofei Sun, Erina Kuranaga, Daiki Umetsu</p>

Epithelial tissues undergo cell turnover both during development and for homeostatic maintenance. Removal of cells is coordinated with the increase in number of newly dividing cells to maintain barrier function of the tissue. In <i>Drosophila</i> metamorphosis, larval epidermal cells (LECs) are replaced by adult precursor cells called histoblasts. Removal of LECs must counterbalance the exponentially increasing adult histoblasts. Previous work showed that the LEC removal accelerates as endocytic activity decreases throughout all LECs. Here, we show that the acceleration is accompanied by a mode switching from isolated single-cell apoptosis to clustered ones induced by the endocytic activity reduction. We identify the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway via extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) activity as the main components downstream of endocytic activity in LECs. The reduced ERK activity, caused by the decrease in endocytic activity, is responsible for the apoptotic mode switching. Initially, ERK is transiently activated in normal LECs surrounding a single apoptotic LEC in a ligand-dependent manner, preventing clustered cell death. Following the reduction of endocytic activity, LEC apoptosis events do not provoke these transient ERK up-regulations, resulting in the acceleration of the cell elimination rate by frequent clustered apoptosis. These findings contrasted with the common perspective that clustered apoptosis is disadvantageous. Instead, switching to clustered apoptosis is required to accommodate the growth of neighboring tissues.

                <p>by Fanny Mazzamurro, Jason Baby Chirakadavil, Isabelle Durieux, Ludovic Poiré, Julie Plantade, Christophe Ginevra, Sophie Jarraud, Gottfried Wilharm, Xavier Charpentier, Eduardo P. C. Rocha</p>

Natural transformation is the only mechanism of genetic exchange controlled by the recipient bacteria. We quantified its rates in 786 clinical strains of the human pathogens <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> (Lp) and 496 clinical and environmental strains of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (Ab). The analysis of transformation rates in the light of phylogeny revealed they evolve by a mixture of frequent small changes and a few large quick jumps across 6 orders of magnitude. In standard conditions close to half of the strains of Lp and a more than a third in Ab are below the detection limit and thus presumably non-transformable. Ab environmental strains tend to have higher transformation rates than the clinical ones. Transitions to non-transformability were frequent and usually recent, suggesting that they are deleterious and subsequently purged by natural selection. Accordingly, we find that transformation decreases genetic linkage in both species, which might accelerate adaptation. Intragenomic conflicts with chromosomal mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and plasmids could explain these transitions and a GWAS confirmed systematic negative associations between transformation and MGEs: plasmids and other conjugative elements in Lp, prophages in Ab, and transposable elements in both. In accordance with the hypothesis of modulation of transformation rates by genetic conflicts, transformable strains have fewer MGEs in both species and some MGEs inactivate genes implicated in the transformation with heterologous DNA (in Ab). Innate defense systems against MGEs are associated with lower transformation rates, especially restriction-modification systems. In contrast, CRISPR-Cas systems are associated with higher transformation rates suggesting that adaptive defense systems may facilitate cell protection from MGEs while preserving genetic exchanges by natural transformation. Ab and Lp have different lifestyles, gene repertoires, and population structure. Nevertheless, they exhibit similar trends in terms of variation of transformation rates and its determinants, suggesting that genetic conflicts could drive the evolution of natural transformation in many bacteria.

<p>Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons involved in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and potential therapeutic interventions targeting PV interneurons. Multiply genetic and environmental factors could lead to fewer PV interneurons or downregulation of PV protein. Genetic mutations or epigenetic modifications could directly affect PV interneurons development. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction could also impact the integrity of PV interneurons and further disrupt neuronal development and migration. Aberrant PV interneurons result in functional abnormalities within gamma oscillations and neuronal circuits. Targeting PV interneurons presents a promising therapeutic strategy for ASD. Optogenetic stimulation and cell therapy have the potential to restore the function of PV interneurons and alleviate ASD symptoms.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>As an important subtype of GABAergic interneurons, parvalbumin (PV) interneurons play a critical role in regulating cortical circuits and neural networks. Abnormalities in the development or function of PV interneurons have been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social and language deficits. In this review, we focus on the abnormalities of PV interneurons in ASD, including quantity and function and discuss the underlying mechanisms of impairments in PV interneurons in the pathology of ASD. Finally, we propose potential therapeutic approaches targeting PV interneurons, such as transplanting MGE progenitor cells and utilizing optogenetic stimulation in the treatment of ASD.</p>

                Yin et al. found that intra-PBN injection of morphine or DAMGO paradoxically induces bilateral morphine-resistant mechanical pain hypersensitivity instead of relieving mechanical pain. Further, they identified a brain-to-spinal opioid pathway that controls morphine-induced mechanical OIH and analgesic tolerance. Targeting this opioid pathway rescued repetitive systemic morphine-induced mechanical OIH/tolerance in mice.

                Daume et al. show that in the human hippocampus, working memory activity of memoranda-selective neurons predicts successful long-term memory (LTM). LTM retrieval, in turn, activates memory-selective neurons more strongly for items that were previously maintained with strong working memory activity, suggesting a shared neural mechanism supporting both memory systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92925">Delivery of a Jagged1-PEG-MAL hydrogel with pediatric human bone cells regenerates critically sized craniofacial bone defects</a></h4>

              
                Current treatments for congenital and acquired craniofacial (CF) bone abnormalities are limited and costly. Conventional methods involve surgical correction, short-term stabilization, and long-term bone grafting, which may include problematic allografts and limited autografts. While bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) has been used for bone regeneration, it can cause bone overgrowth and life-threatening inflammation. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapies, though promising, are not Food and Drug Administration approved and are resource intensive. Thus, there is a need for effective, affordable, and less side-effect-prone bone regenerative therapies. Previous research demonstrated that JAGGED1 induces osteoblast commitment in murine cranial neural crest cells through a NOTCH-dependent non-canonical pathway involving JAK2–STAT5. We hypothesize that delivery of JAGGED1 and induction of its downstream NOTCH non-canonical signaling in pediatric human osteoblasts constitutes an effective bone regenerative treatment. Delivering pediatric human bone-derived osteoblast-like cells to an in vivo murine bone loss model of a critically sized cranial defect, we identified that JAGGED1 promotes human pediatric osteoblast commitment and bone formation through p70 S6K phosphorylation. This approach highlights the potential of JAGGED1 and its downstream activators as innovative treatments for pediatric CF bone loss.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98841">Operation regimes of spinal circuits controlling locomotion and the role of supraspinal drives and sensory feedback</a></h4>

              
                Locomotion in mammals is directly controlled by the spinal neuronal network, operating under the control of supraspinal signals and somatosensory feedback that interact with each other. However, the functional architecture of the spinal locomotor network, its operation regimes, and the role of supraspinal and sensory feedback in different locomotor behaviors, including at different speeds, remain unclear. We developed a computational model of spinal locomotor circuits receiving supraspinal drives and limb sensory feedback that could reproduce multiple experimental data obtained in intact and spinal-transected cats during tied-belt and split-belt treadmill locomotion. We provide evidence that the spinal locomotor network operates in different regimes depending on locomotor speed. In an intact system, at slow speeds (&lt;0.4 m/s), the spinal network operates in a non-oscillating state-machine regime and requires sensory feedback or external inputs for phase transitions. Removing sensory feedback related to limb extension prevents locomotor oscillations at slow speeds. With increasing speed and supraspinal drives, the spinal network switches to a flexor-driven oscillatory regime and then to a classical half-center regime. Following spinal transection, the model predicts that the spinal network can only operate in the state-machine regime. Our results suggest that the spinal network operates in different regimes for slow exploratory and fast escape locomotor behaviors, making use of different control mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100987">TRPML1 gating modulation by allosteric mutations and lipids</a></h4>

              
                Transient Receptor Potential Mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) is a lysosomal cation channel whose loss-of-function mutations directly cause the lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV). TRPML1 can be allosterically regulated by various ligands including natural lipids and small synthetic molecules and the channel undergoes a global movement propagated from ligand-induced local conformational changes upon activation. In this study, we identified a functionally critical residue, Tyr404, at the C-terminus of the S4 helix, whose mutations to tryptophan and alanine yield gain- and loss-of-function channels, respectively. These allosteric mutations mimic the ligand activation or inhibition of the TRPML1 channel without interfering with ligand binding and both mutant channels are susceptible to agonist or antagonist modulation, making them better targets for screening potent TRPML1 activators and inhibitors. We also determined the high-resolution structure of TRPML1 in complex with the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> inhibitor, revealing the structural basis underlying this lipid inhibition. In addition, an endogenous phospholipid likely from sphingomyelin is identified in the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-bound TRPML1 structure at the same hotspot for agonists and antagonists, providing a plausible structural explanation for the inhibitory effect of sphingomyelin on agonist activation.

                Root-synthesized secondary metabolites are critical quality-conferring compounds of foods, plant-derived medicines, and beverages. However, information at a single-cell level on root-specific secondary metabolism remains largely unexplored. <span class="small-caps">L</span>-Theanine, an important quality component of tea, is primarily synthesized in roots, from which it is then transported to new shoots of tea plant. In this study, we present a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)-derived map for the tea plant root, which enabled cell-type-specific analysis of glutamate and ethylamine (two precursors of theanine biosynthesis) metabolism, and theanine biosynthesis, storage, and transport. Our findings support a model in which the theanine biosynthesis pathway occurs via multicellular compartmentation and does not require high co-expression levels of transcription factors and their target genes within the same cell cluster. This study provides novel insights into theanine metabolism and regulation, at the single-cell level, and offers an example for studying root-specific secondary metabolism in other plant systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100821">A comparative study of the cryo-EM structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)</a></h4>

              
                The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a large multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through the cell cycle by orchestrating the timely proteolysis of mitotic cyclins and other cell cycle regulatory proteins. Although structures of multiple human APC/C complexes have been extensively studied over the past decade, the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> APC/C has been less extensively investigated. Here, we describe medium resolution structures of three <i>S. cerevisiae</i> APC/C complexes: unphosphorylated apo-APC/C and the ternary APC/C<sup>CDH1</sup>-substrate complex, and phosphorylated apo-APC/C. Whereas the overall architectures of human and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> APC/C are conserved, as well as the mechanism of CDH1 inhibition by CDK-phosphorylation, specific variations exist, including striking differences in the mechanism of coactivator-mediated stimulation of E2 binding, and the activation of APC/C<sup>CDC20</sup> by phosphorylation. In contrast to human APC/C in which coactivator induces a conformational change of the catalytic module APC2:APC11 to allow E2 binding, in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> apo-APC/C the catalytic module is already positioned to bind E2. Furthermore, we find no evidence of a phospho-regulatable auto-inhibitory segment of APC1, that in the unphosphorylated human APC/C, sterically blocks the CDC20<sup>C-box</sup> binding site of APC8. Thus, although the functions of APC/C are conserved from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to humans, molecular details relating to their regulatory mechanisms differ.

                Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are light-gated ion channels widely used to optically activate or silence selected electrogenic cells, such as individual brain neurons. Here, we describe identifying and characterizing a set of anion-conducting ChRs (ACRs) from diverse taxa and representing various branches of the ChR phylogenetic tree. The <i>Mantoniella squamata</i> ACR (MsACR1) showed high sensitivity to yellow-green light (<i>λ</i><sub>max</sub> at 555 nm) and was further engineered for optogenetic applications. A single amino-acid substitution that mimicked red-light-sensitive rhodopsins like Chrimson shifted the photosensitivity 20 nm toward red light and accelerated photocurrent kinetics. Hence, it was named red and accelerated ACR, raACR. Both wild-type and mutant are capable optical silencers at low light intensities in mouse neurons <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, while raACR offers a higher temporal resolution.

                Changes in chondrocyte gene expression can contribute to the development of osteoarthritis (OA), and so recognition of the regulative processes during chondrogenesis can lead to a better understanding of OA. microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression in chondrocytes/OA, and we have used a combined experimental, bioinformatic, and systems biology approach to explore the multiple miRNA–mRNA interactions that regulate chondrogenesis. A longitudinal chondrogenesis bioinformatic analysis identified paralogues miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p as pro-chondrogenic regulators. Experimental work in human cells demonstrated alteration of miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p expression led to significant inverse modulation of key chondrogenic genes and extracellular matrix production. miR-199a/b-5p targets <i>FZD6, ITGA3</i> and <i>CAV1</i> were identified by inhibition experiments and verified as direct targets by luciferase assay. The experimental work was used to generate and parameterise a multi-miRNA 14-day chondrogenesis kinetic model to be used as a repository for the experimental work and as a resource for further investigation of this system. This is the first multi-miRNA model of a chondrogenesis-based system, and highlights the complex relationships between regulatory miRNAs, and their target mRNAs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89873">Multi-level processing of emotions in life motion signals revealed through pupil responses</a></h4>

              
                Perceiving emotions from the movements of other biological entities is critical for human survival and interpersonal interactions. Here, we report that emotional information conveyed by point-light biological motion (BM) triggered automatic physiological responses as reflected in pupil size. Specifically, happy BM evoked larger pupil size than neutral and sad BM, while sad BM induced a smaller pupil response than neutral BM. Moreover, this happy over sad pupil dilation effect is negatively correlated with individual autistic traits. Notably, emotional BM with only local motion features retained could also exert modulations on pupils. Compared with intact BM, both happy and sad local BM evoked stronger pupil responses than neutral local BM starting from an earlier time point, with no difference between the happy and sad conditions. These results revealed a fine-grained pupil-related emotional modulation induced by intact BM and a coarse but rapid modulation by local BM, demonstrating multi-level processing of emotions in life motion signals. Taken together, our findings shed new light on BM emotion processing, and highlight the potential of utilizing the emotion-modulated pupil response to facilitate the diagnosis of social cognitive disorders.

	<p>Background: There is considerable evidence supporting the elevated risk of mental health problems in individuals with evening chronotype relative to those with morning or intermediate chronotypes. Recent data, however, suggest that this risk may be explained, at least partially, by poor sleep quality. Methods: This study aimed to further clarify the roles of chronotype and sleep quality in mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress) in young individuals (18&amp;amp;ndash;40 years) living in the UK (n = 185) or Germany (n = 209). Results: Consistent with our recent observations in a comparable North Indian sample, we found that poor quality of sleep had significantly positive associations with adverse mental health outcomes both in the UK and Germany-based samples. Significant associations between evening chronotype and poor mental health were also evident, but these associations were fully mediated by poor quality of sleep in both samples. Conclusions: These observations suggest that efforts to identify sleep disruption in a timely manner and promotion of good sleep may prevent mental health problems, especially in individuals with evening chronotype and other known risks for mental disorders.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: This study investigates the resting-state brain characteristics of skeleton athletes compared to healthy age-matched non-athletes, using resting-state fMRI to investigate long-term skeleton-training-related changes in the brain. (2) Methods: Eleven skeleton athletes and twenty-three matched novices with no prior experience with skeleton were recruited. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and seed-based functional connectivity analyses were explored to investigate resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data, aiming to elucidate differences in resting-state brain function between the two groups. (3) Results: Compared to the control group, skeleton athletes exhibited significantly higher ALFF in the left fusiform, left inferior temporal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, left and right insula, left Rolandic operculum, left inferior frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus. Skeleton athletes exhibit stronger functional connectivity in brain regions associated with cognitive and motor control (superior frontal gyrus, insula), as well as those related to reward learning (putamen), visual processing (precuneus), spatial cognition (inferior parietal), and emotional processing (amygdala), during resting-state brain function. (4) Conclusions: The study contributes to understanding how motor training history shapes skeleton athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; brains, which have distinct neural characteristics compared to the control population, indicating potential adaptations in brain function related to their specialized training and expertise in the sport.</p>

	<p>Background: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) among adolescents poses significant risks to academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being. This study examines the prevalence and risk factors of EDS in adolescents in Bangladesh and utilizes machine learning approaches to predict the risk of EDS. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1496 adolescents using a structured questionnaire. Data were collected through a two-stage stratified cluster sampling method. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were performed using SPSS. Machine learning models, including Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), were employed to identify and predict EDS risk factors using Python and Google Colab. Results: The prevalence of EDS in the cohort was 11.6%. SHAP values from the CatBoost model identified self-rated health status, gender, and depression as the most significant predictors of EDS. Among the models, GBM achieved the highest accuracy (90.15%) and precision (88.81%), while CatBoost had comparable accuracy (89.48%) and the lowest log loss (0.25). ROC-AUC analysis showed that CatBoost and GBM performed robustly in distinguishing between EDS and non-EDS cases, with AUC scores of 0.86. Both models demonstrated the superior predictive performance for EDS compared to others. Conclusions: The study emphasizes the role of health and demographic factors in predicting EDS among adolescents in Bangladesh. Machine learning techniques offer valuable insights into the relative contribution of these factors, and can guide targeted interventions. Future research should include longitudinal and interventional studies in diverse settings to improve generalizability and develop effective strategies for managing EDS among adolescents.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-203/v2?src=rss">Effectiveness of a multidimensional collaborative approach versus usual care in the treatment of adult depression in primary care in Chile: study protocol for a single blinded cluster randomized controlled trial [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 appr</a></h4>

              
                Background Major depression (MD) is a prevalent and disabling condition in Chile, with most cases being treated at the primary care level. In Chilean primary care, the authors have identified key factors associated with more complex presentations of MD and a poorer prognosis, such as a history of childhood trauma, suicidality, and comorbidities. These findings underscore the need for a multidimensional, trauma-informed, and interprofessional approach to the treatment of depression. Methods This protocol is a two-arm, single-blinded, cluster RCT to compare the effectiveness of a collaborative multidimensional approach for depression (CMAD) versus usual care to treat MD in primary care clinics in Chile. In total, 394 depressed adults from 18 to 65 years of age in twelve clinics located in Chile’s Maule Region will be consented to participate in the study. Patients and care teams from each clinic will be randomized to the intervention or to the control arm. Interprofessional teams in the intervention arm will attend 27 hours of didactic and active learning sessions focused on clinical competences to effectively engage, treat and follow up patients with the factors associated to the complex presentation of MD. Team in the control arm will receive 27 didactic sessions on current clinical guidelines for MD. Patients of both arms will be blindly assessed at baseline, three months, and six months. The primary outcome will be the reduction in depressive symptoms, with secondary outcomes including improvements in anxiety symptoms, interpersonal and social functioning, and treatment adherence. Discussion This protocol proposes the evaluation of an intervention designed to improve depression symptoms by enhancing the clinical competencies of primary care teams. These competencies are structured around collaborative care and trauma-informed practices. Trial registration NCT05016388, registered on 16 August 2021 at ClinicalTrials.gov.
