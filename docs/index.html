	<p>Neurological disorders are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vascular factors and uremic toxins are involved with cognitive impairment in CKD. In addition, vascular dementia-induced alterations in the structure and function of the hippocampus can lead to deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. However, regardless of this clinical evidence, the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in patients with CKD is not fully understood. We used male Sprague Dawley rats and performed 5/6 nephrectomy to observe the changes in behavior, field excitatory postsynaptic potential, and immunostaining of the hippocampus following CKD progression. We measured the hippocampus volume on magnetic resonance imaging scans in the controls (n = 34) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) hemodialysis patients (n = 42). In four cognition-related behavior assays, including novel object recognition, Y-maze, Barnes maze, and classical contextual fear conditioning, we identified deficits in spatial working memory, learning and memory, and contextual memory, as well as the ability to distinguish familiar and new objects, in the rats with CKD. Immunohistochemical staining of Na+/H+ exchanger1 was increased in the hippocampus of the CKD rat models. We performed double immunofluorescent staining for aquaporin-4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein and then verified the high coexpression in the hippocampus of the CKD rat model. Furthermore, results from recoding of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in the hippocampus showed the reduced amplitude and slope of fEPSP in the CKD rats. ESRD patients with cognitive impairment showed a significant decrease in the hippocampus volume compared with ESRD patients without cognitive impairment or the controls. Our findings suggest that uremia resulting from decreased kidney function may cause the destruction of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier and hippocampus-related cognitive impairment in CKD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification and targeting of a unique NaV1.7 domain driving chronic pain</a></h4>

              
                Despite identification of several small molecules directly targeting the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7, none has been clinically successful. We reported that preventing addition of a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) on the NaV1.7-interacting cytosolic collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) blocked NaV1.7 functions and was antinociceptive in rodents. Here, we discovered a 15 amino acid CRMP2 regulatory sequence (CRS) unique to NaV1.7 that is essential for this regulatory coupling. CRMP2 preferentially bound to the NaV1.7 CRS over other isoforms. Substitution of the NaV1.7 CRS with the homologous domains from the other eight voltage-gated sodium channel isoforms decreased tetrodotoxin-sensitive NaV1.7 currents in rodent sensory neurons. A cell-penetrant version of NaV1.7-CRS reduced NaV1.7 currents and trafficking, decreased presynaptic NaV1.7 localization, reduced spinal neurotransmitter release, and reversed mechanical allodynia in a rat spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain. Interfering with NaV1.7-CRMP2 coupling did not produce motor impairment and spared thermal, inflammatory, and post-surgical nociception. As proof-of-concept for NaV1.7-targeted gene therapy, we found that NaV1.7-CRS packaged into an adeno-associated virus recapitulated the effects on NaV1.7 function in both rodent and rhesus macaque sensory neurons and both reversed and prevented the development of mechanical allodynia in a neuropathic pain model in male and female rodents.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">In-vivo fast non-linear microscopy reveals impairment of fast axonal transport induced by molecular motor imbalances in the brain of zebrafish larvae</a></h4>

              
                Cargo transport by molecular motors along microtubules is essential for the function of eucaryotic cells, in particular neurons in which axonal transport defects constitute the early pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases. Mainly studied in motor and sensory neurons, axonal transport is still difficult to characterize in neurons of the brain in absence of appropriate in vivo tools. Here, we measured fast axonal transport by tracing the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal of potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) nanocrystals endocytosed by brain neurons of zebrafish (Zf) larvae. Thanks to the optical translucency of Zf larvae and of the perfect photostability of nanoKTP SHG, we achieved a high scanning speed of 20 frames (of {approx}90 mx60 m size) per second in Zf brain. We focused our study on endosomal transport in axons of known polarization, separately analyzing kinesin and dynein motor-driven displacements. To validate our assay, we used either loss-of-function mutations of dynein or kinesin 1 or the dynein inhibitor dynapyrazole, and quantified several transport parameters. We successfully demonstrated that dynapyrazole reduces nanoKTP mobile fraction and retrograde run length consistently, while the retrograde run length increased in kinesin 1 mutants. Taking advantage of nanoKTP SHG directional emission, we also quantified fluctua- tions of endosome orientation. Thus, by combining endocytosis of nanocrystals having non-linear response, fast two-photon microscopy, and high-throughput analysis, we are able to finely monitor fast axonal transport in vivo in the brain of a vertebrate, and re- veal subtle axonal transport alterations. The high spatiotemporal resolution achieved in our model may be relevant to precisely investigate axonal transport impairment associated to disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuromechanical Coupling is Reflected in the Spatial Organization of the Spinal Motoneuron Pools</a></h4>

              
                The anatomy of muscles is complex, so that a given movement can result from the activity of multiple muscle combinations, a concept termed redundancy. The central nervous system must resolve this redundancy to produce coordinated and efficient motion. One proposed mechanism that simplifies motor control is through the neural embedding of musculoskeletal dynamics. We have shown previously that the musculoskeletal anatomy of the upper extremity is organized in functional agonistic and antagonistic groups through mechanical coupling. However, it remains unknown if the neural anatomy of the spinal motoneuron pools somatotopically embeds this musculoskeletal anatomy. Here, we develop a three-dimensional model of the macaque cervical spinal cord and a corresponding OpenSim model of the upper extremity to characterize the structure-function relationship of spinal motoneurons innervating upper limb musculature. We hypothesize that the motoneuron pools of agonistic muscles that perform a coordinated action are located closer together in the spinal cord compared to antagonistic muscles. We used the spinal cord model to quantify the spatial relationship between motoneuron pools, and we used the OpenSim model to quantify the functional relationship between muscles. We used a hierarchical clustering analysis compare the structural and functional relationships. We found that the spatial organization of motoneuron pools in the spinal cord broadly mimics the anatomical relationships between muscle lengths and moment arms. Furthermore, within the same segment, the motoneurons innervating synergistic muscles were located closer to each other than to the motoneurons innervating antagonistic muscles, while across segments the motoneurons innervating specific antagonistic groups of muscles were colocalized. These results suggest that the mechanical coupling of the musculoskeletal system is embedded in the spinal cord anatomy underlying the modular organization of the neural motor control system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parallel planning through an optimal neural subspace in motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Preparatory activity in motor cortex may facilitate movement execution by representing movement parameters (representational theory) or by initializing movement-related dynamics to an optimal state (dynamical system theory). Here, we confronted these two theories using neural data from non-human primates. We analyzed the structure of preparatory activity in a task where animals needed to plan two movements simultaneously. Contrary to what the representational theory predicted, we did not find evidence for the concurrent representation of the two movements. Instead, our data revealed that parallel planning was achieved by adjusting preparatory activity to an intermediate state that served as an optimal initial condition to generate both movements. This optimization quantitatively explained fluctuations in the animals' behavior, and directly supported the dynamical system theory. Together, these results uncover a simple mechanism for planning multiple movements in parallel, and shed light on an enduring debate about the nature of preparatory activity in motor cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reducing Merkel cell activity in the whisker follicle disrupts cortical encoding of whisker movement amplitude and velocity</a></h4>

              
                Merkel cells (MCs) and associated primary sensory afferents of the whisker follicle-sinus complex robustly code whisker self-movement, angle, and whisk phase during whisking. However, direct evidence of their roles in encoding whisker movement at cortical level is currently missing. To this end, spiking activity of primary somatosensory barrel cortex (wS1) neurons was measured in response to varying whisker deflection amplitude and velocity in transgenic mice with previously established reduced mechanoelectrical coupling at MC-associated afferents. Under reduced MC activity, wS1 neurons exhibited increased sensitivity to whisker deflection. This appeared to arise from a lack of variation in response magnitude to varying whisker deflection amplitude and velocity. This latter effect was further indicated by weaker variation in the temporal profile of the evoked spiking activity when whisker deflection amplitude and velocity varied. Nevertheless, under reduced MC activity, wS1 neurons retained the ability to discriminate stimulus features based on the timing of the first post-stimulus spike. Collectively, results from this study suggest that MCs contribute to both cortical encoding of whisker amplitude and velocity predominantly by tuning cortical response magnitude and by patterning evoked spiking activity, rather than in tuning cortical response latency.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Variability in cognitive task performance in early adolescence is associated with stronger between-network anticorrelation and future attention problems</a></h4>

              
                Background Intra-individual variability (IIV) during cognitive task performance is a key behavioral index of attention and consistent marker of ADHD. In adults, lower IIV has been associated with anticorrelation between the default mode network (DMN) and dorsal attention network (DAN) - thought to underlie effective allocation of attention. However, whether these behavioral and neural markers of attention are (i) associated with each other and (ii) can predict future attention-related deficits has not been examined in a developmental, population-based cohort. Methods We examined relationships at the baseline visit between IIV on three cognitive tasks, DMN-DAN anticorrelation, and parent-reported attention problems using the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study (n=11,878 participants, aged 9-10, female=47.8%). We also investigated whether behavioral and neural markers of attention at baseline predicted attention problems, 1, 2, and 3 years later. Results At baseline, greater DMN-DAN anticorrelation was associated with lower IIV across all three cognitive tasks (unstandardized {beta}: 0.22-0.25). Older age at baseline was associated with stronger DMN-DAN anticorrelation and lower IIV ({beta}: -0.005--0.0004). Weaker DMN-DAN anticorrelation and IIV were cross-sectionally associated with attention problems ({beta}: 1.41-7.63). Longitudinally, lower IIV at baseline was associated with less severe attention problems, 1-3 years later, after accounting for baseline attention problems ({beta}: 0.288-0.77). Conclusions The results suggest that IIV in early adolescence is associated with worsening attention problems in a representative cohort of US youth. Attention deficits in early adolescence may be important for understanding and predicting future cognitive and clinical outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain Network Architecture Constrains Age-related Cortical Thinning</a></h4>

              
                Age-related cortical atrophy, approximated by cortical thickness measurements from magnetic resonance imaging, follows a characteristic pattern over the lifespan. Although its determinants remain unknown, mounting evidence demonstrates correspondence between the connectivity profiles of structural and functional brain networks and cortical atrophy in health and neurological disease. Here, we performed a cross-sectional multimodal neuroimaging analysis of 2633 individuals from a large population-based cohort to characterize the association between age-related differences in cortical thickness and functional as well as structural brain network topology. We identified a widespread pattern of age-related cortical thickness differences including hotspots of strong age effects located in brain areas with high centrality (structural network hubs). Regional age-related differences were furthermore strongly correlated within the structurally defined node neighborhood. The overall pattern of thickness differences as well as its change throughout the later lifespan was found to be anchored in the functional network hierarchy as encoded by macroscale functional connectivity gradients. Lastly, the identified difference pattern covaried significantly with cognitive and motor performance. Our findings indicate that connectivity profiles of functional and structural brain networks might act as organizing principles behind age-related cortical thinning as an imaging surrogate of cortical atrophy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CNS myelination requires VAMP2/3-mediated membrane expansion in oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Myelin is required for rapid nerve signaling and is emerging as a key driver of CNS plasticity and disease. How myelin is built and remodeled remains a fundamental question of neurobiology. Central to myelination is the ability of oligodendrocytes to add vast amounts of new cell membrane, expanding their surface areas by many thousand-fold. However, how oligodendrocytes add new membrane to build or remodel myelin is unknown. Here, we show that CNS myelin membrane addition requires exocytosis mediated by the vesicular SNARE proteins VAMP2/3. Genetic inactivation of VAMP2/3 in myelinating oligodendrocytes caused severe hypomyelination and premature death without overt loss of oligodendrocytes. Through live imaging, we discovered that VAMP2/3-mediated exocytosis drives membrane expansion within myelin sheaths to initiate wrapping and power sheath elongation. In conjunction with membrane expansion, mass spectrometry of oligodendrocyte surface proteins revealed that VAMP2/3 incorporates axon-myelin adhesion proteins that are collectively required to form nodes of Ranvier. Together, our results demonstrate that VAMP2/3-mediated membrane expansion in oligodendrocytes is indispensable for myelin formation, uncovering a cellular pathway that could sculpt myelination patterns in response to activity-dependent signals or be therapeutically targeted to promote regeneration in disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cellular contributions to ictal population signals</a></h4>

              
                The amplitude of ictal activity is a defining feature of epileptic seizures, but the determinants of this amplitude have not been studied. Pathological synchronization of neuronal activity is assumed to be the main driver of increased ictal amplitudes. However, cell intrinsic changes that drive pathological neuronal discharges may also contribute to ictal amplitude. Clinically, ictal amplitudes are measured electrographically (using e.g. EEG, ECoG, and depth electrodes), but these methods do not enable the assessment of the contributions of the amplitudes of individual neurons as well as synchronization to the amplitude of the ictal signal. We therefore measured ictal population activity by recording both electrographic local field potentials (LFP) and neuronal calcium levels, the latter measured using optical imaging of neuronal transgenic calcium-sensitive fluorophores. Spontaneous seizure activity was first assessed in an awake, behaving mouse model of focal cortical injury, using paired GCaMP6-based calcium imaging and LFP electrical recording. Spontaneous recurrent seizures were then measured in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSC), with a combination of GCaMP7 calcium imaging and LFP recordings. OHSC is an in vitro preparation in which all electrical and calcium signals could be unambiguously ascribed to the epileptic network. Population-averaged calcium activity was highly correlated with the time integral of electrographic field recordings, both in vivo and in vitro. We found that cell intrinsic changes were the largest contributor to the population signal during seizure onset. In other words, the network signal was not merely the summation of highly synchronous physiological activity, but that individual neurons were generating pathological discharges. During frank seizure, individual neurons continued to generate pathological activity, which also became highly synchronized. Interestingly, recruitment of newly active neurons accounted for only a small fraction of synchronous activity, particularly in vivo, revealing that network synchrony was largely due to reactivation of the same population of neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Corticostriatal Beta Power Changes Associated with Cognitive Function in Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive impairment (CI) is the most frequent nonmotor symptom in Parkinsons Disease (PD) and is associated with deficits in executive functions such as working memory. Previous studies have demonstrated that caudate beta power underlies learning and working memory. Decreased dopamine in motor cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits results in increased beta power and PD motor symptoms. Analogous changes in cognitive CSTC circuits, including the caudate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), may contribute to PD CI. A better understanding of anatomic structures and neurophysiologic changes associated with working memory deficits is needed to develop potential neuromodulatory treatment strategies for PD CI. The objective of our study is to evaluate neurophysiologic changes underlying cognitive dysfunction in PD patients via direct local field potential recordings during deep brain stimulation surgery. Fifteen patients were included, one of which completed 2 minutes of resting state data collection while the other fourteen completed resting state collection and task based data collection with a verbal working memory 2-back task with feedback. LFP signals from DLPFC (50 channels) and caudate (25 channels) were sampled at 1000Hz, demeaned by channel and aligned to task events of encoding and feedback. Correlations of resting state beta power and pre-operative neuropsychological testing as well as caudate volumes were performed. Beta power decreased in both DLPFC and caudate during encoding and was significantly different for correct and incorrect trials, whereas beta power increased in DLPFC and caudate during feedback and was significantly different for correct and incorrect trials. Beta power during encoding was inversely correlated with memory scores on pre-operative neuropsychological testing. Understanding neurophysiologic correlates of cognitive dysfunction within cognitive CSTC circuits will aid in development of novel neuromodulatory therapies for patients with PD CI and other cognitive disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adult neural stem cells and neurogenesis are resilient to intermittent fasting</a></h4>

              
                Intermittent fasting (IF) is a promising non-pharmacological strategy to counteract ageing which has been shown to increase the number of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus of mice. However, it is still unclear which steps of the adult neurogenesis process are regulated by IF. The number of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) decreases with age in an activation-dependent manner. To counteract the loss of the stem cell pool, adult NSCs are mostly found in an inactive, quiescent state which ensures their long-term maintenance. We aimed to determine if and how IF impacts the activity and maintenance of adult NSCs in the hippocampus. We chose an every-other-day fasting protocol with food re-administration at night, which we found effectively induces fasting features and preserves the circadian activity pattern of mice. To determine the effects of IF on NSCs and all following steps in the neurogenic lineage, we combined fasting with lineage tracing and label retention assays. We found that IF does not affect NSC activation or maintenance. Contrary to previous reports, we also found that IF does not increase hippocampal neurogenesis. We obtained the same results regardless of strain, sex, diet length, tamoxifen administration or new-born neuron identification method. Our data suggest that NSCs maintain homeostasis upon IF and that this intervention is not a reliable strategy to increase adult neurogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Longitudinal structural change of gray matter before and after hemispherotomy</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hemispherotomy is an effective surgery developed to treat refractory epilepsy caused by diffuse unihemispheric pathologies. Post-surgery neuroplastic mechanisms supporting behavioral recovery after left and right hemispherotomy as well as their difference remain largely unclear. Methods: In a large cohort of 57 pediatric patients who underwent hemispherotomy, voxel-wise GMV in unaffected regions (contralesional cerebrum and bilateral cerebellum) and behavioral abilities were assessed before and after surgery. Using linear mixed models, we evaluated changes in GMV and behavioral scores, and how GMV changes correlated with improvements in behavioral scores. In addition, three machine learning regression algorithms were applied to assess whether preoperative GMV can predict postoperative behavior. Results: In the two patient groups (29 left hemispherotomy patients, age of surgery mean {+/-} standard deviation = 3.5 {+/-} 2.5; 28 right hemispherotomy patients, age of surgery 4.6 {+/-} 2.5), widespread increases in the postoperative GMV in the contralateral cerebrum and ipsilateral cerebellum but decreases in the postoperative GMV in the contralateral cerebellum were consistently observed. Importantly, the decrease in GMV in the contralateral cerebellum was significantly correlated with improvement in behavioral scores in right but not left hemispherotomy patients. Moreover, the preoperative GMV around the most longitudinally changed locations significantly predicted postoperative behavioral scores in left but not right hemispherotomy patients. Conclusions: Our findings indicate an important role for the contralateral cerebellum in the recovery after right hemispherotomy, and postoperative behavioral scores can be predicted with preoperative GMV features.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-dependent attentional style and pupil-linked arousal regulate the reportability of spontaneous mental states</a></h4>

              
                The reportability of spontaneous thinking relies significantly on attention and arousal. As these cognitive faculties change with age, we aimed at testing how spontaneous mental state reportability is influenced accordingly. Using experience sampling, 20 senior (65-75yrs) and 20 young participants (20-30yrs) were prompted to report mind-wandering (MW), mind-blanking (MB), or sensory-related (S) mental states at random times. Attention was assessed with the Attentional Style Questionnaire, and arousal with continuous monitoring of pupil diameter. First, we found more MW occurrences than MB or S across all participants. For young responders, we replicated that MW was more prevalent in easily-distracted participants. In seniors, though, MW was more prevalent in participants with a higher focused attentional style. In senior participants who reported being more easily distracted, MW was associated with lower arousal (pupil constriction) and MB with higher arousal (pupil dilation), reversing the pattern found for young adults and focused seniors. We propose that these effects may result from intentional MW, during which senior participants allocate attentional resources to mentally engage inwards, as opposed to younger participants who get more easily distracted by their own mental activity leading to unintentional MW. Together, our results highlight age-dependent mechanisms by which attentional style and pupil-linked arousal regulate the reportability of spontaneous mental states across age.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiplexing working memory and time: encoding retrospective and prospective information in neural trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) and timing are generally considered distinct cognitive functions, but similar neural signatures have been implicated in both. To explore the hypothesis that WM and timing may rely on shared neural mechanisms, we used psychophysical tasks that contained either task-irrelevant timing or WM components. In both cases the task-irrelevant component influenced performance. RNN simulations revealed that cue-specific neural sequences, which multiplexed WM and time, emerged as the dominant regime that captured the behavioral findings. Over the course of training RNN dynamics transitioned from low-dimensional ramps to high-dimensional neural sequences, and depending on task requirements, steady-state or ramping activity was also observed. Analysis of RNN structure revealed that neural sequences relied primarily on inhibitory connections, and could survive the deletion of all excitatory-to-excitatory connections. Our results suggest that in some instances WM is encoded in time-varying neural activity because of the importance of predicting when WM will be used.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TPH2 knockout male rats are aggressive, show less anxiety, and exhibit an altered oxytocin system</a></h4>

              
                The central serotoninergic system is critical for stress responsivity and social behavior, and its dysregulations has been centrally implicated in virtually all neuropsychiatric disorders. Genetic serotonin depletion animal models could provide a tool to elucidate the causes and mechanisms of diseases and to develop new treatment approaches. Previously mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2) have been developed, showing altered behaviors and neurotransmission. However, the effect of congenital serotonin deficiency on emotional and social behavior in rats is still largely unknown, as are the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we used Tph2 knockout (Tph2-/-) male rat model to study how the lack of serotonin in the rat brain affects anxiety-like and social behaviors. Since oxytocin is centrally implicated in these behaviors, we furthermore explored whether effects of Tph2 knockout on behavior would relate to changes in the oxytocin system. We show that Tph2-/- rats display reduced anxiety-like behavior and a high level of aggression in social interactions. In addition, oxytocin receptor expression was increased in the infralimbic and prelimbic cortex, paraventricular nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus and some subregions of hippocampus, which was paralleled by increased levels of oxytocin in the medial frontal cortex, paraventricular nucleus, but not the dorsal raphe nucleus, central amygdala and hippocampus. In conclusion, our study demonstrated reduced anxiety but exaggerated aggression in Tph2-/- male rats and reveals for the first time a potential involvement of altered oxytocin system function.

                Vendor differences are thought to affect Pavlovian conditioning in rats. After observing possible differences in sign-tracking and goal-tracking behaviour with rats from different breeding colonies, we performed an empirical replication of the effect. 40 male Long-Evans rats from Charles River colonies 'K72' and 'R06' received 11 Pavlovian conditioned approach training sessions (or "autoshaping"), with a lever as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and 10% sucrose as the unconditioned stimulus (US). Each 58-min session consisted of 12 CS-US trials. Paired rats (n = 15/colony) received the US following lever retraction. Unpaired control rats (n = 5/colony) received sucrose during the inter-trial interval. Next, we evaluated the conditioned reinforcing properties of the CS, by determining whether rats would learn to nose-poke into a new, active (vs. inactive) port to receive CS presentations alone (no sucrose). Preregistered confirmatory analyses showed that during autoshaping sessions, Paired rats made significantly more CS-triggered entries into the sucrose port (i.e., goal-tracking) and lever activations (sign-tracking) than Unpaired rats did, demonstrating acquisition of the CS-US association. Confirmatory analyses showed no effects of breeding colony on autoshaping. During conditioned reinforcement testing, analysis of data from Paired rats alone showed significantly more active vs. inactive nosepokes, suggesting that in these rats, the lever CS acquired incentive motivational properties. Analysing Paired rats alone also showed that K72 rats had higher Pavlovian Conditioned Approach scores than R06 rats did. Thus, breeding colony can affect outcome in Pavlovian conditioned approach studies, and animal breeding source should be considered as a covariate in such work.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The rostral zona incerta: a subcortical integrative hub and potential DBS target for OCD</a></h4>

              
                Background: The zona incerta (ZI) is involved in mediating survival behaviors and is connected to a wide range of cortical and subcortical structures, including key basal ganglia nuclei. Based on these connections and their links to behavioral modulation, we propose the ZI is a connectional hub for mediating between top-down and bottom-up control and a possible target for deep brain stimulation for obsessive compulsive disorder. Methods: We analyzed the trajectory of cortical fibers to the ZI in nonhuman and human primates, based on tracer injections in monkeys and high-resolution diffusion MRI in humans. The organization of cortical and subcortical connections with the ZI were identified in the nonhuman primate studies. Results: Monkey anatomic data and human dMRI data showed a similar trajectory of fibers/streamlines to the ZI. PFC/ACC terminals all converge within the rostral ZI (ZIr), with dorsal and lateral areas most prominent. Motor areas terminate caudally. Dense subcortical reciprocal connections included the thalamus, medial hypothalamus, substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area, reticular formation, and pedunculopontine nucleus and a dense nonreciprocal projection to the lateral habenula (LHb). Additional connections included amygdala, dorsal raphe nucleus, and periaqueductal grey. Conclusions: Dense connections with dorsal and lateral PFC/ACC cognitive control areas and LHb and SN/VTA coupled with inputs from the amygdala, hypothalamus, and brainstem, suggests that the ZIr is a subcortical hub positioned to modulate between top-down and bottom-up control. A DBS electrode placed in the ZIr would involve both connections common to other DBS sites, but also would capture several critically distinctive connections.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced brain structure-function tethering in transmodal cortex revealed by high-frequency eigenmodes</a></h4>

              
                The brain's structural connectome supports signal propagation between neuronal elements, shaping diverse coactivation patterns that can be captured as functional connectivity. While the link between structure and function remains an ongoing challenge, the prevailing hypothesis is that the structure-function relationship may itself be gradually decoupled along a macroscale functional gradient spanning unimodal to transmodal regions. However, this hypothesis is strongly constrained by the underlying models which may neglect requisite signaling mechanisms. Here, we transform the structural connectome into a set of orthogonal eigenmodes governing frequency-specific diffusion patterns and show that regional structure-function relationships vary markedly under different signaling mechanisms. Specifically, low-frequency eigenmodes, which are considered sufficient to capture the essence of the functional network, contribute little to functional connectivity reconstruction in transmodal regions, resulting in structure-function decoupling along the unimodal-transmodal gradient. In contrast, high-frequency eigenmodes, which are usually on the periphery of attention due to their association with noisy and random dynamical patterns, contribute significantly to functional connectivity prediction in transmodal regions, inducing gradually convergent structure-function relationships from unimodal to transmodal regions. Although the information in high-frequency eigenmodes is weak and scattered, it effectively enhances the structure-function correspondence by 35% in unimodal regions and 56% in transmodal regions. Altogether, our findings suggest that the structure-function divergence in transmodal areas may not be an intrinsic property of brain organization, but can be narrowed through multiplexed and regionally specialized signaling mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oscillatory mechanisms of intrinsic brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging studies of hemodynamic fluctuations have shown specific network-based organization of the brain at rest, yet the neurophysiological underpinning of these networks in human brain remain unclear. Here, we recorded resting-state activities of neuronal populations in the key regions of default mode network (DMN, posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex), frontoparietal network (FPN, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule), and salience network (SN, anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) from 42 human participants using intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG). We observed stronger within-network connectivity of the DMN, FPN and SN in broadband iEEG power, stronger phase synchronization within the DMN across theta and alpha bands, and weaker phase synchronization within the FPN in delta, theta and alpha band. We also found positive power correlations in high frequency band (70-170Hz) and negative power correlations in alpha and beta band for FPN-DMN and FPN-SN. Robust negative correlations in DMN-SN were found in alpha, beta and gamma band. These findings provide intracranial electrophysiological evidence in support of the network model for intrinsic organization of human brain and shed light on the way how the brain networks communicate at rest.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large-scale capture of hidden fluorescent labels for training generalizable markerless motion capture models</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in deep learning-based markerless pose estimation have dramatically improved the scale and ease with which body landmarks can be tracked in studies of animal behavior. However, pose estimation for animals in a laboratory setting still faces some specific challenges. Researchers typically need to manually generate new training data for each experimental setup and visual environment, limiting the generalizability of this approach. With each network being trained from scratch, different investigators track distinct anatomical landmarks and analyze the resulting kinematic data in idiosyncratic ways. Moreover, much of the movement data is discarded: only a few sparse landmarks are typically labeled, due to the inherent scale and accuracy limits of manual annotation. To address these issues, we developed an approach, which we term GlowTrack, for generating large training datasets that overcome the relatively modest limits of manual labeling, enabling deep learning models that generalize across experimental contexts. The key innovations are: a) an automated, high-throughput approach for generating hidden labels free of human error using fluorescent markers; b) a multi-camera, multi-light setup for generating large amounts of training data under diverse visual conditions; and c) a technique for massively parallel tracking of hundreds of landmarks simultaneously using computer vision feature matching algorithms, providing dense coverage for kinematic analysis at a resolution not currently available. These advances yield versatile deep learning models that are trained at scale, laying the foundation for standardized behavioral pipelines and more complete scrutiny of animal movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cohort-mean measured macromolecules lead to more robust linear-combination modeling than subject-specific or parameterized ones</a></h4>

              
                Expert consensus recommends linear-combination modeling (LCM) of proton MR spectra with sequence-specific simulated metabolite basis function and experimentally derived macromolecular (MM) basis functions. Measured MM basis functions have been derived from metabolite-nulled spectra averaged across a small cohort. The use of subject-specific instead of cohort-averaged measured MM basis functions has not been studied. Furthermore, measured MM basis functions are not widely available to non-expert users, who commonly rely on parameterized MM signals internally simulated by LCM software. To investigate the impact of the choice of MM modeling, this study, therefore, compares metabolite level estimates between different MM modeling strategies (cohort-mean measured; subject-specific measured; parameterized) in a lifespan cohort and characterizes its impact on metabolite-age associations. 102 conventional (TE = 30 ms) and metabolite-nulled (TI = 650 ms) PRESS datasets, acquired from the medial parietal lobe in a lifespan cohort (20-70 years of age), were analyzed in Osprey. Short-TE spectra were modeled in Osprey using six different strategies to consider the macromolecular baseline. Fully tissue- and relaxation-corrected metabolite levels were compared between MM strategies. Model performance was evaluated by model residuals, the Akaike information criterion (AIC), and the impact on metabolite-age associations. The choice of MM strategy had a significant impact on metabolite level estimates. The estimates agreed relatively well between different MM strategies (r > 0.6) and had no major impact on the variance. The lowest relative model residuals and AIC values were found for the cohort-mean measured MM. Metabolite-age associations were consistently found for two major singlet signals (tCr, tCho) for all MM strategies, but varied substantially for highly J-coupled metabolites. A variance partition analysis indicated that up to 44% of the total variance was related to the choice of MM strategy. Additionally, the variance partition analysis reproduced the metabolite-age association for tCr and tCho found in the simpler correlation analysis. In summary, the inclusion of a single high-SNR MM basis function (cohort-mean) leads to more robust metabolite estimation (lower model residuals and AIC values) compared to MM strategies with more degrees of freedom (Gaussian parametrization) or subject-specific MM information. Integration of multiple LCM analyses into a single statistical model potentially improves the robustness in the detection of underlying effects (e.g. metabolite vs age), reduces algorithm-based bias, and estimates algorithm-related variance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Phenotypic screening using waveform analysis of calcium dynamics in primary cortical cultures</a></h4>

              
                At present, in vitro phenotypic screening methods are widely used for drug discovery. In the field of epilepsy research, measurements of neuronal activity have been utilized for predicting efficacy of anti-epileptic drugs. Fluorescence measurements of calcium oscillations in neurons are commonly used for measurement of neuronal activities, and some anti-epileptic drugs have been evaluated using this assay technique. However, changes in waveforms were not quantified in previous reports. Here, we have developed a high-throughput screening system containing a new analysis method for quantifying waveforms, and our method has successfully enabled simultaneous measurement of calcium oscillations in a 96-well plate. Features of waveforms were extracted automatically and allowed the characterization of some anti-epileptic drugs using principal component analysis. Moreover, we have shown that trajectories in accordance with the concentrations of compounds in principal component analysis plots were unique to the mechanism of anti-epileptic drugs. We believe that an approach that focuses on the features of calcium oscillations will lead to better understanding of the characteristics of existing anti-epileptic drugs and allow prediction of the mechanism of action of novel drug candidates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A neural substrate of sex-dependent modulation of motivation by value</a></h4>

              
                While there is emerging evidence of sex differences in decision-making behavior, the neural substrates that underlie such differences remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that in mice performing a value-based decision-making task, while choices are similar between the sexes, motivation to engage in the task is modulated by action value in females more strongly than in males. Inhibition of activity in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neurons that project to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) disrupts this relationship between value and motivation preferentially in females, without affecting choice in either sex. In line with these effects, in females compared to males, ACC-DMS neurons have stronger representations of negative outcomes, and more neurons are active when the value of the chosen option is low. In contrast, the representation of each choice is similar between the sexes. Thus, we identify a neural substrate that contributes to sex-specific modulation of motivation by value.

	<p>The locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system modulates many visceral and cognitive functions, while LC-NE dysfunction leads to neurological and neurodegenerative conditions such as sleep disorders, depression, ADHD, or Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Innovative viral-vector and gene-engineering technology combined with the availability of cell-specific promoters enabled regional targeting and selective control over phenotypically specific populations of neurons. We transduced the LC-NE neurons in adult male rats by delivering the canine adenovirus type 2-based vector carrying the NE-specific promoter PRSx8 and a light-sensitive channelrhodopsin-2 receptor (ChR2) directly in the LC or retrogradely from the LC targets. The highest ChR2 expression level was achieved when the virus was delivered medially to the trigeminal pathway and ~100&amp;amp;mu;m lateral to the LC. The injections close or directly in the LC compromised the tissue integrity and NE cell phenotype. Retrograde labeling was more optimal given the transduction of projection-selective subpopulations. Our results highlight a limited inference of ChR2 expression from representative cases to the entire population of targeted cells. The actual fraction of manipulated neurons appears most essential for an adequate interpretation of the study outcome. The actual fraction of manipulated neurons appears most essential for an adequate interpretation of the study outcome. Thus, besides the cell-type specificity and the transduction efficiency, the between-subject variability in the proportion of the remaining viral-transduced targeted cell population must be considered in any functional connectivity study.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have revealed highly reproducible patterns of temporally lagged brain activity in healthy human adults. However, it is unknown whether temporal organization of intrinsic activity is altered in migraines or if it relates to migraine chronification. In this resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study, temporal features of intrinsic activity were investigated using resting-state lag analysis, and 39 episodic migraine patients, 17 chronic migraine patients, and 35 healthy controls were assessed. Temporally earlier intrinsic activity in the hippocampal complex was revealed in the chronic migraine group relative to the other two groups. We also found earlier intrinsic activity in the medial prefrontal cortex in chronic compared with episodic migraines. Both migraine groups showed earlier intrinsic activity in the lateral temporal cortex and sensorimotor cortex compared with the healthy control group. Across all patients, headache frequency negatively correlated with temporal lag of the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampal complex. Disrupted propagation of intrinsic activity in regions involved in sensory, cognitive and affective processing of pain may contribute to abnormal brain function during migraines. Decreased time latency in the lateral temporal cortex and sensorimotor cortex may be common manifestations in episodic and chronic migraines. The temporal features of the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampal complex were associated with migraine chronification.</p>

	<p>The presence of neurological symptoms within the clinical range of COVID-19 disease infection has increased. This paper presents the situation of a 45-year-old man having the medical antecedent diabetes mellitus, who presented to the emergency department with fever, headache, and respiratory symptoms, nine days following vaccination with the Ad26.COV2-S COVID-19 vaccine. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on nasal polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Two weeks after the presentation, he developed Tolosa&amp;amp;ndash;Hunt Syndrome, an autoimmune phenomenon, with painful left ophthalmoplegia. Significant improvement was seen in terms of his discomfort; however, ptosis and ocular mobility improved only moderately after treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone, and the patient was discharged on a new insulin regimen. The patient returned after four weeks and the neurological exam results showed significant signs of right hemiparesis, mixed aphasia, incomplete left ophthalmoplegia, severe headache, and agitation; after a few days, the patient experienced a depressed level of consciousness and coma. The patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s clinical condition worsened and, unfortunately, he died. MRI brain images revealed multiple ischemic strokes, meningitis, infectious vasculitis, and hemorrhagic encephalitis, which are all serious complications of COVID-19.</p>

                The nervous system detects environmental and internal stimuli and relays this information to immune cells via neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. This is essential to respond appropriately to immunogenic threats and to support system homeostasis. Lymph nodes (LNs) act as sentinels where adaptive immune responses are generated. They are richly innervated by peripheral sympathetic and sensory nerves, which are responsible for the local secretion of neurotransmitters by sympathetic fibers, such as norepinephrine, and neuropeptides by sensory fibers, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The age of reason: Functional brain network development during childhood</a></h4>

              
                Human childhood is characterized by dramatic changes in the mind and brain. However, little is known about the large-scale intrinsic cortical network changes that occur during childhood due to methodological challenges in scanning young children. Here, we overcome this barrier by using sophisticated acquisition and analysis tools to investigate functional network development in children between the ages of 4 and 10 years (n = 92). At multiple spatial scales, age is positively associated with brain network segregation. At the system level, age was associated with segregation of systems involved in attention from those involved in abstract cognition, and with integration among attentional and perceptual systems. Associations between age and functional connectivity are most pronounced in visual and medial prefrontal cortex, the two ends of a gradient from perceptual, externally oriented cortex to abstract, internally oriented cortex. These findings suggest that both ends of the sensory-association gradient may develop early, in contrast to the classical theories that cortical maturation proceeds from back to front, with sensory areas developing first and association areas developing last. More mature patterns of brain network architecture, controlling for age, were associated with better visuospatial reasoning abilities. Our results suggest that as cortical architecture becomes more specialized, children become more able to reason about the world and their place in it.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pathway-specific inputs to the superior colliculus support flexible triggering of innate behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral flexibility requires the ability to modify the feedforward transmission of sensory information. The superior colliculus mediates visually guided innate defensive behaviors via cell-type specific projections. However, how brain-wide inputs to the superior colliculus are organized to modulate visual processing and enable flexible behavior remains unknown. To determine these rules, we focused on inhibitory projection (Gad2) neurons. Trans-synaptic tracing and neuronal recordings revealed that Gad2 neurons projecting to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGd) and the parabigeminal nucleus (PBG) form two separate anatomical and functional populations, where each circuit received a different set of non-retinal inputs. Inhibiting LGd or PBG projecting Gad2 neurons resulted in opposing effects on behavior; increasing freezing or escape probability to visual looming stimuli, respectively. These data suggest that projection-specific sampling of brain-wide inputs provide a circuit design principle that enables feed-forward transfer of visual threat to be independently adjusted to produce context specific behavior.

                Sequence processing in humans is thought to rely on two distinct mechanisms: the computation of transition probabilities between adjacent elements and the extraction of larger hierarchical structures. Previous studies indicate that both mechanisms contribute to auditory sequence processing, but whether language processing involves one or the other remains debated. To address this issue, we designed a linguistic version of the local-global auditory test, which contrasts sequential versus hierarchical violations of expectations in sentences, and we searched for violation responses in both human magnetoencephalography and computational models. We found that in models, both mechanisms coexist, whereas humans only show hierarchical structure effects. Our results suggest that human sentence processing is dominated by structure-based computations and robust to sequential effects. They point to major differences between language processing in humans versus neural models and, within humans, between the processing of linguistic sentences versus non-linguistic sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Na+/K+ pump dominates control of glycolysis in hippocampal dentate granule cells</a></h4>

              
                Cellular ATP that is consumed to perform energetically expensive tasks must be replenished by new ATP through the activation of metabolism. Neuronal stimulation, an energetically demanding process, transiently activates aerobic glycolysis, but the precise mechanism underlying this glycolysis activation has not been determined. We previously showed that neuronal glycolysis is correlated with Ca2+ influx, but is not activated by feedforward Ca2+ signaling (Diaz-Garcia, Meyer, et al., 2021). Since ATP-powered Na+ and Ca2+ pumping activities are increased following stimulation to restore ion gradients and are estimated to consume most neuronal ATP, we aimed to determine if they are coupled to neuronal glycolysis activation. By using two-photon imaging of fluorescent biosensors and dyes in dentate granule cell somas of acute mouse hippocampal slices, we observed that production of cytoplasmic NADH, a byproduct of glycolysis, is strongly coupled to changes in intracellular Na+, while intracellular Ca2+ could only increase NADH production if both forward Na+/Ca2+ exchange and Na+/K+ pump activity were intact. Additionally, antidromic stimulation-induced intracellular [Na+] increases were reduced >50% by blocking Ca2+ entry. These results indicate that neuronal glycolysis activation is predominantly a response to an increase in activity of the Na+/K+ pump, which is strongly potentiated by Na+ influx through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger during extrusion of Ca2+ following stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multisensory learning binds modality-specific neurons into a cross-modal memory engram</a></h4>

              
                Associating multiple sensory cues with objects and experience is a fundamental brain process that improves object recognition and memory performance. However, neural mechanisms that bind sensory features during learning and augment memory expression are unknown. Here we demonstrate multisensory appetitive and aversive memory in Drosophila. Combining colors and odors improved memory performance, even when each sensory modality was tested alone. Temporal control of neuronal function revealed visually-selective mushroom body Kenyon Cells (KCs) to be required for both enhancement of visual and olfactory memory after multisensory training. Voltage imaging in head-fixed flies showed that multisensory learning binds activity between streams of modality-specific KCs, so that unimodal sensory input generates a multimodal neuronal response. Binding occurs between regions of the olfactory and visual KC axons, which receive valence-relevant dopaminergic reinforcement, and is propagated downstream. Dopamine locally releases GABA-ergic inhibition to permit specific microcircuits within KC-spanning serotonergic neurons to function as an excitatory bridge between the previously modality-selective KC streams. Cross-modal binding thereby expands the olfactory memory engram by recruiting visual path KCs to become odor responsive. This broadening of the engram improves memory performance after multisensory learning and permits a single sensory feature to retrieve the memory of the multimodal experience.

	<p>Menopause accelerates increases in arterial stiffness and decreases cognitive performances. The objective of this study was to compare cognitive performances in physically active pre- and post-menopausal females and their relationship with arterial stiffness. We performed a cross-sectional comparison of blood pressure, carotid&amp;amp;ndash;femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) and cognitive performances between physically active late pre- and early post-menopausal females. Systolic (post-menopause&amp;amp;mdash;pre-menopause: +6 mmHg [95% CI &amp;amp;minus;1; +13], p = 0.27; &amp;amp;#331;2 = 0.04) and diastolic (+6 mmHg [95% CI +2; +11], p = 0.06; &amp;amp;#331;2 = 0.12) blood pressures, and cf-PWV (+0.29 m/s [95% CI &amp;amp;minus;1.03; 1.62], p = 0.48; &amp;amp;#331;2 = 0.02) did not differ between groups. Post-menopausal females performed as well as pre-menopausal females on tests evaluating executive functions, episodic memory and processing speed. Group differences were observed on the computerized working memory task. Post-menopausal females had lower accuracy (p = 0.02; &amp;amp;#331;2 = 0.25) but similar reaction time (p = 0.70; &amp;amp;#331;2 &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Moreover, this performance was inversely associated with the severity of menopausal symptoms (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.38; p = 0.05). These results suggest that arterial stiffness and performance on tests assessing episodic memory and processing speed and executive functions assessing inhibition and switching abilities did not differ between physically active pre- and post-menopausal females. However, post-menopausal females had lower performance on a challenging condition of a working memory task, and this difference in working memory between groups cannot be explained by increased arterial stiffness.</p>

	<p>Maternal obesity results in programmed offspring hyperphagia and obesity. The increased offspring food intake is due in part to the preferential differentiation of hypothalamic neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) to orexigenic (AgRP) vs. anorexigenic (POMC) neurons. The altered neurogenesis may involve hypothalamic bHLH (basic helix&amp;amp;ndash;loop&amp;amp;ndash;helix) neuroregulatory factors (Hes1, Mash1, and Ngn3). Whilst the underlying mechanism remains unclear, it is known that mitochondrial function is critical for neurogenesis and is impacted by proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF&amp;amp;alpha;. Obesity is associated with the activation of inflammation and oxidative stress pathways. In obese pregnancies, increased levels of TNF&amp;amp;alpha; are seen in maternal and cord blood, indicating increased fetal exposure. As TNF&amp;amp;alpha; influences neurogenesis and mitochondrial function, we tested the effects of TNF&amp;amp;alpha; and reactive oxidative species (ROS) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on hypothalamic NPC cultures from newborn mice. TNF&amp;amp;alpha; treatment impaired NPC mitochondrial function, increased ROS production and NPC proliferation, and decreased the protein expression of proneurogenic Mash1/Ngn3. Consistent with this, AgRP protein expression was increased and POMC was decreased. Notably, treatment with H2O2 produced similar effects as TNF&amp;amp;alpha; and also reduced the protein expression of antioxidant SIRT1. The inhibition of STAT3/NF&amp;amp;kappa;B prevented the effects of TNF&amp;amp;alpha;, suggesting that TNF&amp;amp;alpha; mediates its effects on NPCs via mitochondrial-induced oxidative stress that involves both signaling pathways.</p>

	<p>Background: Theory of mind (ToM) is a fundamental aspect of social cognition. Previous studies on age-related changes in mentalizing processes have provided conflicting results. This study aims to investigate the age-related changes in the cognitive and affective components of ToM throughout adulthood. Methods: Two hundred and thirty-eight healthy participants divided into five age groups (18&amp;amp;ndash;40 years old; 41&amp;amp;ndash;50 years old; 51&amp;amp;ndash;60 years old; 61&amp;amp;ndash;70 years; 71&amp;amp;ndash;80 years old) underwent tasks assessing the cognitive (ToM Picture Sequencing Task, TMPS, and the Advanced Test of ToM, ATT) and affective (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task, RMET, and the Emotion Attribution Task, EAT) components of ToM, in both verbal and nonverbal modality. Results: Regarding affective ToM, both the youngest- and middle-old adult groups (61 to 80 years) performed worse than the young and youngest-middle adult groups (18 to 50 years) in the RMET, but no significant differences were found in the EAT. Regarding cognitive ToM, the middle-old adult group (71 to 80 years) performed worse than the young adult group (18 to 40 years) only in the TMPS, but no significant differences were found in the ATT. Conclusion: Rather than a general decline in ToM, our results provide evidence regarding selective changes in ToM in older adults, further confirming the dissociation of cognitive and affective ToM.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sex Differences in the Alcohol-Mediated Modulation of BLA Network States</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Alcohol use, reported by 85% of adults in the United States, is highly comorbid with mood disorders, like generalized anxiety disorder and major depression. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is an area of the brain that is heavily implicated in both mood disorders and alcohol use disorder. Importantly, the modulation of BLA network/oscillatory states via parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABAergic interneurons has been shown to control the behavioral expression of fear and anxiety. Further, PV interneurons express a high density of  subunit-containing GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs), which are sensitive to low concentrations of alcohol. Therefore, we hypothesized that the effects of alcohol may modulate BLA network states that have been associated with fear and anxiety behaviors via -GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs on PV interneurons in the BLA. Given the impact of ovarian hormones on the expression of -GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs, we also examined the ability of alcohol to modulate local field potentials in the BLA from male and female C57BL/6J and <I>Gabrd</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice after acute and repeated exposure to alcohol. Here, we demonstrate that acute and repeated alcohol can differentially modulate oscillatory states in male and female C57BL/6J mice, a process that involves -GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs. This is the first study to demonstrate that alcohol is capable of altering network states implicated in both anxiety and alcohol use disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Robust, Long-Term Video EEG Monitoring in a Porcine Model of Post-Traumatic Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>To date, post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) research in large-animal models has been limited. Recent advances in neocortical microscopy have made possible new insights into neocortical PTE. However, it is very difficult to engender convincing neocortical PTE in rodents. Thus, large-animal models that develop neocortical PTE may provide useful insights that also can be more comparable to human patients. Because gyrencephalic species have prolonged latent periods, long-term video EEG recording is required. Here, we report a fully subcutaneous EEG implant with synchronized video in freely ambulatory swine for up to 13 months during epileptogenesis following bilateral cortical impact injuries or sham surgery The advantages of this system include the availability of a commercially available system that is simple to install, a low failure rate after surgery for EEG implantation, radiotelemetry that enables continuous monitoring of freely ambulating animals, excellent synchronization to video to EEG, and a robust signal-to-noise ratio. The disadvantages of this system in this species and age are the accretion of skull bone, which entirely embedded a subset of skull screws and EEG electrodes, and the inability to rearrange the EEG electrode array. These disadvantages may be overcome by splicing a subdural electrode strip to the electrode leads so that skull growth is less likely to interfere with long-term signal capture and by placing two implants for a more extensive montage. This commercially available system in this bilateral cortical impact swine model may be useful to a wide range of investigators studying epileptogenesis in PTE.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Efferent Activity Controls Hair Cell Response to Mechanical Overstimulation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The efferent pathway strengthens the auditory system for optimal performance by fine-tuning the response and protecting the inner ear from noise-induced damage. Although it has been well documented that efference helps defend against hair cell and synaptic extinction, the mechanisms of its otoprotective role have still not been established. Specifically, the effect of efference on an individual hair cell&rsquo;s recovery from mechanical overstimulation has not been demonstrated. In the current work, we explored the impact of efferent stimulation on this recovery using <I>in vitro</I> preparations of hair cells situated in the sacculi of American bullfrogs (<I>Rana catesbeiana</I>). In the absence of efferent stimulus, exposure of a hair bundle to high-amplitude mechanical deflection detuned it from its oscillatory regime, with the extent of detuning dependent on the applied signal. Efferent actuation concomitant with the hair bundle&rsquo;s relaxation from a high-amplitude deflection notably changed the recovery profile and often entirely eliminated the transition to quiescence. Our findings indicate that the efferent system acts as a control mechanism that determines the dynamic regime in which the hair cell is poised.</p>

                Background: The purpose of this study was to reveal the macroeconomic determinants that companies take into account when scheduling initial public offerings (IPOs). Methods: For this purpose, the relationship between the frequency of the IPOs and the selected macroeconomic indicators in the stock market of the G-7 countries for the period 1999-2020 was examined by panel data analysis method. A random effect model was used as econometric model in the analysis, and the Driscoll-Kraay resistant standard estimator developed against deviations was used in the application of the model. Results: According to the results of the analysis, it was determined that stock market returns have a positive and significant effect on the volume of public offerings. Conclusions: Based on our findings, it can be concluded that companies take into account the periods when stock market returns are relatively high for timing the IPO.

                Biological agents and infectious pathogens have the potential to cause very significant harm, as the natural occurrence of disease and pandemics makes clear. As a way to better understand the risk of Global Catastrophic Biological Risks due to human activities, rather than natural sources, this paper reports on a dataset of 71 incidents involving either accidental or purposeful exposure to, or infection by, a highly infectious pathogenic agent. There has been significant effort put into both reducing the risk of purposeful spread of biological weapons, and biosafety intended to prevent the exposure to, or release of, dangerous pathogens in the course of research. Despite these efforts, there are incidents of various types that could potentially be controlled or eliminated by different lab and/or bioweapon research choices and safety procedures. The dataset of events presented here was compiled during a project conducted in 2019 to better understand biological risks from anthropic sources. The events which are listed are unrelated to clinical treatment of naturally occurring outbreaks, and are instead entirely the result of human decisions and mistakes. While the events cover a wide range of cases, the criteria used covers a variety of events previously scattered across academic, policy, and other unpublished or not generally available sources.

                Background: Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii infections, but the emergence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) has rendered it ineffective in the vast majority of cases. Combination therapy has grown in popularity over the last decade; this study aims to analyze A.baumannii growth kinetics after exposure to meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam compared with meropenem and amikacin antibiotic combinations in clinically relevant concentrations.  Methods: This experimental laboratory study was conducted on the A.baumannii ATCC 19606 isolate and three clinical isolates that were intermediate or resistant to tested antibiotics. Meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam, as well as meropenem and amikacin, were tested at four different concentrations against isolates. Turbidity measurements were taken at predetermined time points of 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours following exposure; bacterial concentration was enumerated using the agar plate method, with the results plotted in a time-kill curve.   Results: A bactericidal effect was achieved in isolates that were intermediate to ampicillin sulbactam and resistant to meropenem after the administration of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam combination with a concentration of 4 µg/ml and 16/8 µg/ml, respectively. The combination of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam demonstrated bacteriostatic activity against isolates that were resistant to both antibiotics. Isolates treated with resistant antibiotics showed an increased growth rate compared to the growth control.  Conclusion: The combination of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam could be a promising combination therapy in treating CRAB infections. The mechanism and degree of antibiotic resistance in the isolates affect the efficacy of antibiotic combinations; further research is needed to corroborate the findings of this study.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The disconnect between researcher ambitions and reality in achieving impact in the Earth & Environmental Sciences – author survey [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is an increasing desire for research to provide solutions to the grand challenges facing our global society, such as those expressed in the UN SDGs (“real-world impact”). Herein, we undertook an author survey to understand how this desire influenced the choice of research topic, choice of journal, and preferred type of impact. Methods: We conducted a survey of authors who had published in >100 of our Earth & Environmental Science journals. The survey was sent to just under 60,000 authors and we received 2,695 responses (4% response rate).   Results: Respondents indicated that the majority of their research (74%) is currently concerned with addressing urgent global needs, whilst 90% of respondents indicated that their work either currently contributed to meeting real-world problems or that it would be a priority for them in the future; however, the impetus for this research focus seems to be altruistic researcher desire, rather than incentives or support from publishers, funders, or their institutions. Indeed, when contextualised within existing reward and incentive structures, respondents indicated that citations or downloads were more important to them than contributing to tackling real-world problems. Conclusions: At present, it seems that the laudable and necessary ambition of researchers in the Earth & Environmental Sciences to contribute to the tackling of real-world problems, such as those included in the UN SDGs, is seemingly being lost amidst the realities of being a researcher, owing to the prioritisation of other forms of impact, such as citations and downloads.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A simple approach for extending up to the ultra-relativistic limit the theory of a non-relativistic Fermi gas [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The theory of a Fermi gas constitutes a useful physical model with multiple applications from solid state to stellar physics. The theory of a non-relativistic Fermi gas is relatively simple when compared with the one for a relativistic Fermi gas. Therefore, it would be useful if a rigorous theory of a relativistic Fermi gas could be constructed like the theory of a non-relativistic Fermi gas. Methods: Such a theory, for T > 0 K, is presented here. It is based on using a recently reported formula for the energies of a relativistic spin-0 particle in a three-dimensional infinite well. The Pauli exclusion principle is used for taking care of the fermion nature of the particles forming a Fermi gas. Results: A unified description of a Fermi gas at low temperatures is presented. This description is valid from the non-relativistic to the ultra-relativistic limits. Moreover, it is simple. The theory follows the relatively simple approach often used for constructing the theory of a non-relativistic Fermi gas.    Conclusions: The ultra-relativistic results reported here are often obtained using a different approach than the one used in this work. These results are not new, but they corroborate the correctness of the presented approach. In addition, the relative simplicity of the approach presented in this work allows for teaching the theory of a relativistic Fermi gas in introductory quantum mechanics courses.

                Introduction : Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization in children. Estimate potentially preventable variables that impact the length of hospital stay are a priority to reduce the costs associated with this disease. This study aims to identify clinical variables associated with length of hospital stay of bronchiolitis in children in a tropical middle-income country Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in 417 infants with bronchiolitis in tertiary centers in Colombia. All medical records of all patients admitted through the emergency department were reviewed. To identify factors independently associated we use negative binomial regression model, to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and adjust for potential confounding variables Results : The median of the length of hospital stay was 3.68 days, with a range of 0.74 days to 29 days, 138 (33.17%) of patients have a hospital stay of 5 or more days. After modeling and controlling for potential confounders age <6 months, comorbidities (CHD or neurological), BPD,  chest indrawing, detection of RSV, and C-reactive protein were independent predictors of LOS Conclusions : Our results show that in infants with bronchiolitis, detection of RSV, age <6 months, comorbidities (CHD or neurological), BPD,  chest indrawing, and C-reactive protein were independent predictors of LOS. As a potentially modifiable risk factor, efforts to reduce the probability of RSV infection can reduce the high medical cost associates with prolonged LOS in bronchiolitis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Strategies for promoting sustainable use and conservation of indigenous chicken breeds in Sub-Saharan Africa: Lessons from low-income countries [version 3; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                This review explores innovative and sustainable strategies for the utilization and conservation of indigenous chickens (IC) (Gallus domesticus) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), drawing lessons from selected low-income countries. Small-scale farmers (SSF) have kept IC for hundreds of years to meet their households' nutritional needs, incomes, and social-cultural and religious uses. The commitment exhibited by SSF to keeping IC has made them the significant custodians of essential animal genetic resources AnGR in most low-income countries. Between 1991 and 2012, Zambia's private breeders invested over US$95 million in the commercial poultry sector, resulting in over a 100% increase in the annual production of day-old chicks to 65 million. However, high production costs and low market access hindered rural farmers' full participation, hence their continued dependence on IC breeds. The erosion of AnGR poses the biggest threat to IC in SSA. The Food and Agriculture Organisation, an international body of the United Nations, highlighted that over 3.5% of chicken breeds were extinct, 33% were at risk, and nearly 67% were of unknown status. Poultry diseases, lack of sustainable conservation strategies and poor use have significantly contributed to these losses. In 2012, 60% of IC were reportedly diseased in parts of SSA. The continued loss of IC-AnGR may negatively impact rural livelihoods, and future research and breeding programs in poultry may suffer. This paper reviews IC sector in parts of SSA, the socioeconomic, cultural and religious roles of IC and lessons on researcher-community-stakeholder strategies from selected low-income countries. The paper draws a conclusion and outlines some recommendations for future research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Non-zero mean alpha oscillations revealed with computational model and empirical data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alina A. Studenova, Arno Villringer, Vadim V. Nikulin</p>

Ongoing oscillations and evoked responses are two main types of neuronal activity obtained with diverse electrophysiological recordings (EEG/MEG/iEEG/LFP). Although typically studied separately, they might in fact be closely related. One possibility to unite them is to demonstrate that neuronal oscillations have non-zero mean which predicts that stimulus- or task-triggered amplitude modulation of oscillations can contribute to the generation of evoked responses. We validated this mechanism using computational modelling and analysis of a large EEG data set. With a biophysical model, we indeed demonstrated that intracellular currents in the neuron are asymmetric and, consequently, the mean of alpha oscillations is non-zero. To understand the effect that neuronal currents exert on oscillatory mean, we varied several biophysical and morphological properties of neurons in the network, such as voltage-gated channel densities, length of dendrites, and intensity of incoming stimuli. For a very large range of model parameters, we observed evidence for non-zero mean of oscillations. Complimentary, we analysed empirical rest EEG recordings of 90 participants (50 young, 40 elderly) and, with spatio-spectral decomposition, detected at least one spatially-filtred oscillatory component of non-zero mean alpha oscillations in 93% of participants. In order to explain a complex relationship between the dynamics of amplitude-envelope and corresponding baseline shifts, we performed additional simulations with simple oscillators coupled with different time delays. We demonstrated that the extent of spatial synchronisation may obscure macroscopic estimation of alpha rhythm modulation while leaving baseline shifts unchanged. Overall, our results predict that amplitude modulation of neural oscillations should at least partially explain the generation of evoked responses. Therefore, inference about changes in evoked responses with respect to cognitive conditions, age or neuropathologies should be constructed while taking into account oscillatory neuronal dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Model-based translation of DNA damage signaling dynamics across cell types</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Muriel M. Heldring, Lukas S. Wijaya, Marije Niemeijer, Huan Yang, Talel Lakhal, Sylvia E. Le Dévédec, Bob van de Water, Joost B. Beltman</p>

Interindividual variability in DNA damage response (DDR) dynamics may evoke differences in susceptibility to cancer. However, pathway dynamics are often studied in cell lines as alternative to primary cells, disregarding variability. To compare DDR dynamics in the cell line HepG2 with primary human hepatocytes (PHHs), we developed a HepG2-based computational model that describes the dynamics of DDR regulator p53 and targets MDM2, p21 and BTG2. We used this model to generate simulations of virtual PHHs and compared the results to those for PHH donor samples. Correlations between baseline p53 and p21 or BTG2 mRNA expression in the absence and presence of DNA damage for HepG2-derived virtual samples matched the moderately positive correlations observed for 50 PHH donor samples, but not the negative correlations between p53 and its inhibitor MDM2. Model parameter manipulation that affected p53 or MDM2 dynamics was not sufficient to accurately explain the negative correlation between these genes. Thus, extrapolation from HepG2 to PHH can be done for some DDR elements, yet our analysis also reveals a knowledge gap within p53 pathway regulation, which makes such extrapolation inaccurate for the regulator MDM2. This illustrates the relevance of studying pathway dynamics in addition to gene expression comparisons to allow reliable translation of cellular responses from cell lines to primary cells. Overall, with our approach we show that dynamical modeling can be used to improve our understanding of the sources of interindividual variability of pathway dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Role of actin filaments and cis binding in cadherin clustering and patterning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qilin Yu, Taeyoon Kim, Vijay Rajagopal</p>

Cadherins build up clusters to maintain intercellular contact through trans and cis (lateral) bindings. Meanwhile, interactions between cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton through cadherin/F-actin linkers can affect cadherin dynamics by corralling and tethering cadherin molecules locally. Despite many experimental studies, a quantitative, mechanistic understanding of how cadherin and actin cytoskeleton interactions regulate cadherin clustering does not exist. To address this gap in knowledge, we developed a coarse-grained computational model of cadherin dynamics and their interaction with the actin cortex underlying the cell membrane. Our simulation predictions suggest that weak cis binding affinity between cadherin molecules can facilitate large cluster formation. We also found that cadherin movement inhibition by actin corralling is dependent on the concentration and length of actin filaments. This results in changes in cadherin clustering behaviors, as reflected by differences in cluster size and distribution as well as cadherin monomer trajectory. Strong cadherin/actin binding can enhance trans and cis interactions as well as cadherin clustering. By contrast, with weak cadherin/actin binding affinity, a competition between cadherin-actin binding and cis binding for a limited cadherin pool leads to temporary and unstable cadherin clusters.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimal control of the spatial allocation of COVID-19 vaccines: Italy as a case study</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joseph Chadi Lemaitre, Damiano Pasetto, Mario Zanon, Enrico Bertuzzo, Lorenzo Mari, Stefano Miccoli, Renato Casagrandi, Marino Gatto, Andrea Rinaldo</p>

While campaigns of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 are underway across the world, communities face the challenge of a fair and effective distribution of a limited supply of doses. Current vaccine allocation strategies are based on criteria such as age or risk. In the light of strong spatial heterogeneities in disease history and transmission, we explore spatial allocation strategies as a complement to existing approaches. Given the practical constraints and complex epidemiological dynamics, designing effective vaccination strategies at a country scale is an intricate task. We propose a novel optimal control framework to derive the best possible vaccine allocation for given disease transmission projections and constraints on vaccine supply and distribution logistics. As a proof-of-concept, we couple our framework with an existing spatially explicit compartmental COVID-19 model tailored to the Italian geographic and epidemiological context. We optimize the vaccine allocation on scenarios of unfolding disease transmission across the 107 provinces of Italy, from January to April 2021. For each scenario, the optimal solution significantly outperforms alternative strategies that prioritize provinces based on incidence, population distribution, or prevalence of susceptibles. Our results suggest that the complex interplay between the mobility network and the spatial heterogeneities implies highly non-trivial prioritization strategies for effective vaccination campaigns. Our work demonstrates the potential of optimal control for complex and heterogeneous epidemiological landscapes at country, and possibly global, scales.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Dynamin is primed at endocytic sites for ultrafast endocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Imoto et al. demonstrate that a splice variant of Dynamin 1, Dyn1xA, mediates vesicle scission during ultrafast endocytosis. For such a rapid event, Dyn1xA molecules are concentrated at endocytic zones through molecular condensation with Syndapin 1. This cache of Dyn1xA accelerates the kinetics of endocytosis by 100-fold.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Motor learning selectively strengthens cortical and striatal synapses of motor engram neurons</a></h4>

              
                In this study, Hwang, Roth, et al. find that motor learning recruits a population of engram neurons in the motor cortex that are reactivated during task performance. Motor learning leads to selective remodeling of dendritic spines and strengthening of outputs to the striatum of M1 engram neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Novelty and uncertainty regulate the balance between exploration and exploitation through distinct mechanisms in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Cockburn et al. show that novelty and uncertainty are used by the human brain to guide distinct exploration strategies. Uncertainty-directed exploration considers the prospective benefit of new information, whereas novelty motivates exploration by inflating the brain’s expectation of reward, offering a feasible decomposition of an otherwise intractable explore/exploit dilemma.

                Of all the non-human primate species studied by researchers, the rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) is likely the most widely used across biological disciplines. Rhesus macaques have thrived during the Anthropocene and now have the largest natural range of any non-human primate. They are highly social, exhibit marked genetic diversity, and display remarkable niche flexibility (which allows them to live in a range of habitats and survive on a variety of diets). These characteristics mean that rhesus macaques are well-suited for understanding the links between sociality, health and fitness, and also for investigating intra-specific variation, adaptation and other topics in evolutionary ecology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Metabolic arsenal of giant viruses: Host hijack or self-use?</a></h4>

              
                Viruses generally are defined as lacking the fundamental properties of living organisms in that they do not harbor an energy metabolism system or protein synthesis machinery. However, the discovery of giant viruses of amoeba has fundamentally challenged this view because of their exceptional genome properties, particle sizes and encoding of the enzyme machinery for some steps of protein synthesis. Although giant viruses are not able to replicate autonomously and still require a host for their multiplication, numerous metabolic genes involved in energy production have been recently detected in giant virus genomes from many environments. These findings have further blurred the boundaries that separate viruses and living organisms. Herein, we summarize information concerning genes and proteins involved in cellular metabolic pathways and their orthologues that have, surprisingly, been discovered in giant viruses. The remarkable diversity of metabolic genes described in giant viruses include genes encoding enzymes involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, photosynthesis, and β-oxidation. These viral genes are thought to have been acquired from diverse biological sources through lateral gene transfer early in the evolution of Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses, or in some cases more recently. It was assumed that viruses are capable of hijacking host metabolic networks. But the giant virus auxiliary metabolic genes also may represent another form of host metabolism manipulation, by expanding the catalytic capabilities of the host cells especially in harsh environments, providing the infected host cells with a selective evolutionary advantage compared to non-infected cells and hence favoring the viral replication. However, the mechanism of these genes' functionality remains unclear to date.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modelling the response to vaccine in non-human primates to define SARS-CoV-2 mechanistic correlates of protection</a></h4>

              
                The definition of correlates of protection is critical for the development of next generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platforms. Here, we propose a model-based approach for identifying mechanistic correlates of protection based on mathematical modelling of viral dynamics and data mining of immunological markers. The application to three different studies in non-human primates evaluating SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on CD40-targeting, two-component spike nanoparticle and mRNA 1273 identifies and quantifies two main mechanisms that are a decrease of rate of cell infection and an increase in clearance of infected cells. Inhibition of RBD binding to ACE2 appears to be a robust mechanistic correlate of protection across the three vaccine platforms although not capturing the whole biological vaccine effect. The model shows that RBD/ACE2 binding inhibition represents a strong mechanism of protection which required significant reduction in blocking potency to effectively compromise the control of viral replication.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Core genes can have higher recombination rates than accessory genes within global microbial populations</a></h4>

              
                Recombination is essential to microbial evolution, and is involved in the spread of antibiotic resistance, antigenic variation, and adaptation to the host niche. However, assessing the impact of homologous recombination on accessory genes which are only present in a subset of strains of a given species remains challenging due to their complex phylogenetic relationships. Quantifying homologous recombination for accessory genes (which are important for niche-specific adaptations) in comparison to core genes (which are present in all strains and have essential functions) is critical to understanding how selection acts on variation to shape species diversity and genome structures of bacteria. Here, we apply a computationally efficient, non-phylogenetic approach to measure homologous recombination rates in the core and accessory genome using &gt;100,000 whole genome sequences from <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> and several additional species. By analyzing diverse sets of sequence clusters, we show that core genes often have higher recombination rates than accessory genes, and for some bacterial species the associated effect sizes for these differences are pronounced. In a subset of species, we find that gene frequency and homologous recombination rate are positively correlated. For <i>S. pneumoniae</i> and several additional species, we find that while the recombination rate is higher for the core genome, the mutational divergence is lower, indicating that divergence-based homologous recombination barriers could contribute to differences in recombination rates between the core and accessory genome. Homologous recombination may therefore play a key role in increasing the efficiency of selection in the most conserved parts of the genome.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Green fluorescent protein-like pigments optimize the internal light environment in symbiotic reef building corals</a></h4>

              
                Pigments homologous to the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) have been proposed to fine-tune the internal light microclimate of corals, facilitating photoacclimation of photosynthetic coral symbionts (Symbiodiniaceae) to life in different reef habitats and environmental conditions. However, direct measurements of the <i>in vivo</i> light conditions inside the coral tissue supporting this conclusion are lacking. Here, we quantified the intra-tissue spectral light environment of corals expressing GFP-like proteins from widely different light regimes. We focus on (1) photoconvertible red fluorescent proteins (pcRFPs), thought to enhance photosynthesis in mesophotic habitats via wavelength conversion, and (2) chromoproteins (CPs), which provide photoprotection to the symbionts in shallow water via light absorption. Optical microsensor measurements indicated that both pigment groups strongly alter the coral tissue light environment. Estimates derived from light spectra measured in pcRFP-containing corals showed that fluorescence emission can contribute to &gt;50% of orange-red light available to the photosynthetic symbionts at mesophotic depths. We further show that upregulation of pink CPs in shallow-water corals during bleaching leads to a reduction of orange light by 10-20% compared to low-CP tissue. Thus, screening by CPs has an important role in mitigating the light-enhancing effect of coral tissue scattering during bleaching. Our results provide the first experimental quantification of the importance of GFP-like proteins in fine-tuning the light microclimate of corals during photoacclimation.

                Quinoa germplasm preserves useful and substantial genetic variation, yet it remains untapped due to a lack of implementation of modern breeding tools. We have integrated field and sequence data to characterize a large diversity panel of quinoa. Whole-genome sequencing of 310 accessions revealed 2.9 million polymorphic high confidence SNP loci. Highland and Lowland quinoa were clustered into two main groups, with <i>F<sub>ST</sub></i> divergence of 0.36 and LD decay of 6.5 and 49.8 Kb, respectively. A genome-wide association study using multi-year phenotyping trials uncovered 600 SNPs stably associated with 17 traits. Two candidate genes are associated with thousand seed weight, and a resistance gene analog is associated with downy mildew resistance. We also identified pleiotropically acting loci for four agronomic traits important for adaptation. This work demonstrates the use of re-sequencing data of an orphan crop, which is partially domesticated to rapidly identify marker-trait association and provides the underpinning elements for genomics-enabled quinoa breeding.

                Establishing with precision the quantity and identity of the cell types of the brain is a prerequisite for a detailed compendium of gene and protein expression in the central nervous system (CNS). Currently, however, strict quantitation of cell numbers has been achieved only for the nervous system of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Here, we describe the development of a synergistic pipeline of molecular genetic, imaging, and computational technologies designed to allow high-throughput, precise quantitation with cellular resolution of reporters of gene expression in intact whole tissues with complex cellular constitutions such as the brain. We have deployed the approach to determine with exactitude the number of functional neurons and glia in the entire intact larval <i>Drosophila</i> CNS, revealing fewer neurons and more glial cells than previously predicted. We also discover an unexpected divergence between the sexes at this juvenile developmental stage, with the female CNS having significantly more neurons than that of males. Topological analysis of our data establishes that this sexual dimorphism extends to deeper features of CNS organisation. We additionally extended our analysis to quantitate the expression of voltage-gated potassium channel family genes throughout the CNS and uncover substantial differences in abundance. Our methodology enables robust and accurate quantification of the number and positioning of cells within intact organs, facilitating sophisticated analysis of cellular identity, diversity, and gene expression characteristics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genetically controlled mtDNA deletions prevent ROS damage by arresting oxidative phosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                Deletion of mitochondrial DNA in eukaryotes is currently attributed to rare accidental events associated with mitochondrial replication or repair of double-strand breaks. We report the discovery that yeast cells arrest harmful intramitochondrial superoxide production by shutting down respiration through genetically controlled deletion of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes. We show that this process critically involves the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 2 and two-way mitochondrial-nuclear communication through Rtg2 and Rtg3. While mitochondrial DNA homeostasis is rapidly restored after cessation of a short-term superoxide stress, long-term stress causes maladaptive persistence of the deletion process, leading to complete annihilation of the cellular pool of intact mitochondrial genomes and irrevocable loss of respiratory ability. This shows that oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial impairment may be under strict regulatory control. If the results extend to human cells, the results may prove to be of etiological as well as therapeutic importance with regard to age-related mitochondrial impairment and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predicting the principal components of cortical morphological variables</a></h4>

              
                The generating mechanism for the gyrification of the mammalian cerebral cortex remains a central open question in neuroscience. Although many models have been proposed over the years, very few were able to provide empirically testable predictions. In this paper, we assume a model in which the cortex folds for all species of mammals according to a simple mechanism of effective free energy minimization of a growing self-avoiding surface subjected to inhomogeneous bulk stresses to derive a new set of morphological variables to express cortical morphology. In terms of these new variables, we seek to understand the variance present in two morphometric datasets: a human MRI harmonized multi-site dataset comprised by 3324 healthy controls (CTL) from 4 to 96 years old and a collection of different mammalian cortices with morphological measurements extracted manually. This is done using a standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the cortical morphometric space. We prove there is a remarkable coincidence (typically less than 8 degrees) between the resulting principal components vectors in each datasets and the directions corresponding to the new variables. This shows that the new, theoretically-derived variables are a set of natural and independent morphometrics with which to express cortical shape and size.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating the efficacy of prototype antiseizure drugs using a preclinical pharmacokinetic approach</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Pharmacokinetics (PK) of a drug drive its exposure, efficacy, and tolerability. A thorough preclinical PK assessment of antiseizure medications (ASMs) is therefore essential to evaluate the clinical potential. We tested protection against evoked seizures of prototype ASMs in conjunction with analysis of plasma and brain PK as a proof-of-principle study to enhance our understanding of drug efficacy and duration of action using rodent seizure models. Methods: In vivo seizure protection assays were performed in adult male CF-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. Clobazam (CLB), N-desmethylclobzam (NCLB), carbamazepine (CBZ), carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZE), valproic acid (VPA), and levetiracetam (LEV) concentrations were quantified in plasma and brain using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Mean concentrations of each analyte were calculated and used to determine PK parameters via non-compartmental analysis in Phoenix WinNonLin. Results: NCLB concentrations were approximately 10-fold greater than CLB in mice. The antiseizure profile of CLB was partially sustained by NCLB in mice. CLB concentrations were lower in rats than in mice. CBZE plasma exposures were approximately 70% of CBZ in both mice and rats, likely contributing to the antiseizure effect of CBZ. VPA showed a relatively short half-life in both mice and rats, which correlated with a sharp decline in efficacy. LEV had a prolonged brain and plasma half-life, associated with a prolonged duration of action in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An ERP investigation of accented isolated single word processing</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies show that there are differences in native and non-native speech processing (Lev-Ari, 2018). However, less is known about the differences between processing native and dialectal accents. Is dialectal processing more similar to foreign or native speech? To address this, two theories have been proposed. The Perceptual Distance Hypothesis states that the mechanisms underlying dialectal accent processing are attenuated versions of those of foreign (Clarke & Garrett, 2004). Conversely, the Different Processes Hypothesis argues that the mechanisms of foreign and dialectal accent processing are qualitatively different (Floccia et al, 2006). The present study addresses these hypotheses. Electroencephalographic data was recorded from 25 participants who listened to 40 isolated words in different accents. Event-Related Potential mean amplitudes were extracted: P2 [150-250 ms], PMN [250-400 ms] and N400 [400-600 ms]. Support for the Different Processes Hypothesis was found in different time windows. Results show that early processing mechanisms distinguish only between native and non-native speech, with a reduced P2 amplitude for foreign accent processing, supporting the Different Processes Hypothesis. Furthermore, later processing mechanisms show a similar binary difference in the processing of the accents, with a larger PMN negativity elicited in the foreign accent than the others, further supporting the Different Processes Hypothesis. Results contribute to the understanding of single word processing, in which it is uniquely difficult to extract acoustic characteristics from foreign accent, and in which foreign accented speech is associated with the largest cost, as compared to native and dialectal speech, of phonological matching between representations and acoustic input.

                Objects and landmarks are crucial for guiding navigation and must be integrated into the cognitive map of space. Studies of object coding in the hippocampus have primarily focused on activity of single cells. Here we record simultaneously from large numbers of hippocampal CA1 neurons to determine how the presence of a salient object in the environment alters single-neuron and neural-population dynamics of the area. Only a small number of cells fired consistently at the object location, or at a fixed distance and direction from it; yet the majority of the cells showed some change in their spatial firing patterns when the object was introduced. At the neural population level, these changes were systematically organized according to the animal's distance from the object. This organization was widely distributed across the cell sample, suggesting that some features of cognitive maps - including object representation - are best understood as emergent properties of neural populations.

                Navigation is one of the most fundamental cognitive skills for the survival of fish, the largest vertebrate class, and almost all other animal classes. A critical component of the neural basis of navigation is the encoding of space in the activity of single neurons. To study this basic cognitive component in fish, we 8 recorded the activity of single neurons in the central area of the goldfish telencephalon while the fish were freely navigating in a 3D water tank. We found neurons with firing patterns that gradually increased or decreased along spatial axes distributed in all directions. Some of these cells exhibited beta rhythm oscillations. This type of axial coding for spatial representation in the brains of fish is unique among space encoding cells in vertebrates and provides insights into spatial cognition in this lineage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensory adaptation in the barrel cortex during active sensation in the awake, behaving mouse</a></h4>

              
                Sensory adaptation (SA) is a prominent aspect of how neurons in anaesthetised animals respond to sensory signals, ubiquitous across species and modalities. However, SA depends on the activation state of the brain and it has been doubted whether SA is expressed in behaving animals. Here, we addressed this question by training mice to detect an object using their whiskers and recording neuronal activity from barrel cortex whilst simultaneously imaging the whiskers in 3D. We found that neuronal responses decreased during the course of whisker-object touch sequences but that this was due to two factors. First, a motor effect, whereby, during a sequence of touches, later touches were mechanically weaker than early ones. Second, a sensory encoding effect, whereby neuronal tuning to touch became progressively less sensitive during the course of a touch sequence. The sensory encoding effect was whisker-specific. These results show that SA does occur during active whisker sensing and suggest that SA is fundamental to sensation during natural behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortico-cerebellar coordination facilitates neuroprosthetic learning</a></h4>

              
                Temporal coordination among neurons and development of functional neuronal assemblies is central to nervous system function and purposeful behavior. Still, there is a paucity of evidence about how functional coordination emerges in neuronal assemblies in cortical and subcortical regions that are directly related to the control of functional output. We investigated emergent neural dynamics between primary motor cortex (M1) and the contralateral cerebellar cortex as rats learned a neuroprosthetic/ brain-machine interface (BMI) task. BMIs offer a powerful tool to causally test how distributed neural networks achieve specific neural patterns. During neuroprosthetic learning, actuator movements are causally linked to primary motor cortex (M1) neurons, i.e., direct neurons, that project to the decoder and whose firing is required to successfully perform the task. However, it is unknown how such direct M1 activity interacts with cerebellar activity. We observed a striking 3-6 Hz coherence that emerged between these regions local-field potentials (LFPs) with neuroprosthetic learning which also modulated task-related spiking. We found a robust task-related indirect modulation in the cerebellum, and we found that it became synchronous with M1-direct activity with learning. We also performed optogenetic inhibition of cerebellar activity and found that this led to performance impairments in neuroprosthetic control. Together, these results demonstrate that coordinated neural dynamics emerge in cortico-cerebellar regions during neuroprosthetic learning which supports task-relevant activity in M1 direct neuronal populations, and further, that cerebellar influence is necessary for M1-driven rapid direct neural control.

	<p>Background: Rotenone (ROT) is currently being used in various research fields, especially neuroscience. Separated from other neurotoxins, ROT induces a Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD)-related phenotype that mimics the associated clinical spectrum by directly entering the central nervous system (CNS). It easily crosses through the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) and accumulates in mitochondria. Unfortunately, most of the existing data focus on locomotion. This is why the present study aimed to bring novel evidence on how ROT alone or in combination with different potential ant(agonists) might influence the social and aggressive behavior using the counterclockwise rotation as a neurological pointer. Material and Methods: Thus, we exposed zebrafish to ROT&amp;amp;mdash;2.5 &amp;amp;micro;g/L, valproic acid (VPA)&amp;amp;mdash;0.5 mg/mL, anti-parkinsonian drugs (LEV/CARB)&amp;amp;mdash;250 mg + 25 mg, and probiotics (PROBIO)&amp;amp;mdash;3 g for 32 days by assessing the anti-social profile and mirror tests and counterclockwise rotation every 4 days to avoid chronic stress. Results: We observed an abnormal pattern in the counterclockwise rotation only in the (a) CONTROL, (c) LEV/CARB, and (d) PROBIO groups, from both the top and side views, this indicating a reaction to medication and supplements administered or a normal intrinsic feature due to high levels of stress/anxiety (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Four out of eight studied groups&amp;amp;mdash;(b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, (e) ROT, and (f) ROT + VPA&amp;amp;mdash;displayed an impaired, often antithetical behavior demonstrated by long periods of time on distinct days spent on the right and the central arm (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001). Interestingly, groups (d) PROBIO, (g) ROT + LEV/CARB, and (h) ROT + PROBIO registered fluctuations but not significant ones in contrast with the above groups (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Except for groups (a) CONTROL and (d) PROBIO, where a normalized trend in terms of behavior was noted, the rest of the experimental groups exhibited exacerbated levels of aggression (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001) not only near the mirror but as an overall reaction (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, 0.005, and 0.001). Conclusions: The (d) PROBIO group showed a significant improvement compared with (b) VPA, (c) LEV/CARB, and ROT-treated zebrafish (e&amp;amp;mdash;h). Independently of the aggressive-like reactions and fluctuations among the testing day(s) and groups, ROT disrupted the social behavior, while VPA promoted a specific typology in contrast with LEV/CARB.</p>

	<p>Background: Many investigations have been performed on the effects of mental exertion that consumes self-regulatory resources and then affects physical and/or cognitive performance later on. However, the effect of manipulating self-regulation and interventions to attenuate this negative effect remains unclear. Moreover, there is continuous controversy regarding the resource model of self-regulation. Objective: We conducted a systematic review to assess the literature on manipulating self-regulation based on four ingredients (standard, monitoring, strength, and motivation) in order to counter mental exertion and improve physical and/or cognitive performance. The results provide more insight into the resource model. Method: A thorough search was conducted to extract the relevant literature from several databases, as well as Google Scholar, and the sources from the references were included as grey literature. A self-regulation intervention compared to a control condition, a physical and/or cognitive task, and a randomised controlled trial were selected. Result: A total of 39 publications were included. Regarding the four components of self-regulation, the interventions could mainly be divided into the following: (i) standard: implementation intervention; (ii) monitoring: biofeedback and time monitoring; (iii) strength: repeated exercise, mindfulness, nature exposure, and recovery strategies; (iv) motivation: autonomy-supportive and monetary incentives. The majority of the interventions led to significant improvement in subsequent self-regulatory performance. In addition, the resource model of self-regulation and attention-restoration theory were the most frequently used theories and supported relevant interventions. Conclusion: In line with the resource model, manipulating the four components of self-regulation can effectively attenuate the negative influence of mental exertion. The conservation proposed in the strength model of self-regulation was supported in the current findings to explain the role of motivation in the self-regulation process. Future studies can focus on attention as the centre of the metaphorical resource in the model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Subregion of Insular Cortex Is Required for Rapid Taste-Visceral Integration and Consequent Conditioned Taste Aversion and Avoidance Expression in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Postingestive signals are important for shaping appetitive and consummatory responses, but the brain mechanisms required to assimilate interoceptive events with those at the frontlines of ingestion (taste-guided) are poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether an insular cortex (IC) region, which receives viscerosensory input, including gustatory, is required to modify taste-elicited consummatory reactions in response to a real-time interoceptive change using a serial taste reactivity (TR) test where the rats&rsquo; oromotor and somatic reactions to intraoral (IO) infusions of sucrose were periodically assessed over 45 min following lithium chloride (LiCl) administration. Results showed that neurally-intact rats shifted from an ingestive repertoire to an aversive one as LiCl took effect. Overall, this hedonic shift was delayed in rats with bilateral neurotoxic IC lesions. Rats with greater neuronal loss in posterior gustatory IC displayed fewer aversive reactions to sucrose following this initial LiCl injection. We further assessed whether the failure to integrate interoceptive feedback with ongoing taste-guided behavior impaired acquisition and/or expression of conditioned aversion and/or avoidance in these same rats. Although, as a group, LiCl-injected rats with IC lesions subsequently avoided the sugar in a 48-h two-bottle test, their preference for sucrose was significantly greater than that of the LiCl-injected neurally-intact rats. Overall lesion size, as well as proportion of the posterior gustatory and/or anterior visceral IC were each associated with impaired avoidance. These findings reveal new roles for the posterior gustatory and anterior visceral ICs in multisensory integrative function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Peruvian children toothbrushing during the COVID-19 pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Toothbrushing is a convenient, inexpensive, widespread and culturally accepted method, resulting in an ideal public health outcome. This study aimed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on toothbrushing in Peruvian children. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted using a database of children aged 0 to 11 years, with a final sample of 39,124 participants, 15,974 in 2019 (62.03%) and 7088 in 2020 (55.54%). General toothbrushing, daily toothbrushing and minimum frequency of two times a day were dependent variables; the year was considered as the independent variable. In addition, other covariates such as geographical landscape, area of residence, place of residence, altitude, wealth index, health insurance cover, sex and age. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied. Results: General toothbrushing was 96.19% (n=51 013), daily toothbrushing was 87.47% (n=42 246) and minimum toothbrushing two times a day was 84.53% (n=33 957). In multivariate form, the year presented a negative association with daily toothbrushing (RPa: 0.97; CI95%: 0.96-0.98; p<0.001) and minimum toothbrushing two times a day (RPa: 0.97; CI95%: 0.95-0.98; p<0.001), adjusted for the previously associated co-variables. Conclusions: The year 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted daily toothbrushing and minimum twice-daily toothbrushing of Peruvian children.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">MRI data harmonization across sites using ComBat enhances classification of meningioma and glioma brain-tumors in dogs: a case study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in clinical patients is often evaluated for diagnostic purposes. However, to develop a disease classifier, imaging data can be “noisy”, as in being heterogeneous (e.g., obtained from multiple sites), having significant crossover between normal and pathological processes, being highly imbalanced for the outcome variable (i.e., unequal numbers of cases and controls), or due to a lack of accurate quantitative analysis tools that are transferable, easily usable, and accurate to generate the final image variables for machine learning analyses. Methods: In this article, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ComBat harmonization of heterogeneous MRI data on dogs’ brains, collected across multiple sites, prior to using them in the random forest (RF) classifier to attempt to differentiate the meningioma and the glioma tumor-types. We consider three image variables generated from each of the brain scans and three clinical covariates – age, sex, and breedtype – for each subject. The scans are generated either at Colorado State University (CSU) or outside CSU. We compare the RF classifier performance in identifying the two tumor types, with and without preprocessing the data with ComBat site-specific harmonization. Results: The post-ComBat disease classification accuracy measures – sensitivity, specificity, and total accuracy – indicate an overall significant edge in the RF performance compared to their without-ComBat counterparts across different scenarios. Moreover, incorporating both the image variables and the clinical covariates in the RF model results in the highest total accuracy. Conclusions: Use of MRI data in combination with clinical covariates is more informative than using only clinical covariates in classifying meningioma and glioma brain-tumors in dogs. Moreover, as a preprocessing step for MRI data, we recommend adjusting for the site-specific variability using ComBat harmonization prior to performing downstream analyses, such as disease classification.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Estimated number of deaths directly avoided because of COVID-19 vaccination among older adults in Colombia in 2021: an ecological, longitudinal observational study [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Colombia’s national COVID-19 vaccination plan began in February of 2021. It gave priority to older adults, who constituted 77.7% of deaths from this illness in the year 2020. The main goal of the plan is to decrease specific mortality and the number of serious COVID-19 cases, however, the number of deaths avoided by this strategy is unknown. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of avoided deaths in Colombia by fully vaccinating older adults against COVID-19, during the first year of the implementation of the national vaccination plan. Methods: This study took on the design of an ecological, longitudinal study. Full vaccination coverage for older adults was calculated for each epidemiological week and age group from March to December 2021, based on which the number of avoided COVID-19 deaths was estimated. A sensitivity analysis was performed taking into account variations in the vaccines’ effectiveness by age group. Results: In Colombia, over 5.3 million adults 60 years of age and older received full COVID-19 vaccinations between March and December 2021. During that same period, nearly 46,000 deaths of older adults from this cause were registered. We estimated that vaccination has avoided around 22,000 more older adults from dying from COVID-19 in Colombia, that is, 32.4% of expected deaths in 2021. According to the sensitivity analysis, the number of lives saved ranged from 19,597 to 36,507. Conclusions: Colombia’s strategy to vaccinate older adults against COVID-19 has avoided mortality for this age group from being 48.0% higher than what was observed during the study period. Even more lives have been saved when taking into account the parameters that were defined and the omission of the contribution from partial vaccinations.

                Background: Hypertensive African Americans have a ~50% response rate to thiazide diuretic treatment. This contributes to a high prevalence of uncontrolled high blood pressure. Here, we examined the role of the mitochondrial genome on thiazide diuretic treatment response in hypertensive African Americans enrolled in a clinical trial. Methods: Participants from the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT, n= 4279) were genotyped using the Illumina Infinium Multi-Ethnic Beadchip. Haplotype groups were called using HaploGrep. We used a linear regression analysis to examine the association between mitochondrial haplogroups (L, M, and N) and changes in blood pressure and fasting glucose over six months and two years, respectively. Results: The analysis revealed a null association between mitochondrial haplogroups M and N versus L for each of the outcomes. In subgroup analysis, the L subclades L1, L2, and L3/L4 (versus L0) were each inversely associated with fasting glucose response (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This discovery analysis suggests the mitochondrial genome has a small effect on fasting glucose response, but not that of blood pressure, to thiazide diuretic treatment in African Americans.

                Background: Food safety and hygiene has emerged as the foremost cause of concern in recent time, especially post-pandemic and has changed the eating out behaviour of the consumers. Consumers often consider food safety and hygiene as one of the most prominent factors and hence it is important for food handlers to have adequate knowledge and the right attitude towards food safety and food hygiene. The review will summarise the evidence on food handlers’ behaviours towards food safety and hygiene and associated factors that inhibit positive behaviour towards following food safety protocols and standards. Methods:  This scoping review protocol is guided by updated methodology from Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). The search will be conducted on Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Web of Science. Google Scholar will be used to locate pertinent grey literature. A citation search will also be employed for identifying additional relevant studies. Quantitative and qualitative studies published from 2011- present will be included. Two reviewers will independently screen and extract the data. A third reviewer will be involved in resolving disagreements between reviewers. A two-stage screening including title/abstract and full-text will be conducted. Data extraction will be done using a pilot-tested data extraction form. The data extracted from included studies will be organised and presented using narrative synthesis. The review will also attempt to identify the unaddressed gaps in the literature with the available evidence. Ethics and dissemination: An ethical clearance is not required for this scoping review as findings from existing published literature will be summarised. The review findings will be disseminated through conference presentations and journal publications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Edge computing for Vehicle to Everything: a short review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communications and services have sparked considerable interest as a potential component of future Intelligent Transportation Systems. V2X serves to organise communication and interaction between vehicle to vehicle (V2V), vehicle to infrastructure (V2I), vehicle to pedestrians (V2P), and vehicle to networks (V2N). However, having multiple communication channels can generate a vast amount of data for processing and distribution. In addition, V2X services may be subject to performance requirements relating to dynamic handover and low latency communication channels. Good throughput, lower delay, and reliable packet delivery are the core requirements for V2X services.  Edge Computing (EC) may be a feasible option to address the challenge of dynamic handover and low latency to allow V2X information to be transmitted across vehicles. Currently, existing comparative studies do not cover the applicability of EC for V2X. This review explores EC approaches to determine the relevance for V2X communication and services. EC allows devices to carry out part or all of the data processing at the point where data is collected. The emphasis of this review is on several methods identified in the literature for implementing effective EC. We describe each method individually and compare them according to their applicability. The findings of this work indicate that most methods can simulate the EC positioning under predefined scenarios. These include the use of Mobile Edge Computing, Cloudlet, and Fog Computing. However, since most studies are carried out using simulation tools, there is a potential limitation in that crucial data in the search for EC positioning may be overlooked and ignored for bandwidth reduction. The EC approaches considered in this work are limited to the literature on the successful implementation of V2X communication and services. The outcome of this work could considerably help other researchers better characterise EC applicability for V2X communications and services.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multi-scale model suggests the trade-off between protein and ATP demand as a driver of metabolic changes during yeast replicative ageing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Barbara Schnitzer, Linnea Österberg, Iro Skopa, Marija Cvijovic</p>

The accumulation of protein damage is one of the major drivers of replicative ageing, describing a cell’s reduced ability to reproduce over time even under optimal conditions. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are precursors of protein damage and therefore tightly linked to ageing. At the same time, they are an inevitable by-product of the cell’s metabolism. Cells are able to sense high levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and can subsequently adapt their metabolism through gene regulation to slow down damage accumulation. However, the older or damaged a cell is the less flexibility it has to allocate enzymes across the metabolic network, forcing further adaptions in the metabolism. To investigate changes in the metabolism during replicative ageing, we developed an multi-scale mathematical model using budding yeast as a model organism. The model consists of three interconnected modules: a Boolean model of the signalling network, an enzyme-constrained flux balance model of the central carbon metabolism and a dynamic model of growth and protein damage accumulation with discrete cell divisions. The model can explain known features of replicative ageing, like average lifespan and increase in generation time during successive division, in yeast wildtype cells by a decreasing pool of functional enzymes and an increasing energy demand for maintenance. We further used the model to identify three consecutive metabolic phases, that a cell can undergo during its life, and their influence on the replicative potential, and proposed an intervention span for lifespan control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inverse folding based pre-training for the reliable identification of intrinsic transcription terminators</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vivian B. Brandenburg, Franz Narberhaus, Axel Mosig</p>

It is well-established that neural networks can predict or identify structural motifs of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Yet, the neural network based identification of RNA structural motifs is limited by the availability of training data that are often insufficient for learning features of specific ncRNA families or structural motifs. Aiming to reliably identify intrinsic transcription terminators in bacteria, we introduce a novel pre-training approach that uses inverse folding to generate training data for predicting or identifying a specific family or structural motif of ncRNA. We assess the ability of neural networks to identify secondary structure by systematic <i>in silico</i> mutagenesis experiments. In a study to identify intrinsic transcription terminators as functionally well-understood RNA structural motifs, our inverse folding based pre-training approach significantly boosts the performance of neural network topologies, which outperform previous approaches to identify intrinsic transcription terminators. Inverse-folding based pre-training provides a simple, yet highly effective way to integrate the well-established thermodynamic energy model into deep neural networks for identifying ncRNA families or motifs. The pre-training technique is broadly applicable to a range of network topologies as well as different types of ncRNA families and motifs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Trial-by-trial predictions of subjective time from human brain activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maxine T. Sherman, Zafeirios Fountas, Anil K. Seth, Warrick Roseboom</p>

Human experience of time exhibits systematic, context-dependent deviations from clock time; for example, time is experienced differently at work than on holiday. Here we test the proposal that differences from clock time in subjective experience of time arise because time estimates are constructed by accumulating the same quantity that guides perception: salient events. Healthy human participants watched naturalistic, silent videos of up to 24 seconds in duration and estimated their duration while fMRI was acquired. We were able to reconstruct trial-by-trial biases in participants’ duration reports, which reflect subjective experience of duration, purely from salient events in their visual cortex BOLD activity. By contrast, salient events in neither of two control regions–auditory and somatosensory cortex–were predictive of duration biases. These results held despite being able to (trivially) predict clock time from all three brain areas. Our results reveal that the information arising during perceptual processing of a dynamic environment provides a sufficient basis for reconstructing human subjective time duration.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Sticky Pi is a high-frequency smart trap that enables the study of insect circadian activity under natural conditions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Quentin Geissmann, Paul K. Abram, Di Wu, Cara H. Haney, Juli Carrillo</p>

In the face of severe environmental crises that threaten insect biodiversity, new technologies are imperative to monitor both the identity and ecology of insect species. Traditionally, insect surveys rely on manual collection of traps, which provide abundance data but mask the large intra- and interday variations in insect activity, an important facet of their ecology. Although laboratory studies have shown that circadian processes are central to insects’ biological functions, from feeding to reproduction, we lack the high-frequency monitoring tools to study insect circadian biology in the field. To address these issues, we developed the Sticky Pi, a novel, autonomous, open-source, insect trap that acquires images of sticky cards every 20 minutes. Using custom deep learning algorithms, we automatically and accurately scored where, when, and which insects were captured. First, we validated our device in controlled laboratory conditions with a classic chronobiological model organism, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Then, we deployed an array of Sticky Pis to the field to characterise the daily activity of an agricultural pest, <i>Drosophila suzukii</i>, and its parasitoid wasps. Finally, we demonstrate the wide scope of our smart trap by describing the sympatric arrangement of insect temporal niches in a community, without targeting particular taxa a priori. Together, the automatic identification and high sampling rate of our tool provide biologists with unique data that impacts research far beyond chronobiology, with applications to biodiversity monitoring and pest control as well as fundamental implications for phenology, behavioural ecology, and ecophysiology. We released the Sticky Pi project as an open community resource on https://doc.sticky-pi.com.

Early career researchers (ECRs) are important stakeholders leading efforts to catalyze systemic change in research culture and practice. Here, we summarize the outputs from a virtual unconventional conference (unconference), which brought together 54 invited experts from 20 countries with extensive experience in ECR initiatives designed to improve the culture and practice of science. Together, we drafted 2 sets of recommendations for (1) ECRs directly involved in initiatives or activities to change research culture and practice; and (2) stakeholders who wish to support ECRs in these efforts. Importantly, these points apply to ECRs working to promote change on a systemic level, not only those improving aspects of their own work. In both sets of recommendations, we underline the importance of incentivizing and providing time and resources for systems-level science improvement activities, including ECRs in organizational decision-making processes, and working to dismantle structural barriers to participation for marginalized groups. We further highlight obstacles that ECRs face when working to promote reform, as well as proposed solutions and examples of current best practices. The abstract and recommendations for stakeholders are available in Dutch, German, Greek (abstract only), Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Serbian.

                Background: Malaria is a parasitic borne disease that affects red blood cells. The disease is preventable, detectable and treatable and more common in poor resource settings. Malaria is undoubtedly one of the main public health concerns impacting families and the economy in Mozambique. Age category plays a significant important role in malaria occurrence and can affect the course and progression of the disease and correct treatment. Very few studies on pediatric malaria exists in Mozambique and the existing ones use a simplistic and coarse grouping. The knowledge of malaria pediatric incidence and, the need to evaluate the local heterogeneity by generating malaria risk maps can improve the understanding of pediatric malaria being the objective of this study.  Methods: A retrospective study was conducted using existing malaria positive data from 2018 to 2019 at Rural Sussundenga Hospital (RSH) in Sussundenga municipality. Attributable factors of the disease and incidence were calculated. Proportion of gender, age category and location were tested using G test. For malaria risk mapping, ten malaria factors (anthropic, sociodemographic, climatic and clinic) were used to produce two maps: one using malaria incidence and other without. Bioclimatic, Diva GIS 7.4.0 and, Landsat 8 image were used to produce the map.  Results: The findings revealed that of the 42,248 patients who visited the local hospital f, 51.2% tested positive for malaria with an incidence of 45.7 per 100 persons. There is a difference between residential areas in malaria incidence, with both maps showing malaria risk in Nhamazara, Nhamarenza and Unidade communities.   Conclusions: This implies that malaria high risk areas seem to be located in high populated areas and areas close to water bodies. Relevant information is provided for effective planning in malaria intervention.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Decreased Frontal Gamma Activity in Alzheimer Disease Patients</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In Alzheimer disease (AD) animal models, synaptic dysfunction has recently been linked to a disorder of high-frequency neuronal activity. In patients, a clear relation between AD and oscillatory activity remains elusive. Here, we attempt to shed light on this relation by using a novel approach combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) to probe oscillatory activity in specific hubs of the frontoparietal network in a sample of 60 mild-to-moderate AD patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Sixty mild-to-moderate AD patients and 21 age-matched healthy volunteers (HVs) underwent 3 TMS-EEG sessions to assess cortical oscillations over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the left posterior parietal cortex. To investigate the relations between oscillatory activity, cortical plasticity, and cognitive decline, AD patients underwent a TMS-based neurophysiological characterization and a cognitive evaluation at baseline. The latter was repeated after 24 weeks to monitor clinical evolution.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AD patients showed a significant reduction of frontal gamma activity as compared to age-matched HVs. In addition, AD patients with a more prominent decrease of frontal gamma activity showed a stronger impairment of long-term potentiation–like plasticity and a more pronounced cognitive decline at subsequent follow-up evaluation at 24 weeks.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data provide novel evidence that frontal lobe gamma activity is dampened in AD patients. The current results point to the TMS-EEG approach as a promising technique to measure individual frontal gamma activity in patients with AD. This index could represent a useful biomarker to predict disease progression and to evaluate response to novel pharmacological therapies. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

<p>The activity of spinal glymphatic system of rats with painful diabetic neuropathy was inhibited, and our results indicated that the increased number of GFAP positive astrocytes and aquaporin-4 polarity reversal may worked as its mechanism.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The glymphatic system is a recently discovered glial-dependent macroscopic interstitial waste clearance system that promotes the efficient elimination of soluble proteins and metabolites from the central nervous system. Its anatomic foundation is the astrocytes and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels on the endfeet of astrocytes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the plasticity of the spinal glymphatic system in male SD rats with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) induced by type 2 diabetes mellitus. PDN rats were modeled under a high-fat and high-glucose diet with a low dose of streptozotocin. MRI was applied to observe the infiltration and clearance of contrast to indicate the functional variability of the glymphatic system at the spinal cord level. The paw withdrawal threshold was used to represent mechanical allodynia. The numerical change of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive astrocytes was assessed and the polarity reversal of AQP4 protein was measured by immunofluorescence. As a result, deceased contrast infiltration and clearance, enhanced mechanical allodynia, increased number of GFAP positive astrocytes, and reversed polarity of AQP4 protein were found in the PDN rats. The above molecular level changes may contribute to the impairment of the spinal glymphatic system in PDN rats. This study revealed the molecular and functional variations of the spinal glymphatic system in PDN rats and for the first time indicated that there might be a correlation between the impaired spinal glymphatic system and PDN rats.</p>

                Background: Malnutrition is a common feature among oncology patients. It is responsible for poor response and tolerance to anticancer therapy, increased morbidity, and mortality. More than half of malnourished cancer patients remain undetected owing to lack of effective screening. Body mass index is the main indicator for assessing malnutrition in Kenyan public hospitals. However, it underestimates weight loss in patients with chronic illnesses. The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool and Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment have been widely used in research and clinical practice and have both reported good validity and reliability. However, their diagnostic evaluation has not been performed in Kenya. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 138 and 76 cancer outpatients from Kenyatta National Hospital and Texas cancer treatment centres, respectively. Participants had a confirmed disease, stage 1-4 cancer, and aged 18 years and above. They were screened for malnutrition using both Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool and Patient Generated-Subjective Global Assessment. A separate study questionnaire was utilized to gather participant’s socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. A Bayesian latent class modelling framework was employed to infer the tests’ estimates based on participants ‘cumulative scores from the two tests. Results: The cut-off value of ≥ 1 and ≥ 4 gave the best combination of sensitivity and specificity of Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool and Patient Generated-Subjective Global Assessment. Both tests yielded statistically similar sensitivities and specificities. Predictive values were comparable between the tests and across the two populations. The posterior median true prevalences of malnutrition were high (˃ 54%) and numerically similar between the studied populations. Conclusions: The performance of both tests among patients with cancer is similar. Healthcare workers are therefore at liberty to use either of them to inform treatment. Given the high true prevalence of cancer-related malnutrition, routine screening is critical and should be included as part of cancer care.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Intravenous Thrombolysis with Tenecteplase for the Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with tenecteplase has been associated with better clinical outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with confirmed large vessel occlusions compared to IVT with alteplase. However, the utility of tenecteplase for the treatment of all AIS patients eligible for IVT has not been established.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compared the safety and efficacy of tenecteplase versus alteplase in AIS patients by analyzing propensity score matched data from 20 centers participating in the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke–International Stroke Thrombolysis Register. Patients receiving IVT with tenecteplase were matched with up to 3 patients receiving alteplase from the same center. The primary outcome of interest was the distribution of 3-month functional outcomes. Secondary outcomes included the rates of patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) in the first 24 hours, excellent (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score = 0–1) or good (mRS score = 0–2) functional outcome, and all-cause mortality at 3 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 331 tenecteplase-treated AIS patients were matched to 797 patients treated with alteplase (median age = 70 years, 43.9% women, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score = 11, interquartile range = 6–17). Patients treated with tenecteplase had better 3-month functional outcomes (common odds ratio [OR] = 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18–2.00) with higher odds of good functional outcome (OR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.45–2.77) and a lower likelihood of all-cause mortality (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.27–0.67) at 3 months, compared to alteplase-treated patients. No difference was found in the likelihood of the 3-month excellent functional outcomes (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 0.96–1.78) and 24-hour SICH (1.0% vs 1.3%, OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.20–2.64).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>IVT with tenecteplase was associated with better 3-month clinical outcomes compared to IVT with alteplase in AIS patients, with no increased risk of symptomatic intracranial bleeding. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>
