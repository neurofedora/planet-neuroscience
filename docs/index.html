              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modular cell type organization of cortical areas revealed by in situ sequencing</a></h4>

              
                The cortex is composed of neuronal types with diverse gene expression that are organized into specialized cortical areas. These areas, each with characteristic cytoarchitecture, connectivity, and neuronal activity, are wired into modular networks. However, it remains unclear whether cortical areas and their modular organization can be similarly defined by their transcriptomic signatures. Here we used BARseq, a high-throughput in situ sequencing technique, to interrogate the expression of 107 cell type marker genes in 1.2 million cells over a mouse forebrain hemisphere at cellular resolution. De novo clustering of gene expression in single neurons revealed transcriptomic types that were consistent with previous single-cell RNAseq studies. Within medium-grained cell types that are shared across all cortical areas, gene expression and the distribution of fine-grained cell types vary along the contours of cortical areas. The compositions of transcriptomic types are highly predictive of cortical area identity. We grouped cortical areas into modules so that areas within a module, but not across modules, had similar compositions of transcriptomic types. Strikingly, these modules match cortical subnetworks that are highly interconnected, suggesting that cortical areas that are similar in cell types are also wired together. This "wire-by-similarity" rule reflects a novel organizing principle for the connectivity of cortical areas. Our BARseq-based strategy is high-throughput and low-cost, and scaling up this approach to many animals can potentially reveal the brain-wide molecular architecture across individuals, developmental times, and disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptomic cytoarchitecture reveals principles of human neocortex organization</a></h4>

              
                Variation in cortical cytoarchitecture is the basis for histology-based definition of cortical areas, such as Brodmann areas. Single cell transcriptomics enables higher-resolution characterization of cell types in human cortex, which we used to revisit the idea of the canonical cortical microcircuit and to understand functional areal specialization. Deeply sampled single nucleus RNA-sequencing of eight cortical areas spanning cortical structural variation showed highly consistent cellular makeup for 24 coarse cell subclasses. However, proportions of excitatory neuron subclasses varied strikingly, reflecting differences in intra- and extracortical connectivity across primary sensorimotor and association cortices. Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes also showed differences in laminar organization across areas. Primary visual cortex showed dramatically different organization, including major differences in the ratios of excitatory to inhibitory neurons, expansion of layer 4 excitatory neuron types and specialized inhibitory neurons. Finally, gene expression variation in conserved neuron subclasses predicts differences in synaptic function across areas. Together these results provide a refined cellular and molecular characterization of human cortical cytoarchitecture that reflects functional connectivity and predicts areal specialization.

                The discovery that DA transients can be mapped onto the reward prediction errors in temporal difference models is a pinnacle achievement of neuroscience. Yet, there is abundant evidence that DA activity reinforces actions, suggesting it serves as an intrinsically rewarding event. These two possibilities are so conceptually intertwined that it is not surprising that they have been so far experimentally conflated. Here, using computational modeling, behavioural blocking and optogenetics, we show that stimulating VTA DA neurons promotes learning even when a natural reward and DA stimulation are held constant across the learning phases of blocking. These findings provide strong evidence in favour of the prediction error hypothesis rather than encoding the rewarding value of appetitive events.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integrative single-cell characterization of hypothalamus sex-differential and obesity-associated genes and regulatory elements</a></h4>

              
                Over 500 noncoding genomic loci are associated with obesity. The majority of these loci reside near genes that are expressed in the hypothalamus in specific neuronal subpopulations that regulate food intake, hindering the ability to identify and functionally characterize them. Here, we carried out integrative single-cell analysis (RNA/ATAC-seq) on both mouse and human male and female hypothalamus to characterize genes and regulatory elements in specific cell subpopulations. Utilizing both transcriptome and regulome data, we identify over 30 different neuronal and non-neuronal cell subpopulations and a shared core of transcription factors that regulate cell cluster-specific genes between mice and humans. We characterize several sex-specific differentially expressed genes and the regulatory elements that control them in specific cell subpopulations. Overlapping cell-specific scATAC peaks with obesity-associated GWAS variants, identifies potential obesity-associated regulatory elements. Using reporter assays and CRISPR editing, we show that many of these sequences, including the top obesity-associated loci (FTO and MC4R), are functional enhancers whose activity is altered due to the obesity-associated variant and regulate known obesity genes. Combined, our work provides a catalog of genes and regulatory elements in hypothalamus cell subpopulations and uses obesity to showcase how integrative single-cell sequencing can identify functional variants associated with hypothalamus-related phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel antidepressant acting via allosteric inhibition of GluN2D-incorporated NMDA receptors at GABAergic interneurons</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated calcium-permeable excitatory channels. They have attracted great interest as potential targets for the treatment of depression in recent years. NMDARs typically assemble as heterotetramers composed of two GluN1 and two alternative GluN2 (2A-2D) subunits, the latter of which endow various subtypes with diverse gating and pharmacological properties. To date, limited molecules with GluN2 specificity have been identified to show antidepressant effects. Here, we identify a compound termed YY-23 extracted from Rhizoma Anemarrhenae allosterically inhibited the channel activities of GluN2C- or GluN2D-incorporated NMDARs, an effect that was presumably influenced by the S2 segment in the ligand-binding domain of the GluN2 subunit. We found that prefrontal GluN2D-containing NMDARs were predominantly expressed at GABAergic interneurons rather than pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, we revealed that YY-23 suppressed the activity of GluN2D-containing NMDARs and GABAergic neurotransmission in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). As a consequence, this GABAergic disinhibition facilitated the excitatory transmission. Behavioural experiments showed that YY-23 acted as a rapid antidepressant in both stress-naive and stressed animal models, which was abolished in Grin2d-knockout mice. Together, our findings suggest that GluN2D-incorporated NMDARs on GABAergic interneurons might be promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of depression.

                Neural entrainment to musical rhythm is thought to underlie the perception and production of music. In aging populations, the strength of neural entrainment to rhythm has been found to be attenuated, particularly during attentive listening to auditory streams. However, previous studies on neural entrainment to rhythm and aging have often employed artificial auditory rhythms or limited pieces of recorded, naturalistic music, failing to account for the diversity of rhythmic structures found in natural music. As part of larger project assessing a novel music-based intervention for healthy aging, we investigated neural entrainment to musical rhythms in the electroencephalogram (EEG) while participants listened to self-selected musical recordings across a sample of younger and older adults. We specifically measured neural entrainment to the level of musical pulse - quantified here as the phase-locking value (PLV) - after normalizing the PLVs to detected pulse frequencies of each recording. As predicted, we observed strong neural phase-locking to musical pulse, and to the sub-harmonic and harmonic levels of musical meter. Overall, PLVs were not significantly different between older and younger adults. This preserved neural entrainment to musical pulse and rhythm could support the design of music-based interventions that aim to modulate endogenous brain activity via self-selected music for healthy cognitive aging.

                Two-photon microscopy can resolve fluorescence dynamics deep in scattering tissue, but applying this technique in vivo is limited by short working distance water-immersion objectives. Here we present an ultra long working distance (20 mm) air objective called the Cousa objective. It is optimized for performance across multiphoton imaging wavelengths, offers a >4 mm^2 FOV with submicron lateral resolution, and is compatible with commonly used multiphoton imaging systems. We share the full optical prescription, along with data on real world performance including in vivo calcium imaging in a range of species and approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cholinergic Interneurons Drive Motivation by Promoting Dopamine Release in the Nucleus Accumbens</a></h4>

              
                Motivation to work for potential rewards is critically dependent on dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). DA release from NAc axons can be controlled by at least two distinct mechanisms: 1) action potentials propagating from DA cell bodies in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and 2) activation of {beta}2* nicotinic receptors by local cholinergic interneurons (CINs). How CIN activity contributes to NAc DA dynamics in behaving animals remains unclear. We monitored DA release in the NAc Core of awake, unrestrained rats while simultaneously monitoring or manipulating CIN activity at the same location. CIN stimulation rapidly evoked DA release, and in contrast to slice preparations, this DA release showed no indication of short-term depression or receptor desensitization. The sound of food delivery evoked a brief joint increase in CIN population activity and DA release, with a second joint increase as rats approached the food. In an operant task, we observed fast ramps in CIN activity during approach behaviors, either to start the trial or to collect rewards. These CIN ramps co-occurred with DA release ramps, without corresponding changes in the firing of VTA DA neurons. Finally, we examined the effects of blocking CIN influence over DA release through local NAc infusion of DH{beta}E, a selective antagonist of {beta}2* nicotinic receptors. DH{beta}E dose-dependently interfered with motivated approach decisions, mimicking the effects of a DA antagonist. Our results support a key influence of CINs over motivated behavior via the local regulation of DA release.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of the cerebellum in learning to predict reward: evidence from cerebellar ataxia</a></h4>

              
                Recent findings in animals have challenged the traditional view of the cerebellum solely as the site of motor control, suggesting that the cerebellum may also be important for learning to predict reward from trial-and-error feedback. Yet, evidence for the role of the cerebellum in reward learning in humans is lacking. Moreover, open questions remain about which specific aspects of reward learning the cerebellum may contribute to. Here we address this gap through an investigation of multiple forms of reward learning in individuals with cerebellum dysfunction, represented by cerebellar ataxia cases. Nineteen participants with cerebellar ataxia and 57 age- and sex-matched healthy controls completed two separate tasks that required learning about reward contingencies from trial-and-error. To probe the selectivity of reward learning processes, the tasks differed in their underlying structure: while one task measured incremental reward learning ability alone, the other allowed participants to use an alternative learning strategy based on episodic memory alongside incremental reward learning. We found that individuals with cerebellar ataxia were profoundly impaired at reward learning from trial-and-error feedback on both tasks, but retained the ability to learn to predict reward based on episodic memory. These findings provide evidence from humans for a specific and necessary role for the cerebellum in incremental learning of reward associations based on reinforcement. More broadly, the findings suggest that alongside its role in motor learning, the cerebellum likely operates in concert with the basal ganglia to support reinforcement learning from reward.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral detectability of optogenetic stimulation of inferior temporal cortex varies with the size of concurrently viewed objects.</a></h4>

              
                We have previously demonstrated that macaque monkeys can behaviorally detect a subtle optogenetic impulse delivered to their inferior temporal (IT) cortex. We have also shown that the ability to detect the cortical stimulation impulse varies depending on some characteristics of the visual images viewed at the time of brain stimulation, revealing the visual nature of the perceptual events induced by stimulation of the IT cortex. Here we systematically studied the effect of the size of viewed objects on behavioral detectability of optogenetic stimulation of the central IT cortex. Surprisingly, we found that behavioral detection of the same optogenetic impulse highly varies with the size of the viewed object images. Reduction of the object size in four steps from 8 to 1 degree of visual angle significantly decreased detection performance. These results show that identical stimulation impulses delivered to the same neural population induce variable perceptual events depending on the mere size of the objects viewed at the time of brain stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Express visuomotor responses reflect knowledge of both target location and conscious intent during reaches of different amplitudes</a></h4>

              
                When humans reach to visual targets, extremely rapid (~90 ms) bursts of activity can be observed on task-relevant proximal muscles. Such express visuomotor responses are inflexibly locked in time and space to the target and have been proposed to reflect rapid visuomotor transformations conveyed subcortically via the tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway. Previously, we showed that express visuomotor responses are sensitive to explicit cue-driven information about the target, suggesting that the express pathway can be modulated by cortical signals affording contextual pre-stimulus expectations. Here, we show that the express visuomotor system incorporates information about the veridical target-directed reaching metrics and contextual instructions during visuospatial tasks requiring different movement amplitudes. In one experiment, we recorded the activity from two shoulder muscles as participants reached toward targets that appeared at different distances. Longer hand-to-target distances led to larger and more prevalent express visuomotor responses than short-reach targets. This suggests that both the direction and distance of veridical hand-to-target reaches are encoded along the putative subcortical express pathway. In a second experiment, we modulated the movement amplitude by asking the participants to deliberately undershoot, overshoot, or stop (control) at the target. The overshoot and undershoot tasks impaired the generation of large and frequent express visuomotor responses, consistent with the inability of the express pathway to generate responses directed toward non-veridical targets (e.g. anti-reach tasks). Our findings appear to reflect strategic, cortically-driven modulation of the express visuomotor circuit to facilitate rapid and effective response initiation during target-directed actions.

	<p>The application of voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) analysis to study the central mechanism of migraine has been limited. Furthermore, little is known about inter-hemispheric functional connectivity (FC) alterations during resting state in female patients with migraine. This study aimed to investigate potential interictal VMHC impairments in migraine without aura (MwoA) patients and the relationship between connectivity alterations and clinical parameters. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data and clinical information were acquired from 43 female MwoA patients and 43 matched healthy controls. VMHC analysis was used to compare differences between these two groups, and brain regions showing significant differences were chosen as a mask to perform a seed-based FC group comparison. Subsequent correlation analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between abnormal inter-hemispheric FC and clinical data. Compared with healthy controls, female MwoA patients revealed significantly decreased VMHC in the bilateral cerebellum; cuneus; and lingual, middle occipital, precentral and postcentral gyri. Seed-based FC analysis indicated disrupted intrinsic connectivity in the cerebellum, and default mode, visual and sensorimotor network. These VMHC and FC abnormalities were negatively correlated with clinical indexes including duration of disease, migraine days and visual analogue scale. These inter-hemispheric FC impairments and correlations between abnormal VMHC and FC and clinical scores may improve our understanding of the central mechanism of female-specific migraine.</p>

	<p>This research focused on the development of an astrocyte cell model system (C6 glioma) for the assessment of molecular changes in response to cathodic passively balanced pulsed electrical stimulation at a rate of 50 Hz (60 &amp;amp;micro;s duration, 0.15 mA intensity). Cells treated with selected neurotransmitters (glutamate, adenosine, D-serine, and &amp;amp;gamma;-aminobutyric acid) were monitored (using specific fluorescent probes) for changes in levels of intracellular nitric oxide, calcium ions, and/or chloride. ES exerted an inhibitory effect on NO, increased calcium and had no effect on chloride. Using this model, cells can be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively for changes and these changes can be correlated with the putative molecular effects that electrical stimulation has on astrocytes and their role in glia-mediated diseases. This model system allows for faster and cheaper experiments than those involving animal models due to the potential to easily vary the conditions, reduce the number of variables (especially problematic in animal models), and closely monitor the cellular effects.</p>

	<p>Acoustic stimulation during sleep is believed to enhance slow waves, which are critical to memory consolidation. However, clinical trials of acoustic stimulation have yielded mixed results concerning its effectiveness in improving human memory. A few studies have implied that acoustic stimulation ameliorates the pathology of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) in mice with normal sleep. Here, we explored the effect of acoustic stimulation on 3xTgAD mice suffering from chronic sleep deprivation, as these data may shed light on the potential use of acoustic stimulation in AD patients with insomnia. Methods: Twenty-four 8-month-old 3xTgAD mice were randomly and equally divided into three groups: the normal sleep group (S group), the sleep deprivation group (SD group), and the acoustic stimulation group (AS group). During a 14-day sleep intervention, the SD and AS groups received 6 h of sleep deprivation per day, and the AS group also received acoustic stimulation in the dark phase. Then, the mice underwent Morris water maze (MWM) tests and arterial spin labelling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and were sacrificed for pathological evaluation. Results: The three groups showed similar stress levels. The S and AS groups exhibited better spatial memory, better brain perfusion, and milder amyloid &amp;amp;beta; (A&amp;amp;beta;) and tau pathology than the SD group, although no significant discrepancies were found between the S and AS groups. Conclusion: Acoustic stimulation may exert a protective effect in 3xTgAD mice by improving spatial memory, enhancing the blood supply of the brain, and reversing the contribution of chronic sleep deprivation to A&amp;amp;beta; and tau pathology to mimic the effect of normal sleep patterns.</p>

	<p>In this study, we observed the sex differences in functional brain activity in patients with recurrent depressive disorder (RDE) and assessed the correlation between abnormal functional brain activity changes and clinical symptoms. A total of 40 patients with RDE (19 male and 21 female) and 42 healthy controls (HCs) (20 male and 22 female) met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of images using regional homogeneity (ReHo) and further analysis of the correlation between abnormal brain areas and clinical symptoms of the different sexes with RDE groups were carried out. For the main effects of sex (male vs. female), there were statistically significant differences in ReHo among the four groups in the right middle temporal gyrus, right thalamus, and left posterior cerebellar lobe. For the effects of the sex-by-group interaction, there were statistically significant differences in ReHo among the four groups in the left middle frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, and right insula. Post hoc analyses showed that compared with the female RDE group, the male RDE group had decreased ReHo in the left middle frontal gyrus and right insula. In the female RDE group, the ReHo values of the left middle frontal gyrus were positively correlated with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) scores. This study provides new insights into the clinical targeting of different sexes for RDE.</p>

	<p>Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a central nervous system disease with high mortality and morbidity. Some independent factors valuable for prognosis prediction in patients with SAH are still lacking. In our earlier study, we found that PDK4 exerts a protective effect after SAH, primarily by reducing oxidative stress and neuronal death via the ROS/ASK1/p38 signaling pathway. Therefore, we investigated the changes in the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) in patients after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and analyzed the value of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PDK4 level in predicting the prognoses of patients with SAH after interventional embolization surgery. Some knee arthritis subjects who needed surgery were recruited as a control group. The results showed that PDK4 expression was elevated in the CSF of SAH patients compared with that of controls. PDK4 levels in CSF (OR = 4.525; 95% CI: 1.135&amp;amp;ndash;18.038; p = 0.032), time to surgery (OR = 0.795; 95% CI: 0.646&amp;amp;ndash;0.977; p = 0.029), and initial GCS scores (OR = 2.758; 95% CI: 0.177&amp;amp;ndash;43.106; p = 0.469) were independent prognostic risk factors for SAH patients after surgery. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed PDK4 levels in CSF had a higher predictive value. Thus, PDK4 in CSF could be an independent prognostic risk factor for SAH patients after surgery. PDK4 has the potential to serve as a new therapeutic target and biomarker for use in the diagnosis of SAH severity and the prediction of recovery.</p>

	<p>The growing number of depressive people and the overload in primary care services make it necessary to identify depressive states with easily accessible biomarkers such as mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Some studies have addressed this issue by collecting and analyzing EEG resting state in a search of appropriate features and classification methods. Traditionally, EEG resting state classification methods for depression were mainly based on linear or a combination of linear and non-linear features. We hypothesize that participants with ongoing depressive states differ from controls in complex patterns of brain dynamics that can be captured in EEG resting state data, using only nonlinear measures on a few electrodes, making it possible to develop cheap and wearable devices that could be even monitored through smartphones. To validate such a perspective, a resting-state EEG study was conducted with 50 participants, half with depressive state (DEP) and half controls (CTL). A data-driven approach was applied to select the most appropriate time window and electrodes for the EEG analyses, as suggested by Giacometti&amp;amp;#8288;, as well as the most efficient nonlinear features and classifiers, to distinguish between CTL and DEP participants. Nonlinear features showing temporo-spatial and spectral complexity were selected. The results confirmed that computing nonlinear features from a few selected electrodes in a 15 s time window are sufficient to classify DEP and CTL participants accurately. Finally, after training and testing internally the classifier, the trained machine was applied to EEG resting state data (CTL and DEP) from a publicly available database, validating the capacity of generalization of the classifier with data from different equipment, population, and environment obtaining an accuracy near 100%.</p>

By querying sequencing-datasets of patients with dystonia and/or Leigh(-like) syndromes, we identified three unrelated individuals with biallelic variants in <i>NUP54</i>. All variants clustered in the C-terminal protein region that interacts with NUP62. Associated phenotypes were similar to those of <i>NUP62</i>-related disease, including early-onset dystonia with dysphagia, choreoathetosis, and T2-hyperintense lesions in striatum. <i>In-silico</i> and protein-biochemical studies gave further evidence for the argument that the variants were pathogenic. We expand the spectrum of NPC component-associated dystonic conditions with localized basal-ganglia abnormalities.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tobacco smoking and overweight lead to adverse health effects, which remain an important public health problem worldwide. Researches indicate overlapping pathophysiology may contribute to tobacco use disorder (TUD) and overweight, but the neurobiological interaction mechanism between the two factors is still unclear. This study used a mixed sample design, including the following four groups: (i) overweight long-term smokers (<i>n</i> = 24, age = 31.80 ± 5.70, cigarettes/day = 20.50 ± 7.89); (ii) normal weight smokers (<i>n</i> = 28, age = 31.29 ± 5.56, cigarettes/day = 16.11 ± 8.35); (iii) overweight nonsmokers (<i>n</i> = 19, age = 33.05 ± 5.60), and (iv) normal weight nonsmokers (<i>n</i> = 28, age = 31.68 ± 6.57), a total of 99 male subjects. All subjects underwent T1-weighted high-resolution MRI. We used voxel-based morphometry to compare gray matter volume (GMV) among the four groups. Then, JuSpace toolbox was used for cross-modal correlations of MRI-based modalities with nuclear imaging derived estimates, to examine specific neurotransmitter system changes underlying the two factors. Our results illustrate a significant antagonistic interaction between TUD and weight status in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and a quadratic effect of BMI on DLPFC GMV. For main effect of TUD, long-term smokers were associated with greater GMV in bilateral OFC compared with nonsmokers irrespective of weight status, and such alteration is negatively associated with pack-year and FTND scores. Furthermore, we also found GMV changes related to TUD and overweight are associated with μ-opioid receptor system and TUD-related GMV alterations are associated with noradrenaline transporter maps. This study sheds light on novel multimodal neuromechanistic about the relationship between TUD and overweight, which possibly provides hints into future treatment for the special population of comorbid TUD and overweight.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Assessing pupil size as an index of activation of subcortical ascending arousal system nuclei during rest</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulatory nuclei that are part of the ascending arousal system (AAS) play a crucial role in regulating cortical state and optimizing task performance. Pupil diameter, under constant luminance conditions, is increasingly used as an index of activity of these AAS nuclei. Indeed, task-based functional imaging studies in humans have begun to provide evidence of stimulus-driven pupil-AAS coupling. However, whether there is such a tight pupil-AAS coupling during rest is not clear. To address this question, we examined simultaneously acquired resting-state fMRI and pupil-size data from 74 participants, focusing on six AAS nuclei: the locus coeruleus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, dorsal and median raphe nuclei, and cholinergic basal forebrain. Activation in all six AAS nuclei was optimally correlated with pupil size at 0- to 2-second lags, suggesting that spontaneous pupil changes were almost immediately followed by corresponding BOLD-signal changes in the AAS. These results suggest that spontaneous changes in pupil size that occur during states of rest can be used as a noninvasive general index of activity in AAS nuclei. Importantly, the nature of pupil-AAS coupling during rest appears to be vastly different from the relatively slow canonical hemodynamic response function that has been used to characterize task-related pupil-AAS coupling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Methadone alters transcriptional programs associated with synapse formation in human cortical organoids</a></h4>

              
                Opioid use disorder (OUD) among pregnant women has become an epidemic in the United States. Pharmacological interventions for OUD involve methadone, a synthetic opioid analgesic that attenuates withdrawal symptoms and behaviors linked with maternal drug addiction. However, methadone's ability to readily accumulate in neural tissue, and cause long-term neurocognitive sequelae, has led to concerns regarding its effect on prenatal brain development. We took advantage of human cortical organoid (hCO) technology to probe how this drug impacts the earliest mechanisms giving rise to the cerebral cortex. To this end, we conducted bulk mRNA sequencing of 2-month-old hCOs derived from two cell lines that were chronically treated with a clinically relevant dose of 1M methadone for 50 days. Differential expression and gene ontology analyses revealed a robust transcriptional response to methadone associated with functional components of the synapse, the underlying extracellular matrix (ECM), and cilia. Further unsupervised co-expression network and predictive protein-protein interaction analyses demonstrated that these changes occurred in concert, centered around a regulatory axis consisting of growth factors, developmental signaling pathways, and matricellular proteins. Our results demonstrate that exposure to methadone during early cortico-genesis fundamentally alters transcriptional programs associated with synapse formation, and that these changes arise by modulating extra-synaptic molecular mechanisms in the ECM and cilia. These findings provide novel insight into methadone's putative effect on cognitive and behavioral development and a basis for improving interventions for maternal opioid addiction.

                Musical training can offset age-related decline in speech-in-noise perception. However, how lifelong musical expertise affects the functional reorganization of older brain in speech-in-noise perception has not yet been systematically investigated. Here, we address this issue by analyzing fMRI responses of older musicians, older non-musicians and, young non-musicians identifying noise-masked audiovisual syllables. First, we confirmed that older musicians outperformed older non-musicians and even equaled young non-musicians. Then, we showed that both older groups showed decreased auditory activation and increased visual activation compared to young non-musicians, while older musicians showed higher activation in speech motor regions and greater deactivation of default mode network (DMN) regions than older non-musicians. Next, we revealed that musical expertise counteracted the age-related neural dedifferentiation of speech representation, making older musicians exhibit higher neural alignment-to-young in bilateral sensorimotor areas. Finally, we disentangled that greater activation in speech motor areas and stronger deactivation in DMN regions were correlated with higher neural alignment in sensorimotor areas, which strongly predicted better performance in older adults. Together, long-term musical expertise mitigates age-related deficits in audiovisual speech-in-noise processing through enhanced compensatory scaffolding that reserves youth-like representation in sensorimotor areas. Our findings provide a comprehensive perspective on understanding age- and experience-related brain reorganization during speech perception.

                The inferior colliculus (IC) is an information processing hub that receives widespread 25 convergent projections. It contains two non-lemniscal divisions - the dorsal (DC) and lateral (LC) 26 cortices - that receive major cortical and multisensory projections. The LC in particular has 27 repeated molecular motifs that govern its input-output relationships. However, because the LC 28 is buried deep within a sulcus, it has been impossible to study by imaging, and thus difficult to 29 answer questions about its functional organization. Here, we couple two-photon microscopy with use of a microprism to reveal the first-ever sagittal views containing functional maps of the LC with cellular resolution. We used this novel approach to examine neuronal responses with respect to LC motifs, and demonstrate the LC is functionally distinct from DC. This method will not only provide new insights about the auditory system, but will also permit imaging of hidden brain regions previously un-imageable by conventional means.

                Cognition and attention arise from the adaptive coordination of neural systems in response to external and internal demands. The low-dimensional latent subspace that underlies large-scale neural dynamics and the relationships of these dynamics to cognitive and attentional states, however, are unknown. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging as human participants performed attention tasks, watched comedy sitcom episodes and an educational documentary, and rested. Whole-brain dynamics traversed a common set of latent states that spanned canonical gradients of functional brain organization, with global synchrony among functional networks modulating state transitions. Neural state dynamics were synchronized across people during engaging movie watching and aligned to narrative event structures. Neural state dynamics reflected attention fluctuations such that different states indicated engaged attention in task and naturalistic contexts whereas a common state indicated attention lapses in both contexts. Together, these results demonstrate that traversals along large-scale gradients of human brain organization reflect cognitive and attentional dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Meta-analytic evidence for a novel hierarchical model of conceptual processing</a></h4>

              
                Conceptual knowledge plays a pivotal role in human cognition. Grounded cognition theories propose that concepts consist of perceptual-motor features represented in modality-specific perceptual-motor cortices. However, it is unclear whether conceptual processing consistently engages modality-specific areas. Here, we performed an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis across 212 neuroimaging experiments on conceptual processing related to 7 perceptual-motor modalities (action, sound, visual shape, motion, color, olfaction-gustation, and emotion). We found that conceptual processing consistently engages brain regions also activated during real perceptual-motor experience of the same modalities. In addition, we identified multimodal convergence zones that are recruited for multiple modalities. In particular, the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) and posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) are engaged for three modalities: action, motion, and sound. These "trimodal" regions are surrounded by "bimodal" regions engaged for two modalities. Our findings support a novel model of the conceptual system, according to which conceptual processing relies on a hierarchical neural architecture from modality-specific to multimodal areas up to an amodal hub.

                Objective: Based on network pharmacology, the response of Qing-tong-hua-yu Decoction (QTHY) to the regulation of EGFR/MAPK signaling cascade in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was discussed and the possible mechanism of the protective effect of QTHY on the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was studied. Methods: A compound-target disease-function-pathway network was established and analyzed based on the network pharmacology approach used in Chinese medicine. The correlation, which is between effect of the components of QTHY Decoction against CI/RI with EGFR/MAPK signalling cascade response, was observed. And then the degree of neurological deficits in each group was assessed after cerebral ischemia for 2 hours and reperfusion for 3 hours, 24 hours, 3 days and 7 days. Expression levels of EGFR and p44/42MAPK in ischemic brain tissue at different time points in various groups of rats were tested by Western bolt (WB), real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: Network pharmacology analysis revealed that QTHY-mediated treatment involved 439 key targets, in which the effect of QTHY groups against CI/RI was associated with EGFR/MAPK signaling cascade. QTHY treatment reduced neurological deficit scores and improved ischemic changes in rats. In addition, QTHY promoted EGFR and p44/42MAPK expression in the SVZ through the EGFR/MAPK signaling cascade, with varying degrees of improvement at different time points. Conclusion: QTHY can better improve cerebral ischemia injury in CI / RI rats and exert the neuroprotective effect of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. This may be related to the potential of QTHY to activate the EGFR / MAPK signaling cascade, which is consistent with the results of network pharmacology analysis.

                Background: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric condition leading to significant distress and poor quality of life. Successful treatment of OCD is restricted by the limited knowledge about its pathophysiology. This study aimed to investigate the pathophysiology of OCD using electroencephalographic (EEG) event related potentials (ERP), elicited from multiple tasks to characterise disorder-related differences in underlying brain activity across multiple neural processes. Methods: ERP data were obtained from 25 OCD patients and 27 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) by recording EEG during Flanker and Go/Nogo tasks. Error-related negativity (ERN) was elicited by the Flanker task, while N200 and P300 were generated using the Go/Nogo task. Primary comparisons of the neural response amplitudes and the topographical distribution of neural activity were conducted using scalp field differences across all time points and electrodes. Results: Compared to HC, the OCD group showed altered ERP distributions. Contrasting with the previous literature on ERN and N200 topographies in OCD where fronto-central negative voltages were reported, we detected positive voltages. Additionally, the P300 was found to be less negative in the frontal regions. None of these ERP findings were associated with OCD symptom severity. Conclusions: These results indicate that individuals with OCD show altered frontal neural activity across multiple executive function related processes, supporting the frontal dysfunction theory of OCD. Furthermore, due to the lack of association between altered ERPs and OCD symptom severity, they may be considered potential candidate endophenotypes for OCD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Peptidergic modulation of motor neuron output via CART signaling at C bouton synapses</a></h4>

              
                The intensity of muscle contraction, and therefore movement vigour, needs to be adaptable to enable complex motor behaviors. This can be achieved by adjusting the properties of motor neurons, which form the final common pathway for all motor output from the central nervous system. Here we identify novel roles for a neuropeptide, Cocaine and Amphetamine Regulated Transcript (CART), in the control of movement vigour. We reveal distinct, but parallel mechanisms by which CART and acetylcholine, both released at C bouton synapses on motor neurons, selectively amplify the output of subtypes of motor neurons that are recruited during intense movement. We find that mice with broad genetic deletion of CART or selective elimination of acetylcholine from C boutons exhibit deficits in behavioral tasks that require higher levels of motor output. Overall, these data uncover novel spinal modulatory mechanisms that control movement vigour to support movements that require a high degree of muscle force.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">In vivo 18F-DOPA PET imaging identifies a dopaminergic deficit in a rat model with a G51D α-synuclein mutation</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition with several major hallmarks, including loss of substantia nigra neurons, reduction in striatal dopaminergic function, and formation of alpha-synuclein-rich Lewy bodies. Mutations in SNCA, encoding for alpha-synuclein, are a known cause of familial PD, and the G51D mutation causes a particularly aggressive form of the condition. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to introduce the G51D mutation into the endogenous rat SNCA gene. SNCAG51D/+ and SNCAG51D/G51D rats were born in Mendelian ratios and did not exhibit any severe behavourial defects. L-3,4-dihydroxy-6-18F-fluorophenylalanine (18F-DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was used to investigate this novel rat model. Wild-type (WT), SNCAG51D/+ and SNCAG51D/G51D rats were characterised over the course of ageing (5, 11, and 16 months old) using 18F-DOPA PET imaging and kinetic modelling. We measured the influx rate constant (Ki) and effective distribution volume ratio (EDVR) of 18F-DOPA in the striatum relative to the cerebellum in WT, SNCAG51D/+ and SNCAG51D/G51D rats. A significant reduction in EDVR was observed in SNCAG51D/G51D rats at 16 months of age indicative of increased dopamine turnover. Furthermore, we observed a significant asymmetry in EDVR between the left and right striatum in aged SNCAG51D/G51D rats. The increased and asymmetric dopamine turnover observed in the striatum of aged SNCAG51D/G51D rats is similar to prodromal PD, which suggests the presence of compensatory mechanisms. SNCAG51D rats represent a novel genetic model of PD, and kinetic modelling of 18F-DOPA PET data has identified a highly relevant early disease phenotype.

	<p>Dysregulation of high-frequency neuronal oscillations has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Chronic methamphetamine (METH) use can induce psychosis similar to paranoid schizophrenia. The current study in mice aimed to determine the effect of chronic METH treatment on ongoing and evoked neuronal oscillations. C57BL/6 mice were treated with METH or vehicle control for three weeks and implanted with extradural recording electrodes. Two weeks after the last METH injection, mice underwent three EEG recording sessions to measure ongoing and auditory-evoked gamma and beta oscillatory power in response to an acute challenge with METH (2 mg/kg), the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (0.3 mg/kg), or saline control. A separate group of mice pretreated with METH showed significantly greater locomotor hyperactivity to an acute METH challenge, confirming long-term sensitisation. Chronic METH did not affect ongoing or evoked gamma or beta power. Acute MK-801 challenge reduced ongoing beta power whereas acute METH challenge significantly increased ongoing gamma power. Both MK-801 and METH challenge suppressed evoked gamma power. Chronic METH treatment did not modulate these acute drug effects. There were minor effects of chronic METH and acute METH and MK-801 on selected components of event-related potential (ERP) waves. In conclusion, chronic METH treatment did not exert neuroplastic effects on the regulation of cortical gamma oscillations in a manner consistent with schizophrenia, despite causing behavioural sensitisation.</p>

	<p>Globally, stroke is a leading cause of death and disability. The classification of motor intentions using brain activity is an important task in the rehabilitation of stroke patients using brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCIs). This paper presents a new method for model training in EEG-based BCI rehabilitation by using overlapping time windows. For this aim, three different models, a convolutional neural network (CNN), graph isomorphism network (GIN), and long short-term memory (LSTM), are used for performing the classification task of motor attempt (MA). We conducted several experiments with different time window lengths, and the results showed that the deep learning approach based on overlapping time windows achieved improvements in classification accuracy, with the LSTM combined vote-counting strategy (VS) having achieved the highest average classification accuracy of 90.3% when the window size was 70. The results verified that the overlapping time window strategy is useful for increasing the efficiency of BCI rehabilitation.</p>

                Background: Anemia is a global public health problem, including Indonesia with 32% of adolescents are anemic. This study aims to process porang flour, moringa leaves, and tempe into cookies that are high in iron (Fe), folic acid, cobalamin (vitamin B12), and antioxidants as potential functional food snacks for adolescents with anemia. Methods: This study is experimental with a completely randomized trial design (CRD) with three treatments and replications. There are three comparison formulations of a combination of porang, moringa leaves, and black soybean-based tempe; respectively F1 (91:3:3:3)%, F2 (85:3:6:6)%, and F3 (77:3:10:10)%. The cookie sample was then analyzed for water content, ash, iron, folic acid, cobalt, and antioxidant activity. The differences between the samples were analyzed based on the activity of antioxidants, iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12 (cobalamin) in data obtained from triplicates using multivariate ANOVA analysis. Results: The results of the ash and water content tests of all three cookie formulations showed values in accordance with the Indonesian National Standard (SNI) for cookie products. F3 has significantly higher iron, folic acid, and cobalt levels than F1 and F2 (p<0.05). Antioxidant activity is highest in F3, but there is no statistical difference between F2 and F3 (p>0.05). Conclusions: The combination of porang's tubers, moringa leaves, and tempe made from black soybeans, especially F3, has the potential to be used as a functional cookie processed product source of iron (Fe), folic acid, cobalamin, and antioxidants for adolescent anemia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">What is the association between common medications (indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen) and spontaneous intestinal perforations in premature infants? A systematic review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) affects very low birth weight preterm neonates and accounts for 44% of gastrointestinal perforations. Commonly used medications such as indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen for PDA closure, increases the risk of intestinal perforation. Unfortunately, the majority of the data combine SIP with those affected by necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) despite them being separate entities. This systematic review aims to explore the association between the use of common medications and SIP in the premature infant cohort independently from NEC. Methods: Our study will focus on preterm infants with exposure to either indomethacin, ibuprofen or acetaminophen where SIP is a reported outcome. A health science librarian will search Medline and Medline in Process via OVID, Embase Classic + Embase via OVID, the LILACS database, the ScIELO database and the Cochrane Library including EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Search dates for each database will be from their respective dates of inception to March 2022. All articles will undergo screening by two independent reviewers, and if selected, data extraction with risk of bias assessment by two independent reviewers. A third reviewer will settle any disagreements that may occur. Incidence of SIP will be measured as a proportion. Individual proportions will be pooled using a random effects logistic regression model. The comparative incidence of SIP by treatment group will be measured using the odds ratio. Odds ratios will be pooled using the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model for meta-analysis. PROSPERO Registration: CRD42017058603

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Burden of disease in Colombian Orinoquia, 2017 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Population health diagnoses are a fundamental tool to guide health policies and programs, and consequently, public health requirements. In this perspective, the burden of disease in inhabitants of Colombian Orinoquia is quantified for the first time. Methods: A descriptive population-based study that was based on secondary sources was carried out, which aimed at measuring the burden of the disease in the Colombian region of Orinoquia, using the simplified synthetic indicator of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of the global health estimation methodology. We used mortality records from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) and service provision records from the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Colombia, both records from the year 2017, available on the Integrated Social Protection Information System. Results: 288,740.2 DALYs occurred (95% UI 210,714.6-382,948.8), with higher reports for men (59%); group of non-communicable diseases accounted for 62.3% of DALY (179,993.6, 95% UI, 115,030.2-268,405.0), followed by external cause injuries group which contributed 24.6% (71,000.0, 95% UI, 25,638.1-134,013.1), and group of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders which contributed 13.1% (37,746.0, 95% UI, 28,048.0-50,239.7). Interpersonal violence was the primary cause specific of DALYs with 9.8% of the burden, (28,290.0, 95% UI, 7,365.1-64,208.1). Conclusions: Most DALYs in Orinoquia are produced by non-communicable diseases (NCD), largely caused by neoplasms and cardiovascular disease, which increased with age. However, when considered by specific cause of illness or injury, interpersonal violence is indicated as the main cause of DALYs, affecting mainly young men, possibly as an expression of social inequality, substance use, criminality, and insecurity. It is important to highlight that this region has been recognized as an area of armed conflict, drug trafficking, and poverty.

                Agronomic traits of plants especially those of economic or aesthetic importance are threatened by climatic and environmental factors such as climate change, biotic, and abiotic stresses. These threats are now being mitigated through the analyses of omics data like genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics. The emergence of high-throughput omics technology has led to an avalanche of plant omics data. Plant research demands novel analytical paradigms to extract and harness large plant omics data for plant improvement effectively and efficiently. Machine learning algorithms are well-suited analytical and computational approaches for the integrative analysis of large unstructured, heterogeneous datasets. This study presents an overview of omics approaches to improve plant agronomic traits and crucial curated plant genomic data sources. Furthermore, we summarize machine learning algorithms and software tools/programming packages used in plant omics research. Lastly, we discuss advancements in machine learning algorithms' applications in improving agronomic traits of economically important plants. Extensive application of machine learning would advance plant omics studies. These advancements would consequently help agricultural scientists improve economically important plants’ quality, yield, and tolerance against abiotic and biotic stresses and other plant health-threatening issues.

                Introduction Hand injuries are a recognized occupational hazard from the use of chaff cutters. With increasing mechanization of farming in our region, the burden of hand injuries is poised to increase. Methods We conducted a descriptive study of 47 patients presenting with chaff cutter hand injuries at our center in one year. Results They were predominantly male (98%) and the majority (70%) were aged between 21 and 40 years. The majority of patients who had not resumed work were those with severe injuries and those who had had an amputation. There was a positive correlation between age category and severity of injury. Discussion Chaff cutter injuries contribute considerably to hand amputations at our center. The majority of patients with severe injuries and those undergoing amputations do not return to gainful activities one year after sustaining the injury, suggesting increased dependency. Further research is paramount to identify safety features of chaff cutters in this region.

                Background: A growing population of cells accumulates mutations. A single mutation early in the growth process carries forward to all descendant cells, causing the final population to have a lot of mutant cells. When the first mutation happens later in growth, the final population typically has fewer mutants. The number of mutant cells in the final population follows the Luria-Delbrück distribution. The mathematical form of the distribution is known only from its probability generating function. For larger populations of cells, one typically uses computer simulations to estimate the distribution. Methods: This article searches for a simple approximation of the Luria-Delbrück distribution, with an explicit mathematical form that can be used easily in calculations. Results: The Fréchet distribution provides a good approximation for the Luria-Delbrück distribution for neutral mutations, which do not cause a growth rate change relative to the original cells. Conclusions: The Fréchet distribution apparently provides a good match through its description of extreme value problems for multiplicative processes such as exponential growth.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Role of RAS signaling in ovarian cancer [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The RAS family of proteins is among the most frequently mutated genes in human malignancies. In ovarian cancer (OC), the most lethal gynecological malignancy, RAS, especially KRAS mutational status at codons 12, 13, and 61, ranges from 6–65% spanning different histo-types. Normally RAS regulates several signaling pathways involved in a myriad of cellular signaling cascades mediating numerous cellular processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, invasion, and death. Aberrant activation of RAS leads to uncontrolled induction of several downstream signaling pathways such as RAF-1/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), PI3K phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT, RalGEFs, Rac/Rho, BRAF (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B), MEK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1), ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), PKB (protein kinase B) and PKC (protein kinase C) involved in cell proliferation as well as maintenance pathways thereby driving tumorigenesis and cancer cell propagation. KRAS mutation is also known to be a biomarker for poor outcome and chemoresistance in OC. As a malignancy with several histotypes showing varying histopathological characteristics, we focus on reviewing recent literature showcasing the involvement of oncogenic RAS in mediating carcinogenesis and chemoresistance in OC and its subtypes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Integration of single-cell RNA-Seq and CyTOF data characterises heterogeneity of rare cell subpopulations [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The simultaneous measurement of cellular proteins and transcriptomes of single cell data has become an exciting new possibility with the advent of highly multiplexed multi-omics methodologies. However, mass cytometry (CyTOF) is a well-established, affordable technique for the analysis of proteomic data, which is well suited for the discovery and characterisation of very rare subpopulations of cells with a wealth of publicly available datasets. Methods: We present and evaluate the multimodal integration of single cell RNA-Seq and CyTOF datasets coming from both matched and unmatched samples, using two publicly available datasets. Results: We demonstrate that the integration of well annotated CyTOF data with single cell RNA sequencing can aid in the identification and annotation of cell populations with high accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the integration can provide imputed measurements of protein markers which are comparable to the current gold standard of antibody derived tags (ADT) from CITE-Seq for both matched and unmatched datasets. Using this methodology, we identify and transcriptionally characterise a rare subpopulation of CD11c positive B cells in high resolution using publicly available data and we unravel its heterogeneity in a single cell setting without the need to sort the cells in advance, in a manner which had not been previously possible. Conclusions: This approach provides the framework for using available proteomic and transcriptomic datasets in a unified and unbiased fashion to assist ongoing and future studies of cellular characterisation and biomarker identification.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Job Search during COVID-19: How Online Mindfulness Intervention helped to Reduce Stress and Enhance the Self-esteem of the Job Seeker [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Immediately after graduation from university, college students need to make significant decisions about starting their careers or pursuing higher studies. They are also pressured to meet the expectations and demands of self, others, and the environment. Owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the aforementioned challenging decisions may become hazardous stressors for college students. Hence, the researchers intended to assist and assess the college students involved in student placements. The research goal was to investigate the impact of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on the stress and self-esteem of college students involved in student placements.  Methods: One hundred college students participating in the campus placements were selected using purposive sampling from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University in Coimbatore, India. For evaluation purposes, college students were administered the perceived stress, Rosenberg self-esteem, and Kuppuswamy socio-economic scales. Seventy-five college students were selected for the MBI process and were administered with a pre-intervention and post-intervention without a control group research design. Results: Statistical analysis including analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Bonferroni post hoc test showed a significant increase in self-esteem and a decrease in the stress of the college students involved in placements. Conclusions: Thus, the researchers recommend that policymakers create awareness, include MBI in the curriculum, and allocate funds for training ventures in educational institutions to assist college students in their challenging life journeys

                Intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring abnormalities had been reported to correlate with decreased umbilical artery base excess associated with neonatal seizures. However, we present an infant born at 35 weeks of gestation diagnosed with cerebral palsy associated with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) without fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring abnormalities, According to the summary reports of PVL cases published on the home page of the Japan Obstetric Compensation System for Cerebral Palsy (JOCSC)), the percentage of placenta previa without FHR monitoring abnormalities in the cases of PVL was 5.7% (12/209), which seemed to be higher than the total percentage of placenta previa reported in Japan (0.3-0.5%).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferring parameters of cancer evolution in chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nathan D. Lee, Ivana Bozic</p>

As a cancer develops, its cells accrue new mutations, resulting in a heterogeneous, complex genomic profile. We make use of this heterogeneity to derive simple, analytic estimates of parameters driving carcinogenesis and reconstruct the timeline of selective events following initiation of an individual cancer, where two longitudinal samples are available for sequencing. Using stochastic computer simulations of cancer growth, we show that we can accurately estimate mutation rate, time before and after a driver event occurred, and growth rates of both initiated cancer cells and subsequently appearing subclones. We demonstrate that in order to obtain accurate estimates of mutation rate and timing of events, observed mutation counts should be corrected to account for clonal mutations that occurred after the founding of the tumor, as well as sequencing coverage. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which often does not require treatment for years after diagnosis, presents an optimal system to study the untreated, natural evolution of cancer cell populations. When we apply our methodology to reconstruct the individual evolutionary histories of CLL patients, we find that the parental leukemic clone typically appears within the first fifteen years of life.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Neocortical Lewy body pathology parallels Parkinson's dementia, but not always</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate the relationship between Parkinson's disease (PD) with dementia and cortical proteinopathies in a large population of pathologically confirmed PD patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We reviewed clinical data from all patients with autopsy data seen in the Movement Disorders Center at Washington University, St. Louis between 1996 and 2019. All patients with a diagnosis of PD based on neuropathology were included. We used logistic regression and MANCOVA to investigate the relationship between neuropathology and dementia.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 165 PD patients met inclusion criteria. Among these, 128 had clinical dementia. Those with dementia had greater mean ages of motor onset and death but equivalent mean disease duration. The delay between motor symptom onset and dementia was one year or less in 14 individuals, meeting research diagnostic criteria for possible or probable dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Braak Lewy body stage was associated with diagnosis of dementia, whereas severities of Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) and small vessel pathology did not. Pathology of individuals diagnosed with DLB did not differ significantly from that of other PD patients with dementia. 6% of individuals with PD and dementia did not have neocortical Lewy bodies; 68% with PD but without dementia did have neocortical Lewy bodies.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Neocortical Lewy bodies almost always accompany dementia in PD; however, they also appear in most PD patients without dementia. In some cases, dementia may occur in PD patients without neocortical Lewy bodies, ADNC, or small vessel disease. Thus, other factors not directly related to these classic neuropathologic features may contribute to PD dementia.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Condensin DC loads and spreads from recruitment sites to create loop-anchored TADs in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Condensins are molecular motors that compact DNA via linear translocation. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, the X-chromosome harbors a specialized condensin that participates in dosage compensation (DC). Condensin DC is recruited to and spreads from a small number of <i>r</i>ecruitment <i>e</i>lements on the <i>X</i>-chromosome (<i>rex</i>) and is required for the formation of topologically associating domains (TADs). We take advantage of autosomes that are largely devoid of condensin DC and TADs to address how <i>rex</i> sites and condensin DC give rise to the formation of TADs. When an autosome and X-chromosome are physically fused, despite the spreading of condensin DC into the autosome, no TAD was created. Insertion of a strong <i>rex</i> on the X-chromosome results in the TAD boundary formation regardless of sequence orientation. When the same <i>rex</i> is inserted on an autosome, despite condensin DC recruitment, there was no spreading or features of a TAD. On the other hand, when a ‘<i>super rex</i>’ composed of six <i>rex</i> sites or three separate <i>rex</i> sites are inserted on an autosome, recruitment and spreading of condensin DC led to the formation of TADs. Therefore, recruitment to and spreading from <i>rex</i> sites are necessary and sufficient for recapitulating loop-anchored TADs observed on the X-chromosome. Together our data suggest a model in which <i>rex</i> sites are both loading sites and bidirectional barriers for condensin DC, a one-sided loop-extruder with movable inactive anchor.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The interpretation of computational model parameters depends on the context</a></h4>

              
                Reinforcement Learning (RL) models have revolutionized the cognitive and brain sciences, promising to explain behavior from simple conditioning to complex problem solving, to shed light on developmental and individual differences, and to anchor cognitive processes in specific brain mechanisms. However, the RL literature increasingly reveals contradictory results, which might cast doubt on these claims. We hypothesized that many contradictions arise from two commonly-held assumptions about computational model parameters that are actually often invalid: That parameters <i>generalize</i> between contexts (e.g. tasks, models) and that they capture <i>interpretable</i> (i.e. unique, distinctive) neurocognitive processes. To test this, we asked 291 participants aged 8–30 years to complete three learning tasks in one experimental session, and fitted RL models to each. We found that some parameters (exploration / decision noise) showed significant generalization: they followed similar developmental trajectories, and were reciprocally predictive between tasks. Still, generalization was significantly below the methodological ceiling. Furthermore, other parameters (learning rates, forgetting) did not show evidence of generalization, and sometimes even opposite developmental trajectories. Interpretability was low for all parameters. We conclude that the systematic study of context factors (e.g. reward stochasticity; task volatility) will be necessary to enhance the generalizability and interpretability of computational cognitive models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Optimized tight binding between the S1 segment and KCNE3 is required for the constitutively open nature of the KCNQ1-KCNE3 channel complex</a></h4>

              
                Tetrameric voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels have four identical voltage sensor domains, and they regulate channel gating. KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) is a voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel, and its auxiliary subunit KCNE proteins dramatically regulate its gating. For example, KCNE3 makes KCNQ1 a constitutively open channel at physiological voltages by affecting the voltage sensor movement. However, how KCNE proteins regulate the voltage sensor domain is largely unknown. In this study, by utilizing the KCNQ1-KCNE3-calmodulin complex structure, we thoroughly surveyed amino acid residues on KCNE3 and the S1 segment of the KCNQ1 voltage sensor facing each other. By changing the side-chain bulkiness of these interacting amino acid residues (volume scanning), we found that the distance between the S1 segment and KCNE3 is elaborately optimized to achieve the constitutive activity. In addition, we identified two pairs of KCNQ1 and KCNE3 mutants that partially restored constitutive activity by co-expression. Our work suggests that tight binding of the S1 segment and KCNE3 is crucial for controlling the voltage sensor domains.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High-resolution secretory timeline from vesicle formation at the Golgi to fusion at the plasma membrane in S. cerevisiae</a></h4>

              
                Most of the components in the yeast secretory pathway have been studied, yet a high-resolution temporal timeline of their participation is lacking. Here we define the order of acquisition, lifetime, and release of critical components involved in late secretion from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Of particular interest is the timing of the many reported effectors of the secretory vesicle Rab protein Sec4, including the myosin-V Myo2, the exocyst complex, the lgl homolog Sro7, and the small yeast-specific protein Mso1. At the trans-Golgi network (TGN) Sec4's GEF, Sec2, is recruited to Ypt31-positive compartments, quickly followed by Sec4 and Myo2 and vesicle formation. While transported to the bud tip, the entire exocyst complex, including Sec3, is assembled on to the vesicle. Before fusion, vesicles tether for 5s, during which the vesicle retains the exocyst complex and stimulates lateral recruitment of Rho3 on the plasma membrane. Sec2 and Myo2 are rapidly lost, followed by recruitment of cytosolic Sro7, and finally the SM protein Sec1, which appears for just 2 seconds prior to fusion. Perturbation experiments reveal an ordered and robust series of events during tethering that provide insights into the function of Sec4 and effector exchange.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Translational rapid ultraviolet-excited sectioning tomography for whole-organ multicolor imaging with real-time molecular staining</a></h4>

              
                Rapid multicolor three-dimensional (3D) imaging for centimeter-scale specimens with subcellular resolution remains a challenging but captivating scientific pursuit. Here, we present a fast, cost-effective, and robust multicolor whole-organ 3D imaging method assisted with ultraviolet (UV) surface excitation and vibratomy-assisted sectioning, termed translational rapid ultraviolet-excited sectioning tomography (TRUST). With an inexpensive UV light-emitting diode (UV-LED) and a color camera, TRUST achieves widefield exogenous molecular-specific fluorescence and endogenous content-rich autofluorescence imaging simultaneously while preserving low system complexity and system cost. Formalin-fixed specimens are stained layer by layer along with serial mechanical sectioning to achieve automated 3D imaging with high staining uniformity and time efficiency. 3D models of all vital organs in wild-type C57BL/6 mice with the 3D structure of their internal components (e.g., vessel network, glomeruli, and nerve tracts) can be reconstructed after imaging with TRUST to demonstrate its fast, robust, and high-content multicolor 3D imaging capability. Moreover, its potential for developmental biology has also been validated by imaging entire mouse embryos (~2 days for the embryo at the embryonic day of 15). TRUST offers a fast and cost-effective approach for high-resolution whole-organ multicolor 3D imaging while relieving researchers from the heavy sample preparation workload.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a looming public health disaster with limited interventions. Progress in therapeutic development requires a more detailed understanding of molecular pathogenesis. Most data for AD pathogenesis in humans is from standard neuropathologic assessments, e.g., neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles or biochemical measurement of a limited number of analytes related to neuropathologic features, e.g., amyloid-{beta} peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau. Standard neuropathologic evaluation is highly valuable as it provides assessment of diseases that afflict an individual brain, but it also is limited in its ability to investigate molecular pathogenesis. Modern mass spectrometry-based proteomics enable quantitative insight into the protein phenotype in brains with AD neuropathology. Careful selection of specimens enabled us to investigate protein signatures specific to autosomal dominant AD dementia (ADD), sporadic ADD with minimal comorbidities, individuals without dementia who had high histopathologic burden of AD, and cognitively normal individuals with no or minimal AD histopathologic burden. All data are deposited in the ProteomeXchange proteomic data repositories (ID: PXD034525).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Target-distractor competition modulates saccade trajectories in space and object-space</a></h4>

              
                Saccade planning and execution can be affected by a multitude of factors present in a target selection task. Recent studies have shown that the similarity between a target and nearby distractors affects the curvature of saccade trajectories, due to target-distractor competition. To further understand the nature of this competition, we varied the distance between and the similarity of complex target and distractor objects in a delayed match-to-sample task to examine their effects on saccade trajectories and better understand the underlying neural circuitry. For trials with short saccadic reaction times (SRTs) when target-distractor competition is still active, we found a robust effect of distance consistent with saccade vector averaging, whereas the effect of similarity suggested the existence of an object-based suppressive surround. At longer SRTs there was sufficient time for competition between the objects to complete and the distractor to be inhibited, which resulted in saccade trajectory deviations exhibiting the effects of a spatial suppressive surround. In terms of similarity, as the target-distractor similarity decreased, the initial saccade angle shifted towards the target, reflecting stronger distractor inhibition. There were no interactions between distance and similarity at any point in the time-course of target-distractor competition. Taken together, saccade trajectories reflect target-distractor competition that is affected independently by both spatial and object-space suppressive surrounds. The differences in saccade trajectories at short and long SRTs distinguish between active and completed decision-making processes. Thus, saccade responses are more beneficial than manual responses in studies of decision-making models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissecting the chain of information processing and its interplay with neurochemicals and fluid intelligence across development</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has highlighted the role of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in perceptual, cognitive, and motor tasks. However, the exact involvement of these neurochemical mechanisms in the chain of information processing, and across human development, are unclear. In a cross-sectional longitudinal design, we used a computational approach to dissociate cognitive, decision, and visuomotor processing in 293 individuals spanning early childhood to adulthood. We found that glutamate and GABA within the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) explained unique variance in visuomotor processing, with higher glutamate predicting poorer visuomotor processing in younger participants but better visuomotor processing in mature participants, while GABA showed the opposite pattern. These findings were functionally, neuroanatomically, and neurochemically specific, and were replicated ~1.5 years later and were generalized in two further different behavioral tasks. Using resting fMRI, we revealed that the relationship between IPS neurochemicals and visuomotor processing is mediated by functional connectivity in the visuomotor network. We then extended our findings to high-level cognitive behavior by predicting fluid intelligence performance. We showed that fluid intelligence performance is explained by IPS GABA and glutamate and is mediated by visuomotor processing, and moderated by the developmental stage. These results provide an integrative biological and psychological mechanistic explanation that links cognitive processes and neurotransmitters across human development and establishes their involvement in intelligent behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seeing our hand or a tool during visually-guided actions: different effects on the somatosensory and visual cortices</a></h4>

              
                The processing of proprioceptive information in the context of a conflict between visual and somatosensory feedbacks deteriorates motor performance. Previous studies have shown that seeing one's hand increases the weighting assigned to arm somatosensory inputs. In this light, we hypothesized that the sensory conflict, when tracing the contour of a shape with mirror-reversed vision, will be greater for participants who trace with a stylus seen in their hand (Hand group, n=17) than for participants who trace with the tip of rod without seen their hand (Tool group, n=15). Based on this hypothesis, we predicted that the tracing performance with mirror vision will be more deteriorated for the Hand group than for the Tool group, and we predicted a greater gating of somatosensory information for the Hand group to reduce the sensory conflict. The participants of both groups followed the outline of a shape in two visual conditions. Direct vision: the participants saw the hand or portion of a light 40 cm rod directly. Mirror Vision: the hand or the rod was seen through a mirror. We measured tracing performance using a digitizing tablet and the cortical activity with electroencephalography. Behavioral analyses revealed that the tracing performance of both groups was similarly impaired by mirror vision. However, contrasting the spectral content of the cortical oscillatory activity between the Mirror and Direct conditions, we observed that tracing with mirror vision resulted in significantly larger alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (15-25 Hz) powers in the somatosensory cortex for participants of the Hand group. The somatosensory alpha and beta powers did not significantly differ between Mirror and Direct vision conditions for the Tool group. For both groups, tracing with mirror vision altered the activity of the visual cortex: decreased alpha power for the Hand group, decreased alpha and beta power for the Tool group. Overall, these results suggest that seeing the hand enhanced the sensory conflict when tracing with mirror vision and that the increase of alpha and beta powers in the somatosensory cortex served to reduce the weight assigned to somatosensory information. The increased activity of the visual cortex observed for both groups in the mirror vision condition suggests greater visual processing with increased task difficulty. Finally, the fact that the participants of the Tool group did not show better tracing performance than those of the Hand group suggests that tracing deterioration resulted from a sensorimotor conflict (as opposed to a visuo-proprioceptive conflict).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robust and consistent measures of pattern separation based on information theory and demonstrated in the dentate gyrus</a></h4>

              
                Pattern separation is a valuable computational function performed by neuronal circuits, such as the dentate gyrus, where dissimilarity between inputs is increased, reducing noise and increasing the storage capacity of downstream networks. A number of different measures (such as orthogonalisation, decorrelation, or spike train distance) have been applied to quantify the process of pattern separation. However, these are known to give conclusions that can differ qualitatively depending on the choice of measure and the parameters used to calculate it. We here demonstrate that arbitrarily increasing sparsity, a noticeable feature of dentate granule cell firing and one that is believed to be key to pattern separation, typically leads to improved classical measures for pattern separation even, inappropriately, up to the point where almost all information about the inputs is lost. Standard measures therefore both cannot differentiate between pattern separation and pattern destruction, and give results that may depend on arbitrary parameter choices. We propose that techniques from information theory, in particular mutual information, transfer entropy, and redundancy, should be applied to penalise the potential for lost information (often due to increased sparsity) that is neglected by existing measures. We compare five commonly-used measures of pattern separation with three novel techniques based on information theory, showing that the latter can be applied in a principled way and provide a robust and reliable measure for comparing the pattern separation performance of different neurons and networks. We demonstrate our new measures on detailed compartmental models of individual dentate granule cells and a dentate microcircuit, and show how structural changes associated with epilepsy affect pattern separation performance. Overall, our measures solve a widely acknowledged problem in assessing the pattern separation of neural circuits such as the dentate gyrus, as well as the cerebellum and mushroom body. Finally we provide a publicly available toolbox allowing for easy analysis of pattern separation in spike train ensembles.

Author summaryThe hippocampus is a region of the brain strongly associated with spatial navigation and encoding of episodic memories. To perform these functions effectively it makes use of circuits that perform pattern separation, where redundant structure is removed from neural representations leaving only the most salient information. Pattern separation allows downstream networks to better distinguish between similar situations. Pathological changes, caused by Alzheimers, schizophrenia, or epilepsy, to the circuits that perform pattern separation are associated with reduced discriminative ability in both animal models and humans. Traditionally, pattern separation has been described alongside the downstream networks that receive the separated representations, but more recent studies have focussed on the detailed neuronal and circuit features that contribute to pattern separation alone. We here show that traditional measures of pattern separation are inappropriate in this case, as they do not give consistent conclusions when parameters are changed and can confound pattern separation with the loss of important information. We show that directly accounting for the information throughput of a pattern separation circuit can provide new measures of pattern separation that are robust and consistent, and allow for nuanced analysis of the structure-function relationship of such circuits and how this may be perturbed by pathology.

                Recent studies have suggested the glymphatic system as a solute transport pathway and waste removal mechanism in the brain. Imaging intracisternally administered tracers provides the opportunity of assessing various aspects of the glymphatic function in vivo. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI allows the evaluation of both the kinetics and spatial distribution of tracer transport throughout the brain. In this study, we investigated the impact of the molecular size of intracisternal tracers on the transport kinetics and distribution in the healthy mouse brain. Three MRI contrast agents with drastically different molecular weights (MWs): 1) Gd-DTPA (MW=661.8 Da), 2) GadoSpin (MW=200 kDa), and 3) oxygen-17 enriched water (H217O, MW=19 Da), were administered via cisterna magna infusion and their transport was dynamically assessed. Our results show that the transport of H217O was significantly faster and more extensive than the two gadolinium-based contrast agents. Time-lagged correlation analysis and clustering analysis comparing the kinetics of Gd-DTPA and H217O transport also showed different cluster patterns and lag time between different regions of the brain. Further, there were also significant differences in the transport kinetics of the three tracers to the lateral ventricles. These observations suggest the size-dependent differences in forces that drive tracer transport in the brain.

                We apply efficient coding principles to derive the optimal population of neurons to encode rewards from a distribution. Similar to this optimal population, dopaminergic reward prediction error neurons have a broad distribution of optimistically placed thresholds, neurons with higher thresholds have higher gain and the curvature of their responses depends on the threshold. Thus, these neurons may broadcast an efficient reward signal, not necessarily a reward prediction error.

                Neuronal response to nutrient availability plays an important role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and behavioral response to the environment in higher eukaryotes. However, we know little about how neuronal function is influenced by acute changes in nutrients at high resolution. Taking advantage of powerful fly genetics and the amenability of the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), we have investigated the synaptic response to acute amino acid restriction. Our findings indicate that the presence of general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) and phosphorylation of its target eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2alpha) are essential for the ability of the NMJ to maintain normal neurotransmitter output when the larvae are deprived of amino acids. Surprisingly, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which normally acts downstream of GCN2/eIF2alpha, appears dispensable in this regulation. Furthermore, we show that GCN2/eIF2alpha dependent cascade acts retrogradely from muscle back to motoneuron to adjust synaptic release. These results provide a mechanistic insight into the intricate regulation of synaptic strength through the action of GCN2 when organisms are faced with amino acid scarcity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct feedforward and feedback pathways for cell-type specific attention effects in macaque V4.</a></h4>

              
                Attention gates the flow of sensory information across brain areas. Mechanistically, attention should depend on a modulation of both feedback (FB) and feedforward (FF) projections, which terminate in distinct laminar compartments and target specific neural populations. We performed simultaneous laminar recordings from macaque V1 and V4 and identified putative fast-spiking (FS) interneurons and excitatory cells. V4 firing rates increased for both excitatory neurons and FS interneurons with attention. This increase was most prominent in superficial layers and preceded the modulations in V1 and Layer-4 of V4 in time, consistent with a FB modulation. We furthermore identified an attentional modulation of FF signaling corresponding to an increase in V1-V4 gamma-synchronization. Surprisingly, in V4, only Layer-4 FS interneurons were phase-locked to the V1 gamma rhythm, suggesting that V1-V4 gamma-synchronization may increase the signal-to-noise ratio rather than the gain of FF information transmission. Consistently, optogenetic tagging experiments in mice showed relatively strong phase-locking of PV+ and narrow-waveform SSt+ interneurons to gamma-rhythmic inputs. These findings reveal two distinct FF and FB pathways for attentional modulation with cell-type and layer-specific physiological effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different ways of evolving tool-using brains in teleosts and amniotes</a></h4>

              
                In mammals and birds, tool-using species are characterized by a high degree of encephalization with a relatively large telencephalon containing a higher proportion of total brain neurons compared to other species. Some teleost species in the wrasse family have convergently evolved tool-using abilities. In this study, we compared the brains of tool-using wrasses with various teleost species from a broad phylogenetic range. We show that in the tool-using wrasses, the telencephalon and the ventral part of the forebrain and midbrain are significantly enlarged compared to other teleost species, but do not contain a larger proportion of cells. Instead, this size difference is due to large fiber tracts connecting the dorsal part of the telencephalon (pallium) to the inferior lobe (IL), a ventral mesencephalic structure absent in amniotes. Such tracts were not present in other teleost species such as trout, zebrafish, or the Astyanax surface fish. The high degree of connectivity between the IL and the pallium in tool-using wrasses suggests that this unique teleostean structure contributes to higher-order cognitive functions. Considering how remarkably different their overall brain organization is, we conclude that, unlike in amniotes, the evolution of non telencephalic structures might have been key in the emergence of higher-order cognitive functions in teleosts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lipidomic alterations in the cerebral cortex and white matter in sporadic Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Aims: Non-targeted lipidomics analysis was conducted in post-mortem human frontal cortex area 8 (GM) and white matter of the frontal lobe centrum semi-ovale (WM) to identify lipidomes in middle-aged individuals with no neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, and cases at progressive stages of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). Methods: Lipidomic analysis using an LC-MS/MS platform was carried out in selected cases with suitable post-mortem lacking co-morbidities and concomitant brain pathologies. Complementary data were obtained using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Results: The WM shows an adaptive lipid phenotype resistant to lipid peroxidation, characterized by a lower fatty acid unsaturation, peroxidizability index, and higher ether lipid content than the GM. Changes in the lipidomic profile more marked in the WM than in GM occur in AD with disease progression. WM alterations are characterized by a decline in the content of branched fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA), diacylglycerols (DG), triacylglycerols (TG), glycerophospholipids (GP) (especially ether lipids), and sphingolipids (especially sulfatides, ceramides, and glycosphingolipids). The GM acquires a fatty acid profile prone to peroxidation in sAD, while WM reinforces its peroxidation-resistant trait. Transcriptomic data point to additional defects of peroxisomal function. Conclusions: Four functional categories are associated with the different lipid classes affected in sAD: membrane structural composition, bioenergetics, antioxidant protection, and bioactive lipids, with deleterious consequences affecting both neurons and glial cells favoring disease progression.

                The gut microbiome is emerging as an important susceptibility factor in Alzheimers disease (AD) possibly due to the increased prevalence of pro-inflammatory genera in gut microbiota of AD participants. Microbiota-mediated changes in cognition and adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), an important process for memory which is altered in AD, position the microbiota-gut-brain axis as a key regulator of AD. However, it is unknown whether gut microbiota alterations are the cause or consequence of AD symptoms. We transplanted faecal microbiota from AD participants and age-matched controls into microbiota-depleted naive adult rats and found impairments in AHN and associated memory tasks, which correlated with clinical cognitive scores. Discrete changes in the rat caecal and hippocampal metabolome were evident. Serum from AD participants also decreased neurogenesis in vitro and correlated with cognitive scores and pro-inflammatory genera. Our results reveal that the cognitive symptoms in AD may be due to alterations in gut microbiota, and that impaired neurogenesis may be a mechanistic link between altered gut microbiota and cognitive impairment in AD.

                Tactile sensation and vision are often both utilized for the exploration of objects that are within reach though it is not known whether or how these two distinct sensory systems might combine such information. Here in mice we find that stimulation of the contralateral whisker array suppresses visually evoked activity in a subarea of primary visual cortex (VISp) whose visual space covers the whisker search space. This is mediated by local fast spiking interneurons that receive a direct cortico-cortical input predominantly from layer 6 of the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (SSp-bfd). These data demonstrate functional convergence within and between two primary sensory cortical areas for multisensory object detection and recognition.

                Amongst the characteristics about information processing in the brain, observations of dynamic near-critical states have generated significant interest. However, theoretical and experimental limitations have precluded a definite answer about when and why neural criticality arises. To explore this topic, we used an in vitro neural network of cortical neurons that was trained to play a simplified game of `Pong'. We demonstrate that critical dynamics emerge when neural networks receive task-related structured sensory input, reorganizing the system to a near-critical state. Additionally, better task performance correlated with proximity to critical dynamics. However, criticality alone is insufficient for a neuronal network to demonstrate learning in the absence of additional information regarding the consequences of previous actions. These findings have compelling implications for the role of neural criticality.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Facemap: a framework for modeling neural activity based on orofacial tracking</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies in mice have shown that orofacial behaviors drive a large fraction of neural activity across the brain. To understand the nature and function of these signals, we need better computational models to characterize the behaviors and relate them to neural activity. Here we developed Facemap, a framework consisting of a keypoint tracking algorithm and a deep neural network encoder for predicting neural activity. We used the Facemap keypoints as input for the deep neural network to predict the activity of ~50,000 simultaneously-recorded neurons and in visual cortex we doubled the amount of explained variance compared to previous methods. Our keypoint tracking algorithm was more accurate than existing pose estimation tools, while the inference speed was several times faster, making it a powerful tool for closed-loop behavioral experiments. The Facemap tracker was easy to adapt to data from new labs, requiring as few as 10 annotated frames for near-optimal performance. We used Facemap to find that the neuronal activity clusters which were highly driven by behaviors were more spatially spread-out across cortex. We also found that the deep keypoint features inferred by the model had time-asymmetrical state dynamics that were not apparent in the raw keypoint data. In summary, Facemap provides a stepping stone towards understanding the function of the brainwide neural signals and their relation to behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A new take on model-based and model-free influences on mental effort and striatal prediction errors</a></h4>

              
                A standard assumption in neuroscience is that low-effort model-free learning is automatic and continuously employed, while more complex model-based strategies are only used when the rewards they generate are worth the additional effort. We present evidence refuting this assumption. First, we demonstrate flaws in previous reports of combined model-free and model-based reward prediction errors in the ventral striatum that likely led to spurious results. More appropriate analyses yield no evidence of a model-free prediction errors in this region. Second, we find that task instructions generating more correct model-based behaviour reduce rather than increase mental effort. This is inconsistent with cost-benefit arbitration between model-based and model-free strategies. Together, our data suggest that model-free learning may not be automatic. Instead, humans can reduce mental effort by using a model-based strategy alone rather than arbitrating between multiple strategies. Our results call for re-evaluation of the assumptions in influential theories of learning and decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-model order spatially constrained ICA reveals highly replicable group differences and consistent predictive results from fMRI data</a></h4>

              
                Brain functional networks identified from resting fMRI data have the potential to reveal biomarkers for brain disorders, but studies of complex mental illnesses such as schizophrenia (SZ) often yield mixed results across replication studies. This is likely due in part to the complexity of the disorder, the short data acquisition time, and the limited ability of the approaches for brain imaging data mining. Therefore, the use of analytic approaches which can both capture individual variability while offering comparability across analyses is highly preferred. Fully blind data-driven approaches such as independent component analysis (ICA) are hard to compare across studies, and approaches that use fixed atlas-based regions can have limited sensitivity to individual sensitivity. By contrast, spatially constrained ICA (scICA) provides a hybrid, fully automated solution that can incorporate spatial network priors while also adapting to new subjects. However, scICA has thus far only been used with a single spatial scale. In this work, we present an approach using scICA to extract subject-specific intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) from fMRI data at multiple spatial scales (ICA model orders), which also enables us to study interactions across spatial scales. We evaluate this approach using a large N (N>1,600) study of schizophrenia divided into separate validation and replication sets. A multi-scale ICN template was estimated and labeled, then used as input into spatially constrained ICA which was computed on an individual subject level. We then performed a subsequent analysis of multiscale functional network connectivity (msFNC) to evaluate the patient data, including group differences and classification. Results showed highly consistent group differences in msFNC in regions including cerebellum, thalamus, and motor/auditory networks. Importantly, multiple msFNC pairs linking different spatial scales were implicated. We also used the msFNC features as input to a classification model in cross-validated hold-out data and also in an independent test data. Visualization of predictive features was performed by evaluating their feature weights. Finally, we evaluated the relationship of the identified patterns to positive symptoms and found consistent results across datasets. The results verified the robustness of our framework in evaluating brain functional connectivity of schizophrenia at multiple spatial scales, implicated consistent and replicable brain networks, and highlighted a promising approach for leveraging resting fMRI data for brain biomarker development.

                Creatine transporter deficiency prevents creatine uptake into the brain, leading to mental retardation. To better understand the pathophysiology, this study focuses on the identification of biomarkers related to cognitive improvement in a Slc6a8 knockout mouse model (Slc6a8-/y) engineered to mimic the clinical features of CTD patients which have low brain creatine content. Shotgun proteomics analysis of 4,035 proteins in four different brain regions; the cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus (associated with cognitive functions) and brain stem, and muscle as a control, was performed in 24 mice. Comparisons of the protein abundance in the four brain regions between DCE-treated intranasally Slc6a8-/y mice and wild type and DCE-treated Slc6a8-/y and vehicle group identified 14 biomarkers, shedding light on the mechanism of action of DCE. Integrative bioinformatics and statistical modeling identified key proteins associated with CTD, including KIF1A and PLCB1. The abundance of these proteins in the four brain regions was significantly correlated with both the object recognition and the Y-maze tests. Functional analysis confirmed their key roles and associated molecules in CTD pathogenesis.

	<p>A unique structure of care for neurological inpatients with significant palliative care (PC) needs was established in the Department of Neurology at the Charit&amp;amp;eacute;&amp;amp;mdash;Universit&amp;amp;auml;tsmedizin Berlin in 2021: a specialized neuropalliative care (NPC) unit. After one year, we provide an overview of the concept and the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; characteristics. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of patients treated in our NPC unit between February 2021&amp;amp;ndash;February 2022. Data were extracted from medical records and PC assessment including diagnosis, mode of admission and discharge, length of stay, and palliative symptoms. Data are presented as averages with a 95% confidence interval [lower limit; upper limit] or percentage (absolute number). Results: We included 143 patients (52% (75) female, 67.9 years [65.6; 70.2]). Patients were admitted from general wards (48%; 68), their homes (22%; 32), intensive care units (16%; 23) or emergency departments (14%; 20). The main diagnoses were tumors of the nervous system (39%; 56), neurodegenerative diseases (30%; 43), neurologic complications (13%; 19) and cerebrovascular diseases (12%; 17). Complaints most frequently rated as severely to overwhelmingly burdensome were motor- or fatigue-associated problems, problems communicating, dysphagia and pain. The average length of stay was 13.7 days [12.2; 15.2]. Forty-five percent (64) of patients were discharged without further PC, 17% (24) were referred to a hospice and 13% (18) were discharged with outpatient PC. Five percent (7) were referred to neurorehabilitation and 21% (30) of patients died. Conclusions: Our NPC unit is a new model of care for neurological patients with substantial PC needs especially within the structures of a highly specialized and individualized medicine.</p>

	<p>Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) microstates reflect sub-second, quasi-stable states of brain activity. Several studies have reported alterations of microstate features in patients with schizophrenia (SZ). Based on these findings, it has been suggested that microstates may represent neurophysiological biomarkers for the classification of SZ. To explore this possibility, machine learning approaches can be employed. Bayesian optimization is a machine learning approach that selects the best-fitted machine learning model with tuned hyperparameters from existing models to improve the classification. In this proof-of-concept preliminary study based on secondary analysis, 20 microstate features were extracted from 14 SZ patients and 14 healthy controls&amp;amp;rsquo; EEG signals. These parameters were then ranked as predictors based on their importance, and an optimized machine learning approach was applied to evaluate the performance of the classification. SZ patients had altered microstate features compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, Bayesian optimization outperformed conventional multivariate analyses and showed the highest accuracy (90.93%), AUC (0.90), sensitivity (91.37%), and specificity (90.48%), with reliable results using just six microstate predictors. Altogether, in this proof-of-concept study, we showed that machine learning with Bayesian optimization can be utilized to characterize EEG microstate alterations and contribute to the classification of SZ patients.</p>

	<p>Verbal fluency impairment is common in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), but the effect of drugs on verbal fluency in PD patients has not been comprehensively evaluated. We conducted a network meta-analysis based on four online databases to compare the effect of drugs on verbal fluency in PD patients. This study was performed and reported according to PRISMA-NMA guidelines. In total, 6 out of 3707 articles (three RCTS and three cross-sectional studies) covering eight drug regimens were included (five for letter fluency, five for semantic fluency). In terms of letter fluency, the ranking of the overall efficacy of included drug regimens was: levodopa, levodopa combined with pramipexole, rotigotine, cabergoline, pramipexole, pergolide, but no drug regimen presented a significant advantage over the others. In terms of semantic fluency, the ranking of the overall efficacy of included drug regimens was: rotigotine, levodopa, cabergoline, pergolide, pramipexole, among which, levodopa alone (SMD = 0.93, 95%CI: 0.28&amp;amp;ndash;1.59) and rotigotine alone (SMD = 1.18, 95%CI: 0.28&amp;amp;ndash;2.09) were statistically superior to pramipexole, while no significant difference was identified between all the other drug regimens. Levodopa and rotigotine seem to be more appropriate choices for PD patients with verbal fluency impairment. Further study is needed to illustrate the efficacy of drugs on verbal fluency in PD patients.</p>

	<p>The paper overviews components of neurologic processing efficiencies to develop innovative methodologies and thinking to school-based applications and changes in educational leadership based on sound findings in the cognitive neurosciences applied to schools and learners. Systems science can allow us to better manage classroom-based learning and instruction on the basis of relatively easily evaluated efficiencies or inefficiencies and optimization instead of simply examining achievement. &amp;amp;ldquo;Medicalizing&amp;amp;rdquo; the learning process with concepts such as &amp;amp;ldquo;learning disability&amp;amp;rdquo; or employing grading methods such as pass-fail does little to aid in understanding the processes that learners employ to acquire, integrate, remember, and apply information learned. The paper endeavors to overview and provided reference to tools that can be employed that allow a better focus on nervous system-based strategic approaches to classroom learning.</p>

	<p>The effectiveness of early intensive interventions for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is now well-established, but there continues to be great interindividual variability in treatment response. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify putative predictors of response to two different approaches in behavioral treatment: Early Intensive Behavioral Interventions (EIBI) and the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM). Both are based upon the foundations of Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), but the former is more structured and therapist-driven, while the latter is more naturalistic and child-driven. Four databases (EmBase, PubMed, Scopus and WebOfScience) were systematically screened, and an additional search was conducted in the reference lists of relevant articles. Studies were selected if participants were children with ASD aged 12&amp;amp;ndash;48 months at intake, receiving either EIBI or ESDM treatment. For each putative predictor, p-values from different studies were combined using Fisher&amp;amp;rsquo;s method. Thirteen studies reporting on EIBI and eleven on ESDM met the inclusion criteria. A higher IQ at intake represents the strongest predictor of positive response to EIBI, while a set of social cognitive skills, including intention to communicate, receptive and expressive language, and attention to faces, most consistently predict response to ESDM. Although more research will be necessary to reach definitive conclusions, these findings begin to shed some light on patient characteristics that are predictive of preferential response to EIBI and ESDM, and may provide clinically useful information to begin personalizing treatment.</p>

	<p>Action imagery involves the mental representation of an action without overt execution, and can contribute to perspective taking, such as that required for left-right judgments in mental body rotation tasks. It has been shown that perspective (back view, front view), rotational angle (head-up, head-down), and abstractness (abstract, realistic) of the stimulus material influences speed and correctness of the judgement. The present studies investigated whether left-right judgements are more difficult on legs than on arms and whether the type of limb interacts with the other factors. Furthermore, a combined score for speed and accuracy was explored to eliminate possible tradeoffs and to obtain the best possible measure of subjects&amp;amp;rsquo; individual ability. Study 1 revealed that the front view is more difficult than the back view because it involves a vertical rotation in perspective taking. Head-down rotations are more difficult than head-up rotations because they involve a horizontal rotation in perspective taking. Furthermore, leg stimuli are more difficult than hand stimuli, particularly in head-down rotations. In Study 2, these findings were replicated in abstract stimuli as well as in realistic stimuli. In addition, perspective taking for realistic stimuli in the back view is easier than realistic stimuli in the front view or abstract stimuli (in both perspectives). We conclude that realistic stimulus material facilitates task comprehension and amplifies the effects of perspective. By replicating previous findings, the linear speed-accuracy score was shown to be a valid measure to capture performance in mental body rotations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Transcription Factor Hb9 Is Expressed in Glial Cell Lineages in the Developing Mouse Spinal Cord</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Hb9 (<I>Mnx1</I>) is a transcription factor described as a spinal cord motor neuron (MN)-specific marker and critical factor for the postmitotic specification of these cells. To date, expression of Hb9 in other cell types has not been reported. We performed a fate-mapping approach to examine distributions of Hb9-expressing cells and their progeny ("Hb9-lineage cells") within the embryonic and adult spinal cord of Hb9<sup>cre</sup>;Ai14 mice. We found that Hb9-lineage cells are distributed in a gradient of increasing abundance throughout the rostrocaudal spinal cord axis during embryonic and postnatal stages. Furthermore, although the majority of Hb9-lineage cells at cervical spinal cord levels are MNs, at more caudal levels, Hb9-lineage cells include small-diameter dorsal horn neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. In the peripheral nervous system, we observed a similar phenomenon with more abundant Hb9-lineage Schwann cells in muscles of the lower body versus upper body muscles. We cultured spinal cord progenitors <I>in vitro</I> and found that gliogenesis was increased by treatment with the caudalizing factor FGF-8B, while glial tdTomato expression was increased by treatment with both FGF-8B and GDF-11. Together, these observations suggest that early and transient expression of Hb9 in spinal cord neural progenitors may be induced by caudalizing factors such as FGF and GDF signaling. Furthermore, our work raises the possibility that early Hb9 expression may influence the development of spinal cord macroglia and Schwann cells, especially at caudal regions. Together, these findings highlight the importance of using caution when designing experiments using Hb9<sup>cre</sup> mice to perform spinal cord MN-specific manipulations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Prefrontal Cortical to Mediodorsal Thalamus Projection Neurons Regulate Posterror Adaptive Control of Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Adaptive control is the online adjustment of behavior to guide and optimize responses after errors or conflict. The neural circuits involved in monitoring and adapting behavioral performance following error are poorly understood. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a critical role in this form of control. However, these brain areas are densely connected with many other regions, and it is unknown which projections are critical for adaptive behavior. Here, we tested the involvement of four distinct dorsal and ventral prefrontal cortical projections to striatal and thalamic target areas in adaptive control. We re-analyzed data from published experiments, using trial-by-trial analyses of behavior in an operant task for attention and impulsivity. We find that male rats slow their responses and perform worse following errors. Moreover, by combining retrograde labeling and chemogenetic silencing, we find that dorsomedial prefrontal pyramidal neurons that project to the lateral nucleus of the mediodorsal thalamus (MDL) are involved in posterror performance and timing of responses, specifically with unpredictable delays until stimulus presentation. Together, these data show that dorsal medial PFC (mPFC) projection neurons targeting the lateral MDT regulate adaptive control to flexibly optimize behavioral responses in goal-directed behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Regular antenatal care visits were associated with low risk of low birth weight among newborns in Rwanda: Evidence from the 2014/2015 Rwanda Demographic Health Survey (RDHS) Data [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low birth weight (LBW) remains the global unfinished agenda in most countries of the world especially in low- and middle-income countries. LBW subsequently has harmful effects on the lifestyle, psychosocial and physiological development of the child. Although it is known that antenatal care (ANC) visits are important interventions contributing to prediction of newborn birth weight, little has been conducted on effect of ANC visits on birth weight in Rwanda. This study aimed at determining the association between regular ANC visits and risk of LBW among newborns in Rwanda. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was conducted to analyse the effects of ANC on LBW using the 2014/2015 Rwanda Demographic Health Survey. Associations of socio-demographic, socio-economic, and individual factors of the mother with LBW newborns were performed using bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: Prevalences of LBW and macrosomia were 5.8% and 17.6%, respectively. Newborns delivered from mothers attending fewer than four ANC visits were at almost three-times greater risk of having LBW [aOR=2.8; 95%CI (1.5–5.4), p=0.002] compared to those whose mothers attending four or more ANC visits. Residing in a rural area for pregnant women was significantly associated with LBW [aOR=1.1; 95%CI (0.7–1.6), p=0.008]. Maternal characteristics, such as anemia, predicted an increase in LBW [aOR=3.5; 95%CI (1.5–5.4),p<0.001]. Those who received no nutritional counseling [aOR=2.5; 95%CI (2–8.5), p<0.001] and who were not told about maternal complications [aOR=3.3; 95%CI (1.5–6.6), p=0.003] were more prone to deliver newborns with LBW than those who received them. Pregnant women who received iron and folic acid were less likely to have LBW newborns [aOR=0.5; 95%CI (0.3–0.9), p=0.015]. Conclusion: ANC visits significantly contributed to reducing the incidence of LBW. This study underscores the need for early, comprehensive, and high-quality ANC services to prevent LBW in Rwanda.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Multidisciplinary digital methodologies for documentation and preservation of immovable Archaeological heritage in the Khovd River Valley, Western Mongolia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The archaeological and ethnographic heritages of Mongolia reflect a multi-millennial continuity of typically mobile-pastoral occupations across sparsely populated, environmentally diverse landscapes, but the threats of modernisation and industrialisation to those heritages are nevertheless present and substantial. The construction of the Erdeneburen Hydroelectric Dam on the Khovd River in western Mongolia is planned to submerge hundreds of archaeological features and jeopardise at least another thousand. Methods: The Mongolian Archaeology Project: Surveying the Steppes, in collaboration with the Mongolian Institute of Archaeology, integrates a variety of digital techniques including GIS (geographic information systems), Machine Learning automated site detection, drone mapping, and Structure-from-Motion LiDAR scanning to document the endangered archaeology. This paper presents the resulting dataset of archaeological features across three different impact zones associated with the dam construction and evaluates the degree of efficacy of the initial data integration strategy through informal partner feedback and self-assessment. Results: While only approximately 20% of the documented sites fall within the planned flood zone, the remaining sites will be subjected to collateral threats such as industrial and infrastructural development that will necessitate extended monitoring, both temporally and spatially. In consideration of these results, this paper argues that a ‘responsive’ mode of heritage disaster intervention can bridge the gap between ‘reactive’ and ‘proactive’ modes, but requires development of an integrated (digital) methodology. Conclusions: The paper concludes by offering a new, more interconnected ‘transmethodology’ that addresses spatiality, sub-sampling, data reuse, and community input across multiple disciplines such as cultural heritage preservation, salvage archaeology, computer vision, and community archaeology. The authors developed this ‘transmethodology’ and the resulting workflows out of a theoretical framework that considers principles of Symmetrical Archaeology, Resilience Humanitarianism, and the CARE standard for inclusive data management (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics).

                Background: In Asian countries, human trafficking is often encountered as forced labor, forced marriage, sex trafficking, men, women, and children exploitation. This review points out how human trafficking activities are prevalent in Asian countries and also reveals different causes that are the basis of increasingly human trafficking in Asian countries such as poverty, unemployment, political uncertainty, war, natural disaster, corruption and weak policies. Human trafficking also creates huge health, physical, psychological and social implications on individuals and the overall society. Methods: The purpose of this study is to collect evidence on human trafficking in Asian countries. A scoping review methodology was used to systematically search online databases including Sage Journals Online, Wiley Online, Hein Online, Taylor & Francis Online, Web of Science, and Scopus literature to amalgamate information on this issue. For the purposes of this article, 64 studies met the inclusion criteria after searching and screening a total number of 1,278 studies. Results: The findings of this study were classified under three categories: prevalence of human trafficking in Asia, causes of human trafficking in Asia (poverty and unemployment, environmental and manmade disaster, weak policies and corruption), and impacts of human trafficking including social, health, physical, psychological impacts. Conclusion: Keeping in mind the prevalence and impacts of human trafficking, the author also recommends some meaningful and practical steps for policymakers and researchers to effectively tackle human trafficking in Asian countries.

                Background: Finding well-known Beauveria bassiana isolates that could preserve rice crops from Sesamia calamistis (stem borer) is problematic. Another difficult task is the development of precise inoculation methods, which have been employed for their establishment as endophytes in cereal crops. This study proposed machine learning models to predict the best entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana that could directly protect rice crops against Sesamia calamistis. Methods: Data driven machine learning decisions were implemented and assessed from 60 experimental runs with nine different feature/input variables and three target/output variables following foliar spray and seed treatment inoculation method. The feature variables consisted of rice plant tissue, such as Nerica-L19, Nerica1, Nerica8, the time, and the five promising isolates Beauveria bassiana (Bb3, Bb4, Bb10, Bb21, Bb35). The target variable consisted of the number of colonised roots, stems and leaves, expressed as a percentage depending on the degree of protection after each inoculation. A data driven decision by the extreme gradient boosting regression algorithm was used to proficiently abstract the situation where there is no direct relationship between features and target variables. Results: The foliar spray inoculation method exhibited high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.99, 0.98 and 0.94 depending on the number of colonised stems, roots and leaves, respectively, while the seed treatment approach exhibited the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.91, 0.87 and 0.75, respectively. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm effectively abstracted the nonlinear relationship between the attribute variables that were taken into consideration and predicted Beauveria bassiana as a bio-pesticide for rice and perhaps other cereal stem borers. Thus, this XGBoost regression model could be used to navigate the optimization domain and reduce the development time of the biocontrol process.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Synaptic reshaping of plastic neuronal networks by periodic multichannel stimulation with single-pulse and burst stimuli</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Justus A. Kromer, Peter A. Tass</p>

Synaptic dysfunction is associated with several brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease (PD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Utilizing synaptic plasticity, brain stimulation is capable of reshaping synaptic connectivity. This may pave the way for novel therapies that specifically counteract pathological synaptic connectivity. For instance, in PD, novel multichannel coordinated reset stimulation (CRS) was designed to counteract neuronal synchrony and down-regulate pathological synaptic connectivity. CRS was shown to entail long-lasting therapeutic aftereffects in PD patients and related animal models. This is in marked contrast to conventional deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy, where PD symptoms return shortly after stimulation ceases.
In the present paper, we study synaptic reshaping by periodic multichannel stimulation (PMCS) in networks of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). During PMCS, phase-shifted periodic stimulus trains are delivered to segregated neuronal subpopulations. Harnessing STDP, PMCS leads to changes of the synaptic network structure. We found that the PMCS-induced changes of the network structure depend on both the phase lags between stimuli and the shape of individual stimuli. Single-pulse stimuli and burst stimuli with low intraburst frequency down-regulate synapses between neurons receiving stimuli simultaneously. In contrast, burst stimuli with high intraburst frequency up-regulate these synapses. We derive theoretical approximations of the stimulation-induced network structure. This enables us to formulate stimulation strategies for inducing a variety of network structures. Our results provide testable hypotheses for future pre-clinical and clinical studies and suggest that periodic multichannel stimulation may be suitable for reshaping plastic neuronal networks to counteract pathological synaptic connectivity. Furthermore, we provide novel insight on how the stimulus type may affect the long-lasting outcome of conventional DBS. This may strongly impact parameter adjustment procedures for clinical DBS, which, so far, primarily focused on acute effects of stimulation.

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was rapidly declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Early clinical symptomatology focused mainly on respiratory illnesses. However, a variety of neurological manifestations in both adults and newborns are now well-documented. To experimentally determine whether SARS-CoV-2 could replicate in and affect human brain cells, we infected iPSC-derived human brain organoids. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can productively replicate and promote death of neural cells, including cortical neurons. This phenotype was accompanied by loss of excitatory synapses in neurons. Notably, we found that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antiviral Sofosbuvir was able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and rescued these neuronal alterations in infected brain organoids. Given the urgent need for readily available antivirals, these results provide a cellular basis supporting repurposed antivirals as a strategic treatment to alleviate neurocytological defects that may underlie COVID-19- related neurological symptoms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Prophage-like gene transfer agents promote Caulobacter crescentus survival and DNA repair during stationary phase</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kevin Gozzi, Ngat T. Tran, Joshua W. Modell, Tung B. K. Le, Michael T. Laub</p>

Gene transfer agents (GTAs) are prophage-like entities found in many bacterial genomes that cannot propagate themselves and instead package approximately 5 to 15 kbp fragments of the host genome that can then be transferred to related recipient cells. Although suggested to facilitate horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the wild, no clear physiological role for GTAs has been elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that the α-proteobacterium <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> produces bona fide GTAs. The production of <i>Caulobacter</i> GTAs is tightly regulated by a newly identified transcription factor, RogA, that represses <i>gafYZ</i>, the direct activators of GTA synthesis. Cells lacking <i>rogA</i> or expressing <i>gafYZ</i> produce GTAs harboring approximately 8.3 kbp fragment of the genome that can, after cell lysis, be transferred into recipient cells. Notably, we find that GTAs promote the survival of <i>Caulobacter</i> in stationary phase and following DNA damage by providing recipient cells a template for homologous recombination-based repair. This function may be broadly conserved in other GTA-producing organisms and explain the prevalence of this unusual HGT mechanism.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Epidemiology of first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, from March to April 2020, in Gabon [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background After the first cases of coronaviruses disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China in January 2020, the epidemic spread around the world. Few data are available from Central Africa. We conducted a study to monitor this emerging disease in Gabon, a Central Africa country. Methods In order to set up an epidemiological surveillance of COVID-19 in Gabon, we led molecular investigations on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples from the 1161 first suspected cases of COVID-19. A Reverse Ttranscriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using primers and probes targeted the E gene and polymerase gene according to the kit Tib-Molbiol. Results We diagnosed the first case of COVID-19 on March, 12 2020. Among those suspected cases, 83 were confirmed cases. There was no significant difference in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 between age groups (p = 0.14). Seventy-three percent were asymptomatic. The viral loads were significantly higher in the nasopharyngeal samples than in the oropharyngeal samples (p=0.03). There was no significant difference in viral loads between age groups (p=0.9895) and no correlation between clinical symptoms and viral loads (p=0.06042). Conclusion In conclusion, this study provides the first molecular data from Gabon concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. The data showed that most of the infected people were asymptomatic. The viral load was higher in the nasopharyngeal samples.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Analysis of the safety and immunogenicity profile of an azoximer bromide polymer-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                A systematic review of clinical trials conducted with a low-dose inactivated influenza vaccine adjuvanted by azoximer bromide (AZB, Polyoxidonium), was performed to compare vaccine reactogenicity against non-adjuvant vaccines. We also assessed whether lower amounts of antigen per viral strain in AZB-adjuvanted vaccines affected antibody responses. A robust search strategy identified scientific publications reporting 30 clinical trials, comprising data on 11,736 participants and 86 trial arms, for inclusion in the analysis. Local reaction rates (R lr) appeared to be lower in AZB-adjuvanted vaccine treatment arms versus comparator vaccine treatment arms. Post-vaccination geometric mean titres in those exposed to AZB-adjuvanted vaccine and comparator vaccine treatment arms were similar in both children and adults aged 18–60 years, implying an antigen-sparing effect by AZB. Meta‑regression analysis based on a literature search of records or reports of clinical trials featuring AZB and the inactivated subunit of influenza published between 1998–2018 was conducted online in January 2019 and updated in August 2019. This search covered trials performed between 1993 and 2016 and suggested that AZB did not contribute to vaccine reactogenicity.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Functional Neuroimaging as an Assessment Tool in Critically Ill Patients</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Little is known about residual cognitive function in the earliest stages of serious brain injury. Functional neuroimaging has yielded valuable diagnostic and prognostic information in chronic disorders of consciousness, such as the vegetative state (also termed unresponsive wakefulness syndrome). The objective of the current study was to determine if functional neuroimaging could be efficacious in the assessment of cognitive function in acute disorders of consciousness, such as coma, where decisions about the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies are often made.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A hierarchical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach assessed sound perception, speech perception, language comprehension, and covert command following in 17 critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Preserved auditory function was observed in 15 patients (88%), whereas 5 (29%) also had preserved higher-order language comprehension. Notably, one patient could willfully modulate his brain activity when instructed to do so, suggesting a level of covert conscious awareness that was entirely inconsistent with his clinical diagnosis at the time of the scan. Across patients, a positive relationship was also observed between fMRI responsivity and the level of functional recovery, such that patients with the greatest functional recovery had neural responses most similar to those observed in healthy control participants.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest that fMRI may provide important diagnostic and prognostic information beyond standard clinical assessment in acutely unresponsive patients, which may aid discussions surrounding the continuation or removal of life-sustaining therapies during the early post-injury period.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High resolution imaging of the osteogenic and angiogenic interface at the site of murine cranial bone defect repair via multiphoton microscopy</a></h4>

              
                The spatiotemporal blood vessel formation and specification at the osteogenic and angiogenic interface of murine cranial bone defect repair were examined utilizing a high-resolution multiphoton-based imaging platform in conjunction with advanced optical techniques that allow interrogation of the oxygen microenvironment and cellular energy metabolism in living animals. Our study demonstrates the dynamic changes of vessel types, i.e. arterial, venous and capillary vessel networks at the superior and dura periosteum of cranial bone defect, suggesting a differential coupling of the vessel type with osteoblast expansion and bone tissue deposition/remodeling during repair. Employing transgenic reporter mouse models that label distinct types of vessels at the site of repair, we further show that oxygen distributions in capillary vessels at the healing site are heterogeneous as well as time and location-dependent. The endothelial cells coupling to osteoblasts prefer glycolysis and are less sensitive to microenvironmental oxygen changes than osteoblasts. In comparison, osteoblasts utilize relatively more OxPhos and potentially consume more oxygen at the site of repair. Taken together, our study highlights the dynamics and functional significance of blood vessel types at the site of defect repair, opening up opportunities for further delineating the oxygen and metabolic microenvironment at the interface of bone tissue regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mesoscale cortex-wide neural dynamics predict goal-directed, but not random actions in mice several seconds prior to movement</a></h4>

              
                Volition - the sense of control or agency over one's voluntary actions - is widely recognized as the basis of both human subjective experience and natural behavior in non-human animals. Several human studies have found peaks in neural activity preceding voluntary actions, e.g. the readiness potential (RP), and some have shown upcoming actions could be decoded even before awareness. Others propose that random processes underlie and explain pre-movement neural activity. Here we seek to address these issues by evaluating whether pre-movement neural activity in mice contains structure beyond that present in random neural activity. Implementing a self-initiated water-rewarded lever pull paradigm in mice while recording widefield [Ca++] neural activity we find that cortical activity changes in variance seconds prior to movement and that upcoming lever pulls could be predicted between 3 to 5 seconds (or more in some cases) prior to movement. We found inhibition of motor cortex starting at approximately 5sec prior to lever pulls and activation of motor cortex starting at approximately 2sec prior to a random unrewarded left limb movement. We show that mice, like humans, are biased towards commencing self-initiated actions during specific phases of neural activity but that the pre-movement neural code changes over time in some mice and is widely distributed as behavior prediction improved when using all vs single cortical areas. These findings support the presence of structured multi-second neural dynamics preceding self-initiated action beyond that expected from random processes. Our results also suggest that neural mechanisms underlying self-initiated action could be preserved between mice and humans.

                Based on neuroimaging data, the insula is considered important for people to empathize with the pain of others. Here we present intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings and single-cell recordings from the human insulae while 7 epilepsy patients rated the intensity of a woman's painful experiences seen in short movie clips. Pain had to be deduced from seeing facial expressions or a hand being slapped by a belt. We found activity in the broadband 20-190 Hz range correlated with the trial-by-trial perceived intensity in the insula for both types of stimuli. Within the insula, some locations had activity correlating with perceived intensity for our facial expressions but not for our hand stimuli, others only for our hand but not our face stimuli, and others for both. The timing of responses to the sight of the hand being hit is best explained by kinematic information; that for our facial expressions, by shape information. Comparing the broadband activity in the iEEG signal with spiking activity from a small number of neurons and an fMRI experiment with similar stimuli, revealed a consistent spatial organization, with stronger associations with intensity more anteriorly, while viewing the hand being slapped.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genome-wide base editor screen identifies regulators of protein abundance in yeast</a></h4>

              
                Proteins are key molecular players in a cell, and their abundance is extensively regulated not just at the level of gene expression but also post-transcriptionally. Here, we describe a genetic screen in yeast that enables systematic characterization of how protein abundance regulation is encoded in the genome. The screen combines a CRISPR/Cas9 base editor to introduce point mutations with fluorescent tagging of endogenous proteins to facilitate a flow-cytometric readout. We first benchmarked base editor performance in yeast with individual gRNAs as well as in positive and negative selection screens. We then examined the effects of 16,452 genetic perturbations on the abundance of eleven proteins representing a variety of cellular functions. We uncovered hundreds of regulatory relationships, including a novel link between the GAPDH isoenzymes Tdh1/2/3 and the Ras/PKA pathway. Many of the identified regulators are specific to one of the eleven proteins, but we also found genes that, upon perturbation, affected the abundance of most of the tested proteins. While the more specific regulators usually act transcriptionally, broad regulators often have roles in protein translation. Overall, our novel screening approach provides unprecedented insights into the components, scale and connectedness of the protein regulatory network.

                Previous studies have highlighted an important role for hippocampal sharp-wave ripples in spatial alternation learning, as well as modulating activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, no study so far has investigated the direct influence of hippocampal sharp-wave ripples on mPFC activity during spatial alternation learning. Long Evans rats were trained on a three-arm radial maze to perform a sequence of alternations. Three different alternation sequences needed to be learnt, and while learning a new sequence, the activity in the mPFC was inhibited either directly following sharp-wave ripples in the hippocampus (on-time condition) or with a randomized delay (delayed condition). In the on-time condition the behavioral performance was significantly worse compared to the same animals in the delayed inhibition condition, as measured by a lower correct alternation performance and more perseverative behavior. This indicates that the activity in the mPFC directly following hippocampal sharp-wave ripples is necessary for spatial rule switching.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Artificial Gravity During a Spaceflight Analog Alters Brain Sensory Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Spaceflight has numerous untoward effects on human physiology. Various countermeasures are under investigation including artificial gravity (AG). Here, we investigated whether AG alters resting-state brain functional connectivity changes during head-down tilt bed rest (HDBR), a spaceflight analog. Participants underwent 60 days of HDBR. Two groups received daily AG administered either continuously (cAG) or intermittently (iAG). A control group received no AG. We assessed resting-state functional connectivity before, during, and after HDBR. We also measured balance and mobility changes from pre-to post-HDBR. We examined how functional connectivity changes throughout HDBR and whether AG is associated with differential effects. We found differential connectivity changes by group between posterior parietal cortex and multiple somatosensory regions. The control group exhibited increased functional connectivity between these regions throughout HDBR whereas the cAG group showed decreased functional connectivity. This finding suggests that AG alters somatosensory reweighting during HDBR. We also observed brain-behavioral correlations that differed significantly by group. Control group participants who showed increased connectivity between the putamen and somatosensory cortex exhibited greater mobility declines post-HDBR. For the cAG group, increased connectivity between these regions was associated with little to no mobility declines post-HDBR. This suggests that when somatosensory stimulation is provided via AG, functional connectivity increases between the putamen and somatosensory cortex are compensatory in nature, resulting in reduced mobility declines. Given these findings, AG may be an effective countermeasure for the reduced somatosensory stimulation that occurs in both microgravity and HDBR.

                Riluzole is the only treatment known to improve survival in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). However, oral riluzole efficacy is modest at best, further it is known to have large inter-individual variability of serum concentration and clearance, is formulated as an oral drug in a patient population plagued with dysphagia, and has known systemic side-effects like asthenia (limiting patient compliance) and elevated liver enzymes. In this context, we postulated that continuous intrathecal (IT) infusion of low doses of riluzole could provide consistent elevations of the drug spinal cord (SC) concentrations at or above those achieved with oral dosing, without increasing the risk for adverse events associated with systemic drug exposure or off-target side effects in the brain. We developed a formulation of riluzole for IT delivery and conducted our studies in purpose-bred hound dogs. Our non-GLP studies revealed that IT infusion alone was able to increase SC concentrations above those provided by oral administration, without increasing plasma concentrations. We then conducted two GLP studies that combined IT infusion with oral administration at human equivalent dose, to evaluate SC and brain concentrations of riluzole along with assessments of safety and tolerability. In the 6-week study, the highest IT dose (0.2 mg/hr) was well tolerated by the animals and increased SC concentrations above those achieved with oral riluzole alone, without increasing brain concentrations. In the 6-month study, the highest dose tested (0.4 mg/hr) was not tolerated and yielded SC significantly above those achieved in all previous studies. Our data show the feasibility and safety profile of continuous IT riluzole delivery to the spinal cord, without concurrent elevated liver enzymes, and minimal brain concentrations creating another potential therapeutic route of delivery to be used in isolation or in combination with other therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Effect of Node Features on GCN-based Brain Network Classification: An Empirical Study</a></h4>

              
                Brain functional network (BFN) analysis has become a popular technique for identifying neurological/mental diseases. Due to the fact that BFN is a graph, graph convolutional network (GCN) can be naturally used in the classification of BFN. Different from traditional methods that directly use the adjacency matrices of BFNs to train a classifier, GCN requires an additional input i.e.,node features. To our best knowledge, however, there is no systematic study to analyze their influence on the performance of GCN-based brain disorder classification. Therefore, in this per, we conduct an empirical study on various node feature measures, including 1) original fMRI signals, 2) one-hot encoding, 3) node statistics, 4) node correlation, and 5) their combination. Experimental results on two benchmark databases show that different node feature inputs to GCN significantly affect the brain disease classification performance, and node correlation usually contributes higher accuracy compared to original signals and manually extracted statistical features.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the progressive loss of both upper and lower motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. Currently, there are only two drugs, Riluzole (Rilutek) and Edaravone (Radicava), approved by FDA for ALS treatment. These two drugs are very expensive with only a few months of life extension. So far, there is no cure for ALS. Aberrant protein aggregation in motor neurons is an intracellular hallmark of ALS. The disturbance in protein homeostasis may contribute to the onset and progression of ALS. Autophagy plays an important role in degrading misfolded proteins and thereby preventing their aggregation. Pharmacological manipulation of autophagy has been proposed as a new therapeutic approach for treating ALS. IADB, a novel indole alkaloid derivative, has been reported to exert mitochondrial protection and cardioprotection through its autophagy-modulating potential. In our present study, we attempted to examine whether IADB has therapeutic potential in SOD1G93A-associated experimental models of ALS. We found that IADB could promote the clearance of SOD1G93A aggregates and reduce the overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells transfected with SOD1G93A. We further examined the IADB in a mouse model of ALS. Administration of IADB started at the age of 55 days until the end stage of the disease. IADB treatment significantly increased LC3-II levels and decreased human SOD1 levels and p62 expression in the spinal cords of SOD1G93A mice, suggesting that IADB treatment could induce autophagy activation and promote clearance of mutant SOD1 aggregates in SOD1G93A mice. Moreover, IADB treatment could alleviate the activation of microglia and astrocytes and mitochondrial oxidative damage in the spinal cord of SOD1G93A mice. Finally, we demonstratedthat IADB treatment could improve motor performance and delay the onset and progression of the disease in a mouse model of ALS. The neuroprotective effects of IADB may mainly originate from its autophagy-promoting property.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development and validation of an fMRI-informed EEG model of reward-related ventral striatum activation</a></h4>

              
                Reward processing is essential for our mental-health and well-being. Here, we present the development and validation of a scalable fMRI-informed EEG model related to reward processing in the ventral-striatum (VS); a central reward circuit node. Simultaneous EEG/fMRI data were acquired from 17 healthy individuals listening to pleasurable music, and used to construct a one-class regression model for predicting the reward-related VS-BOLD signal using spectro-temporal features from the EEG. Validation analyses, applied on EEG/fMRI data from a different group (N=14), revealed that the EEG model predicted VS-BOLD activation from the simultaneous EEG to a greater extent than a model derived from another anatomical region. The VS-EEG-model was also modulated by musical pleasure and predictive of the VS-BOLD during a monetary reward task, further indicating it functional relevance. These findings provide compelling evidence for the use of a scalable yet precise EEG-only probe of VS-originated reward processing, which could serve for process specific neruo-monitoring and -modulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Network Occlusion Sensitivity Analysis Identifies Regional Contributions to Brain Age Prediction</a></h4>

              
                Deep learning frameworks utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have frequently been used for brain age prediction and have achieved outstanding performance. Nevertheless, deep learning remains a black box as it is hard to interpret which brain parts contribute significantly to the predictions. To tackle this challenge, we first trained a lightweight, fully CNN model for brain age estimation on a large sample data set (N = 3054, age range = [8,80 years]) and tested it on an independent data set (N = 555, mean absolute error (MAE) = 4.45 years, r = 0.96). We then developed an interpretable scheme combining network occlusion sensitivity analysis (NOSA) with a fine-grained human brain atlas to uncover the learned invariance of the model. Our findings show that the dorsolateral, dorsomedial frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus had the highest contributions to age prediction across the lifespan. More interestingly, we observed that different regions showed divergent patterns in their predictions for specific age groups and that the bilateral hemispheres contributed differently to the predictions. Regions in the frontal lobe were essential predictors in both the developmental and aging stages with the thalamus remaining relatively stable and saliently correlated with other regional changes throughout the lifespan. The lateral and medial temporal brain regions gradually became involved during the aging phase. At the network level, the frontoparietal and the default mode networks show an inverted U-shape contribution from the developmental to the aging stages. The framework could identify regional contributions to the brain age prediction model, which could help increase the model interpretability when serving as an aging biomarker.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Post-Stimulus Encoding of Decision Confidence in EEG: Toward a Brain-Computer Interface for Decision Making</a></h4>

              
                When making decisions, humans can evaluate how likely they are to be correct. If this subjective confidence could be reliably decoded from brain activity, it would be possible to build a brain-computer interface (BCI) that improves decision performance by automatically providing more information to the user if needed based on their confidence. But this possibility depends on whether confidence can be decoded right after stimulus presentation and before the response so that a corrective action can be taken in time. Although prior work has shown that decision confidence is represented in brain signals, it is unclear if the representation is stimulus-locked or response-locked, and whether stimulus-locked pre-response decoding is sufficiently accurate for enabling such a BCI. We investigate the neural correlates of confidence by collecting high-density EEG during a perceptual decision task with realistic stimuli. Importantly, we design our task to include a post-stimulus gap that prevents the confounding of stimulus-locked activity by response-locked activity and vice versa, and then compare with a task without this gap. We perform event-related potential (ERP) and source-localization analyses. Our analyses suggest that the neural correlates of confidence are stimulus-locked, and that an absence of a post-stimulus gap could cause these correlates to incorrectly appear as response-locked. By preventing response-related activity to confound stimulus-locked activity, we then show that confidence can be reliably decoded from single-trial stimulus-locked pre-response EEG alone. We also identify a high-performance classification algorithm by comparing a battery of algorithms. Lastly, we design a simulated BCI framework to show that the EEG classification is accurate enough to build a BCI and that the decoded confidence could be used to improve decision making performance particularly when the task difficulty and cost of errors are high. Our results show feasibility of non-invasive EEG-based BCIs to improve human decision making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The molecular genetic landscape of human brain size variation</a></h4>

              
                Human brain size increases dynamically through early development, peaks in adolescence, and varies up to two-fold among adults. Although previous studies have elucidated changes in brain size across evolution, development, traits, and diseases, the molecular underpinnings of interindividual variation in brain size remain unknown. Here, we leverage postmortem brain RNA sequencing and estimates of brain weight (BW) in 2,531 individuals across three independent datasets, to identify 928 genes that show genome-wide significant associations with either higher or lower BW (BW+, BW-, respectively). These BW gene sets showed distinct neurodevelopmental trajectories and spatial patterns that mapped onto developmental, functional and cellular axes of brain organization. Expression differences among evolutionarily conserved BW genes were predictive of interspecies differences in brain size, and functional annotation of BW genes revealed enrichment for neurogenesis and cell-cell communication. Genome-wide, transcriptome-wide, and phenome-wide association analyses of in vivo neuroimaging phenotypes confirmed that the genetic regulation of BW- transcripts influences cortical surface area and volume, as well as behavioral traits related to brain function and disease. Cumulatively, our study represents a major step towards the goal of delineating the causal mechanisms of human brain size variation in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocytes regulate spatial memory in a sex-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive processes and neurocognitive disorders are regulated by astrocytes and have prominent sex differences. However, the contribution of astrocytes to sex differences is not known. We leveraged astrocyte-targeted gene editing and chemogenetics in adult mice to reveal that astrocytic glutamate receptors and other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) modulate hippocampus-dependent cognitive function in a sexually dimorphic manner. In females, spatial memory was improved by increasing metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3) in astrocytes or stimulating astrocytic Gi/o-coupled signaling, whereas stimulating Gs-coupled signaling impaired memory. However, in males, memory was improved by reducing mGluR3 or stimulating Gs-coupled signaling, whereas stimulating Gi/o-coupled signaling impaired memory. Thus, memory requires a sex-specific balance of astrocytic Gs-coupled and Gi/o-coupled receptor activities, and disease-associated alterations or therapeutic targeting of these pathways may cause opposing sex-dependent effects on cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beta band rhythms influence reaction times</a></h4>

              
                Despite their involvement in many cognitive functions, beta oscillations are among the least understood brain rhythms. Reports on whether the functional role of beta is primarily inhibitory or excitatory have been contradictory. Our framework attempts to reconcile these findings and proposes that several beta rhythms co-exist at different frequencies. Beta frequency shifts and their potential influence on behavior have thus far received little attention. In this magnetoencephalography experiment, we asked whether changes in beta power or frequency in auditory cortex and motor cortex influence behavior (reaction times) during an auditory sweep discrimination task. We found that in motor cortex, increased beta power slowed down responses, while in auditory cortex, increased beta frequency slowed down responses. We further characterized beta as transient burst events with distinct spectro-temporal profiles influencing reaction times. Finally, we found that increased motor-to-auditory beta connectivity also slowed down responses. In sum, beta power, frequency, bursting properties, cortical focus, and connectivity profile all influenced behavioral outcomes. Our results imply that the study of beta oscillations requires caution as beta dynamics are multifaceted phenomena, and that several dynamics must be taken into account to reconcile mixed findings in the literature.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Infant low-frequency EEG cortical power, cortical tracking and phase-amplitude coupling predicts language a year later.</a></h4>

              
                Cortical signals have been shown to track acoustic and linguistic properties of continual speech. This phenomenon has been measured across the lifespan, reflecting speech understanding as well as cognitive functions such as attention and prediction. Furthermore, atypical low-frequency cortical tracking of speech is found in children with phonological difficulties (developmental dyslexia). Accordingly, low-frequency cortical signals, especially in the delta and theta ranges, may play a critical role in language acquisition. A recent investigation Attaheri et al., 2022 (1) probed cortical tracking mechanisms in infants aged 4, 7 and 11 months as they listened to sung speech. Results from temporal response functions (TRF), phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and dynamic theta-delta power (PSD) analyses indicated speech envelope tracking and stimulus related power (PSD) via the delta & theta neural signals. Furthermore, delta and theta driven PAC was found at all ages with gamma amplitudes displaying a stronger PAC to low frequency phases than beta. The present study tests whether those previous findings replicate in the second half of the same cohort (first half: N=61, (1); second half: N=61). In addition to demonstrating good replication, we investigate whether cortical tracking in the first year of life predicts later language acquisition for the full infant cohort (122 infants recruited, 113, retained). Increased delta cortical tracking and theta-gamma PAC were related to better language outcomes using both infant-led and parent-estimated measures. By contrast, increased ~4Hz PSD power and a greater theta/delta power ratio related to decreased parent-estimated language outcomes. The data are interpreted within a "Temporal Sampling" framework for developmental language trajectories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Awake hippocampal replay is not required for short-term memory</a></h4>

              
                Short-term memory (STM) on a time scale of seconds to minutes is required to successfully perform day-to-day tasks, for example when engaging in a meaningful conversation. Previous studies in both rodents and primates have correlated hippocampal cellular activity and behavioural expression of STM. This research has led to models describing the putative neural mechanism in the hippocampus that mediate STM. In these models, a key role has been given to hippocampal replay - reactivation of neurons representing a trajectory through space-but definitive causal evidence that can challenge or confirm the model is missing. In this study, we aimed to address the uncertainty around the role of awake replay in STM by collecting direct causal evidence from behaving rats. Signatures of replay events were detected in the hippocampus and disrupted using electrical stimulation of the ventral hippocampal commissure in rats that were trained on three different spatial memory tasks in a multi-arm radial maze. All tasks required memory of the recent past, but varied in the time scale over which information needed to be retained: (1) a multiple trial match-to sample task, (2) a single trial non-match to sample task and (3) a spatial sequence memory paradigm. Rats readily learned the task rules, but disruption of awake replay did not affect task performance or other behavioral measures in any of the task. Altogether, our results show for the first time with definitive causal evidence that awake replay is not required for STM of events or of their temporal order.

                Sodium imaging (23Na-MRI) is of interest in neurological conditions given potential sensitivity to the physiological and metabolic status of tissues. Benchmarks have so far been restricted to parenchyma or grey/white matter (GM/WM). We investigate (1) the availability of evidence, (2) regional pooled estimates and (3) variability attributable to regional/methodology. MEDLINE literature search for Tissue sodium concentration (TSC) measured in specified healthy brain regions returned 127 reports plus 278 retrieved from bibliographies. 28 studies met inclusion criteria, including 400 individuals. Reporting variability led to nested data structure, so we used multilevel meta-analysis and a random effects model to pool effect sizes. The pooled mean from 141 TSC estimates was 40.51 mM (95% CI: 37.59 - 43.44; p< 0.001, I2Total=99.4%). Tissue as a moderator was significant (F214=65.34, p-val < .01). Six sub-regional pooled means with requisite statistical power were derived. We were unable to consider most methodological and demographic factors sought because of non-reporting, but each factor included beyond tissue improved model fit. Significant residual heterogeneity remained. The current estimates provide an empirical point of departure for better understanding in 23Na-MRI. Improving on current estimates supports: (1) larger, more representative data collection/sharing, including (2) regional data, and (3) agreement on full reporting standards.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Overflow of Working Memory from an Easily Accessible Active State</a></h4>

              
                Working memory is a system that realizes short-term memory retention and is essential to everyday activities. Recently, it has been suggested that working memory items can be maintained in both an active state with sustained neural activity and a latent state without any explicit neural activity. However, how easily we can retrieve memories in each state and how much information can be retained in the active state remains unknown. Here, we addressed these questions by adopting a novel experimental paradigm for measuring the reaction time required to recall a letter of the alphabet when presented with a corresponding color, based on memorized color/letter pairs. The results demonstrated that when participants retained only two pairs of items, they could recall both pairs similarly quickly. However, when there were two or more memorized pairs, the most recent or internally attended pairs were recalled more quickly than the other pairs. These results suggest that memories in the "active" state are accessed first and memories that have overflowed into the "latent" state are accessed afterward. Additionally, the capacity of the easily accessible active state is extremely limited (to approximately two chunks of information) compared with the traditionally considered working memory capacity (four to seven chunks). These results provide robust behavioral support for the co-existence of multiple states in working memory and underscore the need for a more detailed classification of the working memory capacity.

                When undisturbed, Drosophila larvae move forward through their environment with sweeping waves of caudal to rostral muscle contraction [1, 2]. In stark contrast, nociceptive sensory stimuli (such as attacks by parasitoid wasps) trigger the larvae to roll across the substrate by corkscrewing around the long body axis [3, 4]. While studies have described the motor pattern of larval crawling [1, 2], the motor pattern of larval rolling escape locomotion remains unknown. Here, we have determined this pattern. To do so, we developed a high speed confocal time-lapse imaging preparation that allowed us to trigger rolling with optogenetics while simultaneously imaging a genetically encoded calcium sensor that was expressed in the muscles. Of the 30 muscles present in each larval abdominal hemisegment we find that only 11 muscles are consistently and specifically activated across segments during rolling. 8 additional muscles are more sparsely activated. Importantly, the sequential pattern of muscle recruitment during rolling is completely distinct from that of forward or reverse crawling. We discover that a roll involves a wave of muscle activation that propagates around the larval circumference (in the transverse plane of each segment) and involves four coactive muscle groups. A pattern of activation progresses from coactive ventral muscle groups to dorsal groups and then spreads across the midline to the contralateral dorsal muscle groups which then progresses back to the ventral groups. Finally, the direction of a roll (either clockwise or counterclockwise around the body) is determined by the clockwise or counterclockwise order of muscle group activation around the transverse plane.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Catecholaminergic neuromodulation and selective attention jointly shape perceptual decision making</a></h4>

              
                Perception of sensory input is influenced by fluctuations in ongoing neural activity, most prominently driven by attention and neuromodulator systems. It is currently unknown if neuromodulator activity and attention differentially modulate neural activity and perception or whether neuromodulatory systems in fact control attentional processes. We pharmacologically enhanced cholinergic (through donepezil) and catecholaminergic (through atomoxetine) levels in humans performing a visual attention task to investigate the effects of neuromodulatory drive and spatial attention on neural activity and behavior. Attention and catecholaminergic enhancement both improved perceptual sensitivity by increasing the rate of evidence accumulation towards a decision threshold (cholinergic effects were negligible). Electroencephalographic recordings revealed that attention and catecholaminergic enhancement both modulated pre-stimulus cortical excitability, evoked sensory processes and parietal evidence accumulation. Crucially however, the spatial profile and timing of these effects were remarkably different. This suggests that selective attention and neuromodulatory systems shape perception largely independently and in qualitatively different ways.

                It has been repeatedly claimed that emotional faces capture attention readily, and that they are processed without awareness. Yet some observations cast doubt on these assertions. Part of the problem may lie in the experimental paradigms employed. Here, we used a free viewing visual search task and simultaneously recorded electroencephalography and eye-movements. Fixation-related potentials were computed for fearful and neutral facial expressions, and the electrical response compared when participants were aware or unaware of the fixated stimulus. We showed that the P300 increased across repeated fixations on the unseen targets, culminating in a conscious report, likely reflecting evidence accumulation. Awareness of the stimulus was associated with electrical changes emerging at around 130 ms, with emotions of the stimulus being dissociated only after awareness had arisen. These results suggest that the earliest electrical correlate of awareness emerges at around 130 ms in visual search and that emotion processing requires visual awareness.

                Stochastic Resonance (SR) describes a phenomenon where an additive noise (stochastic carrier-wave) enhances the signal transmission in a nonlinear system. In the nervous system, nonlinear properties are present from the level of single ion channels all the way to perception and appear to support the emergence of SR. For example, SR has been repeatedly demonstrated for visual detection tasks, also by adding noise directly to cortical areas via transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS). We mathematically show that high-frequency, non-stochastic, periodic signals can yield resonance-like effects with linear transfer and infinite signal-to-noise ratio at the output. Here we tested this prediction empirically and investigated whether non-random, high-frequency, transcranial alternating current stimulation (hf-tACS) applied to visual cortex could induce resonance-like effects and enhance performance on a visual detection task. We demonstrated in 28 participants that applying 80 Hz triangular-waves or sine-waves with hf-tACS reduced visual contrast detection threshold for optimal brain stimulation intensities. The influence of hf-tACS on contrast sensitivity was equally effective to tRNS-induced modulation, demonstrating that both hf-tACS and tRNS can reduce contrast detection thresholds. Our findings suggest that a resonance-like mechanism can also emerge when non-stochastic electrical waveforms are applied via hf-tACS.

                Visual perception is limited by spatial resolution, which declines with eccentricity and differs around polar angle locations. To compensate for poor peripheral resolution, we make rapid eye movements, saccades, to bring peripheral objects into high-acuity foveal vision. Already before saccade onset, visual attention shifts to the saccade target location and prioritizes visual processing. This presaccadic shift of attention improves performance in many visual tasks, but whether it changes resolution is unknown. Here, we investigated whether presaccadic attention sharpens peripheral spatial resolution; and if so, whether such effect interacts with polar angle locations. We measured acuity thresholds in an orientation discrimination task during fixation and saccade preparation around the visual field. The results revealed that presaccadic attention sharpens acuity, which can facilitate a smooth transition from peripheral to foveal representation. This acuity enhancement is similar across the four cardinal locations; thus, presaccadic attention does not change polar angle differences in resolution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A permissive role for dopamine in the production of vigorous movements</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine is essential for the production of vigorous movements, but how dopamine modifies the gain of motor commands remains unclear. Here, we developed a dexterous motor task in which head-restrained mice self-initiate fast and large-amplitude lever pushes with their left forelimb to earn rewards. We show that this task is goal-directed and depends on cortico-striatal circuits in the hemisphere contralateral to the limb used to push the lever. We find that unilateral loss of midbrain dopamine neurons reduces the speed and amplitude of lever pushes, and that levodopa treatment rapidly restores motor vigor, consistent with parkinsonian bradykinesia. Photometry recordings of striatal dopamine levels indicate that the therapeutic efficacy of levodopa does not require phasic dopamine release. In dopamine-intact mice, optogenetic stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons calibrated to mimic transients evoked by rewards is also insufficient to increase the speed and amplitude of forelimb movements. Together, our data show that phasic dopamine transients are unlikely to specify the vigor of forelimb movements online as they are being executed, and suggest instead that dopamine plays a permissive role in the selection and production of vigorous movements. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of how the basal ganglia contribute to motor control under physiological conditions and in Parkinson's disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Imaging the Neural Substrate of Trigeminal Neuralgia Pain Using Deep Learning</a></h4>

              
                Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a severe and disabling facial pain condition and is characterized by intermittent, severe, electric shock-like pain in one (or more) trigeminal subdivisions. This pain can be triggered by an innocuous stimulus or can be spontaneous. Presently available therapies for TN include both surgical and pharmacological management; however, the lack of a known etiology for TN contributes to the unpredictable response to treatment and the variability in long-term clinical outcomes. Given this, a range of peripheral and central mechanisms underlying TN pain remain to be understood. We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from TN patients who (1) rested comfortably in the scanner during a resting state session and (2) rated their pain levels in real time using a calibrated tracking ball-controlled scale in a pain tracking session. Following data acquisition, the data was analyzed using the conventional correlation analysis and two artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired deep learning methods: convolutional neural network (CNN) and graph convolutional neural network (GCNN). Each of the three methods yielded a set of brain regions related to the generation and perception of pain in TN. There were six regions that were identified by all three methods, including the superior temporal cortex, the insula, the fusiform, the precentral gyrus, the superior frontal gyrus, and the supramarginal gyrus. Additionally, 17 regions, including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex(dACC) and the thalamus, were identified by at least two of the three methods. Collectively, these 23 regions represent signature centers of TN pain and provide target areas for future studies relating to central mechanisms of TN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-related changes in brain metabolites underlie slowing of speed-accuracy trade-off</a></h4>

              
                Aging leads to response slowing but the underpinning cognitive and neural mechanisms remain elusive. We studied cognitive components of response speed with a diffusion drift model to estimate non-decision, boundary-separation, and drift-rate contributions to choice reaction times of older (62-80 years) and younger (18-29 years) adults (n=25 each). We characterised age-related differences in the metabolic and microstructural profile of cortical regions and white matter (WM) pathways of visuo-perceptual and attention networks with magnetic resonance spectroscopy and multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging. Aging was associated with increased non-decision time and boundary-separation, reduced N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) concentrations in anterior cingulate (ACC) and posterior parietal cortices, and reduced WM microstructure in the optic radiation (OR), inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF, SLF) and fornix. NAA in ACC and diffusivities in OR and SLF predicted non-decision time, while restricted diffusivity signal fraction in the ILF and fornix, and diffusivity in OR predicted boundary-separation. These results suggest that age-related deterioration of neuronal health and WM microstructure in visuo-perceptual and attention networks contribute to response slowing in aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Do intrinsic functional networks reflect interacting brain rhythms? Assessing the power bias in MEG amplitude connectivity at rest</a></h4>

              
                Electrophysiological measures of functional connectivity can be affected by the power bias, i.e., variations in their estimation due to variations in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) rather than in genuine neural interactions. Intrinsic functional networks emerge at rest from magnetoencephalography (MEG) amplitude connectivity mostly within the  and {beta} frequency bands, where the SNR of MEG recordings is coincidentally maximal. This raises the question, is the spectral specificity of these networks really driven by neural oscillatory dynamics or is it an artifact due to the power bias? Here, we present a detailed theoretical analysis of the power bias in amplitude connectivity allowing to disentangle the neural part of connectivity from the nonlinear SNR dependence of estimated amplitude connectivity (as well as from the contribution of noise correlations). On this basis, we developed a new correction technique involving a SNR-dependent renormalization of amplitude connectivity, which we validated using synthetic data. We then applied the technique to resting-state MEG data and quantified to what extent the power bias affects the spectral content of intrinsic functional brain couplings. We demonstrated the absence of such effect, which was explained by the observation in synthetic data that the power bias is very reduced at the sufficiently high SNRs found in resting-state MEG recordings. Comparison with a classical linear regression technique highlights the importance of our nonlinear correction to reach this conclusion. Our analysis thus confirms the crucial role of neural oscillations for the spontaneous emergence of intrinsic brain functional networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct spectral profiles of awake resting EEG in disorders of consciousness - the role of frequency and topography of oscillations</a></h4>

              
                The prolonged disorders of consciousness (PDOC) pose a challenge for an accurate clinical diagnosis, mainly due to patients scarce or ambiguous behavioral responsiveness. Measurement of brain activity can support better diagnosis, independent of motor restrictions. Methods based on spectral analysis of resting-state EEG appear as a promising path, revealing specific changes within the internal brain dynamics in PDOC patients. In this study we used a robust method of resting-state EEG power spectrum parameter extraction to identify distinct spectral properties for different types of PDOC. Sixty patients and 37 healthy volunteers participated in this study. Patient group consisted of 22 unresponsive wakefulness patients, 25 minimally conscious patients and 13 patients emerging from the minimally conscious state. Ten minutes of resting EEG was acquired during wakefulness and transformed into individual power spectra. For each patient, using the spectral decomposition algorithm, we extracted maximum peak frequency within 1-14 Hz range in the centro-parietal region, and the antero-posterior (AP) gradient of the maximal frequency peak. All patients were behaviorally diagnosed using Coma Recovery Scale - Revised (CRS-R). The maximal peak frequency in the 1-14 Hz range successfully predicted both neurobehavioral capacity of patients as indicated by CRS-R total score and PDOC diagnosis. Additionally in patients in whom only one peak within the 1-14 Hz range was observed, the AP gradient significantly contributed to the accuracy of prediction. We have identified three distinct spectral profiles of patients, likely representing separate neurophysiological modes of thalamocortical functioning. Etiology did not have significant influence on the obtained results.

                Neurons in cortex synchronize their spiking in response to local and distant inputs. These synchronized assemblies are fundamental to cortex function, yet basic dynamical aspects about their size and duration are largely unknown. Using 2-photon imaging of neurons in superficial cortex of awake mice, we show that synchronized assemblies organize as scale-invariant avalanches that quadratically grow with duration. This quadratic expansion was found only for correlated neurons and required temporal coarse graining to compensate for spatial subsampling when network dynamics are critical, as demonstrated in simulations. The corresponding time course of an inverted parabola with an exponent of 2 described avalanches of up to 5 s duration and maximized temporal complexity in the ongoing activity of prefrontal and somatosensory cortex and in visual responses of primary visual cortex. Our results identify a scale-invariant order in the synchronization of highly diverse cortical cell assemblies in the form of parabolic avalanches.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">HB-EGF and zinc activate EGFR to induce reactive neural stem cells in the mouse hippocampus after seizures</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal seizures mimicking mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) cause a profound disruption of the adult neurogenic niche in mice. Seizures provoke neural stem cells to switch to a reactive phenotype (reactive-neural stem cells, React-NSCs)) characterized by multibranched hypertrophic morphology, massive activation to enter mitosis, symmetric division and final differentiation into reactive astrocytes. As a result, neurogenesis is chronically impaired. Here we, using a mouse model of MTLE, show that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalization pathway is key for the induction of React-NSCs and that its inhibition exerts a beneficial effect on the neurogenic niche. We show that during the initial days after the induction of seizures by a single intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid, a strong release of zinc and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, both activators of the EGFR signalization pathway in neural stem cells, is produced. Administration of the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib, a chemotherapeutic in clinical phase IV, prevents the induction of React-NSCs and preserves neurogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The inhibitory control of traveling waves in cortical networks</a></h4>

              
                Propagating waves of activity can be evoked and can occur spontaneously in vivo and in vitro. We examine the properties of these waves as inhibition varies in a cortical slice and then develop several computational models. We first show that in the slice, inhibition controls the velocity of propagation as well as the magnitude of the local field potential. We introduce a spiking model of sparsely connected excitatory and inhibitory theta neurons which are distributed on a one-dimensional domain and illustrate both evoked and spontaneous waves. The excitatory neurons have an additional spike-frequency adaptation current which limits their maximal activity. We show that increased inhibition slows the waves down and limits the participation of excitatory cells in this spiking network. Decreased inhibition leads to large amplitude faster moving waves similar to those seen in seizures. To gain further insight into the mechanism that control the waves, we then systematically reduce the model to a Wilson-Cowan type network using a mean-field approach. We simulate this network directly and by using numerical continuation to follow traveling waves in a moving coordinate system as we vary the strength and spread of inhibition and the strength of adaptation. We find several types of instability (bifurcations) that lead to the loss of waves and subsequent pattern formation. We approximate the smooth nonlinearity by a step function and obtain expressions for the velocity, wave-width, and stability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effect of walking with reduced trunk motion on dynamic stability in healthy adults</a></h4>

              
                Most people with Parkinson's Disease (PD) walk with a smaller mediolateral base of support (BoS) compared to healthy people, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. According to the extrapolated center of mass (XCoM) concept, a decrease in mediolateral XCoM excursion would require a smaller mediolateral BoS to maintain a constant margin of stability (MoS) and remain stable. As people with PD typically walk with reduced trunk motion, we hypothesized that the mediolateral MoS might stay the same despite a smaller BoS. As proof of principle, we assess whether walking with reduced trunk motion results in a smaller step width in healthy adults, without altering the mediolateral MoS. Fifteen healthy adults walked on a treadmill at preferred comfortable walking speed in two conditions. First, the 'regular walking' condition without any instructions, and second, the 'reduced trunk motion' condition with the instruction: 'Keep your trunk as still as possible'. Treadmill speed was kept the same in the two conditions. Trunk kinematics, step width, mediolateral XCoM excursion and mediolateral MoS were calculated and compared between the two conditions. Walking with the instruction to keep the trunk still significantly reduced trunk kinematics. Walking with reduced trunk motion resulted in significant decreases in step width and mediolateral XCoM excursion, but not in the mediolateral MoS. Furthermore, step width and mediolateral XCoM excursion were strongly correlated during both conditions (r=0.887 and r=0.934). This study shows that walking with reduced trunk motion leads to a gait pattern with a smaller BoS in healthy adults, without altering the mediolateral MoS. Our findings indicate a strong coupling between CoM motion state and the mediolateral BoS. We expect that people with PD who walk narrow-based, have a similar mediolateral MoS as healthy people, which will be further investigated.

	<p>Motor imagery (MI) describes a dynamic cognitive process where a movement is mentally simulated without taking place and holds potential as a means of stimulating motor learning and regaining motor skills. There is growing evidence that imagined and executed actions have common neural circuitry. Since MI counteracts cognitive and motor decline, a growing interest in MI-based mental exercise for older individuals has emerged. Here we review the last decade&amp;amp;rsquo;s scientific literature on age-related changes in MI skills. Heterogeneity in the experimental protocols, as well as the use of populations with unrepresentative age, is making it challenging to draw unambiguous conclusions about MI skills preservation. Self-report and behavioural tasks have shown that some MI components are preserved, while others are impaired. Evidence from neuroimaging studies revealed that, during MI tasks, older individuals hyperactivate their sensorimotor and attentional networks. Some studies have argued that this represents a compensatory mechanism, others claim that this is a sign of cognitive decline. However, further studies are needed to establish whether MI could be used as a promotion factor to improve cognitive functioning and well-being in older people.</p>

	<p>Fatigue, depression, and sleep inertia are frequently underdiagnosed manifestations in narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. Our cross-sectional study design included diagnostic interview accompanied by assessment instruments and aimed to explore how these factors influence disease severity as well as to elucidate any sex predisposition. One hundred and forty-eight subjects (female 63%) were divided into narcolepsy type 1 (NT1; n = 87, female = 61%), narcolepsy type 2 (NT2; n = 22, female = 59%), and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH; n = 39, female = 69%). All subjects completed a set of questionnaires: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Sleep Inertia Questionnaire (SIQ). In narcoleptic subjects, questionnaire data were correlated with the Narcolepsy Severity Scale (NSS), and in subjects with idiopathic hypersomnia, with the Idiopathic Hypersomnia Severity Scale (IHSS). The highest correlation in narcoleptic subjects was found between NSS and ESS (r = 0.658; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), as well as FSS (r = 0.506; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), while in subjects with idiopathic hypersomnia, the most prominent positive correlations were found between IHSS and SIQ (r = 0.894; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), FSS (r = 0.812; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), HADS depression scale (r = 0.649; p = 0.0005), and HADS anxiety scale (r = 0.528; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). ESS showed an analogic correlation with disease severity (r = 0.606; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). HADS anxiety and depression scores were higher in females (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05 and p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), with similar results for FSS and SIQ scales (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05 for both), and a trend toward higher ESS values in females (p = 0.057). Our study illustrates that more attention should be focused on pathophysiological mechanisms and associations of fatigue, depression, as well as sleep inertia in these diseases; they influence the course of both illnesses, particularly in women.</p>

	<p>Early literacy skills such as alphabet knowledge and phonemic awareness are made up the foundation for learning to read. These skills are more effectively taught with explicit instruction starting inpreschool and then continuing during early elementary school years. The COVID19 pandemic school closures severely impacted early literacy development worldwide. Brazil had one of the longest school closure periods, which resulted in several children having no access to any educational activities. Education Technology (EdTech) tools can leverage access to pedagogical materials and remediate the consequences of school closure. We investigated the impact of using an early literacy EdTech, GraphoGame Brazil, to foster learning of early literacy skills during the height of COVID19 school closures, in Brazil. We carried out a quasi-experimental, pretest and posttest study with elementary school students who were taking online classes. Participants were pseudo randomly assigned to (1) an experimental group, who played GraphoGame Brazil, and to (2) an active control group, who played an EdTech that focuses on early numeracy skills. The results show a significant positive training effect on word reading accuracy associated with the use of GraphoGame for the children in the experimental group, relative to the control group. We also found statistically significant negative effect in lowercase naming for the control group. We address the consequences of COVID19 school closures, the promise of EdTech and its limitations, and discuss the issue of fostering successful early literacy instruction in countries that have struggled with teaching children to read even before the pandemic.</p>

	<p>This article will explore the expressivity and tractability of vividness, as viewed from the interdisciplinary perspective of the cognitive sciences, including the sub-disciplines of artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and phenomenology. Following the precursor work by Benussi in experimental phenomenology, seminal papers by David Marks in psychology and, later, Hector Levesque in computer science, a substantial part of the discussion has been around a symbolic approach to the concept of vividness. At the same time, a similar concept linked to semantic memory, imagery, and mental models has had a long history in cognitive psychology, with new emerging links to cognitive neuroscience. More recently, there is a push towards neural-symbolic representations which allows room for the integration of brain models of vividness to a symbolic concept of vividness. Such works lead to question the phenomenology of vividness in the context of consciousness, and the related ethical concerns. The purpose of this paper is to review the state of the art, advances, and further potential developments of artificial-human vividness while laying the ground for a shared conceptual platform for dialogue, communication, and debate across all the relevant sub-disciplines. Within such context, an important goal of the paper is to define the crucial role of vividness in grounding simulation and modeling within the psychology (and neuroscience) of human reasoning.</p>

	<p>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly the &amp;amp;alpha;7 nAChR, play a critical role in neuroinflammation and microglial activation associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Microglial quinolinic acid (QUIN), which is synthesized by 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid dioxygenase (HAAO), is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist and has been implicated in the development of MDD-related symptoms. In the present study, we assessed the effects of PNU120596, an &amp;amp;alpha;7 nAChR positive allosteric modulator (PAM), on HAAO expression and QUIN formation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. We also investigated the effects of memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, alone and in combination with PNU120596 on cognitive deficit and depressive-like behaviors induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice using the Y-maze and forced swim test, respectively. LPS (1 mg/kg, i.p.) elevated HAAO expression and QUIN formation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, which were reduced with pretreatment with PNU120596 (4 mg/kg, i.p.). Furthermore, memantine (1 or 3 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented the cognitive deficit and depressive-like behaviors induced by LPS in mice. Together, these results suggest that the antidepressant-like effects of PNU120596 are mediated by attenuation of LPS-induced QUIN formation. Therefore, &amp;amp;alpha;7 nAChR PAM could be a potential therapeutic candidate for MDD associated with neurotoxic glutamatergic transmission.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Psychosocial- and disclosure-related challenges among HIV-serodiscordant couples: an interpretative phenomenological analysis study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Serodiscordant refers to a couple where one has human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the other partner is HIV negative. HIV-serodiscordancy often results in diverse psychological and emotional challenges. Evidence demonstrates that the dynamics of living in an HIV-serodiscordant relationship are often stressful. This study explored the psychosocial- and disclosure-related challenges faced by couples in HIV-serodiscordant relationships in South Africa. Methods: An interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) design was followed. A total of 13 HIV-serodiscordant partners were purposively sampled. Data were collected through individual face-to-face interviews and analysed using the IPA framework. Results: The findings indicated that HIV-serodiscordant couples experienced diverse psychosocial challenges such as shock, sadness, hurt, denial and disbelief. Participants also experienced challenges such as selective disclosure and fear of further disclosure. Conclusions: The findings have implications for public health and are critical in programming and designing couple-based HIV care interventions. Couples in HIV-serodiscordant relationships would benefit more from differentiated, client-centred psychosocial support. To contribute to the HIV epidemic control and reduction of new HIV infections, specific interventions such as couples counselling, disclosure counselling, support groups, health education and safer conception risk reduction strategies need to be implemented.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of sleep and health behaviours among people with diabetes and a nondiabetic group in Phitsanulok, Thailand: a cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global public health problem. To avoid disease complications, people with diabetes have to control their blood glucose and maintain a healthy lifestyle including a healthy diet, weight control, moderate exercise, and smoking cessation. Methods: This study aimed to survey sleep, eating, and exercise behaviours of people with diabetes in the Bang Rakam district, a rural community in Phitsanulok province, Thailand. The data on sleep and other health behaviours were taken from 1,385 T2DM patients and 1,394 non-T2DM controls, who were aged 30 - 85 years and were free from other chronic diseases. The data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Results: Compared to the control group, the people with diabetes had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI).  However, only a few of them smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol. Most of the participants were ‘morning people’ who slept 7-9 hours per day. It was found that sleep ≥8 hours increased the risk of diabetes among women (OR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.56). The people with diabetes also reported eating chicken and vegetables more than the control group. They also avoided eating beef and eating more than a cup of rice per meal. However, the T2DM group did fewer physical activities, such as walking, biking, or playing sports, during their leisure time. Conclusions: Most people with diabetes (T2DM) in a rural community of Thailand had healthy behaviours regarding sleep duration, sleep pattern, lifestyle, eating, smoking and alcohol consumption, except exercise and physical activity. The findings here contrast with the common perception that people with diabetes have bad lifestyle patterns, instead it showed that a healthy lifestyle pattern based on dietary patterns alone may not be sufficient and that lifestyle prevention of diabetes should always include physical activity as an integral part.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tsh Induces Agrp1 Neuron Proliferation in Oatp1c1-Deficient Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                <p>Thyroid hormones (THs), thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3), regulate growth, metabolism, and neurodevelopment. THs secretion is controlled by the pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and the hypothalamic&ndash;pituitary&ndash;thyroid (HPT) axis. The organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1/SLCO1C1) and the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8/SLC16A2) actively transport THs, which bind to their nuclear receptors and induce gene expression. A mutation in <I>OATP1C1</I> is associated with brain hypometabolism, gradual neurodegeneration, and impaired cognitive and motor functioning in adolescent patients. To understand the role of Oatp1c1 and the mechanisms of the disease, we profiled the transcriptome of <I>oatp1c1</I> mutant (<I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) and <I>mct8</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup><I>xoatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> adult male and female zebrafish brains. Among dozens of differentially expressed genes, agouti-related neuropeptide 1 (<I>agrp1</I>) expression increased in <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> adult brains. Imaging in the hypothalamus revealed enhanced proliferation of Agrp1 neurons in <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae and adults, and increased food consumption in <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae. Similarly, feeding and the number of Agrp1 neurons increased in thyroid gland-ablated zebrafish. Pharmacological treatments showed that the T3 analog TRIAC (3,3',5-tri-iodothyroacetic acid), but not T4, normalized the number of Agrp1 neurons in <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> zebrafish. Since the HPT axis is hyperactive in the <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> brain, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to knockdown <I>tsh</I> in <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae, and inducibly enhanced the HPT axis in wild-type larvae. These manipulations showed that Tsh promotes proliferation of Agrp1 neurons and increases food consumption in zebrafish. The results revealed upregulation of both the HPT axis&ndash;Agrp1 circuitry and feeding in a zebrafish model for OATP1C1 deficiency.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mutation in the thyroid hormone (TH) transporter <I>OATP1C1</I> is associated with cognitive and motor functioning disturbances in humans. Here, we used an <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> zebrafish to understand the role of organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1C1 (Oatp1c1), and the characteristics of OATP1C1 deficiency. Transcriptome profiling identified upregulation of <I>agrp1</I> expression in the <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> brain. The <I>oatp1c1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae showed increased thyroid-stimulating hormone (<I>tsh</I>) levels, proliferation of Agrp1 neurons and food consumption. Genetic manipulations of the hypothalamic&ndash;pituitary&ndash;thyroid (HPT) axis showed that Tsh increases the number of Agrp1 neurons and food consumption. The T3 analog TRIAC (3,3',5-tri-iodothyroacetic acid) normalizes the number of Agrp1 neurons and may have potential for the treatment of Oatp1c1 deficiency. The findings demonstrate a functional interaction between the thyroid and feeding systems in the brain of zebrafish and suggest a neuroendocrinological mechanism for OATP1C1 deficiency.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">PDE2A Inhibition Enhances Axonal Sprouting, Functional Connectivity, and Recovery after Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <p>Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors have been safely and effectively used in the clinic and increase the concentration of intracellular cyclic nucleotides (cAMP/cGMP). These molecules activate downstream mediators, including the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which controls neuronal excitability and growth responses. CREB gain of function enhances learning and allocates neurons into memory engrams. CREB also controls recovery after stroke. PDE inhibitors are linked to recovery from neural damage and to stroke recovery in specific sites within the brain. PDE2A is enriched in cortex. In the present study, we use a mouse cortical stroke model in young adult and aged male mice to test the effect of PDE2A inhibition on functional recovery, and on downstream mechanisms of axonal sprouting, tissue repair, and the functional connectivity of neurons in recovering cortex. Stroke causes deficits in use of the contralateral forelimb, loss of axonal projections in cortex adjacent to the infarct, and functional disconnection of neuronal networks. PDE2A inhibition enhances functional recovery, increases axonal projections in peri-infarct cortex, and, through two-photon <I>in vivo</I> imaging, enhances the functional connectivity of motor system excitatory neurons. PDE2A inhibition after stroke does not have an effect on other aspects of tissue repair, such as angiogenesis, gliogenesis, neurogenesis, and inflammatory responses. These data suggest that PDE2A inhibition is an effective therapeutic approach for stroke recovery in the rodent and that it simultaneously enhances connectivity in peri-infarct neuronal populations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Inhibition of PDE2A enhances motor recovery, axonal projections, and functional connectivity of neurons in peri-infarct tissue. This represents an avenue for a pharmacological therapy for stroke recovery.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Age of Reason: Functional Brain Network Development during Childhood</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human childhood is characterized by dramatic changes in the mind and brain. However, little is known about the large-scale intrinsic cortical network changes that occur during childhood because of methodological challenges in scanning young children. Here, we overcome this barrier by using sophisticated acquisition and analysis tools to investigate functional network development in children between the ages of 4 and 10 years (<f></f>; 50 female, 42 male). At multiple spatial scales, age is positively associated with brain network segregation. At the system level, age was associated with segregation of systems involved in attention from those involved in abstract cognition, and with integration among attentional and perceptual systems. Associations between age and functional connectivity are most pronounced in visual and medial prefrontal cortex, the two ends of a gradient from perceptual, externally oriented cortex to abstract, internally oriented cortex. These findings suggest that both ends of the sensory-association gradient may develop early, in contrast to the classical theories that cortical maturation proceeds from back to front, with sensory areas developing first and association areas developing last. More mature patterns of brain network architecture, controlling for age, were associated with better visuospatial reasoning abilities. Our results suggest that as cortical architecture becomes more specialized, children become more able to reason about the world and their place in it.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Anthropologists have called the transition from early to middle childhood the "age of reason", when children across cultures become more independent. We employ cutting-edge neuroimaging acquisition and analysis approaches to investigate associations between age and functional brain architecture in childhood. Age was positively associated with segregation between cortical systems that process the external world and those that process abstract phenomena like the past, future, and minds of others. Surprisingly, we observed pronounced development at both ends of the sensory-association gradient, challenging the theory that sensory areas develop first and association areas develop last. Our results open new directions for research into how brains reorganize to support rapid gains in cognitive and socioemotional skills as children reach the age of reason.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Large-Scale Mapping of Vocalization-Related Activity in the Functionally Diverse Nuclei in Rat Posterior Brainstem</a></h4>

              
                <p>The identity and location of vocalization pattern generating (VPG) circuits in mammals is debated. Based on physiological experiments, investigators suggested anterior brainstem circuits in the reticular formation, and anatomic evidence suggested the nucleus retroambiguus (NRA) in the posterior brainstem, or combinations of these sites as the putative mammalian VPG. Additionally, vocalization loudness is a critical factor in acoustic communication. However, many of the underlying neuronal mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we evoked calls by stimulation of the periaqueductal gray in anesthetized male rats, performed a large-scale mapping of vocalization-related activity using the activity marker c-<I>fos</I>, and high-density recordings of brainstem circuits using Neuropixels probes. Both c-<I>fos</I> expression and recording of vocalization-related activity point to a participation of the NRA in vocalization. More important, among our recorded structures, we found that the NRA is the only brainstem area showing a strong correlation between unit activity and call intensity. In addition, we observed functionally diverse patterns of vocalization-related activity in a set of regions around NRA. Dorsal to NRA, we observed activity specific to the beginning and end of vocalizations in the posterior level of the medullary reticular nucleus, dorsal part, whereas medial and lateral to the NRA, we observed activity related to call initiation. No clear vocalization-related activity was observed at anterior brainstem sites. Our findings suggest a set of functionally heterogeneous regions around the NRA contribute to vocal pattern generation in rats.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Vocalization patterns are shaped in the mammalian brainstem, but the identity and location of the circuits involved is debated. Additionally, the neuronal mechanisms of vocal intensity control are still unknown. This study consisted of a large-scale mapping of brainstem vocalization circuits based on the activity marker c-<I>fos</I> and high-density recordings with Neuropixels probes. The results confirm the role of nucleus retroambiguus in call production and point to a key role of neurons in this nucleus in loudness control. Dorsal to the nucleus retroambiguus and in the posterior medulla, the authors identify neurons with activity specific to the beginning and end of vocalizations. The results point to specific neural dials for various aspects of rat vocalization control in the posterior brainstem.</p>
