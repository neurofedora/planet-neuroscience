	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Expression Analysis of VDR-Related LncRNAs in Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-021-01858-y</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling has been reported to affect neurodevelopment, thus participating in the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We have measured expression amounts of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt;, and two related long non-coding RNAs, namely &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNHG6&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00511&lt;/em&gt;, in the circulation of ASD patients compared with normal controls. Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt; was remarkably higher in ASD cases compared with controls (posterior beta = 2.38, SE = 0.46, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001, 95% credible interval (CrI) for beta = [1.49, 3.27]). Level of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNHG6&lt;/em&gt; was lower in ASD cases compared with controls (posterior beta = − 0.791, SE = 0.24, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.029, 95% CrI for beta = [− 1.27, − 0.33]). Expression levels of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00511&lt;/em&gt; were similar between ASD cases and controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; values = 0.97 and 0.46, respectively). Expressions of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNHG6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00511&lt;/em&gt; were not correlated with age of children. However, significant correlations were perceived between expressions of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00511&lt;/em&gt; (r = 0.47, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt; (r = 0.42, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNHG6&lt;/em&gt; (r = 0.32, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Therefore, these results imply dysregulation of a number of VDR-related genes in ASD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Protective Effects of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide and Related Precursors in Alzheimer’s Disease: A Systematic Review of Preclinical Studies</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Data from preclinical studies propose nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) as a neuroprotective and bioenergetics stimulant agent to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, there seems to be inconsistency between behavioral and molecular outcomes. We performed this systematic review to provide a better understanding of the effects of NAD&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in rodent AD models and to summarize the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Studies were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and the reference lists of relevant review articles published through December 2020. The search strategy was restricted to articles about NAD&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, its derivatives, and their association with cognitive function in AD rodent models. The initial search yielded 320 articles, of which 11 publications were included in our systematic review.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Based on the primary outcomes, it was revealed that NAD&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; improves learning and memory. The secondary endpoints also showed neuroprotective effects of NAD&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; on different AD models. The proposed neuroprotective mechanisms included, but were not limited to, the attenuation of the oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, while enhancing the mitochondrial function.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The current systematic review summarizes the preclinical studies on NAD&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; precursors and provides evidence favoring the pro-cognitive effects of such components in rodent models of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and its pathogenesis is not fully known. Although there are several hypotheses, such as neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloid-β plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and oxidative stress, none of them completely explain the origin and progression of AD. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota and epigenetics can directly influence the pathogenesis of AD via their effects on multiple pathways, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and amyloid protein. Various gut microbes such as &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Bacteroidetes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Proteobacteria&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Tenericutes&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Verrucomicrobia&lt;/em&gt; are known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. These microbes and their metabolites modulate various physiological processes that contribute to AD pathogenesis, such as neuroinflammation and other inflammatory processes, amyloid deposition, cytokine storm syndrome, altered BDNF and NMDA signaling, impairing neurodevelopmental processes. Likewise, epigenetic markers associated with AD mainly include histone modifications and DNA methylation, which are under the direct control of a variety of enzymes, such as acetylases and methylases. The activity of these enzymes is dependent upon the metabolites generated by the host’s gut microbiome, suggesting the significance of epigenetics in AD pathogenesis. It is interesting to know that both gut microbiota and epigenetics are dynamic processes and show a high degree of variation according to diet, stressors, and environmental factors. The bidirectional relation between the gut microbiota and epigenetics suggests that they might work in synchrony to modulate AD representation, its pathogenesis, and progression. They both also provide numerous targets for early diagnostic biomarkers and for the development of AD therapeutics. This review discusses the gut microbiota and epigenetics connection in the pathogenesis of AD and aims to highlight vast opportunities for diagnosis and therapeutics of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain is a central component of pathology in Alzheimer’s disease. A growing volume of evidence demonstrates close associations between periodontal pathogens including &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Treponema denticola&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;T. denticola&lt;/em&gt;) and AD. However, the effect and mechanisms of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;T. denticola&lt;/em&gt; on accumulation of Aβ remain to be unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;T. denticola&lt;/em&gt; was able to enter the brain and act directly on nerve cells resulting in intra- and extracellular Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; and Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; accumulation in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice by selectively activating both β-secretase and γ-secretase. Furthermore, both KMI1303, an inhibitor of β-secretase, as well as DAPT, an inhibitor of γ- secretase, were found to be able to inhibit the effect of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;T. denticola&lt;/em&gt; on Aβ accumulation in N2a neuronal cells. Overall, it is concluded that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;T. denticola&lt;/em&gt; increases the expression of Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; and Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; by its regulation on beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 and presenilin 1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neurodevelopmental disorders are defined as a set of abnormal brain developmental conditions marked by the early childhood onset of cognitive, behavioral, and functional deficits leading to memory and learning problems, emotional instability, and impulsivity. Autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and Down’s syndrome are a few known examples of neurodevelopmental disorders. Although they are relatively common in both developed and developing countries, very little is currently known about their underlying molecular mechanisms. Both genetic and environmental factors are known to increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Current diagnostic and screening tests for neurodevelopmental disorders are not reliable; hence, individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders are often diagnosed in the later stages. This negatively affects their prognosis and quality of life, prompting the need for a better diagnostic biomarker. Recent studies on microRNAs and their altered regulation in diseases have shed some light on the possible role they could play in the development of the central nervous system. This review attempts to elucidate our current understanding of the role that microRNAs play in neurodevelopmental disorders with the hope of utilizing them as potential biomarkers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Accumulation of misfolded tau, amyloid β (Aβ), and alpha-synuclein (α-syn) proteins is the fundamental contributor to many neurodegenerative diseases, namely Parkinson’s (PD) and AD. Such protein aggregations trigger activation of immune mechanisms in neuronal and glial, mainly M1-type microglia cells, leading to release of pro-inflammatory mediators, and subsequent neuronal dysfunction and apoptosis. Despite the described neurotoxic features for glial cells, recruitment of peripheral leukocytes to the brain and their conversion to neuroprotective M2-type microglia can mitigate neurodegeneration by clearing extracellular protein accumulations or residues. Based on these observations, it was speculated that Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination, by making use of DCs as natural adjuvants, could be used for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. DCs potentiated by disease-specific antigens can also enhance T helper 2 (Th2)-specific immune response and by production of specific antibodies contribute to clearance of intracellular aggregations, as well as enhancing regulatory T cell response. Thus, enhancement of immune response by DC vaccine therapy can potentially augment glial polarization into the neuroprotective phenotype, enhance antibody production, and at the same time balance neuronal cells’ repair, renewal, and protection. The characteristic feature of this method of treatment is to maintain the equilibrium in the immune response rather than targeting a single mediator in the disease and their application in other neurodegenerative diseases should be addressed. However, the safety of these methods should be investigated by clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study aimed to determine the effects of 8 weeks of an administration of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Bifidobacterium bifidum &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Lactobacillus plantarum&lt;/em&gt; combined with exercise training on neurotoxicity of Aβ, spatial learning, acetylcholine (ACH), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in Alzheimer rats. Twenty-five Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 5 in each): (1) healthy control (control), (2) Alzheimer disease (AD), (3) AD with treadmill exercise (AD + Exe), (4) AD with probiotic (combined administration of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Bifidobacterium bifidum&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Lactobacillus plantarum&lt;/em&gt;) treatment (AD + Pro), and (5) AD with treadmill exercise and probiotic treatment (AD + Exe + Pro). AD was induced by intra-cerebroventricular injection of Aβ1-42 peptide. Then, the training groups exercised on treadmill for 8 weeks, 5 days per weeks. The rats were treated daily with probiotic supplements via gavage for 8 weeks. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was administered to measure spatial learning. Then, the animals were sacrificed and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vegf&lt;/em&gt; and ACH were analyzed using the qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods, respectively. Results showed that the β-amyloid plaques were significantly increased in the brains of the AD group compared with the control group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The combined use of probiotics and exercise training significantly increased the time spent in the target quadrant after removing the platform, compared with the AD group in the Morris water maze test (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Crystal violet analysis showed that sole (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and combined exercise training and probiotic supplementation (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) significantly reduced the number of dead cells in the brains of rats compared with the AD group. AD significantly decreased &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vegf&lt;/em&gt; mRNA and ACH in the CA1 area of the hippocampus (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). However, mono and combined therapy (exercise and probiotics) significantly increased ACH in the rats’ brain compared with the AD group. Overall, 8 weeks of an administration of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Bifidobacterium bifidum &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Lactobacillus plantarum&lt;/em&gt; combined with exercise training can improve spatial learning impairment in the AD rats. Exercise and probiotics seem to offer potential benefits to AD patients by upregulating ACH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neuroinflammation-induced neurodegeneration and immune cell infiltration are two features of Alzheimer disease (AD). This study aimed to identify potential peripheral biomarkers that interact with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and infiltrating immune cells in AD. Blood and CSF data were downloaded from the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AD and assessed infiltrating immune cells using the Immune Cell Abundance Identifier (ImmuCellAI) algorithm. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) and immune-related genes were identified from medical databases, and common genes were used to construct a protein-protein interaction network (PPI). Potential biomarkers reflecting the clinical features of AD were screened using Pearson correlations and logistic regression analysis. We identified 210 DEGs in the AD group. ImmuCellAI indicated that blood samples from patients with AD had a higher abundance of exhausted T (Tex; 0.196 vs. 0.132) and induced regulatory T (iTreg; 0.180 vs. 0.137) cells than controls. Thirty-two genes overlapped between the BBB and immune-related genes, and 27 genes in the PPI network were associated with eight pathways, including the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway (hsa04060) and the chemokine signaling pathway (hsa04062). Pearson correlations showed that five genes were associated with the CSF biomarkers, Aβ, total, and phosphorylated tau. Logistics analysis showed that the B cell-associated genes, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CXCL12&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TNFRSF13C&lt;/em&gt;, were independent risk factors for AD diagnosis. Peripheral &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CXCL12&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TNFRSF13C&lt;/em&gt; genes that correlated with immune cell infiltration in AD might serve as easily accessible biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Brain insulin system dysfunction has been proposed as a key player in the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (sAD). Given this fact, an adult rat model for sAD has been developed by intracerebroventricular injection of a subdiabetogenic streptozotocin dosage (icv-STZ). A low dose of icv-STZ in adult rats leads to a subclinical model of Alzheimer’s disease. According to the brain developmental origin for sAD occurrence, the present study evaluated the effect of neonatal injection of icv-STZ on the development and progression of Alzheimer’s disease later in the adult animals treated with a low dose of icv-STZ. Although no alteration was observed in the rats receiving an adult low dose of icv-STZ, these animals displayed cognitive deficits if they were also treated neonatally with icv-STZ. These impairments were associated with altered gene expression of insulin receptor, tau and choline acetyltransferase, along with increased astrocyte and dark neuron densities in the hippocampus. This study highlights neonatal brain insulin system dysfunction in the programming of brain insulin signaling sensitivity and provides more evidence for the developmental origin of sAD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Although genetic factors occupy an important place in the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), oxidative stress and exposure to environmental toxicants have also been linked to the condition. The aim of this study was to examine dynamic thiol/disulfide homeostasis in children diagnosed with ASD. Forty-eight children aged 3–12 years diagnosed with ASD and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy children were included in the study. A sociodemographic data form was completed for all the cases, and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) was applied to the patients. Thiol/disulfide parameters in serum were measured in all cases and compared between the two groups. Mean native thiol, total thiol concentrations (μmol/L), and median reduced thiol ratios were significantly lower in the ASD group than in the control group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001 for all). Median disulfide concentrations (μmol/L), redox potential, and median oxidized thiol ratios were significantly higher in the ASD group than in the control group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001, respectively). ROC analysis revealed that area under the curve (AUC&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; values with “excellent discriminatory potential,” for native thiol, total thiol, the reduced thiol ration, the oxidized thiol ratio, and redox potential and with “acceptable discriminatory potential” for disulfide were significantly capable of differentiating individuals with ASD from healthy individuals. No correlation was determined between the severity of autism and laboratory parameters. Impaired dynamic thiol/disulfide homeostasis was observed in children with ASD, suggesting that dynamic thiol/disulfide homeostasis in serum may be of diagnostic value in autism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Main risk factors of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) include both genetic and non-genetic factors, especially prenatal and perinatal events. Newborn screening dried blood spot (DBS) samples have great potential for the study of early biochemical markers of disease. To study DBS strengths and limitations in the context of ASD research, we analyzed the metabolomic profiles of newborns later diagnosed with ASD. We performed LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics on DBS from 37 case-control pairs randomly selected from the iPSYCH sample. After preprocessing using MZmine 2.41, metabolites were putatively annotated using mzCloud, GNPS feature-based molecular networking, and MolNetEnhancer. A total of 4360 mass spectral features were detected, of which 150 (113 unique) could be putatively annotated at a high confidence level. Chemical structure information at a broad level could be retrieved for 1009 metabolites, covering 31 chemical classes. Although no clear distinction between cases and controls was revealed, our method covered many metabolites previously associated with ASD, suggesting that biochemical markers of ASD are present at birth and may be monitored during newborn screening. Additionally, we observed that gestational age, age at sampling, and month of birth influence the metabolomic profiles of newborn DBS, which informs us on the important confounders to address in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, autism affects children in three major cognitive domains including social interactions, language learning and repetitive stereotyped behaviors. Abnormal regulation of cell proliferation in the brain during the embryonic period via the TGF-β signaling pathway and TRIM33 gene that encodes a protein with a corepressor and regulatory role in this pathway has been considered as an etiology for autism. Here, we investigated the association of a variation of TRIM33 with autism symptoms at levels of mRNA and protein expression. We used Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) as behavioral diagnostic tools. Normal and autistic children were genotyped for a TRIM33 polymorphism (rs11102807), and then expression was assessed at transcriptional and translational levels. Results demonstrated that the frequency of the homozygous A allele (AA genotype of rs11102807) was significantly higher in children with autism (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), whereas carriers of the G allele were mostly among healthy individuals. Children homozygous for the rs11102807 A allele were associated with an increase in CARS and ADI-R scores, indicating a significant correlation with autism symptoms. TRIM33 gene expression at both mRNA (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and protein (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) levels was significantly higher in controls compared to autistic children. A remarkable association between higher TRIM33 gene expression at the transcriptional level and lower scores for both CARS and ADI-R was observed in non-autistic children. It seems that rs11102807 modulates the function and expression of the TRIM33 gene, implying that the A allele may increase the risk of autism in children by reducing gene expression and altering the TGF-β signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition that includes a number of neurodevelopmental mental disorders. Recent genetic/genomic investigations have reported an increased prevalence of copy number variations (CNVs) in individuals with autism. Despite the extensive evidence of a genetic component, the genes involved are not known and the background is heterogeneous among subjects. As such, it is highly likely that multiple events (molecular cascades) are implicated in the development of autism. The aim of this work was to shed some light on the biological background behind this condition. We hypothesized that the heterogeneous alterations found within different individuals may converge into one or more specific biological functions (pathways) linked to the heterogeneous phenotypes commonly observed in subjects with ASD. We analyzed a sample of 107 individuals for CNV alterations and checked the genes located within the altered loci (1366). Then, we characterized the subjects for distinct phenotypes. After creating subsamples based on symptoms, the CNVs related to each specific symptom were used to create distinct networks associated with each phenotype (18 in total in the sample under analysis). These networks were independently clustered and enriched to identify potential common pathways involved in autism and variably combined with the clinical phenotype. The first 10 pathways of the analysis are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Nigrostriatal pathway disturbance is one of the major pathogenic factors in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Dopaminergic neuron dysfunction results in bradykinesia and akinesia (inability to initiate movement), indicating a significant risk factor for substantia nigra pars compacta lesions. Furthermore, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is associated with Aβ toxicity decline in AD therapy. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (Nmnat1) is an essential enzyme that preserves normal neuronal function and protects neurons from insult. This study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of Nmnat1 and its underlying mechanisms in a triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTgAD). Results showed that Nmnat1 improved the substantial behavioral measures of cognitive impairments compared with the 3xTgAD control. Additionally, Nmnat1 overexpression significantly increased tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 and caspase-3 expression levels in 3xTgAD mice. Nmnat1 also effectively controlled SOD1 activation. In conclusion, Nmnat1 substantially decreases multiple AD-associated pathological characteristics at least partially by the increase of caspase-3 activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;T-006, a small-molecule compound derived from tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), has potential for the treatment of neurological diseases. In order to investigate the effect of T-006 prophylactic treatment on an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model and identify the target of T-006, we intragastrically administered T-006 (3 mg/kg) to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) transgenic mice (APP/PS1-2xTg and APP/PS1/Tau-3xTg) for 6 and 8 months, respectively. T-006 improved cognitive ability after long-term administration in two AD mouse models and targeted mitochondrial-related protein alpha-F1-ATP synthase (ATP5A). T-006 significantly reduced the expression of phosphorylated-tau, total tau, and APP while increasing the expression of synapse-associated proteins in 3xTg mice. In addition, T-006 modulated the JNK and mTOR-ULK1 pathways to reduce both p-tau and total tau levels. Our data suggested that T-006 mitigated cognitive decline primarily by reducing the p-tau and total tau levels in 3xTg mice, supporting further investigation into its development as a candidate drug for AD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Interactions among cellular components forming a mesoscopic scale brain network (microcircuit) display characteristic neural dynamics. Analysis of microcircuits provides a system-level understanding of the neurobiology of health and disease. Causal discovery aims to detect causal relationships among variables based on observational data. A key barrier in causal discovery is the high dimensionality of the variable space. A method called Causal Inference for Microcircuits (CAIM) is proposed to reconstruct causal networks from calcium imaging or electrophysiology time series. CAIM combines neural recording, Bayesian network modeling, and neuron clustering. Validation experiments based on simulated data and a real-world reaching task dataset demonstrated that CAIM accurately revealed causal relationships among neural clusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Electroencephalogram data used in the domain of brain–computer interfaces typically has subpar signal-to-noise ratio and data acquisition is expensive. An effective and commonly used classifier to discriminate event-related potentials is the linear discriminant analysis which, however, requires an estimate of the feature distribution. While this information is provided by the feature covariance matrix its large number of free parameters calls for regularization approaches like Ledoit–Wolf shrinkage. Assuming that the noise of event-related potential recordings is not time-locked, we propose to decouple the time component from the covariance matrix of event-related potential data in order to further improve the estimates of the covariance matrix for linear discriminant analysis. We compare three regularized variants thereof and a feature representation based on Riemannian geometry against our proposed novel linear discriminant analysis with time-decoupled covariance estimates. Extensive evaluations on 14 electroencephalogram datasets reveal, that the novel approach increases the classification performance by up to four percentage points for small training datasets, and gracefully converges to the performance of standard shrinkage-regularized LDA for large training datasets. Given these results, practitioners in this field should consider using our proposed time-decoupled covariance estimation when they apply linear discriminant analysis to classify event-related potentials, especially when few training data points are available.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Rhythms of the brain are generated by neural oscillations across multiple frequencies. These oscillations can be decomposed into distinct frequency intervals associated with specific physiological processes. In practice, the number and ranges of decodable frequency intervals are determined by sampling parameters, often ignored by researchers. To improve the situation, we report on an open toolbox with a graphical user interface for decoding rhythms of the brain system (DREAM). We provide worked examples of DREAM to investigate frequency-specific performance of both neural (spontaneous brain activity) and neurobehavioral (in-scanner head motion) oscillations. DREAM decoded the head motion oscillations and uncovered that younger children moved their heads more than older children across all five frequency intervals whereas boys moved more than girls in the age of 7 to 9 years. It is interesting that the higher frequency bands contain more head movements, and showed stronger age-motion associations but weaker sex-motion interactions. Using data from the Human Connectome Project, DREAM mapped the amplitude of these neural oscillations into multiple frequency bands and evaluated their test-retest reliability. The resting-state brain ranks its spontaneous oscillation’s amplitudes spatially from high in ventral-temporal areas to low in ventral-occipital areas when the frequency band increased from low to high, while those in part of parietal and ventral frontal regions are reversed. The higher frequency bands exhibited more reliable amplitude measurements, implying more inter-individual variability of the amplitudes for the higher frequency bands. In summary, DREAM adds a reliable and valid tool to mapping human brain function from a multiple-frequency window into brain waves.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Brain atrophy quantification plays a fundamental role in neuroinformatics since it permits studying brain development and neurological disorders. However, the lack of a ground truth prevents testing the accuracy of longitudinal atrophy quantification methods. We propose a deep learning framework to generate longitudinal datasets by deforming T1-w brain magnetic resonance imaging scans as requested through segmentation maps. Our proposal incorporates a cascaded multi-path U-Net optimised with a multi-objective loss which allows its paths to generate different brain regions accurately. We provided our model with baseline scans and real follow-up segmentation maps from two longitudinal datasets, ADNI and OASIS, and observed that our framework could produce synthetic follow-up scans that matched the real ones (Total scans= 584; Median absolute error: 0.03 ± 0.02; Structural similarity index: 0.98 ± 0.02; Dice similarity coefficient: 0.95 ± 0.02; Percentage of brain volume change: 0.24 ± 0.16; Jacobian integration: 1.13 ± 0.05). Compared to two relevant works generating brain lesions using U-Nets and conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN), our proposal outperformed them significantly in most cases (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), except in the delineation of brain edges where the CGAN took the lead (Jacobian integration: Ours - 1.13 ± 0.05 vs CGAN - 1.00 ± 0.02; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). We examined whether changes induced with our framework were detected by FAST, SPM, SIENA, SIENAX, and the Jacobian integration method. We observed that induced and detected changes were highly correlated (Adj. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;gt; 0.86).

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Brain atlases have proven to be valuable neuroscience tools for localizing regions of interest and performing statistical inferences on populations. Although many human brain atlases exist, most do not contain information about white matter structures, often neglecting them completely or labelling all white matter as a single homogenous substrate. While few white matter atlases do exist based on diffusion MRI fiber tractography, they are often limited to descriptions of white matter as spatially separate “regions” rather than as white matter “bundles” or fascicles, which are well-known to overlap throughout the brain. Additional limitations include small sample sizes, few white matter pathways, and the use of outdated diffusion models and techniques. Here, we present a new population-based collection of white matter atlases represented in both volumetric and surface coordinates in a standard space. These atlases are based on 2443 subjects, and include 216 white matter bundles derived from 6 different automated state-of-the-art tractography techniques. This atlas is freely available and will be a useful resource for parcellation and segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SPW-R) have been identified as key bio-markers of important brain functions such as memory consolidation and decision making. Understanding their underlying mechanisms in healthy and pathological brain function and behaviour rely on accurate SPW-R detection. In this multidisciplinary study, we propose a novel, self-improving artificial intelligence (AI) detection method in the form of deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term memory (LSTM) layers that can learn features of SPW-R events from raw, labeled input data. The approach contrasts conventional routines that typically relies on hand-crafted, heuristic feature extraction and often laborious manual curation. The algorithm is trained using supervised learning on hand-curated data sets with SPW-R events obtained under controlled conditions. The input to the algorithm is the local field potential (LFP), the low-frequency part of extracellularly recorded electric potentials from the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Its output predictions can be interpreted as time-varying probabilities of SPW-R events for the duration of the inputs. A simple thresholding applied to the output probabilities is found to identify times of SPW-R events with high precision. The non-causal, or bidirectional variant of the proposed algorithm demonstrates consistently better accuracy compared to the causal, or unidirectional counterpart. Reference implementations of the algorithm, named ‘RippleNet’, are open source, freely available, and implemented using a common open-source framework for neural networks (&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis fontcategory-non-proportional&quot;&gt;tensorflow.keras&lt;/span&gt;) and can be easily incorporated into existing data analysis workflows for processing experimental data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Similarity analysis is one of the crucial steps in most fMRI studies. Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) can measure similarities of neural signatures generated by different cognitive states. This paper develops Deep Representational Similarity Learning (DRSL), a deep extension of RSA that is appropriate for analyzing similarities between various cognitive tasks in fMRI datasets with a large number of subjects, and high-dimensionality — such as whole-brain images. Unlike the previous methods, DRSL is not limited by a linear transformation or a restricted fixed nonlinear kernel function — such as Gaussian kernel. DRSL utilizes a multi-layer neural network for mapping neural responses to linear space, where this network can implement a customized nonlinear transformation for each subject separately. Furthermore, utilizing a gradient-based optimization in DRSL can significantly reduce runtime of analysis on large datasets because it uses a batch of samples in each iteration rather than all neural responses to find an optimal solution. Empirical studies on multi-subject fMRI datasets with various tasks — including visual stimuli, decision making, flavor, and working memory — confirm that the proposed method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art RSA algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) occurs when a blood vessel ruptures in the brain. This leads to significant morbidity and mortality, the likelihood of which is predicated on the size of the bleeding event. X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans allow clinicians and researchers to qualitatively and quantitatively diagnose hemorrhagic stroke, guide interventions and determine inclusion criteria of patients in clinical trials. There is no currently available open source, validated tool to quickly segment hemorrhage. Using an automated pipeline and 2D and 3D deep neural networks, we show that we can quickly and accurately estimate ICH volume with high agreement with time-consuming manual segmentation. The training and validation datasets include significant heterogeneity in terms of pathology, such as the presence of intraventricular (IVH) or subdural hemorrhages (SDH) as well as variable image acquisition parameters. We show that deep neural networks trained with an appropriate anatomic context in the network receptive field, can effectively perform ICH segmentation, but those without enough context will overestimate hemorrhage along the skull and around calcifications in the ventricular system. We trained with all data from a multi-center phase II study (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 112) achieving a best mean and median Dice coefficient of 0.914 and 0.919, a volume correlation of 0.979 and an average volume difference of 1.7 ml and root mean squared error of 4.7 ml in 500 out-of-sample scans from the corresponding multi-center phase III study. 3D networks with appropriate anatomic context outperformed both 2D and random forest models. Our results suggest that deep neural network models, when carefully developed can be incorporated into the workflow of an ICH clinical trial series to quickly and accurately segment ICH, estimate total hemorrhage volume and minimize segmentation failures.

This study was to design a deep learning algorithm and evaluate the performance in detecting meningioma lesions and grade classification.

The pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet) was trained to automatically detect and delineate the meningiomas. The results were compared to manual segmentations by evaluating the mean intersection over union (mIoU). The performance of grade classification was evaluated by accuracy. For the automated detection and segmentation of meningiomas, the mean pixel accuracy, tumor accuracy, background accuracy and mIoU were 99.68%, 81.36%, 99.88% and 81.36% for all patients; 99.52%, 84.86%, 99.93% and 84.86% for grade I meningiomas; 99.57%, 80.11%, 99.92% and 80.12% for grade II meningiomas; and 99.75%, 78.40%, 99.99% and 78.40% for grade III meningiomas, respectively. For grade classification, the accuracy values of the training and test datasets were 99.93% and 81.52% for all patients; 99.98% and 98.51% for grade I meningiomas; 99.91% and 66.67% for grade II meningiomas; and 99.88% and 73.91% for grade III meningiomas, respectively. The automated detection, segmentation and grade classification of meningiomas based on deep learning were accurate and reliable and may improve the monitoring and treatment of this frequently occurring tumor entity.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Complex network analysis has an increasing relevance in the study of
neurological disorders, enhancing the knowledge of brain's structural and
functional organization. Network structure and efficiency can reveal different
brain states along with different ways of processing the information. In this
work, complex network analysis was performed on the basis of brain connectivity
obtained from Electroencephalography (EEG) data, while different auditory
stimuli were presented to the subjects. This connectivity is inferred from the
Phase-Amplitude coupling (PAC) from different EEG electrodes, to explore
differences between controls and dyslexic subjects. Connectivity data allows
the construction of a graph, and then, graph theory can be used to study the
characteristics of the complex networks throughout time for controls and
dyslexics. This results in a set of metrics including clustering coefficient,
path length and small-worldness. From this, different characteristics linked to
the temporal evolution of networks and connectivity can be pointed out for
dyslexics. Our study revealed patterns related to Dyslexia as losing the
small-world topology. Finally, these graph-based features are used to classify
between controls and dyslexic subjects by means of a support vector machine.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14612</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A theory of language learning is described, which uses Bayesian induction of
feature structures (scripts) and script functions. Each word sense in a
language is mentally represented by an m-script, a script function which
embodies all the syntax and semantics of the word. M-scripts form a
fully-lexicalised unification grammar, which can support adult language. Each
word m-script can be learnt robustly from about six learning examples. The
theory has been implemented as a computer model, which can bootstrap-learn a
language from zero vocabulary. The Bayesian learning mechanism is (1) Capable:
to learn arbitrarily complex meanings and syntactic structures; (2) Fast:
learning these structures from a few examples each; (3) Robust: learning in the
presence of much irrelevant noise, and (4) Self-repairing: able to acquire
implicit negative evidence, using it to learn exceptions. Children learning
language are clearly all of (1) - (4), whereas connectionist theories fail on
(1) and (2), and symbolic theories fail on (3) and (4). The theory is in good
agreement with many key facts of language acquisition, including facts which
are problematic for other theories. It is compared with over 100 key

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14417</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gradual pattern mining allows for extraction of attribute correlations
through gradual rules such as: &quot;the more X, the more Y&quot;. Such correlations are
useful in identifying and isolating relationships among the attributes that may
not be obvious through quick scans on a data set. For instance, a researcher
may apply gradual pattern mining to determine which attributes of a data set
exhibit unfamiliar correlations in order to isolate them for deeper exploration
or analysis. In this work, we propose an ant colony optimization technique
which uses a popular probabilistic approach that mimics the behavior biological
ants as they search for the shortest path to find food in order to solve
combinatorial problems. In our second contribution, we extend an existing
gradual pattern mining technique to allow for extraction of gradual patterns
together with an approximated temporal lag between the affected gradual item
sets. Such a pattern is referred to as a fuzzy-temporal gradual pattern and it
may take the form: &quot;the more X, the more Y, almost 3 months later&quot;. In our
third contribution, we propose a data crossing model that allows for
integration of mostly gradual pattern mining algorithm implementations into a
Cloud platform. This contribution is motivated by the proliferation of IoT
applications in almost every area of our society and this comes with provision
of large-scale time-series data from different sources.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14406</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has proven to be a highly effective problem-solving tool for
object detection and image segmentation across various domains such as
healthcare and autonomous driving. At the heart of this performance lies neural
architecture design which relies heavily on domain knowledge and prior
experience on the researchers' behalf. More recently, this process of finding
the most optimal architectures, given an initial search space of possible
operations, was automated by Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this paper,
we evaluate the robustness of one such algorithm known as Efficient NAS (ENAS)
against data agnostic poisoning attacks on the original search space with
carefully designed ineffective operations. By evaluating algorithm performance
on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we empirically demonstrate how our novel search space
poisoning (SSP) approach and multiple-instance poisoning attacks exploit design
flaws in the ENAS controller to result in inflated prediction error rates for
child networks. Our results provide insights into the challenges to surmount in
using NAS for more adversarially robust architecture search.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14362</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural interfaces using biocompatible scaffolds provide crucial properties
for the functional repair of nerve injuries and neurodegenerative diseases,
including cell adhesion, structural support, and mass transport. Neural
stimulation has also been found to be effective in promoting neural
regeneration. This work provides a new strategy to integrate photoacoustic (PA)
neural stimulation into hydrogel scaffolds using a nanocomposite hydrogel
approach. Specifically, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-functionalized carbon
nanotubes (CNT), highly efficient photoacoustic agents, are embedded into silk
fibroin to form biocompatible and soft photoacoustic materials. We show that
these photoacoustic functional scaffolds enable non-genetic activation of
neurons with a spatial precision defined by the area of light illumination,
promoting neuron regeneration. These CNT/silk scaffolds offered reliable and
repeatable photoacoustic neural stimulation. 94% of photoacoustic stimulated
neurons exhibit a fluorescence change larger than 10% in calcium imaging in the
light illuminated area. The on-demand photoacoustic stimulation increased
neurite outgrowth by 1.74-fold in a dorsal root ganglion model, when compared
to the unstimulated group. We also confirmed that photoacoustic neural
stimulation promoted neurite outgrowth by impacting the brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway. As a multifunctional neural scaffold,
CNT/silk scaffolds demonstrated non-genetic PA neural stimulation functions and
promoted neurite outgrowth, providing a new method for non-pharmacological
neural regeneration.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14007</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose a wrapper for feature subset selection (FSS) based
on parallel and distributed hybrid evolutionary algorithms viz., parallel
binary differential evolution and threshold accepting (PB-DETA), parallel
binary threshold accepting and differential evolution (PB-TADE) under the
Apache Spark environment. Here, the FSS is formulated as a combinatorial
optimization problem. PB-TADE comprises invoking two optimization algorithms
i.e., TA and BDE in tandem in every iteration, while in PB-DETA, BDE is invoked
first before TA takes over in tandem in every iteration. In addition to these
hybrids, parallel binary differential evolution (P-BDE), is also developed to
investigate the role played by TA and for baseline comparison. For all the
three proposed approaches, logistic regression (LR) is used to compute the
fitness function namely, the area under ROC curve (AUC) score. The
effectiveness of the parallel and distributed wrappers is assessed over five
large datasets of varying feature space dimension pertaining to the cyber
security and biology domains. It is noteworthy that the PB-TADE turned out to
be statistically significant compared to P-BDE and PB-DETA. The speed up is
reported with respect to the sequential version of the three wrappers. Average
AUC score obtained, most repeated feature subsets, feature subsets with least
cardinality having best AUC score are also reported. Further, our proposed
methods outperformed the state-of-the-art results, wherever the results were
reported.

is one of the most significant contributors to renewable energy and is
dependent on solar irradiation. For the effective management of electrical

Linear Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting and Genetic Algorithm Optimization
are used to forecast solar irradiation. The data used for training and

United States that are part of the SURFRAD network. A Global Horizontal Index

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13927</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, with the emergence of numerous novel intelligent
optimization algorithms, many optimization researchers have begun to look for a
basic search mechanism for their schemes that provides a more essential
explanation of their studies. This paper aims to study the basic mechanism of
an algorithm for black-box optimization with quantum theory. To achieve this
goal, the Schroedinger equation is employed to establish the relationship
between the optimization problem and the quantum system, which makes it
possible to study the dynamic search behaviors in the evolution process with
quantum theory. Moreover, to explore the basic behavior of the optimization
system, the optimization problem is assumed to be decomposed and approximated.
Then, a multilevel approximation quantum dynamics model of the optimization
algorithm is established, which provides a mathematical and physical framework
for the analysis of the optimization algorithm. Correspondingly, the basic
search behavior based on this model is derived, which is governed by quantum
theory. Comparison experiments and analysis between different bare-bones
algorithms confirm the existence of the quantum mechanic based basic search
mechanism of the algorithm on black-box optimization.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Continuous-depth neural models, where the derivative of the model's hidden
state is defined by a neural network, have enabled strong sequential data
processing capabilities. However, these models rely on advanced numerical
differential equation (DE) solvers resulting in a significant overhead both in
terms of computational cost and model complexity. In this paper, we present a
new family of models, termed Closed-form Continuous-depth (CfC) networks, that
are simple to describe and at least one order of magnitude faster while
exhibiting equally strong modeling abilities compared to their ODE-based
counterparts. The models are hereby derived from the analytical closed-form
solution of an expressive subset of time-continuous models, thus alleviating
the need for complex DE solvers all together. In our experimental evaluations,
we demonstrate that CfC networks outperform advanced, recurrent models over a
diverse set of time-series prediction tasks, including those with long-term
dependencies and irregularly sampled data. We believe our findings open new
opportunities to train and deploy rich, continuous neural models in
resource-constrained settings, which demand both performance and efficiency.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Polynomial functions have plenty of useful analytical properties, but they
are rarely used as learning models because their function class is considered
to be restricted. This work shows that when trained properly polynomial
functions can be strong learning models. Particularly this work constructs
polynomial feedforward neural networks using the product activation, a new
activation function constructed from multiplications. The new neural network is
a polynomial function and provides accurate control of its polynomial order. It
can be trained by standard training techniques such as batch normalization and
dropout. This new feedforward network covers several previous polynomial models
as special cases. Compared with common feedforward neural networks, the
polynomial feedforward network has closed-form calculations of a few
interesting quantities, which are very useful in Bayesian learning. In a series
of regression and classification tasks in the empirical study, the proposed
model outperforms previous polynomial models.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper develops a Bayesian mechanics for adaptive systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we model the interface between a system and its environment with a
Markov blanket. This affords conditions under which states internal to the
blanket encode information about external states.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we introduce dynamics and represent adaptive systems as Markov
blankets at steady-state. This allows us to identify a wide class of systems
whose internal states appear to infer external states, consistent with
variational inference in Bayesian statistics and theoretical neuroscience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we partition the blanket into sensory and active states. It follows
that active states can be seen as performing active inference and well-known
forms of stochastic control (such as PID control), which are prominent
formulations of adaptive behaviour in theoretical biology and engineering.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zinc and copper are important trace elements necessary for the proper functioning of neurons. Impaired zinc and/or copper metabolism and signaling are implicated in many brain diseases, including autism (ASD). In our studies, autistic-like behavior in rat offsprings was induced by application to pregnant mothers valproic acid or thalidomide. Zinc and copper contents were measured in serum and brain structures: hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. Our research shows no interconnections in the particular metal concentrations measured in autistic animal brains and their sera. Based on patient researches, we studied 26 genes belonging to disturbed neurotransmitter pathways. In the same brain regions, we examined the expression of genes encoding proteins of cholinergic, adrenergic, serotonin, and dopamine receptors. In both rats’ ASD models, 17 out of the tested gene expression were decreased. In the cerebellum and cerebral cortex, expression of genes encoding cholinergic, adrenergic, and dopaminergic receptors decreased, whereas in the hippocampus only expression of serotoninergic receptors genes was downregulated. The changes in metals content observed in the rat brain can be secondary phenomena, perhaps elements of mechanisms that compensate for neurotransmission dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: How Self-Appraisal Is Mediated by the Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.700046</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Self-appraisal is a process that leads to the formation of self-esteem, which contributes to subjective well-being and mental health. Neuroimaging studies link self-esteem with the activity of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), anterior insula (AIns), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It is not known, however, how the process of self-appraisal itself is mediated by the brain and how different nodes of the self-appraisal network interact with each other. In this study, we used multilevel mediation analysis of functional MRI data recorded during the trait adjective judgment task, treating the emotional valence of adjectives as the predictor, behavioral response as the dependent variable, and brain activity as the mediator. The mediation effect was revealed in the rTPJ. Dynamic causal modeling showed that positive self-descriptions trigger communication within the network, with the rTPJ exerting the strongest excitatory output and MPFC receiving the strongest excitatory input. rAIns receives the strongest inhibitory input and sends exclusively inhibitory connections to other regions pointing out to its role in the processing of negative self-descriptions. Analysis of individual differences showed that in some individuals, self-appraisal is mostly driven by the endorsement of positive self-descriptions and is accompanied by increased activation and communication between rTPJ, MPFC, and PCC. In others, self-appraisal is driven by the rejection of negative self-descriptions and is accompanied by increased activation of rAIns and inhibition of PCC and MPFC. Membership of these groups was predicted by different personality variables. This evidence uncovers different mechanisms of positive self-bias, which may contribute to different facets of self-esteem and are associated with different personality profiles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Action video gaming (AVG) places sustained cognitive load on various behavioral systems, thus offering new insights into learning-related neural plasticity. This study aims to determine whether AVG experience is associated with resting-state electroencephalogram (rs-EEG) temporal and spatial complexity, and if so, whether this effect is observable across AVG subgenres. Two AVG games – League of Legends (LOL) and Player Unknown’s Battle Grounds (PUBG) that represent two major AVG subgenres – were examined. We compared rs-EEG microstate and omega complexity between LOL experts and non-experts (Experiment 1) and between PUBG experts and non-experts (Experiment 2). We found that the experts and non-experts had different rs-EEG activities in both experiments, thus revealing the adaptive effect of AVG experience on brain development. Furthermore, we also found certain subgenre-specific complexity changes, supporting the recent proposal that AVG should be categorized based on the gaming mechanics of a specific game rather than a generic genre designation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.701673</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the brain’s immunocompetent macrophages with a unique feature that allows surveillance of the surrounding microenvironment and subsequent reactions to tissue damage, infection, or homeostatic perturbations. Thereby, microglia’s striking morphological plasticity is one of their prominent characteristics and the categorization of microglial cell function based on morphology is well established. Frequently, automated classification of microglial morphological phenotypes is performed by using quantitative parameters. As this process is typically limited to a few and especially manually chosen criteria, a relevant selection bias may compromise the resulting classifications. In our study, we describe a novel microglial classification method by morphological evaluation using a convolutional neuronal network on the basis of manually selected cells in addition to classical morphological parameters. We focused on four microglial morphologies, ramified, rod-like, activated and amoeboid microglia within the murine hippocampus and cortex. The developed method for the classification was confirmed in a mouse model of ischemic stroke which is already known to result in microglial activation within affected brain regions. In conclusion, our classification of microglial morphological phenotypes using machine learning can serve as a time-saving and objective method for post-mortem characterization of microglial changes in healthy and disease mouse models, and might also represent a useful tool for human brain autopsy samples.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Evolutionary Modifications Are Moderate in the Astroglial System of Actinopterygii as Revealed by GFAP Immunohistochemistry</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.698459</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present paper is the first comparative study on the astroglia of several actinopterygian species at different phylogenetical positions, teleosts (16 species), and non-teleosts (3 species), based on the immunohistochemical staining of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), the characteristic cytoskeletal intermediary filament protein, and immunohistochemical marker of astroglia. The question was, how the astroglial architecture reflexes the high diversity of this largest vertebrate group. The actinopterygian telencephalon has a so-called ‘eversive’ development in contrast to the ‘evagination’ found in sarcopterygii (including tetrapods). Several brain parts either have no equivalents in tetrapod vertebrates (e.g., torus longitudinalis, lobus inferior, lobus nervi vagi), or have rather different shapes (e.g., the cerebellum). GFAP was visualized applying DAKO polyclonal anti-GFAP serum. The study was focused mainly on the telencephalon (eversion), tectum (visual orientation), and cerebellum (motor coordination) where the evolutionary changes were most expected, but the other areas were also investigated. The predominant astroglial elements were tanycytes (long, thin, fiber-like cells). In the teleost telencephala a ‘fan-shape’ re-arrangement of radial glia reflects the eversion. In bichir, starlet, and gar, in which the eversion is less pronounced, the ‘fan-shape’ re-arrangement did not form. In the tectum the radial glial processes were immunostained, but in Ostariophysi and Euteleostei it did not extend into their deep segments. In the cerebellum Bergmann-like glia was found in each group, including non-teleosts, except for Cyprinidae. The vagal lobe was uniquely enlarged and layered in Cyprininae, and had a corresponding layered astroglial system, which left almost free of GFAP the zones of sensory and motor neurons. In conclusion, despite the diversity and evolutionary alterations of Actinopterygii brains, the diversity of the astroglial architecture is moderate. In contrast to Chondrichthyes and Amniotes; in Actinopterygii true astrocytes (stellate-shaped extraependymal cells) did not appear during evolution, and the expansion of GFAP-free areas was limited.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Validating Habitual and Goal-Directed Decision-Making Performance Online in Healthy Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.702810</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Everyday decision-making is supported by a dual-system of control comprised of parallel goal-directed and habitual systems. Over the past decade, the two-stage Markov decision task has become popularized for its ability to dissociate between goal-directed and habitual decision-making. While a handful of studies have implemented decision-making tasks online, only one study has validated the task by comparing in-person and web-based performance on the two-stage task in children and young adults. To date, no study has validated the dissociation of goal-directed and habitual behaviors in older adults online. Here, we implemented and validated a web-based version of the two-stage Markov task using parameter simulation and recovery and compared behavioral results from online and in-person participation on the two-stage task in both young and healthy older adults. We found no differences in estimated free parameters between online and in-person participation on the two-stage task. Further, we replicate previous findings that young adults are more goal-directed than older adults both in-person and online. Overall, this work demonstrates that the implementation and use of the two-stage Markov decision task for remote participation is feasible in the older adult demographic, which would allow for the study of decision-making with larger and more diverse samples.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;The aim of the present study was to investigate the outcome of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;Patients and Methods&lt;p&gt;In a multicenter, observational, 1:2 matched case-control study all 23 patients with a history of dementia, hospitalized with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 28th 2020 to January 31st 2021 were enrolled. For each Case, 2 patients without dementia observed in the same period study, pair matched for gender, age (±5 years), PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/FiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (P/F) ratio at admission (&amp;lt;200, or &amp;gt;200), number of comorbidities (±1; excluding dementia) were chosen (Control group).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The majority of patients were males (60.9% of Cases and Controls) and very elderly [median age 82 years (IQR: 75.5–85) in the Cases and 80 (IQR: 75.5–83.75) in the Controls]. The prevalence of co-pathologies was very high: all the Cases and 43 (93.5%) Controls showed a Charlson comorbidity index of at least 2. During hospitalization the patients in the Case group less frequently had a moderate disease of COVID-19 (35 vs. 67.4%, p = 0.02), more frequently a severe disease (48 vs. 22%, p = 0.03) and more frequently died (48 vs. 22%, p = 0.03). Moreover, during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 14 (60.8%) patients in the Case group and 1 (2.1%; p &amp;lt; 0.000) in the Control group showed signs and symptoms of delirium.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Patients with dementia are vulnerable and have an increased risk of a severe disease and death when infected with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Sixty-nine AD patients were randomized to either rTMS or sham treatment (five sessions/week for a total of 10 sessions). The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), 12-Word Philadelphia Verbal Learning Test (PVLT), and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) were assessed at baseline and after the last session.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;After a 2-week treatment, compared to patients in the sham group, those in the rTMS group scored significantly higher on PVLT total score and its immediate recall subscale score. Moreover, in the rTMS group, there were significant improvements after the 2-week treatment, which were manifested in MMSE total score and its time orientation and recall subscale scores, as well as PVLT total score and its immediate recall and short delay recall subscale scores. In the sham group, the PVLT total score was significantly improved.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The target site of the left parietal cortex can improve AD patients’ cognitive function, especially memory, providing a potential therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Network Modeling Sex Differences in Brain Integrity and Metabolic Health</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.691691</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis-driven studies have demonstrated that sex moderates many of the relationships between brain health and cardiometabolic disease, which impacts risk for later-life cognitive decline. In the present study, we sought to further our understanding of the associations between multiple markers of brain integrity and cardiovascular risk in a midlife sample of 266 individuals by using network analysis, a technique specifically designed to examine complex associations among multiple systems at once. Separate network models were constructed for male and female participants to investigate sex differences in the biomarkers of interest, selected based on evidence linking them with risk for late-life cognitive decline: all components of metabolic syndrome (obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia); neuroimaging-derived brain-predicted age minus chronological age; ratio of white matter hyperintensities to whole brain volume; seed-based resting state functional connectivity in the Default Mode Network, and ratios of N-acetyl aspartate, glutamate and myo-inositol to creatine, measured through proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Males had a sparse network (87.2% edges = 0) relative to females (69.2% edges = 0), indicating fewer relationships between measures of cardiometabolic risk and brain integrity. The edges in the female network provide meaningful information about potential mechanisms between brain integrity and cardiometabolic health. Additionally, Apolipoprotein ϵ4 (ApoE ϵ4) status and waist circumference emerged as central nodes in the female model. Our study demonstrates that network analysis is a promising technique for examining relationships between risk factors for cognitive decline in a midlife population and that investigating sex differences may help optimize risk prediction and tailor individualized treatments in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Benefits of Higher Cardiovascular and Motor Coordinative Fitness on Driving Behavior Are Mediated by Cognitive Functioning: A Path Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.686499</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Driving is an important skill for older adults to maintain an independent lifestyle, and to preserve the quality of life. However, the ability to drive safely in older adults can be compromised by age-related cognitive decline. Performing an additional task during driving (e.g., adjusting the radio) increases cognitive demands and thus might additionally impair driving performance. Cognitive functioning has been shown to be positively related to physical activity/fitness such as cardiovascular and motor coordinative fitness. As such, a higher fitness level might be associated with higher cognitive resources and may therefore benefit driving performance under dual-task conditions. For the first time, the present study investigated whether this association of physical fitness and cognitive functioning causes an indirect relationship between physical fitness and dual-task driving performance through cognitive functions. Data from 120 healthy older adults (age: 69.56 ± 3.62, 53 female) were analyzed. Participants completed tests on cardiovascular fitness (cardiorespiratory capacity), motor coordinative fitness (composite score: static balance, psychomotor speed, bimanual dexterity), and cognitive functions (updating, inhibition, shifting, cognitive processing speed). Further, they performed a virtual car driving scenario where they additionally engaged in cognitively demanding tasks that were modeled after typical real-life activities during driving (typing or reasoning). Structural equation modeling (path analysis) was used to investigate whether cardiovascular and motor coordinative fitness were indirectly associated with lane keeping (i.e., variability in lateral position) and speed control (i.e., average velocity) while dual-task driving via cognitive functions. Both cardiovascular and motor coordinative fitness demonstrated the hypothesized indirect effects on dual-task driving. Motor coordinative fitness showed a significant indirect effect on lane keeping, while cardiovascular fitness demonstrated a trend-level indirect effect on speed control. Moreover, both fitness domains were positively related to different cognitive functions (processing speed and/or updating), and cognitive functions (updating or inhibition), in turn, were related to dual-task driving. These findings indicate that cognitive benefits associated with higher fitness may facilitate driving performance. Given that driving with lower cognitive capacity can result in serious consequences, this study emphasizes the importance for older adults to engage in a physically active lifestyle as it might serve as a preventive measure for driving safety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate retinal microvascular features in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for published articles comparing retinal microvascular characteristics in subjects with AD and controls. The mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess continuous variables. Review Manager Version (RevMan) 5.30, was employed to analyze the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. The analysis revealed that the macular whole enface superficial and deep vessel density (VD) values measured by OCTA were significantly lower in patients with AD than in controls (MD = −1.10, P &amp;lt; 0.0001; MD = −1.61, P = 0.0001, respectively). The value measured by OCTA for parafoveal superficial VD in patients with AD was also remarkably lower than that in the control group (MD = −1.42, P = 0.001), whereas there was no significant difference in the value for parafoveal deep VD (MD = −3.67, P = 0.19), compared to the controls. In addition, the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) was larger in patients with AD than in the control group (MD = 0.08, P = 0.07), although it did not reach statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The present meta-analysis indicated that the macular whole enface and parafoveal vessel densities were reduced in patients with AD. Moreover, our pooled data revealed that FAZ is larger in patients with AD. Consequently, OCTA may be utilized as a diagnostic tool to identify and monitor patients with AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Time Course and Clinical Relevance of Neurological Deterioration After Endovascular Recanalization Therapy for Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.651614</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurological deterioration (ND) is a devastating complication for patients with ischemic stroke after endovascular recanalization therapy (EVT). We aimed to investigate the time course and clinical relevance of ND after EVT. Consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent EVT for large arterial occlusions of the anterior cerebral circulation were enrolled. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores were assessed before EVT, at the end of EVT, at 24 h (d1), on day 3 (d3), on day 15 (d15), at discharge and anytime when ND was indicated. ND was defined as an increase of ≥ 4 points in the NIHSS score and was divided into acute ND (AD, within 24 h), subacute ND (SD, d1–d3), and delayed ND (DD, d3–d15 or discharge). Using multivariable logistic regression analysis, we explored predictors and outcomes of ND at different time periods. As a result, of 343 patients, 129 (37.6%) experienced ND, including 90 (26.2%) with AD, 27 (7.9%) with SD and 12 (3.5%) with DD. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that history of hypertension, cardioembolic stroke, lower Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS), and poor collaterals were significantly associated with an increased risk of AD; history of hypertension, lower ASPECTS, poor collaterals, and unsuccessful recanalization, with SD; and high admission NIHSS score, with DD. In addition, patients who experienced AD (OR = 10.22, P &amp;lt; 0.001), SD (OR = 15.89, P = 0.004), or DD (OR = 8.31, P = 0.015) were more likely to have poor outcomes. ND was a strong predictor of poor stroke outcomes. Management of related risk factors at different ND time periods might improve the prognosis of EVT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Molecular signatures of silencing suppression degeneracy from a complex RNA virus</title>

As genomic architectures become more complex, they begin to accumulate degenerate and redundant elements. However, analyses of the molecular mechanisms underlying these genetic architecture features remain scarce, especially in compact but sufficiently complex genomes. In the present study, we followed a proteomic approach together with a computational network analysis to reveal molecular signatures of protein function degeneracy from a plant virus (as virus-host protein-protein interactions). We employed affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry to detect several host factors interacting with two proteins of &lt;i&gt;Citrus tristeza virus&lt;/i&gt; (p20 and p25) that are known to function as RNA silencing suppressors, using an experimental system of transient expression in a model plant. The study was expanded by considering two different isolates of the virus, and some key interactions were confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. We found that p20 and p25 target a common set of plant proteins including chloroplastic proteins and translation factors. Moreover, we noted that even specific targets of each viral protein overlap in function. Notably, we identified argonaute proteins (key players in RNA silencing) as reliable targets of p20. Furthermore, we found that these viral proteins preferentially do not target hubs in the host protein interactome, but elements that can transfer information by bridging different parts of the interactome. Overall, our results demonstrate that two distinct proteins encoded in the same viral genome that overlap in function also overlap in their interactions with the cell proteome, thereby highlighting an overlooked connection from a degenerate viral system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DmgBonblARI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Regulating synchronous oscillations of cerebellar granule cells by different types of inhibition</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/mUWR-zZDQ7Q/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Yuanhong Tang, Lingling An, Quan Wang, Jian K. Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Synchronous oscillations in neural populations are considered being controlled by inhibitory neurons. In the granular layer of the cerebellum, two major types of cells are excitatory granular cells (GCs) and inhibitory Golgi cells (GoCs). GC spatiotemporal dynamics, as the output of the granular layer, is highly regulated by GoCs. However, there are various types of inhibition implemented by GoCs. With inputs from mossy fibers, GCs and GoCs are reciprocally connected to exhibit different network motifs of synaptic connections. From the view of GCs, feedforward inhibition is expressed as the direct input from GoCs excited by mossy fibers, whereas feedback inhibition is from GoCs via GCs themselves. In addition, there are abundant gap junctions between GoCs showing another form of inhibition. It remains unclear how these diverse copies of inhibition regulate neural population oscillation changes. Leveraging a computational model of the granular layer network, we addressed this question to examine the emergence and modulation of network oscillation using different types of inhibition. We show that at the network level, feedback inhibition is crucial to generate neural oscillation. When short-term plasticity was equipped on GoC-GC synapses, oscillations were largely diminished. Robust oscillations can only appear with additional gap junctions. Moreover, there was a substantial level of cross-frequency coupling in oscillation dynamics. Such a coupling was adjusted and strengthened by GoCs through feedback inhibition. Taken together, our results suggest that the cooperation of distinct types of GoC inhibition plays an essential role in regulating synchronous oscillations of the GC population. With GCs as the sole output of the granular network, their oscillation dynamics could potentially enhance the computational capability of downstream neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mUWR-zZDQ7Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The white matter contains long-range connections between different brain regions and the organization of these connections holds important implications for brain function in health and disease. Tractometry uses diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to quantify tissue properties along the trajectories of these connections. Statistical inference from tractometry usually either averages these quantities along the length of each fiber bundle or computes regression models separately for each point along every one of the bundles. These approaches are limited in their sensitivity, in the former case, or in their statistical power, in the latter. We developed a method based on the sparse group lasso (SGL) that takes into account tissue properties along all of the bundles and selects informative features by enforcing both global and bundle-level sparsity. We demonstrate the performance of the method in two settings: i) in a classification setting, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are accurately distinguished from matched controls. Furthermore, SGL identifies the corticospinal tract as important for this classification, correctly finding the parts of the white matter known to be affected by the disease. ii) In a regression setting, SGL accurately predicts “brain age.” In this case, the weights are distributed throughout the white matter indicating that many different regions of the white matter change over the lifespan. Thus, SGL leverages the multivariate relationships between diffusion properties in multiple bundles to make accurate phenotypic predictions while simultaneously discovering the most relevant features of the white matter.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rIbdV9_I_VM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cancer is the result of mutagenic processes that can be inferred from tumor genomes by analyzing rate spectra of point mutations, or “mutational signatures”. Here we present SparseSignatures, a novel framework to extract signatures from somatic point mutation data. Our approach incorporates a user-specified background signature, employs regularization to reduce noise in non-background signatures, uses cross-validation to identify the number of signatures, and is scalable to large datasets. We show that SparseSignatures outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on simulated data using a variety of standard metrics. We then apply SparseSignatures to whole genome sequences of pancreatic and breast tumors, discovering well-differentiated signatures that are linked to known mutagenic mechanisms and are strongly associated with patient clinical features.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CyAiWRPg3_k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Angiogenesis is the process by which blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels. It plays a key role in many biological processes, including embryonic development and wound healing, and contributes to many diseases including cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. The structure of the resulting vessel networks determines their ability to deliver nutrients and remove waste products from biological tissues. Here we simulate the Anderson-Chaplain model of angiogenesis at different parameter values and quantify the vessel architectures of the resulting synthetic data. Specifically, we propose a topological data analysis (TDA) pipeline for systematic analysis of the model. TDA is a vibrant and relatively new field of computational mathematics for studying the shape of data. We compute topological and standard descriptors of model simulations generated by different parameter values. We show that TDA of model simulation data stratifies parameter space into regions with similar vessel morphology. The methodologies proposed here are widely applicable to other synthetic and experimental data including wound healing, development, and plant biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yhP3eEOYSho&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In most animals, natural stimuli are characterized by a high degree of redundancy, limiting the ensemble of ecologically valid stimuli to a significantly reduced subspace of the representation space. Neural encodings can exploit this redundancy and increase sensing efficiency by generating low-dimensional representations that retain all information essential to support behavior. In this study, we investigate whether such an efficient encoding can be found to support a broad range of echolocation tasks in bats. Starting from an ensemble of echo signals collected with a biomimetic sonar system in natural indoor and outdoor environments, we use independent component analysis to derive a low-dimensional encoding of the output of a cochlear model. We show that this compressive encoding retains all essential information. To this end, we simulate a range of psycho-acoustic experiments with bats. In these simulations, we train a set of neural networks to use the encoded echoes as input while performing the experiments. The results show that the neural networks’ performance is at least as good as that of the bats. We conclude that our results indicate that efficient encoding of echo information is feasible and, given its many advantages, very likely to be employed by bats. Previous studies have demonstrated that low-dimensional encodings allow for task resolution at a relatively high level. In contrast to previous work in this area, we show that high performance can also be achieved when low-dimensional filters are derived from a data set of realistic echo signals, not tailored to specific experimental conditions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WPbUhUfiA7g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The brain exhibits capabilities of fast incremental learning from few noisy examples, as well as the ability to associate similar memories in autonomously-created categories and to combine contextual hints with sensory perceptions. Together with sleep, these mechanisms are thought to be key components of many high-level cognitive functions. Yet, little is known about the underlying processes and the specific roles of different brain states. In this work, we exploited the combination of context and perception in a thalamo-cortical model based on a soft winner-take-all circuit of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons. After calibrating this model to express awake and deep-sleep states with features comparable with biological measures, we demonstrate the model capability of fast incremental learning from few examples, its resilience when proposed with noisy perceptions and contextual signals, and an improvement in visual classification after sleep due to induced synaptic homeostasis and association of similar memories.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KEA-y1Hdr-s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: How public reaction to disease information across scales and the impacts of vector control methods influence disease prevalence and control efficacy</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jing Jiao, Gonzalo P. Suarez, Nina H. Fefferman&lt;/p&gt;

With the development of social media, the information about vector-borne disease incidence over broad spatial scales can cause demand for local vector control before local risk exists. Anticipatory intervention may still benefit local disease control efforts; however, infection risks are not the only focal concerns governing public demand for vector control. Concern for environmental contamination from pesticides and economic limitations on the frequency and magnitude of control measures also play key roles. Further, public concern may be focused more on ecological factors (i.e., controlling mosquito populations) or on epidemiological factors (i.e., controlling infection-carrying mosquitoes), which may lead to very different control outcomes. Here we introduced a generic Ross-MacDonald model, incorporating these factors under three spatial scales of disease information: local, regional, and global. We tailored and parameterized the model for Zika virus transmitted by &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquito. We found that sensitive reactivity caused by larger-scale incidence information could decrease average human infections per patch breeding capacity, however, the associated increase in total control effort plays a larger role, which leads to an overall decrease in control efficacy. The shift of focal concerns from epidemiological to ecological risk could relax the negative effect of the sensitive reactivity on control efficacy when mosquito breeding capacity populations are expected to be large. This work demonstrates that, depending on expected total mosquito breeding capacity population size, and weights of different focal concerns, large-scale disease information can reduce disease infections without lowering control efficacy. Our findings provide guidance for vector-control strategies by considering public reaction through social media.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bOqhziw6mu8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Proteins of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I), predominantly known for antigen presentation in the immune system, have recently been shown to be necessary for developmental neural refinement and adult synaptic plasticity. However, their roles in nonneuronal cell populations in the brain remain largely unexplored. Here, we identify classical MHC I molecule H2-K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; as a negative regulator of proliferation in neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Using genetic knockout mouse models and in vivo viral-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression, we delineate a role for H2-K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; in negatively regulating NSPC proliferation and adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Transcriptomic analysis of H2-K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; knockout NSPCs, in combination with in vitro RNAi, overexpression, and pharmacological approaches, further revealed that H2-K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; inhibits cell proliferation by dampening signaling pathways downstream of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1). These findings identify H2-K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; as a critical regulator of cell proliferation through the modulation of growth factor signaling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Gcex-ADRIZs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Previous History of Migraine is associated with Fatigue, but not Headache, as Long-Term Post-COVID Symptom after SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Case- Control Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.678472</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate the association of pre-existing migraine in patients hospitalised and who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection with the presence of post-COVID symptoms. Background: No study has investigated the role of migraine as a risk factor for development of post-COVID symptoms. Methods: A case-control study including individuals hospitalised during the first wave of the pandemic (from February 20 to May 31, 2020) was conducted. Patients with confirmed previous diagnosis of migraine were considered cases. Two age- and sex-matched individuals without a history of headache per case were also recruited as controls. Hospitalisation/clinical data were collected from hospital medical records. Patients were scheduled for a telephone interview. A list of post-COVID symptoms was systematically evaluated, but participants were invited to freely report any symptom. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used to assess anxiety/depressive symptoms and sleep quality. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were constructed. Results: Overall, 57 patients with confirmed diagnosis of migraine and 144 non-migraine controls who had recovered from COVID-19 were assessed at 7.3 months (SD 0.6) after hospital discharge. The number of post-COVID symptoms in the migraine group was significantly greater (OR 1.70 95%CI 1.29-2.25, P&amp;lt;0.001) than in the non-migraine group. Fatigue was significantly more prevalent (OR 2.89 95%CI 1.32-6.32, P=0.008) in the migraine group. However, no between-groups difference in the prevalence of headache as a post-COVID symptom was detected. Conclusions: Patients with a history of migraine who recovered from COVID-19 exhibited more long-term fatigue as post-COVID sequelae than those without migraine. Some of the pathophysiological changes associated with migraine could predispose to the occurrence of post-COVID symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

learning frameworks. As a first proof of concept, we propose a genetic
algorithm to simultaneously learn the structure of argumentative classification
models. To obtain a well interpretable model, the fitness function balances
sparseness and accuracy of the classifier. We discuss our algorithm and present
first experimental results on standard benchmarks from the UCI machine learning
repository. Our prototype learns argumentative classification models that are
comparable to decision trees in terms of learning performance and

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Navigation to multiple cued reward locations has been increasingly used to
study rodent learning. Though deep reinforcement learning agents have been
shown to be able to learn the task, they are not biologically plausible.
Biologically plausible classic actor-critic agents have been shown to learn to
navigate to single reward locations, but which biologically plausible agents
are able to learn multiple cue-reward location tasks has remained unclear. In
this computational study, we show versions of classic agents that learn to
navigate to a single reward location, and adapt to reward location
displacement, but are not able to learn multiple paired association navigation.
The limitation is overcome by an agent in which place cell and cue information
are first processed by a feedforward nonlinear hidden layer with synapses to
the actor and critic subject to temporal difference error-modulated plasticity.
Faster learning is obtained when the feedforward layer is replaced by a
recurrent reservoir network.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13249</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When inferring the goals that others are trying to achieve, people
intuitively understand that others might make mistakes along the way. This is
crucial for activities such as teaching, offering assistance, and deciding
between blame or forgiveness. However, Bayesian models of theory of mind have
generally not accounted for these mistakes, instead modeling agents as mostly
optimal in achieving their goals. As a result, they are unable to explain
phenomena like locking oneself out of one's house, or losing a game of chess.
Here, we extend the Bayesian Theory of Mind framework to model boundedly
rational agents who may have mistaken goals, plans, and actions. We formalize
this by modeling agents as probabilistic programs, where goals may be confused
with semantically similar states, plans may be misguided due to
resource-bounded planning, and actions may be unintended due to execution
errors. We present experiments eliciting human goal inferences in two domains:
(i) a gridworld puzzle with gems locked behind doors, and (ii) a block-stacking
domain. Our model better explains human inferences than alternatives, while
generalizing across domains. These findings indicate the importance of modeling
others as bounded agents, in order to account for the full richness of human
intuitive psychology.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Effects of VLSI Circuit Constraints on Temporal-Coding Multilayer Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:2106.10382v2 [cs.AR] CROSS LISTED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10382</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The spiking neural network (SNN) has been attracting considerable attention
not only as a mathematical model for the brain, but also as an energy-efficient
information processing model for real-world applications. In particular, SNNs
based on temporal coding are expected to be much more efficient than those
based on rate coding, because the former requires substantially fewer spikes to
carry out tasks. As SNNs are continuous-state and continuous-time models, it is
favorable to implement them with analog VLSI circuits. However, the
construction of the entire system with continuous-time analog circuits would be
infeasible when the system size is very large. Therefore, mixed-signal circuits
must be employed, and the time discretization and quantization of the synaptic
weights are necessary. Moreover, the analog VLSI implementation of SNNs
exhibits non-idealities, such as the effects of noise and device mismatches, as
well as other constraints arising from the analog circuit operation. In this
study, we investigated the effects of the time discretization and/or weight
quantization on the performance of SNNs. Furthermore, we elucidated the effects
the lower bound of the membrane potentials and the temporal fluctuation of the
firing threshold. Finally, we propose an optimal approach for the mapping of
mathematical SNN models to analog circuits with discretized time.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Boolean learning under noise-perturbations in hardware neural networks. (arXiv:2003.12319v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12319</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A high efficiency hardware integration of neural networks benefits from
realizing nonlinearity, network connectivity and learning fully in a physical
substrate. Multiple systems have recently implemented some or all of these
operations, yet the focus was placed on addressing technological challenges.
Fundamental questions regarding learning in hardware neural networks remain
largely unexplored. Noise in particular is unavoidable in such architectures,
and here we investigate its interaction with a learning algorithm using an
opto-electronic recurrent neural network. We find that noise strongly modifies
the system's path during convergence, and surprisingly fully decorrelates the
final readout weight matrices. This highlights the importance of understanding
architecture, noise and learning algorithm as interacting players, and
therefore identifies the need for mathematical tools for noisy, analogue system
optimization.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Bifurcation Spiking Neural Network. (arXiv:1909.08341v3 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08341</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks (SNNs) has attracted much attention due to its great
potential of modeling time-dependent signals. The firing rate of spiking
neurons is decided by control rate which is fixed manually in advance, and
thus, whether the firing rate is adequate for modeling actual time series
relies on fortune. Though it is demanded to have an adaptive control rate, it
is a non-trivial task because the control rate and the connection weights
learned during the training process are usually entangled. In this paper, we
show that the firing rate is related to the eigenvalue of the spike generation
function. Inspired by this insight, by enabling the spike generation function
to have adaptable eigenvalues rather than parametric control rates, we develop
the Bifurcation Spiking Neural Network (BSNN), which has an adaptive firing
rate and is insensitive to the setting of control rates. Experiments validate
the effectiveness of BSNN on a broad range of tasks, showing that BSNN achieves
superior performance to existing SNNs and is robust to the setting of control
rates.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Sucrose Consumption Alters Serotonin/Glutamate Co-localisation Within the Prefrontal Cortex and Hippocampus of Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.678267</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The overconsumption of sugar-sweetened food and beverages underpins the current rise in obesity rates. Sugar overconsumption induces maladaptive neuroplasticity to decrease dietary control. Although serotonin and glutamate co-localisation has been implicated in reward processing, it is still unknown how chronic sucrose consumption changes this transmission in regions associated with executive control over feeding—such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. To address this, a total of 16 C57Bl6 mice received either 5% w/v sucrose or water as a control for 12 weeks using the Drinking-In-The-Dark paradigm (n = 8 mice per group). We then examined the effects of chronic sucrose consumption on the immunological distribution of serotonin (5-HT), vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3) and 5-HT&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/VGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; co-localised axonal varicosities. Sucrose consumption over 12 weeks decreased the number of 5-HT&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;/VGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and 5-HT&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/VGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; varicosities within the PFC and DG. The number of 5-HT&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/VGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; varicosities remained unchanged within the PFC but decreased in the DG following sucrose consumption. Given that serotonin mediates DG neurogenesis through microglial migration, the number of microglia within the DG was also assessed in both experimental groups. Sucrose consumption decreased the number of DG microglia. Although the DG and PFC are associated with executive control over rewarding activities and emotional memory formation, we did not detect a subsequent change in DG neurogenesis or anxiety-like behaviour or depressive-like behaviour. Overall, these findings suggest that the chronic consumption of sugar alters serotonergic neuroplasticity within neural circuits responsible for feeding control. Although these alterations alone were not sufficient to induce changes in neurogenesis or behaviour, it is proposed that the sucrose consumption may predispose individuals to these cognitive deficits which ultimately promote further sugar intake.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The tweety Gene Family: From Embryo to Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.672511</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The tweety genes encode gated chloride channels that are found in animals, plants, and even simple eukaryotes, signifying their deep evolutionary origin. In vertebrates, the tweety gene family is highly conserved and consists of three members—ttyh1, ttyh2, and ttyh3—that are important for the regulation of cell volume. While research has elucidated potential physiological functions of ttyh1 in neural stem cell maintenance, proliferation, and filopodia formation during neural development, the roles of ttyh2 and ttyh3 are less characterized, though their expression patterns during embryonic and fetal development suggest potential roles in the development of a wide range of tissues including a role in the immune system in response to pathogen-associated molecules. Additionally, members of the tweety gene family have been implicated in various pathologies including cancers, particularly pediatric brain tumors, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Here, we review the current state of research using information from published articles and open-source databases on the tweety gene family with regard to its structure, evolution, expression during development and adulthood, biochemical and cellular functions, and role in human disease. We also identify promising areas for further research to advance our understanding of this important, yet still understudied, family of genes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: High-Resolution EEG Source Localization in Segmentation-Free Head Models Based on Finite-Difference Method and Matching Pursuit Algorithm</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.695668</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a method to monitor electrophysiological activity on the scalp, which represents the macroscopic activity of the brain. However, it is challenging to identify EEG source regions inside the brain based on data measured by a scalp-attached network of electrodes. The accuracy of EEG source localization significantly depends on the type of head modeling and inverse problem solver. In this study, we adopted different models with a resolution of 0.5 mm to account for thin tissues/fluids, such as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and dura. In particular, a spatially dependent conductivity (segmentation-free) model created using deep learning was developed and used for more realist representation of electrical conductivity. We then adopted a multi-grid-based finite-difference method (FDM) for forward problem analysis and a sparse-based algorithm to solve the inverse problem. This enabled us to perform efficient source localization using high-resolution model with a reasonable computational cost. Results indicated that the abrupt spatial change in conductivity, inherent in conventional segmentation-based head models, may trigger source localization error accumulation. The accurate modeling of the CSF, whose conductivity is the highest in the head, was an important factor affecting localization accuracy. Moreover, computational experiments with different noise levels and electrode setups demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method with segmentation-free head model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Identification of Electroencephalogram Signals in Alzheimer's Disease by Multifractal and Multiscale Entropy Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.667614</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that primarily develops in old age. In recent years, it has been reported that early diagnosis of AD and early intervention significantly delays disease progression. Hence, early diagnosis and intervention are emphasized. As a diagnostic index for AD patients, evaluating the complexity of the dependence of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal on the temporal scale of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is effective. Multiscale entropy analysis and multifractal analysis have been performed individually, and their usefulness as diagnostic indicators has been confirmed, but the complemental relationship between these analyses, which may enhance diagnostic accuracy, has not been investigated. We hypothesize that combining multiscale entropy and fractal analyses may add another dimension to understanding the alteration of EEG dynamics in AD. In this study, we performed both multiscale entropy and multifractal analyses on EEGs from AD patients and healthy subjects. We found that the classification accuracy was improved using both techniques. These findings suggest that the use of multiscale entropy analysis and multifractal analysis may lead to the development of AD diagnostic tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A High Accuracy Electrographic Seizure Classifier Trained Using Semi-Supervised Labeling Applied to a Large Spectrogram Dataset</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.667373</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to explore using ECoG spectrogram images for training reliable cross-patient electrographic seizure classifiers, and to characterize the classifiers’ test accuracy as a function of amount of training data. ECoG channels in ∼138,000 time-series ECoG records from 113 patients were converted to RGB spectrogram images. Using an unsupervised spectrogram image clustering technique, manual labeling of 138,000 ECoG records (each with up to 4 ECoG channels) was completed in 320 h, which is an estimated 5 times faster than manual labeling without ECoG clustering. For training supervised classifier models, five random folds of data were created; with each fold containing 72, 18, and 23 patients’ data for model training, validation and testing respectively. Five convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including two with residual connections, were trained. Cross-patient classification accuracies and F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; scores improved with model complexity, with the shallowest 6-layer model (with ∼1.5 million trainable parameters) producing a class-balanced seizure/non-seizure classification accuracy of 87.9% on ECoG channels and the deepest ResNet50-based model (with ∼23.5 million trainable parameters) producing a classification accuracy of 95.7%. The trained ResNet50-based model additionally had 93.5% agreement in scores with an independent expert labeller. Visual inspection of gradient-based saliency maps confirmed that the models’ classifications were based on relevant portions of the spectrogram images. Further, by repeating training experiments with data from varying number of patients, it was found that ECoG spectrogram images from just 10 patients were sufficient to train ResNet50-based models with 88% cross-patient accuracy, while at least 30 patients’ data was required to produce cross-patient classification accuracies of &amp;gt;90%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Norms for Automatic Estimation of Hippocampal Atrophy and a Step Forward for Applicability to the Italian Population</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.656808</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal volume is one of the main biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Dementia (AD). Over the years, advanced tools that performed automatic segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) T13D scans have been developed, such as FreeSurfer (FS) and ACM-Adaboost (AA). Hippocampal volume is considered abnormal when it is below the 5th percentile of the normative population. The aim of this study was to set norms, established from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) population, for hippocampal volume measured with FS v.6.0 and AA tools in the neuGRID platform (www.neugrid2.eu) and demonstrate their applicability for the Italian population.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Norms were set from a large group of 545 healthy controls belonging to ADNI. For each pipeline, subjects with segmentation errors were discarded, resulting in 532 valid segmentations for FS and 421 for AA (age range 56–90 years). The comparability of ADNI and the Italian Brain Normative Archive (IBNA), representative of the Italian general population, was assessed testing clinical variables, neuropsychological scores and normalized hippocampal volumes. Finally, percentiles were validated using the Italian Alzheimer’s disease Repository Without Borders (ARWiBo) as external independent data set to evaluate FS and AA generalizability.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal percentiles were checked with the chi-square goodness of fit test. P-values were not significant, showing that FS and AA algorithm distributions fitted the data well. Clinical, neuropsychological and volumetric features were similar in ADNI and IBNA (p &amp;gt; 0.01). Hippocampal volumes measured with both FS and AA were associated with age (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The 5th percentile thresholds, indicating left/right hippocampal atrophy were respectively: (i) below 3,223/3,456 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 56 years and 2,506/2,415 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 90 years for FS; (ii) below 4,583/4,873 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 56 years and 3,831/3,870 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 90 years for AA. The average volumes computed on 100 cognitively intact healthy controls (CN) selected from ARWiBo were close to the 50th percentiles, while those for 100 AD patients were close to the abnormal percentiles.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;Norms generated from ADNI through the automatic FS and AA segmentation tools may be used as normative references for Italian patients with suspected AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.645984</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The input–output properties of spinal motoneurons and muscle fibers comprising motor units are highly non-linear. The goal of this study was to investigate the stimulation type (continuous versus discrete) and waveform (linear versus non-linear) controlling force production at the motor unit level under intraspinal microstimulation. We constructed a physiological model of the motor unit with computer software enabling virtual experiments on single motor units under a wide range of input conditions, including intracellular and synaptic stimulation of the motoneuron and variation in the muscle length under neuromodulatory inputs originating from the brainstem. Continuous current intensity and impulse current frequency waveforms were inversely estimated such that the motor unit could linearly develop and relax the muscle force within a broad range of contraction speeds and levels during isometric contraction at various muscle lengths. Under both continuous and discrete stimulation, the stimulation waveform non-linearity increased with increasing speed and level of force production and with decreasing muscle length. Only discrete stimulation could control force relaxation at all muscle lengths. In contrast, continuous stimulation could not control force relaxation at high contraction levels in shorter-than-optimal muscles due to persistent inward current saturation on the motoneuron dendrites. These results indicate that non-linear adjustment of the stimulation waveform is more effective in regard to varying the force profile and muscle length and that the discrete stimulation protocol is a more robust approach for designing stimulation patterns aimed at neural interfaces for precise movement control under pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Various functional neuroimaging studies help to better understand the changes in brain activity during meditation. The purpose of this study was to investigate how brain energy metabolism changes during focused attention meditation (FAM) state, measured by phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-MRS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-MRS imaging was carried out in 27 participants after 7 weeks of FAM training. Metabolite ratios and the absolute values of metabolites were assessed after meditation training in two MRI measurements, by comparing effects in a FAM state with those in a distinct focused attention awake state during a backwards counting task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The results showed decreased phosphocreatine/ATP (PCr/ATP), PCr/ inorganic phosphate (Pi), and intracellular pH values in the entire brain, but especially in basal ganglia, frontal lobes, and occipital lobes, and increased Pi/ATP ratio, cerebral Mg, and Pi absolute values were found in the same areas during FAM compared to the control focused attention awake state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Changes in the temporal areas and basal ganglia may be interpreted as a higher energetic state induced by meditation, whereas the frontal and occipital areas showed changes that may be related to a down-regulation in ATP turnover, energy state, and oxidative capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Role of White Matter in the Neural Control of Swallowing: A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.628424</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Swallowing disorders (dysphagia) can negatively impact quality of life and health. For clinicians and researchers seeking to improve outcomes for patients with dysphagia, understanding the neural control of swallowing is critical. The role of gray matter in swallowing control has been extensively documented, but knowledge is limited regarding the contributions of white matter. Our aim was to identify, evaluate, and summarize the populations, methods, and results of published articles describing the role of white matter in neural control of swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We completed a systematic review with a multi-engine search following PRISMA-P 2015 standards. Two authors screened articles and completed blind full-text review and quality assessments using an adapted U.S. National Institute of Health's Quality Assessment. The senior author resolved any disagreements. Qualitative synthesis of evidence was completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The search yielded 105 non-duplicate articles, twenty-two of which met inclusion criteria. Twenty were rated as Good (5/22; 23%) or Fair (15/22; 68%) quality. Stroke was the most represented diagnosis (n = 20; 91%). All studies were observational, and half were retrospective cohort design. The majority of studies (13/22; 59%) quantified white matter damage with lesion-based methods, whereas 7/22 (32%) described intrinsic characteristics of white matter using methods like fractional anisotropy. Fifteen studies (68%) used instrumental methods for swallowing evaluations. White matter areas commonly implicated in swallowing control included the pyramidal tract, internal capsule, corona radiata, superior longitudinal fasciculus, external capsule, and corpus callosum. Additional noteworthy themes included: severity of white matter damage is related to dysphagia severity; bilateral white matter lesions appear particularly disruptive to swallowing; and white matter adaptation can facilitate dysphagia recovery. Gaps in the literature included limited sample size and populations, lack of in-depth evaluations, and issues with research design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Although traditionally understudied, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that white matter is critical in the neural control of swallowing. The reviewed studies indicated that white matter damage can be directly tied to swallowing deficits, and several white matter structures were implicated across studies. Further well-designed interdisciplinary research is needed to understand white matter's role in neural control of normal swallowing and in dysphagia recovery and rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Resting-State Electroencephalogram Microstate Correlations With Empathy and Their Moderating Effect on the Relationship Between Empathy and Disgust</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.626507</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans have a natural ability to understand the emotions and feelings of others, whether one actually witnesses the situation of another, perceives it from a photograph, reads about it in a fiction book, or merely imagines it. This is the phenomenon of empathy, which requires us to mentally represent external information to experience the emotions of others. Studies have shown that individuals with high empathy have high anterior insula and adjacent frontal operculum activation when they are aware of negative emotions in others. As a negative emotion, disgust processing involves insula coupling. What are the neurophysiological characteristics for regulating the levels of empathy and disgust? To answer this question, we collected electroencephalogram microstates (EEG-ms) of 196 college students at rest and used the Disgust Scale and Interpersonal Reactivity Index. The results showed that: (1) there was a significant positive correlation between empathy and disgust sensitivity; (2) the empathy score and the intensity of transition possibility between EEG-ms C and D were significantly positively correlated; and (3) the connection strength between the transition possibility of EEG-ms C and D could adjust the relationship between the disgust sensitivity score and the empathy score. This study provides new neurophysiological characteristics for an understanding of the regulate relationship between empathy and disgust and provides a new perspective on emotion and attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: An Autism-Associated Neuroligin-3 Mutation Affects Developmental Synapse Elimination in the Cerebellum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.676891</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroligin is a postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecule that is involved in synapse formation and maturation by interacting with presynaptic neurexin. Mutations in neuroligin genes, including the arginine to cystein substitution at the 451st amino acid residue (R451C) of neuroligin-3 (NLGN3), have been identified in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Functional magnetic resonance imaging and examination of post-mortem brain in ASD patients implicate alteration of cerebellar morphology and Purkinje cell (PC) loss. In the present study, we examined possible association between the R451C mutation in NLGN3 and synaptic development and function in the mouse cerebellum. In NLGN3-R451C mutant mice, the expression of NLGN3 protein in the cerebellum was reduced to about 10% of the level of wild-type mice. Elimination of redundant climbing fiber (CF) to PC synapses was impaired from postnatal day 10–15 (P10–15) in NLGN3-R451C mutant mice, but majority of PCs became mono-innervated as in wild-type mice after P16. In NLGN3-R451C mutant mice, selective strengthening of a single CF relative to the other CFs in each PC was impaired from P16, which persisted into juvenile stage. Furthermore, the inhibition to excitation (I/E) balance of synaptic inputs to PCs was elevated, and calcium transients in the soma induced by strong and weak CF inputs were reduced in NLGN3-R451C mutant mice. These results suggest that a single point mutation in NLGN3 significantly influences the synapse development and refinement in cerebellar circuitry, which might be related to the pathogenesis of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Cannabinoid Receptor 1 Reverse Agonist AM251 Ameliorates Radiation-Induced Cognitive Decrements</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.668286</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite advancements in the radiotherapeutic management of brain malignancies, resultant sequelae include persistent cognitive dysfunction in the majority of survivors. Defining the precise causes of normal tissue toxicity has proven challenging, but the use of preclinical rodent models has suggested that reductions in neurogenesis and microvascular integrity, impaired synaptic plasticity, increased inflammation, and alterations in neuronal structure are contributory if not causal. As such, strategies to reverse these persistent radiotherapy-induced neurological disorders represent an unmet medical need. AM251, a cannabinoid receptor 1 reverse agonist known to facilitate adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, may help to ameliorate radiation-induced CNS impairments. To test this hypothesis, three treatment paradigms were used to evaluate the efficacy of AM251 to ameliorate radiation-induced learning and memory deficits along with disruptions in mood at 4 and 12 weeks postirradiation. Results demonstrated that acute (four weekly injections) and chronic (16 weekly injections) AM251 treatments (1 mg/kg) effectively alleviated cognitive and mood dysfunction in cranially irradiated mice. The beneficial effects of AM251 were exemplified by improved hippocampal- and cortical-dependent memory function on the novel object recognition and object in place tasks, while similar benefits on mood were shown by reductions in depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors on the forced swim test and elevated plus maze. The foregoing neurocognitive benefits were associated with significant increases in newly born (doublecortin+) neurons (1.7-fold), hippocampal neurogenesis (BrdU+/NeuN+mature neurons, 2.5-fold), and reduced expression of the inflammatory mediator HMGB (1.2-fold) in the hippocampus of irradiated mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that AM251 ameliorates the effects of clinically relevant cranial irradiation where overall neurological benefits in memory and mood coincided with increased hippocampal cell proliferation, neurogenesis, and reduced expression of proinflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Inhibition of Perforin-Mediated Neurotoxicity Attenuates Neurological Deficits After Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.664312</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Perforin-mediated cytotoxicity plays a crucial role in microbial defense, tumor surveillance, and primary autoimmune disorders. However, the contribution of the cytolytic protein perforin to ischemia-induced secondary tissue damage in the brain has not been fully investigated. Here, we examined the kinetics and subpopulations of perforin-positive cells and then evaluated the direct effects of perforin-mediated cytotoxicity on outcomes after ischemic stroke. Using flow cytometry, we showed that perforin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; immune cells could be detected at 12 h and that the percentage of these cells increased largely until on day 3 and then significantly declined on day 7. Surprisingly, the percentage of Perforin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells also unexpectedly increased from day 7 to day 14 after ischemic stroke in Perforin1-EGFP transgenic mice. Our results suggested that Perforin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells play vital roles in the ischemic brain at early and late stages and further suggested that Perforin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells are a heterogeneous population. Surprisingly, in addition to CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, NK cells, and NKT cells, central nervous system (CNS)-resident immune microglia, which are first triggered and activated within minutes after ischemic stroke in mice, also secreted perforin during ischemic brain injury. In our study, the percentage of perforin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia increased from 12 h after ischemic stroke, increased largely until on day 3 after ischemic stroke, and then moderately declined from days 3 to 7. Intriguingly, the percentage of perforin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia also dramatically increased from days 7 to 14 after ischemic stroke. Furthermore, compared with wild-type littermates, Perforin 1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited significant increases in the cerebral infarct volume, neurological deficits, and neurogenesis and inhibition of neurotoxic astrogliosis. Interestingly, the number of CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells was significantly decreased in Perforin 1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared with their wild-type littermates, especially the number of γδ T cells. In addition, Perforin 1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice had lower levels of IL-17 than their wild-type littermates. Our results identified a critical function of perforin-mediated neurotoxicity in the ischemic brain, suggesting that targeting perforin-mediated neurotoxicity in brain-resident microglia and invading perforin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; immune cells may be a potential strategy for the treatment of ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Retinal organoids (ROs), which are derived from stem cells, can automatically form three-dimensional laminar structures that include all cell types and the ultrastructure of the retina. Therefore, they are highly similar to the retinal structure in the human body. The development of organoids has been a great technological breakthrough in the fields of transplantation therapy and disease modeling. However, the translation of RO applications into medical practice still has various deficiencies at the current stage, including the long culture process, insufficient yield, and great heterogeneity among ROs produced under different conditions. Nevertheless, many technological breakthroughs have been made in transplanting ROs for treatment of diseases such as retinal degeneration. This review discusses recent advances in the development of ROs, improvements of the culture protocol, and the latest developments in RO replacement therapy techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Normal and Abnormal Sharp Wave Ripples in the Hippocampal-Entorhinal Cortex System: Implications for Memory Consolidation, Alzheimer's Disease, and Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.683483</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The appearance of hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs) is an electrophysiological biomarker for episodic memory encoding and behavioral planning. Disturbed SWRs are considered a sign of neural network dysfunction that may provide insights into the structural connectivity changes associated with cognitive impairment in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). SWRs originating from hippocampus have been extensively studied during spatial navigation in rodents, and more recent studies have investigated SWRs in the hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (HPC-EC) system during a variety of other memory-guided behaviors. Understanding how SWR disruption impairs memory function, especially episodic memory, could aid in the development of more efficacious therapeutics for AD and TLE. In this review, we first provide an overview of the reciprocal association between AD and TLE, and then focus on the functions of HPC-EC system SWRs in episodic memory consolidation. It is posited that these waveforms reflect rapid network interactions among excitatory projection neurons and local interneurons and that these waves may contribute to synaptic plasticity underlying memory consolidation. Further, SWRs appear altered or ectopic in AD and TLE. These waveforms may thus provide clues to understanding disease pathogenesis and may even serve as biomarkers for early-stage disease progression and treatment response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Frontal White Matter Hyperintensities and Executive Functioning Performance in Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.672535</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Frontal lobe structures decline faster than most other brain regions in older adults. Age-related change in the frontal lobe is associated with poorer executive function (e.g., working memory, switching/set-shifting, and inhibitory control). The effects and presence of frontal lobe white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on executive function in normal aging is relatively unknown. The current study assessed relationships between region-specific frontal WMH load and cognitive performance in healthy older adults using three executive function tasks from the NIH Toolbox (NIHTB) Cognition Battery. A cohort of 279 healthy older adults ages 65–88 completed NIHTB and 3T T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI. Lesion Segmentation Toolbox quantified WMH volume and generated lesion probability maps. Individual lesion maps were registered to the Desikan-Killiany atlas in FreeSurfer 6.0 to define regions of interest (ROI). Independent linear regressions assessed relationships between executive function performance and region-specific WMH in frontal lobe ROIs. All models included age, sex, education, estimated total intracranial volume, multi-site scanner differences, and cardiovascular disease risk using Framingham criteria as covariates. Poorer set-shifting performance was associated with greater WMH load in three frontal ROIs including bilateral superior frontal (left β = −0.18, FDR-p = 0.02; right β = −0.20, FDR-p = 0.01) and right medial orbitofrontal (β = −0.17, FDR-p = 0.02). Poorer inhibitory performance associated with higher WMH load in one frontal ROI, the right superior frontal (right β = −0.21, FDR-p = 0.01). There were no significant associations between working memory and WMH in frontal ROIs. Our study demonstrates that location and pattern of frontal WMH may be important to assess when examining age-related differences in cognitive functions involving switching/set-shifting and inhibition. On the other hand, working memory performance was not related to presence of frontal WMH in this sample. These data suggest that WMH may contribute selectively to age-related declines in executive function. Findings emerged beyond predictors known to be associated with WMH presence, including age and cardiovascular disease risk. The spread of WMH within the frontal lobes may play a key role in the neuropsychological profile of cognitive aging. Further research should explore whether early intervention on modifiable vascular factors or cognitive interventions targeted for executive abilities may help mitigate the effect of frontal WMH on executive function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Analysis of Age-Related White Matter Microstructures Based on Diffusion Tensor Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.664911</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Population aging has become a serious social problem. Accordingly, many researches are focusing on changes in brains of the elderly. In this study, we used multiple parameters to analyze age-related changes in white matter fibers. A sample cohort of 58 individuals was divided into young and middle-age groups and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were used to analyze the differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusion (MD), axial diffusion (AD), and radial diffusion (RD) between the two groups. Deterministic fiber tracking was used to investigate the correlation between fiber number and fiber length with age. The TBSS analysis revealed significant differences in FA, MD, AD, and RD in multiple white matter fibers between the two groups. In the middle-age group FA and AD were lower than in young people, whereas the MD and RD values were higher. Deterministic fiber tracking showed that the fiber length of some fibers correlated positively with age. These fibers were observed in the splenium of corpus callosum (SCC), the posterior limb of internal capsule (PLIC), the right posterior corona radiata (PCR_R), the anterior corona radiata (ACR), the left posterior thalamic radiation (include optic radiation; PTR_L), and the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF_L), among others. The results showed that the SCC, PLIC, PCR_R, ACR, PTR_L, and SLF_L significantly differed between young and middle-age people. Therefore, we believe that these fibers could be used as image markers of age-related white matter changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Feasibility of Using Virtual Reality and Eye Tracking in Research With Older Adults With and Without Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.607219</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aim: To examine the feasibility of using large scale spatial, self-mobile, virtual reality, and eye tracking in older adults with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Older adults with early stage AD (n = 38) and a control group without AD (n = 50) were asked to find their way in a large, projected VR simulation of a retirement community repeatedly over 10 trials for each of 2 days, while wearing eye tracking glasses. Feasibility measures, including tolerance, side effects, and ability to complete the VR and eye tracking were collected. This study reports the analysis of the feasibility data for the VR and eye tracking and comparison of findings between the groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Over 80% of the subjects were able to complete the VR portion of the study. Only four subjects, all in the AD group, could not use the joystick and were excluded. Withdrawal rate (18%) was similar between the groups [X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(2)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.82, N = 88, p = 0.245] with most withdrawals occurring after the fourth trial. Simulation sickness was not significantly different between the groups. Only 60% of the subjects had completed eye tracking videos; more subjects in the AD group had complete eye tracking videos than the control group; X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(1)&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.411, N = 88, p = 0.006. Eye tracking incompletion was primarily due to inability to calibration issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Virtual reality testing and eye tracking can be used in older adults with and without AD in a large-scale way-finding task, but that there are some limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Structure and mechanistic features of the prokaryotic minimal RNase P</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/70160</link>
	<content:encoded>Endonucleolytic removal of 5'-leader sequences from tRNA precursor transcripts (pre-tRNAs) by RNase P is essential for protein synthesis. Beyond RNA-based RNase P enzymes, protein-only versions of the enzyme exert this function in various Eukarya (there termed PRORPs) and in some bacteria (&lt;i&gt;Aquifex aeolicus&lt;/i&gt; and close relatives); both enzyme types belong to distinct subgroups of the PIN domain metallonuclease superfamily. Homologs of &lt;i&gt;Aquifex&lt;/i&gt; RNase P (HARPs) are also expressed in some other bacteria and many archaea, where they coexist with RNA-based RNase P and do not represent the main RNase P activity. Here we solved the structure of the bacterial HARP from &lt;i&gt;Halorhodospira halophila &lt;/i&gt;by cryo-EM revealing a novel screw-like dodecameric assembly. Biochemical experiments demonstrate that oligomerization is required for RNase P activity of HARPs. We propose that the tRNA substrate binds to an extended spike-helix (SH) domain that protrudes from the screw-like assembly to position the 5'-end in close proximity to the active site of the neighboring dimer. The structure suggests that eukaryotic PRORPs and prokaryotic HARPs recognize the same structural elements of pre-tRNAs (tRNA elbow region and cleavage site). Our analysis thus delivers the structural and mechanistic basis for pre-tRNA processing by the prokaryotic HARP system.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A covariation analysis reveals elements of selectivity in quorum sensing systems</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69169</link>
	<content:encoded>Many bacteria communicate with kin and coordinate group behaviors through a form of cell-cell signaling called acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing (QS). In these systems, a signal synthase produces an AHL to which its paired receptor selectively responds. Selectivity is fundamental to cell signaling. Despite its importance, it has been challenging to determine how this selectivity is achieved and how AHL QS systems evolve and diversify. We hypothesized that we could use covariation within the protein sequences of AHL synthases and receptors to identify selectivity residues. We began by identifying about 6,000 unique synthase-receptor pairs. We then used the protein sequences of these pairs to identify covariation patterns and mapped the patterns onto the LasI/R system from &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa &lt;/i&gt;PAO1. The covarying residues in both proteins cluster around the ligand-binding sites. We demonstrate that these residues are involved in system selectivity toward the cognate signal and go on to engineer the Las system to both produce and respond to an alternate AHL signal. We have thus demonstrated that covariation methods provide a powerful approach for investigating selectivity in protein-small molecule interactions and have deepened our understanding of how communication systems evolve and diversify.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Direct Extraction of Signal and Noise Correlations from Two-Photon Calcium Imaging of Ensemble Neuronal Activity</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68046</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuronal activity correlations are key to understanding how populations of neurons collectively encode information. While two-photon calcium imaging has created a unique opportunity to record the activity of large populations of neurons, existing methods for inferring correlations from these data face several challenges. First, the observations of spiking activity produced by two-photon imaging are temporally blurred and noisy. Secondly, even if the spiking data were perfectly recovered via deconvolution, inferring network-level features from binary spiking data is a challenging task due to the non-linear relation of neuronal spiking to endogenous and exogenous inputs. In this work, we propose a methodology to explicitly model and directly estimate signal and noise correlations from two-photon fluorescence observations, without requiring intermediate spike deconvolution. We provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of the proposed estimator and demonstrate its utility through applications to simulated and experimentally recorded data from the mouse auditory cortex.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A novel decoy strategy for polymyxin resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66988</link>
	<content:encoded>Modification of the outer membrane charge by a polymyxin B (PMB)-induced PmrAB two-component system appears to be a dominant phenomenon in PMB-resistant &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt;. PMB-resistant variants and many clinical isolates also appeared to produce outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses revealed that upregulation of the &lt;i&gt;pmr &lt;/i&gt;operon and decreased membrane-linkage proteins (OmpA, OmpW and BamE) are linked to overproduction of OMVs, which also promoted enhanced biofilm formation. The addition of OMVs from PMB-resistant variants into the cultures of PMB-susceptible &lt;i&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/i&gt; and the clinical isolates protected these susceptible bacteria from PMB. Taxonomic profiling of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; human gut microbiomes under anaerobic conditions demonstrated that OMVs completely protected the microbial community against PMB treatment. A &lt;i&gt;Galleria mellonella-&lt;/i&gt;infection model with PMB treatment showed that OMVs increased the mortality rate of larvae by protecting &lt;i&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/i&gt; from PMB. Taken together, OMVs released from &lt;i&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/i&gt; functioned as decoys against PMB.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Global Constraints within the Developmental Program of the Drosophila Wing</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66750</link>
	<content:encoded>Organismal development is a complex process, involving a vast number of molecular constituents interacting on multiple spatio-temporal scales in the formation of intricate body structures. Despite this complexity, development is remarkably reproducible and displays tolerance to both genetic and environmental perturbations. This robustness implies the existence of hidden simplicities in developmental programs. Here, using the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; wing as a model system, we develop a new quantitative strategy that enables a robust description of biologically salient phenotypic variation. Analyzing natural phenotypic variation across a highly outbred population, and variation generated by weak perturbations in genetic and environmental conditions, we observe a highly constrained set of wing phenotypes. Remarkably, the phenotypic variants can be described by a single integrated mode that corresponds to a non-intuitive combination of structural variations across the wing. This work demonstrates the presence of constraints that funnel environmental inputs and genetic variation into phenotypes stretched along a single axis in morphological space. Our results provide quantitative insights into the nature of robustness in complex forms while yet accommodating the potential for evolutionary variations. Methodologically, we introduce a general strategy for finding such invariances in other developmental contexts.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66491</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuronal ankyrins cluster and link membrane proteins to the actin and spectrin-based cytoskeleton. Among the three vertebrate ankyrins, little is known about neuronal Ankyrin-R (AnkR). We report AnkR is highly enriched in Pv&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fast-spiking interneurons in mouse and human. We identify AnkR-associated protein complexes including cytoskeletal proteins, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and perineuronal nets (PNNs). We show that loss of AnkR from forebrain interneurons reduces and disrupts PNNs, decreases anxiety-like behaviors, and changes the intrinsic excitability and firing properties of Pv&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fast-spiking interneurons. These changes are accompanied by a dramatic reduction in Kv3.1b K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. We identify a novel AnkR-binding motif in Kv3.1b, and show that AnkR is both necessary and sufficient for Kv3.1b membrane localization in interneurons and at nodes of Ranvier. Thus, AnkR regulates Pv&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fast-spiking interneuron function by organizing ion channels, CAMs, and PNNs, and linking these to the underlying b1 spectrin-based cytoskeleton.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: The genetic organization of longitudinal subcortical volumetric change is stable throughout the lifespan</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66466</link>
	<content:encoded>Development and aging of the cerebral cortex show similar topographic organization and are governed by the same genes. It is unclear whether the same is true for subcortical regions, which follow fundamentally different ontogenetic and phylogenetic principles. We tested the hypothesis that genetically governed neurodevelopmental processes can be traced throughout life by assessing to which degree brain regions that develop together continue to change together through life. Analyzing over 6000 longitudinal MRIs of the brain, we used graph theory to identify five clusters of coordinated development, indexed as patterns of correlated volumetric change in brain structures. The clusters tended to follow placement along the cranial axis in embryonic brain development, suggesting continuity from prenatal stages, and correlated with cognition. Across independent longitudinal datasets, we demonstrated that developmental clusters were conserved through life. Twin-based genetic correlations revealed distinct sets of genes governing change in each cluster. Single nucleotide polymorphisms-based analyses of 38127 cross-sectional MRIs showed a similar pattern of genetic volume-volume correlations. In conclusion, coordination of subcortical change adheres to fundamental principles of lifespan continuity and genetic organization.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Transcription-associated topoisomerase 2α activity is a major effector of cytotoxicity induced by G-quadruplex ligands</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65184</link>
	<content:encoded>G-quadruplexes (G4) are non-canonical DNA structures found in the genome of most species including human. Small molecules stabilizing these structures, called G4 ligands, have been identified and, for some of them, shown to induce cytotoxic DNA double-strand breaks. Through the use of an unbiased genetic approach, we identify here topoisomerase 2-alpha (TOP2A) as a major effector of cytotoxicity induced by two clastogenic G4 ligands, pyridostatin and CX-5461, the latter molecule currently undergoing phase I/II clinical trials in oncology. We show that both TOP2 activity and transcription account for DNA break production following G4 ligand treatments. In contrast, clastogenic activity of these G4 ligands is countered by topoisomerase 1 (TOP1), which limits co-transcriptional G4 formation, and by factors promoting transcriptional elongation. Altogether our results support that clastogenic G4 ligands act as DNA structure-driven TOP2-poisons at transcribed regions bearing G4 structures.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Resistance to different anthracycline chemotherapeutics elicits distinct and actionable primary metabolic dependencies in breast cancer</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65150</link>
	<content:encoded>Chemotherapy resistance is a critical barrier in cancer treatment. Metabolic adaptations have been shown to fuel therapy resistance; however, little is known regarding the generality of these changes and whether specific therapies elicit unique metabolic alterations. Using a combination of metabolomics, transcriptomics, and functional genomics, we show that two anthracyclines, doxorubicin and epirubicin, elicit distinct primary metabolic vulnerabilities in human breast cancer cells. Doxorubicin-resistant cells rely on glutamine to drive oxidative phosphorylation and &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; glutathione synthesis, while epirubicin-resistant cells display markedly increased bioenergetic capacity and mitochondrial ATP production. The dependence on these distinct metabolic adaptations is revealed by the increased sensitivity of doxorubicin-resistant cells and tumor xenografts to buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a drug that interferes with glutathione synthesis, compared with epirubicin-resistant counterparts that are more sensitive to the biguanide phenformin. Overall, our work reveals that metabolic adaptations can vary with therapeutics and that these metabolic dependencies can be exploited as a targeted approach to treat chemotherapy-resistant breast cancer.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65051</link>
	<content:encoded>Cellular motility is an ancient eukaryotic trait, ubiquitous across phyla with roles in predator avoidance, resource access, and competition. Flagellar motility is seen in various parasitic protozoans, and morphological changes in flagella during the parasite life cycle have been observed. We studied the impact of these changes on motility across life cycle stages, and how such changes might serve to facilitate human infection. We used holographic microscopy to image swimming cells of different &lt;i&gt;Leishmania mexicana&lt;/i&gt; life cycle stages in three dimensions. We find that the human-infective (metacyclic promastigote) forms display ‘run and tumble’ behaviour in the absence of stimulus, reminiscent of bacterial motion, and that they specifically modify swimming direction and speed to target host immune cells in response to a macrophage-derived stimulus. Non-infective (procyclic promastigote) cells swim more slowly, along meandering helical paths. These findings demonstrate adaptation of swimming phenotype and chemotaxis towards human cells.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Circadian modulation of human sleep spindle frequency</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.28.450146v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Homeostatic and circadian processes play a pivotal role in determining sleep structure, timing and quality. In sharp contrast with the wide accessibility of the EEG index of sleep homeostasis, an electrophysiological measure of the circadian modulation of sleep is still non-available. As a consequence, the circadian component of sleep regulation is assumed, but not assessed in routine polysomnographic records. Available evidence suggests that sleep spindle frequencies are markers of the circadian modulation of sleep. In order to test the above assumption, the Budapest-Munich database of sleep records (N = 251), as well as an afternoon nap sleep record database (N = 112) were analysed by the Individual Adjustment Method of sleep spindle analysis. Slow and fast sleep spindle frequencies were characterized by U-shaped overnight dynamics, with highest values in the first and the fourth-to-fifth sleep cycle and the lowest values in the middle of the sleeping period (cycles 2-3). Age-related attenuation of sleep spindle deceleration was evident. Estimated phases of the nadirs in sleep spindle frequencies were advanced in children as compared to other age groups. Additionally, nap sleep spindles were faster than night sleep spindles (0.57 and 0.39 Hz difference for slow and fast types, respectively). Our findings suggest that the circadian modulation of sleep is measurable by a fine frequency resolution analysis of sleep spindles. Moreover, age-related attenuation of circadian sleep modulation can be measured by assessing the overnight dynamics in sleep spindle frequency.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.28.450144v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Sensory processing is hard because the variables of interest are encoded in spike trains in a relatively complex way. A major goal in studies of sensory processing is to understand how the brain extracts those variables. Here we revisit a common encoding model in which variables are encoded linearly. Although there are typically more variables than neurons, this problem is still solvable because only a small number of variables appear at any one time (sparse prior). However, previous solutions require all-to-all connectivity, inconsistent with the sparse connectivity seen in the brain. Here we propose an algorithm that provably reaches the MAP (maximum a posteriori) inference solution, but does so using sparse connectivity. Our algorithm is inspired by the circuit of the mouse olfactory bulb, but our approach is general enough to apply to other modalities. In addition, it should be possible to extend it to nonlinear encoding models.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Nanoscopical analysis reveals an orderly arrangement of the presynaptic scaffold protein Bassoon at the Golgi-apparatus</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.28.450125v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Bassoon is a core scaffold protein of the presynaptic active zone. In brain synapses, the C-terminus of Bassoon is oriented toward the plasma membrane and its N-terminus is oriented towards synaptic vesicles. At the Golgi-apparatus Bassoon is thought to assemble active zone precursor structures, but whether it is arranged in an orderly fashion is unknown. Understanding the topology of this large scaffold protein is important for models of active zone biogenesis. Using stimulated emission depletion nanoscopy in cultured hippocampal neurons, we found that an N-terminal intramolecular tag of recombinant Bassoon, but not C-terminal tag, colocalized with markers of the trans-Golgi network. The N-terminus of Bassoon was located between 48 nm and 69 nm away from TGN38, while its C-terminus was located between 100 nm and 115 nm away from TGN38. Sequences within the first 95 amino acids of Bassoon were required for this arrangement. Our data are consistent with a model, in which the N-terminus of Bassoon binds to the membranes of the trans-Golgi network, while the C-terminus associates with active zone components, thus reflecting the topographic arrangement characteristic of synapses also at the Golgi-apparatus.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Residual errors in visuomotor adaptation persist despite extended motor preparation periods</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.28.450124v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A consistent finding in sensorimotor adaptation is a persistent undershoot of full compensation, such that performance asymptotes with residual errors greater than seen at baseline. This behaviour has been attributed to limiting factors within the implicit adaptation system, which reaches a sub-optimal equilibrium between trial-by-trial learning and forgetting. However, recent research has suggested that allowing longer motor planning periods prior to movement eliminates these residual errors. The additional planning time allows required cognitive processes to be completed before movement onset, thus increasing accuracy. Here we looked to extend these findings by investigating the relationship between increased motor preparation time and the size of imposed visuomotor rotation (30{degrees}, 45{degrees} or 60{degrees}), with regards to the final asymptotic level of adaptation. We found that restricting preparation time to 0.35 seconds impaired adaptation for moderate and larger rotations, resulting in larger residual errors compared to groups with additional preparation time. However, we found that even extended preparation time failed to eliminate persistent errors, regardless of magnitude of cursor rotation. Thus, the asymptote of adaptation was significantly less than the degree of imposed rotation, for all experimental groups. Additionally, there was a positive relationship between asymptotic error and implicit retention. These data suggest that a prolonged motor preparation period is insufficient to reliably achieve complete adaptation and therefore our results provide support for the proposal that the balance between error-based learning and forgetting (i.e., incomplete retention) contributes to asymptotic adaptation levels.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Dynamic pathways of information flow between distributed brain regions underlie the diversity of behaviour. However, it remains unclear how neuronal activity in one area causally influences ongoing population activity in another, and how such interactions change over time. Here we introduce a causal approach to quantify cortical interactions by pairing simultaneous electrophysiological recordings with neural perturbations. We found that the influence visual cortical areas had on each other was surprisingly variable over time. Both feedforward and feedback pathways reliably affected different subpopulations of target neurons at different moments during processing of a visual stimulus, resulting in dynamically rotating communication dimensions between the two cortical areas. The influence of feedback on primary visual cortex (V1) became even more dynamic when visual stimuli were associated with a reward, impacting different subsets of V1 neurons within tens of milliseconds. This, in turn, controlled the geometry of V1 population activity in a behaviourally relevant manner. Thus, distributed neural populations interact through dynamically reorganizing and context- dependent communication channels to evaluate sensory information.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.27.450102v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Following repeated opioid use, some dependent individuals experience persistent cognitive deficits that contribute to relapse of drug-taking behaviors, and one component of this response may be mediated by the endogenous dynorphin/kappa opioid system in neocortex. In mice, we find that acute morphine withdrawal evokes dynorphin release in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and disrupts cognitive function by activation of local kappa opioid receptors (KORs). Immunohistochemical analyses using a phospho-KOR antibody confirmed that both withdrawal-induced and optically evoked dynorphin release activated KOR in PFC. Using a genetically encoded sensor based on inert KOR (kLight1.2a), we revealed the in vivo dynamics of endogenous dynorphin release in the PFC. Local activation of KOR in PFC produced multi-phasic disruptions of memory processing in an operant delayed alternation behavioral task, which manifest as reductions in response number and accuracy during early and late phases of an operant session. Local pretreatment in PFC with the selective KOR antagonist norbinaltorphimine (norBNI) blocked the disruptive effect of systemic KOR activation during both early and late phases of the session. The early, but not late phase disruption was blocked by viral excision of PFC KORs, suggesting an anatomically dissociable contribution of pre- and postsynaptic KORs. Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in morphine-dependent mice or optical stimulation of pdynCre neurons using Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) disrupted delayed alternation performance, and the dynorphin-induced effect was blocked by local norBNI. Our findings describe a mechanism for control of cortical function during opioid dependence and suggest that KOR antagonism could promote abstinence.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Stress decreases serotonin tone in the nucleus accumbens to promote aversion and potentiate cocaine preference via decreased stimulation of 5-HT1B receptors</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.27.450100v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Stress-induced release of dynorphins (Dyn) activates kappa opioid receptors (KOR) in monoaminergic neurons to produce dysphoria and potentiate drug reward; however, the circuit mechanisms responsible for this effect are not known. We found that conditional deletion of KOR from Slc6a4 (SERT)-expressing neurons blocked stress-induced potentiation of cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP). Within the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), two overlapping populations of KOR-expressing neurons: Slc17a8 (VGluT3) and SERT, were distinguished functionally and anatomically. Optogenetic inhibition of these SERT+ neurons potentiated subsequent cocaine CPP, whereas optical inhibition of the VGluT3+ neurons blocked subsequent cocaine CPP. SERT+/VGluT3- expressing neurons were concentrated in the lateral aspect of the DRN. SERT projections from the DRN were observed in the medial nucleus accumbens (mNAc), but VGluT3 projections were not. Optical inhibition of SERT+ neurons produced place aversion, whereas optical stimulation of SERT+ terminals in the mNAc attenuated stress-induced increases in forced swim immobility and subsequent cocaine CPP. KOR neurons projecting to mNAc were confined to the lateral aspect of the DRN, and the principal source of dynorphinergic (Pdyn) afferents in the mNAc was from local neurons. Excision of Pdyn from the mNAc blocked stress-potentiation of cocaine CPP. Prior studies suggested that stress-induced dynorphin release within the mNAc activates KOR to potentiate cocaine preference by a reduction in 5-HT tone. Consistent with this hypothesis, a transient pharmacological blockade of mNAc 5-HT1B receptors potentiated subsequent cocaine CPP. 5-HT1B is known to be expressed on 5-HT terminals in NAc, and 5-HT1B transcript was also detected in Pdyn+, Adora2a+ and ChAT+ (markers for direct pathway, indirect pathway, and cholinergic interneurons, respectively). Following stress exposure, 5-HT1B transcript was selectively elevated in Pdyn+ cells of the mNAc. These findings suggest that Dyn/KOR regulates serotonin activation of 5HT1B receptors within the mNAc and dynamically controls stress response, affect, and drug reward.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Contraction-dependent intracortical inhibition supports gravity-efficient motor control</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.27.450084v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Efficient control of voluntary movements along the gravity axis requires adapted shifts in muscular contraction modes. In daily life, rising the arm up involves shortening (i.e., concentric) contractions of arm flexors, while the reverse movement can rely on lengthening (i.e., eccentric) contractions of the same muscles with the help of gravity force. Although this muscular-control mode is universal, the neuromuscular mechanisms that subserve the control of such gravity-oriented movements remain unknown. In this study, we designed two neurophysiological experiments that allowed tracking modulations of cortical, spinal, and muscular outputs of arm flexors while healthy humans carried out vertical pointing movements. In conditions where upward and downward movements revealed kinematic features reminiscent of optimal motor commands (i.e., directional asymmetries), we report fine contraction-dependent modulations of the corticospinal output. The overall corticospinal excitability dropped during lengthening contractions (downward movements) compared with shortening contractions (upward movements). Specifically, we did not observe any change in spinal motoneuron responsiveness from cervicomedullary stimulations but a specific increase in intracortical inhibition during lengthening vs. shortening contractions. We discuss these fine contraction-dependent modulations of the supraspinal motor output in the light of feedforward mechanisms that may support gravity-tuned motor control. Generally, these results shed a new perspective on the neural policy that optimize movement control along the gravity axis.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Disrupted choline clearance and sustained acetylcholine release in vivo by a common choline transporter coding variant associated with poor attentional control in humans</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.27.450076v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Transport of choline via the neuronal high-affinity choline transporter (CHT; SLC5A7) is essential for cholinergic terminals to synthesize and release acetylcholine (ACh). In humans, we previously demonstrated an association between a common CHT coding substitution (rs1013940; Ile89Val) and reduced attentional capacity as well as attenuated frontal cortex activation. Here, we used a CRISPR/Cas9 approach to generate mice expressing the I89V substitution and assessed, using in vivo cortical choline biosensing, CHT-mediated choline transport, and ACh release. CHT-mediated clearance of choline in mice expressing one or two Val89 alleles was reduced by over 7-fold relative to wild type (WT) mice, suggesting dominant-negative effects. Choline clearance in CHT Val89 mice was further reduced by neuronal inactivation. Deficits in ACh release, 5 and 10 min after repeated depolarization at a low, behaviorally relevant frequency, support an attenuated reloading capacity of cholinergic neurons in mutant mice. The density of CHTs in total synaptosomal lysates and neuronal plasma-membrane-enriched fractions was not impacted by the Val89 variant, indicating a selective impact on CHT function. Consistent with this hypothesis, structural modeling revealed that Val89 may attenuate choline transport by changing the ability of choline to induce conformational changes of CHT that support normal transport rates. Our findings suggest that diminished, sustained cholinergic signaling capacity in the frontal cortex underlies perturbed attentional performance in individuals expressing CHT Val89. Our work supports the utility of the CHT Val89 mouse model as a valuable model to study heritable risk for cognitive disorders arising from cholinergic dysfunction.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.27.450072v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>We used pupillometry to evaluate the effects of attention cueing on perceptual bi-stability, as reported by adult human observers. Perceptual alternations and pupil diameter were measured during two forms of rivalry, generated by presenting a white and a black disk to the two eyes (binocular rivalry) or splitting the disks between eyes (interocular grouping rivalry). In line with previous studies, we found that subtle pupil size oscillations (about 0.05 mm) tracked alternations between exclusive dominance phases of the black or white disk. These oscillations were larger for perceptually stronger stimuli: presented to the dominant eye or with physically higher luminance contrast. However, cueing of endogenous attention to one of the rivaling percepts did not affect pupil oscillations during exclusive dominance phases. This was in spite of the reliable effects of endogenous attention on perceptual dominance, which shifted in favor of the cued percept by about 10%. The results were comparable for binocular and interocular grouping rivalry. Cueing only had a marginal modulatory effect on pupil size during mixed percepts in binocular rivalry. This may suggest that, rather than acting by modulating perceptual strength, endogenous attention primarily acts during periods of unresolved competition, which is compatible with attention being automatically directed to the rivaling stimuli during periods of exclusive dominance and thereby sustaining perceptual alternations.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A universal probabilistic spike count model reveals ongoing modulation of neural variability</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.27.450063v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neural responses are variable: even under identical experimental conditions, single neuron and population responses typically differ from trial to trial and across time. Recent work has demonstrated that this variability has predictable structure, can be modulated by sensory input and behaviour, and bears critical signatures of the underlying network dynamics and computations. However, current methods for characterising neural variability are primarily geared towards sensory coding in the laboratory: they require trials with repeatable experimental stimuli and behavioural covariates. In addition, they make strong assumptions about the parametric form of variability, rely on assumption-free but data-inefficient histogram-based approaches, or are altogether ill-suited for capturing variability modulation by covariates. Here we present a universal probabilistic spike count model that eliminates these shortcomings. Our method builds on sparse Gaussian processes and can model arbitrary spike count distributions (SCDs) with flexible dependence on observed as well as latent covariates, using scalable variational inference to jointly infer the covariate-to-SCD mappings and latent trajectories in a data efficient way. Without requiring repeatable trials, it can flexibly capture covariate-dependent joint SCDs, and provide interpretable latent causes underlying the statistical dependencies between neurons. We apply the model to recordings from a canonical non-sensory neural population: head direction cells in the mouse. We find that variability in these cells defies a simple parametric relationship with mean spike count as assumed in standard models, its modulation by external covariates can be comparably strong to that of the mean firing rate, and slow low-dimensional latent factors explain away neural correlations. Our approach paves the way to understanding the mechanisms and computations underlying neural variability under naturalistic conditions, beyond the realm of sensory coding with repeatable stimuli.</content:encoded>

These decisions are usually taken over a short period of time at the beginning of the sound, known as build-up, by using the available grouping cues. Here we investigate the use of temporal coherence and temporal stability to influence subsequent grouping. We show that these two grouping cues behave independently from one another and except when put into conflict. In these situations, the cues available during the build-up period determine subsequent perception.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Two photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) microscopy is a widely used optical imaging technique that has revolutionized neurophotonics through a diverse palette of dyes, specialized transgenic models, easy implementation, and straightforward data analysis. However, in vivo TPEF imaging is often limited in the number of contrasts available to distinguish different cells, structures, or functions. We propose using two label free multiphoton microscopy techniques: stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy and transient absorption microscopy (TAM) as complementary and orthogonal imaging modalities to TPEF for in vivo brain imaging. In this study, we construct a simultaneous nonlinear absorption, Raman, and fluorescence (SNARF) microscope and image several cortical structures up to 250-300 m below the pial surface, the highest reported in vivo imaging depth for SRS or TAM. We further demonstrate the capabilities of our SNARF microscope through the quantification of age-dependent myelination, hemodynamics, vessel structure, cell density, and cell identity in vivo. Using machine learning, we report the use of label free SRS and TAM features to predict capillary lining cell identities with 90% accuracy. The SNARF microscope and methodology outlined herein provide a powerful platform to study several research topics, including neurovascular coupling, blood brain barrier, neuronal and axonal degeneration in aging, and neurodegenerative diseases.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.26.450021v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Human brightness estimation often pronouncedly dissociates from objective viewing conditions. Yet, the physiological substrate underlying subjective perception is still poorly understood. Rather than physical illumination, the subjective experience of brightness has been shown to correlate with temporal dynamics in the amplitude of cortical neural responses. Here, we aimed to experimentally manipulate visual flicker-evoked steady-state responses and related perception via concurrent modulation of cortical excitability by transcranial alternating current stimulation. Participants performed a brightness discrimination task of two visual flicker stimuli, one of which was targeted by same-frequency electrical stimulation at varying phase shifts. Transcranial electrical stimulation was applied with an occipital and a periorbital active control montage, based on finite-element method simulations of electric fields. Experimental results reveal that flicker brightness perception is modulated dependent on the phase shift between sensory and electrical stimulation, solely under stable flicker entrainment and exclusively under occipital electrical stimulation. The degree of induced brightness modulation was positively correlated with the strength of neuronal phase locking to the flicker, recorded prior to electrical stimulation. This finding was corroborated by a neural network model, demonstrating a comparable dependency between flicker-evoked phase synchronization and amplitude modulations of entrained neural rhythms by phase shifted visual and electric inputs. Our data suggest a causal role of the amplitude of neural activity in visual cortex for brightness perception in humans. This finding provides an important step towards understanding the basis of visual perception and further confirms electrical stimulation as a tool for advancing controlled modulations of neural excitability and related behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.25.449939v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Amyloid-beta (A{beta}) deposition is one of the hallmark pathologies in both sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) and autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD), the latter of which is caused by mutations in genes involved in A{beta} processing. Despite A{beta} deposition being a centerpiece to both sAD and ADAD, some differences between these AD subtypes have been observed with respect to the spatial pattern of A{beta}. Previous work has shown that the spatial pattern of A{beta} in individuals spanning the sAD spectrum can be reproduced with high accuracy using an epidemic spreading model (ESM), which simulates the diffusion of A{beta} across neuronal connections and is constrained by individual rates of A{beta} production and clearance. However, it has not been investigated whether A{beta} deposition in the rarer ADAD can be modeled in the same way, and if so, how congruent the spreading patterns of A{beta} across sAD and ADAD are. We leverage the ESM as a data-driven approach to probe individual-level variation in the spreading patterns of A{beta} across three different large-scale imaging datasets (2 SAD, 1 ADAD). We applied the ESM separately to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging initiative (N=737), the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (N=510), and the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (N=249), the latter two of which were processed using an identical pipeline. We assessed inter- and intra-individual model performance in each dataset separately, and further identified the most likely epicenter of A{beta} spread for each individual. Using epicenters defined in previous work in sAD, the ESM provided moderate prediction of the regional pattern of A{beta} deposition across all three datasets. We further find that, while the most likely epicenter for most A{beta}-positive subjects overlaps with the default mode network, 13% of ADAD individuals were best characterized by a striatal origin of A{beta} spread. These subjects were also distinguished by being younger than ADAD subjects with a DMN A{beta} origin, despite having a similar estimated age of symptom onset. Together, our results suggest that most ADAD patients express A{beta} spreading patters similar to those of sAD, but that there may be a subset of ADAD patients with a separate, striatal phenotype.</content:encoded>

Methods: A total of 308 unmedicated participants completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans, of which 247 (148 MDD; 99 Healthy Controls, HC) were suitable for this study. Seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RsFc) analysis was performed using three cerebellar regions of interest (ROIs): ROI1 corresponded to default mode network (DMN) / inattentive processing; ROI2 corresponded to attentional networks including frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and ventral attention; ROI3 corresponded to motor processing. These ROIs were delineated based on prior functional gradient analyses of the cerebellum. A general linear model was used to perform within-group and between-group comparisons. Results: In comparison to HC, participants with MDD displayed increased RsFc within the cerebello-cerebral DMN (ROI1) and significantly elevated RsFc between the cerebellar ROI1 and bilateral angular gyrus at a voxel threshold (p &amp;lt; 0.001, two-tailed) and at a cluster level (p &amp;lt; 0.05, FDR-corrected). Group differences were non-significant for ROI2 and ROI3. Conclusions: These results contribute to the development of a systems neuroscience approach to the diagnosis and treatment of MDD. Specifically, our findings confirm previously reported associations between MDD, DMN, and cerebellum, and highlight the promising role of these functional and anatomical locations for the development of novel imaging-based biomarkers and targets for neuromodulation therapies.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Chronic adolescent stress increases exploratory behavior but does not change the acute stress response in adult male C57BL/6 mice</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.25.449581v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Chronic stress exposure in adolescence can lead to a lasting change in stress responsiveness later in life and is associated with increased mental health issues in adulthood. Here we investigate whether the Chronic Social Instability (CSI) paradigm in mice influences the behavioural and molecular responses to novel acute stressors, and whether it alters physiological responses influenced by the noradrenergic system. Using large cohorts of mice, we show that CSI mice display a persistent increase in exploratory behaviors in the open field test alongside small but widespread transcriptional changes in the ventral hippocampus. However, both the transcriptomic and behavioural responses to novel acute stressors are indistinguishable between groups. In addition, the pupillometric response to a tail shock, known to be mediated by the noradrenergic system, remains unaltered in CSI mice. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography analysis of monoaminergic neurotransmitter levels in the ventral hippocampus also shows no differences between control or CSI mice at baseline or in response to acute stress. We conclude that CSI exposure during adolescence leads to persistent changes in exploratory behavior and gene expression in the hippocampus, but it does not alter the response to acute stress challenges in adulthood and is unlikely to alter the function of the noradrenergic system.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The avian dorsal telencephalon contains discrete areas receiving visual, auditory, and trigeminal ascending projections. Recent studies have shown that the auditory and the visual regions embodied “columnar and layered” cytoarchitectural motifs, which bears a striking resemblance to that of the mammalian sensory cortices.  At present, it is not known to what extent this type of organization also extends to the trigemino‐recipient area. The question is of interest, since afferents forming this sensory pathway are exceptionally not thalamic but rhombencephalic in origin. We investigated this question by placing minute injections of neural tracers into selected locations of vital slices of the chicken telencephalon. We conclude that the trigeminal area share, to a detailed level, a common columnar‐layered neuroarchitectectonic motif with other sensory areas.







ABSTRACT
The dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR), which is the largest component of the avian pallium, contains discrete partitions receiving tectovisual, auditory, and trigeminal ascending projections. Recent studies have shown that the auditory and the tectovisual regions can be regarded as complexes composed of three highly interconnected layers: an internal senso‐recipient one, an intermediate afferent/efferent one, and a more external re‐entrant one. Cells located in homotopic positions in each of these layers are reciprocally linked by an interlaminar loop of axonal processes, forming columnar‐like local circuits. Whether this type of organization also extends to the trigemino‐recipient DVR is, at present, not known. This question is of interest, since afferents forming this sensory pathway, exceptional among amniotes, are not thalamic but rhombencephalic in origin. We investigated this question by placing minute injections of neural tracers into selected locations of vital slices of the chicken telencephalon. We found that neurons of the trigemino‐recipient nucleus basorostralis pallii (Bas) establish reciprocal, columnar and homotopical projections with cells located in the overlying ventral mesopallium (MV). &quot;Column‐forming&quot; axons originated in B and MV terminate also in the intermediate strip, the fronto‐trigeminal nidopallium (NFT), in a restricted manner. We also found that the NFT and an internal partition of B originate substantial, coarse‐topographic projections to the underlying portion of the lateral striatum. We conclude that all sensory areas of the DVR are organized according to a common neuroarchitectonic motif, which bears a striking resemblance to that of the radial/laminar intrinsic circuits of the sensory cortices of mammals.

	<content:encoded>A critical way for humans to acquire, represent and communicate information is through language, yet the underlying computation mechanisms through which language contributes to our word meaning representations are poorly understood. We compared three major types of word computation mechanisms from large language corpus (simple co-occurrence, graph-space relations and neural-network-vector-embedding relations) in terms of the association of words brain activity patterns, measured by two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments. Word relations derived from a graph-space representation, and not neural-network-vector-embedding, had unique explanatory power for the neural activity patterns in brain regions that have been shown to be particularly sensitive to language processes, including the anterior temporal lobe (capturing graph-common-neighbors), inferior frontal gyrus, and posterior middle/inferior temporal gyrus (capturing graph-shortest-path). These results were robust across different window sizes and graph sizes and were relatively specific to language inputs. These findings highlight the role of cumulative language inputs in organizing word meaning neural representations and provide a mathematical model to explain how different brain regions capture different types of language-derived information.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Oxytocin receptors influence the development and maintenance of social behavior in zebrafish (Danio rerio).</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.26.449566v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Zebrafish are highly social teleost fish and an excellent model to study social behavior. The neuropeptide Oxytocin is associated different social behaviors as well as disorders resulting in social impairment like autism spectrum disorder. However, how Oxytocin receptor signaling affects the development and expression kinetics of social behavior is not known. In this study we investigated the role of the two oxytocin receptors, Oxtr and Oxtrl, in the development and maintenance of social preference and shoaling behavior in 2- to 8-week-old zebrafish. Using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated oxtr and oxtrl knock-out fish, we found that the development of social preference is accelerated if one of the Oxytocin receptors is knocked-out and that the knock-out fish reach significantly higher levels of social preference. Moreover, oxtr -/- fish showed impairments in the maintenance of social preference. Social isolation prior to testing led to impaired maintenance of social preference in both wild-type and oxtr and oxtrl knock-out fish. Knocking-out one of the Oxytocin receptors also led to increased group spacing and reduced polarization in a 20-fish shoal at 8 weeks post fertilization, but not at 4. These results show that the development and maintenance of social behavior is influenced by the Oxytocin receptors and that the effects are not just pro- or antisocial, but dependent on both the age and social context of the fish.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Dopamine reports reward prediction errors, but does not update policy, during inference-guided choice</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.25.449995v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Dopamine is thought to carry reward prediction errors (RPEs), which update values and hence modify future behaviour. However, updating values is not always the most efficient way of adapting to change. If previously encountered situations will be revisited in future, inferring that the state of the world has changed allows prior experience to be reused when situations are reencountered. To probe dopamines involvement in such inference-based behavioural flexibility, we measured and manipulated dopamine while mice solved a sequential decision task using state inference. Dopamine was strongly influenced by the value of states and actions, consistent with RPE signalling, using value information that respected task structure. However, though dopamine responded strongly to rewards, stimulating dopamine at the time of trial outcome had no effect on subsequent choice. Therefore, when inference guides choice, rewards have a dopamine-independent influence on policy through the information they carry about the worlds state.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Automated movement assessment in stroke rehabilitation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.25.449936v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>We are developing a system for long term Semi-Automated Rehabilitation At the Home (SARAH) that relies on low-cost and unobtrusive video-based sensing. We present a cyber-human methodology used by the SARAH system for automated assessment of upper extremity stroke rehabilitation at the home. We propose a hierarchical model for automatically segmenting stroke survivors movements and generating training task performance assessment scores during rehabilitation. The hierarchical model fuses expert therapist knowledge-based approaches with data-driven techniques. The expert knowledge is more observable in the higher layers of the hierarchy (task and segment) and therefore more accessible to algorithms incorporating high level constraints relating to activity structure (i.e. type and order of segments per task). We utilize an HMM and a Decision Tree model to connect these high level priors to data driven analysis. The lower layers (RGB images and raw kinematics) need to be addressed primarily through data driven techniques. We use a transformer based architecture operating on low-level action features (tracking of individual body joints and objects) and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network(MS-TCN) operating on raw RGB images. We develop a sequence combining these complimentary algorithms effectively, thus encoding the information from different layers of the movement hierarchy. Through this combination, we produce a robust segmentation and task assessment results on noisy, variable and limited data, which is characteristic of low cost video capture of rehabilitation at the home. Our proposed approach achieves 85% accuracy in per-frame labeling, 99% accuracy in segment classification and 93% accuracy in task completion assessment. Although the methodology proposed in this paper applies to upper extremity rehabilitation using the SARAH system, it can potentially be used, with minor alterations, to assist automation in many other movement rehabilitation contexts (i.e. lower extremity training for neurological accidents).</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Despite being extensively modelled to explore decision making processes in economic tasks, there are no studies exploring the neurophysiological correlates of the Predator-Prey Game, a game theory paradigm designed to operationalize attack and defence conflicts. In the present study, we explored the relationship between the ERP components associated with feedback, namely feedback-related negativity (FRN) and feedback -elated P3b, and investment in an adapted version of the Predator-Prey Game (PPG), operationalizing attack and defence. Forty-seven (28 female) community-dwelling volunteers without history of neurological disease were recruited. Participants played the PPG game both as attackers and defenders while EEG signal was recorded with a 128 channels sensor net. Behavioural results showed that individuals tend to invest more and decide faster when playing in defence, rather than in attack. Electrophysiological data showed FRN to be sensitive to the valence of feedback, with increased amplitudes of FRN loss feedbacks. On the other hand, the P3b amplitudes were sensitive to the role, with increased amplitude for attack when compared with defence. The integration of the behavioural and ERP findings supports the theoretical model positing that attack elicits more deliberate and less automatic brain processes than defence.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.25.449907v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>By means of an expansive innervation, the relatively few phylogenetically-old serotonin (5-HT) neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) are positioned to enact coordinated modulation of circuits distributed across the entire brain in order to adaptively regulate behavior. In turn, the activity of the DRN is driven by a broad set of excitatory inputs, yet the resulting network computations that naturally emerge from the excitability and connectivity features of the various cellular elements of the DRN are still unknown. To gain insight into these computations, we developed a flexible experimental and computational framework based on a combination of automatic characterization and network simulations of augmented generalized integrate-and-fire (aGIF) single-cell models. This approach enabled the examination of causal relationships between specific excitability features and identified population computations. We found that feedforward inhibition of 5-HT neurons by heterogeneous DRN somatostatin (SOM) neurons implemented divisive inhibition, while endocannabinoid-mediated modulation of excitatory drive to the DRN increased the gain of 5-HT output. The most striking computation that arose from this work was the ability of 5-HT output to linearly encode the derivative of the excitatory inputs to the DRN. This network computation primarily emerged from the prominent adaptation mechanisms found in 5-HT neurons, including a previously undescribed dynamic threshold. This novel computation in the DRN provides a potential mechanism underlying some of the functions recently ascribed to 5-HT in the context of reinforcement learning.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.25.449874v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In clinical practice, human sleep is classified into stages, each associated with different levels of muscular activity and marked by characteristic patterns in the EEG signals. It is however unclear whether this subdivision into discrete stages with sharply defined boundaries is truly reflecting the dynamics of human sleep. To address this question, we consider one-channel EEG signals as heterogeneous random walks: stochastic processes controlled by hyper-parameters that are themselves time-dependent. We first demonstrate the heterogeneity of the random process by showing that each sleep stage has a characteristic distribution and temporal correlation function of the raw EEG signals. Next, we perform a superstatistical analysis by computing  hyper-parameters, such as the standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness of the raw signal distributions, within subsequent 30-second epochs. It turns out that also the hyper-parameters have characteristic, sleep-stage-dependent distributions, which can be exploited for a simple Bayesian sleep stage detection. Moreover, we find that the hyper-parameters are not piece-wise constant, as the traditional hypnograms would suggest, but show rising or falling trends within and across sleep stages, pointing to an underlying continuous rather than subdivided process that controls human sleep.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Ipsilesional motor cortex activation with high-force unimanual handgrip contractions of the less-affected limb in participants with stroke</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.25.449456v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Stroke is a leading cause of severe disability that often presents with unilateral motor impairment. Conventional rehabilitation approaches focus on motor practice of the affected limb and aim to suppress brain activity in the contralesional hemisphere to facilitate ipsilesional hemispheric neuroplasticity subserving motor recovery. Previous research has also demonstrated that exercise of the less-affected limb can promote motor recovery of the affected limb through the interlimb transfer of the trained motor task, termed cross-education. One of the leading theories for cross-education proposes that the interlimb transfer manifests from ipsilateral cortical activity during unimanual motor tasks, and that this ipsilateral cortical activity results in motor related neuroplasticity giving rise to contralateral improvements in motor performance. Conversely, exercise of the less-affected limb promotes contralesional brain activity which is typically viewed as contraindicated in stroke recovery due to the interhemispheric inhibitory influence onto the ipsilesional hemisphere. High-force unimanual handgrip contractions are known to increase ipsilateral brain activation in control participants, but it remains to be determined if this would be observed in participants with stroke. Therefore, this study aimed to determine how parametric increases in handgrip force during repeated contractions with the less-affected limb impacts brain activity bilaterally in participants with stroke and in a cohort of neurologically intact controls. In this study, higher force contractions were found to increase brain activation in the ipsilesional/ipsilateral hemisphere in both groups (p = .002), but no between group differences were observed. These data suggest that high-force exercise with the less-affected limb may promote ipsilesional cortical plasticity to promote motor recovery of the affected-limb in participants with stroke.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Cognitive Functions in Adult‐Onset Phenotypes of X‐Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26141?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
X‐linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X‐ALD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive demyelination ranging from mild myelopathic forms (adrenomyeloneuropathy [AMN]) to severe cerebral variants (adult cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy [ACALD]). The aim of this study was to compare cognitive function in adult‐onset X‐ALD phenotypes.


Methods
Cognitive function in various domains (intelligence, attention, memory, executive function, and processing speed) was assessed in 172 adults (117 with AMN, 30 with arrested ACALD, and 25 with acute ACALD) using comprehensive neuropsychological batteries. Phenotype differences were examined by analyses of variance.


Results
X‐ALD phenotypes significantly differed in nonverbal intelligence, sustained attention, verbal encoding, nonverbal recognition, and processing speed (ps &amp;lt; 0.050). No group differences emerged regarding verbal intelligence, verbal retrieval and recognition, and executive function (ps &amp;gt; 0.050). Specifically, patients with acute ACALD showed severe cognitive deficits compared to AMN and normal data, with largest effects on processing speed. Contrary, cognition was overall intact in patients with AMN, independent of sex and corticospinal tract involvement, and those with arrested ACALD showed mild cognitive dysfunction, particularly in verbal encoding and processing speed.


Interpretation
Cerebral demyelination in patients with X‐ALD causes white matter dementia, mainly characterized by an extreme slowdown in processing speed associated with deficits in attention and learning. Most patients with AMN show intact cognitive function. Future prospective, longitudinal studies with more sensitive imaging techniques are required to clarify whether early mild cognitive dysfunction found in some patients with AMN may be associated with subtle myelin abnormalities that do not yet appear as white matter lesions on cerebral MRI (cMRI) but have the potential to serve as early predictors of later cerebral progression.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23373?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is an extraordinary form of plasticity fundamental for cognitive flexibility. Recent evidence showed that newborn neurons differentially modulate input to the infra‐ and supra‐pyramidal blades of the DG during the processing of spatial and contextual information, respectively. However, how this differential regulation by neurogenesis is translated into different aspects contributing cognitive flexibility is unclear. Here, we increased adult‐born neurons by a genetic expansion of neural stem cells and studied their influence during navigational learning. We found that increased neurogenesis improved both memory precision and flexibility. Interestingly, each of these gains was associated with distinct subregional patterns of activity and better separation of memory representations in the DG‐CA3 network. Our results highlight the role of adult‐born neurons in promoting memory precision and indexing and suggests their anatomical allocation within specific DG‐CA3 compartments, together contributing to cognitive flexibility.</content:encoded>

Abstract
Understanding and diagnosing cognitive impairment in epilepsy remains a prominent challenge. New etiological models suggest that cognitive difficulties might not be directly linked to seizure activity, but are rather a manifestation of a broader brain pathology. Consequently, treating seizures is not sufficient to alleviate cognitive symptoms, highlighting the need for novel diagnostic tools. Here, we investigated whether the organization of three intrinsic, resting‐state functional connectivity networks was correlated with domain‐specific cognitive test performance. Using individualized EEG source reconstruction and graph theory, we examined the association between network small worldness and cognitive test performance in 23 patients with focal epilepsy and 17 healthy controls, who underwent a series of standardized pencil‐and‐paper and digital cognitive tests. We observed that the specific networks robustly correlated with test performance in distinct cognitive domains. Specifically, correlations were evident between the default mode network and memory in patients, the central‐executive network and executive functioning in controls, and the salience network and social cognition in both groups. Interestingly, the correlations were evident in both groups, but in different domains, suggesting an alteration in these functional neurocognitive networks in focal epilepsy. The present findings highlight the potential clinical relevance of functional brain network dysfunction in cognitive impairment.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Mimicking partial to total placental insufficiency in a rabbit model of cerebral palsy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24901?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>A new model of Partial+Full uterine ischemia mimicking the transition from partial to total placental abruption in humans was developed in rabbits. Similar neurobehavioral deficits but worse cell viability ex vivo were found in the new Partial+Full uterine ischemia model compared to the previous Full uterine ischemia model.

Abstract
All placental abruptions begin as partial abruptions, which sometimes manifest as fetal bradycardia. The progression from partial to total abruption was mimicked by a new rabbit model of placental insufficiency, and we compared it, with sufficient statistical power, with the previous model mimicking total placental abruption. The previous model uses total uterine ischemia at E22 or E25 (70% or 79% term, respectively), in pregnant New Zealand white rabbits for 40 min (Full H‐I). The new model, Partial+Full H‐I, added a 30‐min partial ischemia before the 40‐min total ischemia. Fetuses were delivered either at E31.5 (full term) vaginally for neurobehavior testing, or by C‐section at E25 for ex vivo brain cell viability evaluation. The onset of fetal bradycardia was within the first 2 min of either H‐I protocol. There was no difference between Full H‐I (n = 442 for E22, 312 for E25) and Partial+Full H‐I (n = 154 and 80) groups in death or severely affected kits at E22 (76% vs. 79%) or at E25 (66% vs. 64%), or normal kits at E22 or E25, or any of the individual newborn neurobehavioral tests at any age. No sex differences were found. Partial+Full H‐I (n = 6) showed less cell viability than Full H‐I (n = 8) at 72‐hr ex vivo in the brain regions studied. Partial+Full H‐I insult produced similar cerebral palsy phenotype as our previous Full H‐I model in a sufficiently powered study and may be more suitable for testing of potential neuroprotectants.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A unique cerebellar pattern of microglia activation in a mousemodel of encephalopathy of prematurity</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.26.449853v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Preterm infants often show pathologies of the cerebellum, which are associated with impaired motor performance, lower IQ and poor language skills at school ages. Because 1 in 10 babies is born preterm cerebellar injury is a significant clinical problem. The causes of cerebellar damage are yet to be fully explained. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that perinatal inflammatory stimuli may play a key role in cerebellar injury of preterm infants. We undertook our studies in an established mouse model of inflammation-induced encephalopathy of prematurity driven by systemic administration of the prototypic pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}). Inflammation is induced between postnatal day (P) 1 to day 5, timing equivalent to the last trimester for brain development in humans the period of vulnerability to preterm birth related brain injury. We investigated acute and long-term consequences for the cerebellum on brain volume expansion, oligodendroglial maturation, myelin levels and the microglial transcriptome. Perinatal inflammation induced global mouse brain volume reductions, including specific grey and white matter volume reductions in cerebellar lobules I and II (5% FDR) in IL-1{beta} versus control treated mice from P15 onwards. Oligodendroglia damage preceded the MRI-detectable volume changes, as evidenced by a reduced proliferation of OLIG2+ cells at P10 and reduced levels of the myelin proteins MOG, MBP and MAG at P10 and P15. Increased density of Iba1+ cerebellar microglia was observed at P5 and P45, with evidence for increased microglial proliferation at P5 and P10. Comparison of the transcriptome of microglia isolated from P5 cerebelli and cerebrum revealed significant enrichment of pro-inflammatory markers in microglia from both regions, but in the cerebellum microglia displayed a unique type I interferon signalling dysregulation. Collectively, these data suggest that in our model that systemic inflammation causes chronic activation of microglia and maldevelopment of cerebellum that includes myelin deficits which is driven in the cerebellum by type I interferon signalling. Future protective strategies for preterm infants should consider sustained type I interferon signalling driven cerebellar inflammation as an important target.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.25.449912v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cognitive-relevant information is processed by different brain areas that cooperate to eventually produce a response. The relationship between local activity and global brain states during such processes, however, remains for the most part unexplored. To address this question, we designed a simple face-recognition task performed in drug-resistant epileptic patients with intracranial EEG. Based on our observations, we developed a novel analytical framework (named &quot;local-global&quot; framework) to statistically correlate the brain activity in every recorded gray-matter region with the coupling functions as proxy to assess the level of influence of local neural activations into the brains global state during cognition. The application of our analysis to the data from two subjects was able to detect the local activity in task-relevant brain areas including the primary visual and motor cortices. Despite substantial differences in the recorded regions of each subject, the coupling functions consistently showed a significant global desynchronization occurring a few hundred milliseconds after the stimulus onset. In this context, the local-global framework revealed that the reported desynchronization was better explained by the local activity of brain areas involved in face information processing, providing evidence that the global measures might be a novel signature of functional brain activity reorganization taking place when a stimulus is processed in a task context.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Brain-age (BA) estimates based on deep learning are increasingly used as neuroimaging biomarker for brain health; however, the underlying neural features have remained unclear. We combined ensembles of convolutional neural networks with Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to detect which brain features contribute to BA. Trained on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of a population-based study (n=2637, 18-82 years), our models estimated age accurately based on single and multiple modalities, regionally restricted and whole-brain images (mean absolute errors 3.38-5.07 years). We find that BA estimates capture aging at both small and large-scale changes, revealing gross enlargements of ventricles and subarachnoid spaces, as well as lesions, iron accumulations and atrophies that appear throughout the brain. Divergence from expected aging reflected cardiovascular risk factors and accelerated aging was more pronounced in the frontal lobe. Applying LRP, our study demonstrates how superior deep learning models detect brain-aging in healthy and at-risk individuals throughout adulthood.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.25.449758v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Aesthetic experiences have an influence on many aspects of life. Interest in the neural basis of aesthetic experiences has grown rapidly in the past decade, and fMRI studies have identified several brain systems supporting aesthetic experiences. Work on the rapid neuronal dynamics of aesthetic experience, however, is relatively scarce. The present study adds to this field by investigating the experience of being aesthetically moved by means of ERP and time-frequency analysis. Participants EEG was recorded while they viewed a diverse set of artworks and evaluated the extent to which these artworks moved them. Results show that being aesthetically moved is associated with a sustained increase in gamma activity over centroparietal regions. Also, alpha power over right frontocentral regions was reduced in high and low moving images, compared to artworks given intermediate ratings. We interpret the gamma effect as an indication for sustained savoring processes for aesthetically moving artworks compared to aesthetically less moving artworks. The alpha effect is interpreted as an indication of increased attention for aesthetically salient images. In contrast to previous works, we observed no significant effects in any of the established ERP components, but we did observe effects at latencies longer than 1 s. We conclude that EEG time-frequency analysis provides useful information on the neuronal dynamics of aesthetic experience.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Longitudinal CSF Iron Pathway Proteins in Posthemorrhagic Hydrocephalus: Associations with Ventricle Size and Neurodevelopmental Outcomes</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26133?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Iron has been implicated in the pathogenesis of brain injury and hydrocephalus after preterm germinal matrix hemorrhage‐intraventricular hemorrhage, however, it is unknown how external or endogenous intraventricular clearance of iron pathway proteins affect the outcome in this group.


Methods
This prospective multicenter cohort included patients with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) who underwent (1) temporary and permanent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion and (2) Bayley Scales of Infant Development‐III testing around 2 years of age. CSF proteins in the iron handling pathway were analyzed longitudinally and compared to ventricle size and neurodevelopmental outcomes.


Results
Thirty‐seven patients met inclusion criteria with a median estimated gestational age at birth of 25 weeks; 65% were boys. Ventricular CSF levels of hemoglobin, iron, total bilirubin, and ferritin decreased between temporary and permanent CSF diversion with no change in CSF levels of ceruloplasmin, transferrin, haptoglobin, and hepcidin. There was an increase in CSF hemopexin during this interval. Larger ventricle size at permanent CSF diversion was associated with elevated CSF ferritin (p = 0.015) and decreased CSF hemopexin (p = 0.007). CSF levels of proteins at temporary CSF diversion were not associated with outcome, however, higher CSF transferrin at permanent CSF diversion was associated with improved cognitive outcome (p = 0.015). Importantly, longitudinal change in CSF iron pathway proteins, ferritin (decrease), and transferrin (increase) were associated with improved cognitive (p = 0.04) and motor (p = 0.03) scores and improved cognitive (p = 0.04), language (p = 0.035), and motor (p = 0.008) scores, respectively.


Interpretation
Longitudinal changes in CSF transferrin (increase) and ferritin (decrease) are associated with improved neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonatal PHH, with implications for understanding the pathogenesis of poor outcomes in PHH. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

The vasculature is a dynamic structure, growing and regressing in response to embryonic development, growth, changing physiological demands, wound healing, tumor growth and other stimuli. At the microvascular level, network geometry is not predetermined, but emerges as a result of biological responses of each vessel to the stimuli that it receives. These responses may be summarized as angiogenesis, remodeling and pruning. Previous theoretical simulations have shown how two-dimensional vascular patterns generated by these processes in the mesentery are consistent with experimental observations. During early development of the brain, a mesh-like network of vessels is formed on the surface of the cerebral cortex. This network then forms branches into the cortex, forming a three-dimensional network throughout its thickness. Here, a theoretical model is presented for this process, based on known or hypothesized vascular response mechanisms together with experimentally obtained information on the structure and hemodynamics of the mouse cerebral cortex. According to this model, essential components of the system include sensing of oxygen levels in the midrange of partial pressures and conducted responses in vessel walls that propagate information about metabolic needs of the tissue to upstream segments of the network. The model provides insights into the effects of deficits in vascular response mechanisms, and can be used to generate physiologically realistic microvascular network structures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VPEXfJ89jhk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Multi-host pathogens are particularly difficult to control, especially when at least one of the hosts acts as a hidden reservoir. Deep sequencing of densely sampled pathogens has the potential to transform this understanding, but requires analytical approaches that jointly consider epidemiological and genetic data to best address this problem. While there has been considerable success in analyses of single species systems, the hidden reservoir problem is relatively under-studied. A well-known exemplar of this problem is bovine Tuberculosis, a disease found in British and Irish cattle caused by &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium bovis&lt;/i&gt;, where the Eurasian badger has long been believed to act as a reservoir but remains of poorly quantified importance except in very specific locations. As a result, the effort that should be directed at controlling disease in badgers is unclear. Here, we analyse densely collected epidemiological and genetic data from a cattle population but do not explicitly consider any data from badgers. We use a simulation modelling approach to show that, in our system, a model that exploits available cattle demographic and herd-to-herd movement data, but only considers the ability of a hidden reservoir to generate pathogen diversity, can be used to choose between different epidemiological scenarios. In our analysis, a model where the reservoir does not generate any diversity but contributes to new infections at a local farm scale are significantly preferred over models which generate diversity and/or spread disease at broader spatial scales. While we cannot directly attribute the role of the reservoir to badgers based on this analysis alone, the result supports the hypothesis that under current cattle control regimes, infected cattle alone cannot sustain &lt;i&gt;M. bovis&lt;/i&gt; circulation. Given the observed close phylogenetic relationship for the bacteria taken from cattle and badgers sampled near to each other, the most parsimonious hypothesis is that the reservoir is the infected badger population. More broadly, our approach demonstrates that carefully constructed bespoke models can exploit the combination of genetic and epidemiological data to overcome issues of extreme data bias, and uncover important general characteristics of transmission in multi-host pathogen systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Pa194nrlbRQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Standing and walking balance control in humans relies on the transformation of sensory information to motor commands that drive muscles. Here, we evaluated whether sensorimotor transformations underlying walking balance control can be described by task-level center of mass kinematics feedback similar to standing balance control. We found that delayed linear feedback of center of mass position and velocity, but not delayed linear feedback from ankle angles and angular velocities, can explain reactive ankle muscle activity and joint moments in response to perturbations of walking across protocols (discrete and continuous platform translations and discrete pelvis pushes). Feedback gains were modulated during the gait cycle and decreased with walking speed. Our results thus suggest that similar task-level variables, i.e. center of mass position and velocity, are controlled across standing and walking but that feedback gains are modulated during gait to accommodate changes in body configuration during the gait cycle and in stability with walking speed. These findings have important implications for modelling the neuromechanics of human balance control and for biomimetic control of wearable robotic devices. The feedback mechanisms we identified can be used to extend the current neuromechanical models that lack balance control mechanisms for the ankle joint. When using these models in the control of wearable robotic devices, we believe that this will facilitate shared control of balance between the user and the robotic device.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VcMU5775s_I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Free-living bacteria adapt to environmental change by reprogramming gene expression through precise interactions of hundreds of DNA-binding proteins. A predictive understanding of bacterial physiology requires us to globally monitor all such protein–DNA interactions across a range of environmental and genetic perturbations. Here, we show that such global observations are possible using an optimized version of in vivo protein occupancy display technology (in vivo protein occupancy display—high resolution, IPOD-HR) and present a pilot application to &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. We observe that the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; protein–DNA interactome organizes into 2 distinct prototypic features: (1) highly dynamic condition-dependent transcription factor (TF) occupancy; and (2) robust kilobase scale occupancy by nucleoid factors, forming silencing domains analogous to eukaryotic heterochromatin. We show that occupancy dynamics across a range of conditions can rapidly reveal the global transcriptional regulatory organization of a bacterium. Beyond discovery of previously hidden regulatory logic, we show that these observations can be utilized to computationally determine sequence specificity models for the majority of active TFs. Our study demonstrates that global observations of protein occupancy combined with statistical inference can rapidly and systematically reveal the transcriptional regulatory and structural features of a bacterial genome. This capacity is particularly crucial for non-model bacteria that are not amenable to routine genetic manipulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/1yPs-rhAA7U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional networks are ubiquitous in deep learning. They are particularly
useful for images, as they reduce the number of parameters, reduce training
time, and increase accuracy. However, as a model of the brain they are
seriously problematic, since they require weight sharing - something real
neurons simply cannot do. Consequently, while neurons in the brain can be
locally connected (one of the features of convolutional networks), they cannot
be convolutional. Locally connected but non-convolutional networks, however,
significantly underperform convolutional ones. This is troublesome for studies
that use convolutional networks to explain activity in the visual system. Here
we study plausible alternatives to weight sharing that aim at the same
regularization principle, which is to make each neuron within a pool react
similarly to identical inputs. The most natural way to do that is by showing
the network multiple translations of the same image, akin to saccades in animal
vision. However, this approach requires many translations, and doesn't remove
the performance gap. We propose instead to add lateral connectivity to a
locally connected network, and allow learning via Hebbian plasticity. This
requires the network to pause occasionally for a sleep-like phase of &quot;weight
sharing&quot;. This method enables locally connected networks to achieve nearly
convolutional performance on ImageNet, thus supporting convolutional networks

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Evaluation of deep lift pose models for 3D rodent pose estimation based on geometrically triangulated data. (arXiv:2106.12993v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12993</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The assessment of laboratory animal behavior is of central interest in modern
neuroscience research. Behavior is typically studied in terms of pose changes,
which are ideally captured in three dimensions. This requires triangulation
over a multi-camera system which view the animal from different angles.
However, this is challenging in realistic laboratory setups due to occlusions
and other technical constrains. Here we propose the usage of lift-pose models
that allow for robust 3D pose estimation of freely moving rodents from a single
view camera view. To obtain high-quality training data for the pose-lifting, we
first perform geometric calibration in a camera setup involving bottom as well
as side views of the behaving animal. We then evaluate the performance of two
previously proposed model architectures under given inference perspectives and
conclude that reliable 3D pose inference can be obtained using temporal
convolutions. With this work we would like to contribute to a more robust and
diverse behavior tracking of freely moving rodents for a wide range of
experiments and setups in the neuroscience community.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12901</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The recurrent network architecture is a widely used model in sequence
modeling, but its serial dependency hinders the computation parallelization,
which makes the operation inefficient. The same problem was encountered in
serial adder at the early stage of digital electronics. In this paper, we
discuss the similarities between recurrent neural network (RNN) and serial
adder. Inspired by carry-lookahead adder, we introduce carry-lookahead module
to RNN, which makes it possible for RNN to run in parallel. Then, we design the
method of parallel RNN computation, and finally Carry-lookahead RNN (CL-RNN) is
proposed. CL-RNN takes advantages in parallelism and flexible receptive field.
Through a comprehensive set of tests, we verify that CL-RNN can perform better
than existing typical RNNs in sequence modeling tasks which are specially
designed for RNNs.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In certain situations, Neural Networks (NN) are trained upon data that obey
underlying physical symmetries. However, it is not guaranteed that NNs will
obey the underlying symmetry unless embedded in the network structure. In this
work, we explore a special kind of symmetry where functions are invariant with
respect to involutory linear/affine transformations up to parity $p=\pm 1$. We
develop mathematical theorems and propose NN architectures that ensure
invariance and universal approximation properties. Numerical experiments
indicate that the proposed models outperform baseline networks while respecting
the imposed symmetry. An adaption of our technique to convolutional NN
classification tasks for datasets with inherent horizontal/vertical reflection
symmetry has also been proposed.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Evolving Hierarchical Memory-Prediction Machines in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning. (arXiv:2106.12659v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12659</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental aspect of behaviour is the ability to encode salient features
of experience in memory and use these memories, in combination with current
sensory information, to predict the best action for each situation such that
long-term objectives are maximized. The world is highly dynamic, and
behavioural agents must generalize across a variety of environments and
objectives over time. This scenario can be modeled as a partially-observable
multi-task reinforcement learning problem. We use genetic programming to evolve
highly-generalized agents capable of operating in six unique environments from
the control literature, including OpenAI's entire Classic Control suite. This
requires the agent to support discrete and continuous actions simultaneously.
No task-identification sensor inputs are provided, thus agents must identify
tasks from the dynamics of state variables alone and define control policies
for each task. We show that emergent hierarchical structure in the evolving
programs leads to multi-task agents that succeed by performing a temporal
decomposition and encoding of the problem environments in memory. The resulting
agents are competitive with task-specific agents in all six environments.
Furthermore, the hierarchical structure of programs allows for dynamic run-time
complexity, which results in relatively efficient operation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.6140</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose theoretical methods to infer coupling strength and noise intensity
simultaneously through an observation of spike timing in two well-synchronized
noisy oscillators. A phase oscillator model is applied to derive formulae
relating each of the parameters to some statistics from spike-time data. Using
these formulae, each parameter is inferred from a specific set of statistics.
We demonstrate the methods with the FitzHugh-Nagumo model as well as the phase
model. Our methods do not require any external perturbation and thus are ready
for application to various experimental systems.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Moderate Ethanol Pre-treatment Mitigates ICH-Induced Injury via ER Stress Modulation in Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.682775</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening type of stroke that disrupts the normal neurological function of the brain. Clinical studies have reported a non-linear J-shaped association between alcohol consumption levels and the occurrence of cerebral stroke. Specifically, alcohol intoxication increases stroke incidence, while moderate alcohol pre-conditioning decreases stroke frequency and improves outcomes. Although alcohol pre-consumption is likely a crucial player in ICH, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We performed 1-h alcohol pre-conditioning followed by ICH induction in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to investigate the role of alcohol pre-conditioning in ICH. Interestingly, behavioral test analysis found that ethanol intoxication (3 g/kg) aggravated ICH-induced neurological deficits, but moderate ethanol pre-conditioning (0.75 g/kg) ameliorated ICH-induced neurological deficits by reducing the oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines release. Moreover, we found that moderate ethanol pretreatment improved the striatal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis by increasing the chaperone protein expression and reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis caused by ICH. Our findings show that the mechanism regulated by moderate ethanol pre-conditioning might be beneficial for ICH, indicating the importance of ER homeostasis, oxidative stress, and differential cytokines release in ICH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.671779</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microtubule-associated protein tau forms insoluble neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which is one of the major histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Many studies have demonstrated that tau causes early functional deficits prior to the formation of neurofibrillary aggregates. The redistribution of tau from axons to the somatodendritic compartment of neurons and dendritic spines causes synaptic impairment, and then leads to the loss of synaptic contacts that correlates better with cognitive deficits than amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates do in AD patients. In this review, we discuss the underlying mechanisms by which tau is mislocalized to dendritic spines and contributes to synaptic dysfunction in AD. We also discuss the synergistic effects of tau and oligomeric forms of Aβ on promoting synaptic dysfunction in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: T2-Weighted Whole-Brain Intracranial Vessel Wall Imaging at 3 Tesla With Cerebrospinal Fluid Suppression</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.665076</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;w) intracranial vessel wall imaging (IVWI) provides good contrast to differentiate intracranial vasculopathies and discriminate various important plaque components. However, the strong cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal in T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;w images interferes with depicting the intracranial vessel wall. In this study, we propose a T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-prepared sequence for whole-brain IVWI at 3T with CSF suppression.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A preparation module that combines T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; preparation and inversion recovery (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IR) was used to suppress the CSF signal and was incorporated into the commercial three-dimensional (3D) turbo spin echo sequence-Sampling Perfection with Application optimized Contrast using different flip angle Evolution (SPACE). This new technique (hereafter called T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IR-SPACE) was evaluated on nine healthy volunteers and compared with two other commonly used 3D T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted sequences: T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;w-SPACE and FLAIR-SPACE (FLAIR: fluid-attenuated inversion recovery). The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the vessel wall (VW) and CSF and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) between them were measured and compared among these three T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted sequences. Subjective wall visualization of the three T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted sequences was scored blindly and independently by two radiologists using a four-point scale followed by inter-rater reproducibility analysis. A pilot study of four stroke patients was performed to preliminarily evaluate the diagnostic value of this new sequence, which was compared with two conventional T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted sequences.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IR-SPACE had the highest CNR (11.01 ± 6.75) compared with FLAIR-SPACE (4.49 ± 3.15; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;w-SPACE (−56.16 ± 18.58; p &amp;lt; 0.001). The subjective wall visualization score of T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IR-SPACE was higher than those of FLAIR-SPACE and T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;w-SPACE (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IR-SPACE: 2.35 ± 0.59; FLAIR-SPACE: 0.52 ± 0.54; T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;w-SPACE: 1.67 ± 0.58); the two radiologists’ scores showed excellent agreement (ICC = 0.883).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IR preparation module markedly suppressed the CSF signal without much SNR loss of the other tissues (i.e., vessel wall, white matter, and gray matter) compared with the IR pulse. Our results suggest that T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IR-SPACE is a potential alternative T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted sequence for assessing intracranial vascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motivated by the challenge of investigating the reproducibility of spiking neural network simulations, we have developed the Arpra library: an open source C library for arbitrary precision range analysis based on the mixed Interval Arithmetic (IA)/Affine Arithmetic (AA) method. Arpra builds on this method by implementing a novel mixed trimmed IA/AA, in which the error terms of AA ranges are minimised using information from IA ranges. Overhead rounding error is minimised by computing intermediate values as extended precision variables using the MPFR library. This optimisation is most useful in cases where the ratio of overhead error to range width is high. Three novel affine term reduction strategies improve memory efficiency by merging affine terms of lesser significance. We also investigate the viability of using mixed trimmed IA/AA and other AA methods for studying reproducibility in unstable spiking neural network simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sensory-Induced Human LTP-Like Synaptic Plasticity – Using Visual Evoked Potentials to Explore the Relation Between LTP-Like Synaptic Plasticity and Visual Perceptual Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.684573</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Stimulus-selective response modulation (SRM) of sensory evoked potentials represents a well-established non-invasive index of long-term potentiation-like (LTP-like) synaptic plasticity in the human sensory cortices. Although our understanding of the mechanisms underlying stimulus-SRM has increased over the past two decades, it remains unclear how this form of LTP-like synaptic plasticity is related to other basic learning mechanisms, such as perceptual learning. The aim of the current study was twofold; firstly, we aimed to corroborate former stimulus-SRM studies, demonstrating modulation of visual evoked potential (VEP) components following high-frequency visual stimulation. Secondly, we aimed to investigate the association between the magnitudes of LTP-like plasticity and visual perceptual learning (VPL).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;42 healthy adults participated in the study. EEG data was recorded during a standard high-frequency stimulus-SRM paradigm. Amplitude values were measured from the peaks of visual components C1, P1, and N1. Embedded in the same experimental session, the VPL task required the participants to discriminate between a masked checkerboard pattern and a visual “noise” stimulus before, during and after the stimulus-SRM probes.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We demonstrated significant amplitude modulations of VEPs components C1 and N1 from baseline to both post-stimulation probes. In the VPL task, we observed a significant change in the average threshold levels from the first to the second round. No significant association between the magnitudes of LTP-like plasticity and performance on the VPL task was evident.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;To the extent of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the relationship between the visual stimulus-RM phenomenon and VPL in humans. In accordance with previous studies, we demonstrated robust amplitude modulations of the C1 and N1 components of the VEP waveform. However, we did not observe any significant correlations between modulation magnitude of VEP components and VPL task performance, suggesting that these phenomena rely on separate learning mechanisms implemented by different neural mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Functional Contributions of the Arcuate Fasciculus to Language Processing</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.672665</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Current evidence strongly suggests that the arcuate fasciculus (AF) is critical for language, from spontaneous speech and word retrieval to repetition and comprehension abilities. However, to further pinpoint its unique and differential role in language, its anatomy needs to be explored in greater detail and its contribution to language processing beyond that of known cortical language areas must be established. We address this in a comprehensive evaluation of the specific functional role of the AF in a well-characterized cohort of individuals with chronic aphasia (n = 33) following left hemisphere stroke. To evaluate macro- and microstructural integrity of the AF, tractography based on the constrained spherical deconvolution model was performed. The AF in the left and right hemispheres were then manually reconstructed using a modified 3-segment model (Catani et al., 2005), and a modified 2-segment model (Glasser and Rilling, 2008). The normalized volume and a measure of microstructural integrity of the long and the posterior segments of the AF were significantly correlated with language indices while controlling for gender and lesion volume. Specific contributions of AF segments to language while accounting for the role of specific cortical language areas – inferior frontal, inferior parietal, and posterior temporal – were tested using multiple regression analyses. Involvement of the following tract segments in the left hemisphere in language processing beyond the contribution of cortical areas was demonstrated: the long segment of the AF contributed to naming abilities; anterior segment – to fluency and naming; the posterior segment – to comprehension. The results highlight the important contributions of the AF fiber pathways to language impairments beyond that of known cortical language areas. At the same time, no clear role of the right hemisphere AF tracts in language processing could be ascertained. In sum, our findings lend support to the broader role of the left AF in language processing, with particular emphasis on comprehension and naming, and point to the posterior segment of this tract as being most crucial for supporting residual language abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Systematic Review of Neuromodulation Treatment Effects on Suicidality</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.660926</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Neuromodulation is an important group of therapeutic modalities for neuropsychiatric disorders. Prior studies have focused on efficacy and adverse events associated with neuromodulation. Less is known regarding the influence of neuromodulation treatments on suicidality. This systematic review sought to examine the effects of various neuromodulation techniques on suicidality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic review of the literature from 1940 to 2020 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline was conducted. Any reported suicide-related outcome, including suicidal ideation, suicide intent, suicide attempt, completed suicide in reports were considered as a putative measure of treatment effect on suicidality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The review identified 129 relevant studies. An exploratory analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of sertraline and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) for treating depression reported a decrease in suicidal ideation favoring tDCS vs. placebo and tDCS combined with sertraline vs. placebo. Several studies reported an association between repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and improvements in suicidal ideation. In 12 of the studies, suicidality was the primary outcome, ten of which showed a significant improvement in suicidal ideation. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and magnetic seizure therapy was also shown to be associated with lower suicidal ideation and completed suicide rates. There were 11 studies which suicidality was the primary outcome and seven of these showed an improvement in suicidal ideation or suicide intent and fewer suicide attempts or completed suicides in patients treated with ECT. There was limited literature focused on the potential protective effect of vagal nerve stimulation with respect to suicidal ideation. Data were mixed regarding the potential effects of deep brain stimulation on suicidality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Future prospective studies of neuromodulation that focus on the primary outcome of suicidality are urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic Review Registration:https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=125599, identifier: CRD42019125599.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Functional Genomics of Axons and Synapses to Understand Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.686722</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional genomics studies through transcriptomics, translatomics and proteomics have become increasingly important tools to understand the molecular basis of biological systems in the last decade. In most cases, when these approaches are applied to the nervous system, they are centered in cell bodies or somatodendritic compartments, as these are easier to isolate and, at least in vitro, contain most of the mRNA and proteins present in all neuronal compartments. However, key functional processes and many neuronal disorders are initiated by changes occurring far away from cell bodies, particularly in axons (axopathologies) and synapses (synaptopathies). Both neuronal compartments contain specific RNAs and proteins, which are known to vary depending on their anatomical distribution, developmental stage and function, and thus form the complex network of molecular pathways required for neuron connectivity. Modifications in these components due to metabolic, environmental, and/or genetic issues could trigger or exacerbate a neuronal disease. For this reason, detailed profiling and functional understanding of the precise changes in these compartments may thus yield new insights into the still intractable molecular basis of most neuronal disorders. In the case of synaptic dysfunctions or synaptopathies, they contribute to dozens of diseases in the human brain including neurodevelopmental (i.e., autism, Down syndrome, and epilepsy) as well as neurodegenerative disorders (i.e., Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases). Histological, biochemical, cellular, and general molecular biology techniques have been key in understanding these pathologies. Now, the growing number of omics approaches can add significant extra information at a high and wide resolution level and, used effectively, can lead to novel and insightful interpretations of the biological processes at play. This review describes current approaches that use transcriptomics, translatomics and proteomic related methods to analyze the axon and presynaptic elements, focusing on the relationship that axon and synapses have with neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Altered Expression of Ion Channels in White Matter Lesions of Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: What Do We Know About Their Function?</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite significant advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS), knowledge about contribution of individual ion channels to axonal impairment and remyelination failure in progressive MS remains incomplete. Ion channel families play a fundamental role in maintaining white matter (WM) integrity and in regulating WM activities in axons, interstitial neurons, glia, and vascular cells. Recently, transcriptomic studies have considerably increased insight into the gene expression changes that occur in diverse WM lesions and the gene expression fingerprint of specific WM cells associated with secondary progressive MS. Here, we review the ion channel genes encoding K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; channels; ryanodine receptors; TRP channels; and others that are significantly and uniquely dysregulated in active, chronic active, inactive, remyelinating WM lesions, and normal-appearing WM of secondary progressive MS brain, based on recently published bulk and single-nuclei RNA-sequencing datasets. We discuss the current state of knowledge about the corresponding ion channels and their implication in the MS brain or in experimental models of MS. This comprehensive review suggests that the intense upregulation of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel genes in WM lesions with ongoing tissue damage may reflect the imbalance of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis that is observed in progressive MS brain, while the upregulation of a large number of voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel genes may be linked to a protective response to limit neuronal excitability. In addition, the altered chloride homeostasis, revealed by the significant downregulation of voltage-gated Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; channels in MS lesions, may contribute to an altered inhibitory neurotransmission and increased excitability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Endothelial Senescence and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, a COVID-19 Based Hypothesis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.673217</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome is a serious illness of unknown etiology, characterized by debilitating exhaustion, memory impairment, pain and sleep abnormalities. Viral infections are believed to initiate the pathogenesis of this syndrome although the definite proof remains elusive. With the unfolding of COVID-19 pandemic, the interest in this condition has resurfaced as excessive tiredness, a major complaint of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, often lingers for a long time, resulting in disability, and poor life quality. In a previous article, we hypothesized that COVID-19-upregulated angiotensin II triggered premature endothelial cell senescence, disrupting the intestinal and blood brain barriers. Here, we hypothesize further that post-viral sequelae, including myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, are promoted by the gut microbes or toxin translocation from the gastrointestinal tract into other tissues, including the brain. This model is supported by the SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host proteins and bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Conversely, targeting microbial translocation and cellular senescence may ameliorate the symptoms of this disabling illness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Selective Regional Loss of Cortical Synapses Lacking Presynaptic Mitochondria in the 5xFAD Mouse Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.690168</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is strongly correlated with cognitive impairment. Accumulating evidence indicates that amyloid pathology leads to synaptic degeneration and mitochondrial damage in AD. However, it remains unclear whether synapses and presynaptic mitochondria are differentially affected in various cortical regions of the AD brain at the ultrastructural level. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, we assessed synaptic structures in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and primary visual cortex (V1) of the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. At 6 months of age, 5xFAD mice exhibited significantly elevated levels of amyloid deposition in layer 2/3 of the mPFC but not V1. Accordingly, three-dimensional reconstruction of synaptic connectivity revealed a significant reduction in excitatory synaptic density in layer 2 of the mPFC, but not V1, of male transgenic mice. Notably, the density of synapses lacking presynaptic mitochondria was selectively decreased in the mPFC of 5xFAD mice, with no change in the density of mitochondria-containing synapses. Further classification of spines into shape categories confirmed a preferential loss of thin spines whose presynaptic boutons were largely devoid of mitochondria in the 5xFAD mPFC. Furthermore, the number of mitochondria per bouton in spared mitochondria-containing boutons was reduced in the mPFC, but not V1, of 5xFAD mice. Collectively, these results highlight region-specific vulnerability of cortical synapses to amyloid deposition and suggest that the presence of presynaptic mitochondria may affect synaptic degeneration in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) transduce signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to effector ion channels and enzymes G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt;, a member of the pertussis toxin-sensitive G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt; family, is widely expressed in the brain, although its role within a neuronal context remains largely unknown. Using immunohistochemical and quantitative immunoelectron microscopy techniques, we have investigated the expression, cellular and subcellular localization of G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; in the cerebellar cortex. Histoblot revealed that G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; is expressed in many brain regions, including the cerebellum. At the cellular level, G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; protein was distributed in Purkinje cells, basket cells, stellate cells, granule cells and Golgi cells. At the subcellular level, pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy revealed mainly a postsynaptic localization of G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; along the extrasynaptic plasma membrane of Purkinje cell dendritic shafts and spines, and dendrites of basket, stellate and granule cells. To a lesser extent, immunolabeling for G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; was localized in different types of axon terminals establishing excitatory synapses. Moreover, post-embedding immunoelectron microscopy revealed the synaptic localization of G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; on PSDs of glutamatergic synapses between Purkinje cell spines and parallel fiber terminals and its co-localization with GABA&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt; in the same spines. Quantitative analysis of G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; immunoparticles revealed they preferentially localized on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the analysis revealed a high concentration of G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; around excitatory synapses on Purkinje cell dendritic spines, but a uniform distribution in granule cell dendrites. These molecular-anatomical findings suggest that G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; is a major signal transducer of specific GPCRs in different neuronal populations in the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: High-Resolution Insights Into the in vitro Developing Blood-Brain Barrier: Novel Morphological Features of Endothelial Nanotube Function</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.661065</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) imaging of the in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB), is a promising modality for investigating the dynamic morphological interplay underpinning BBB development. The successful establishment of BBB integrity is grounded in the brain endothelial cells (BEC’s) ability to occlude its paracellular spaces of brain capillaries through the expression of the intercellular tight junction (TJ) proteins. The impermeability of these paracellular spaces are crucial in the regulation of transcellular transport systems to achieve homeostasis of the central nervous system. To-date research describing morphologically, the dynamics by which TJ interaction is orchestrated to successfully construct a specialized barrier remains undescribed. In this study, the application of HREM illuminates the novel, dynamic and highly restrictive BEC paracellular pathway which is founded based on lateral membrane alignment which is the functional imperative for the mechanical juxtapositioning of TJ zones that underpin molecular bonding and sealing of the paracellular space. For the first time, we report on the secretion of a basement membrane in vitro, which allow BECs to orientate themselves into distinct basolateral and apicolateral domains and establish a 3-dimensional BEC construct. We report for the first time, on the expression of nanovesicles bound to the plasma membrane surfaces of the BECs. These membrane-bound vesicles are reported to possess an array of DNA/RNA constituents and chemotaxic properties affecting the formation of nanotubes that span the paracellular space between BECs, facilitating BBB construction, alluding to a functional role in mediating cell-to-cell communication. This study suggests that novel, ultrathin nanotubular (NT) structures are involved in functional roles in bringing into alignment the paracellular space of BECs. Immortalized mouse BECs (b.End3, b.End5) and primary rat cardiac microvascular ECs were used to further validate the in vitro BBB model by profiling variances in peripheral EC monolayer development. These cardiac capillary ECs presented with an opposite topographical profile: large fenestra and intercellular spaces, devoid of morphological ultrastructures. This comparative study alludes to the role of NT facilitation in TJ-induced hemifusion of apicolateral BEC membranes, as a structural event forming the basis for establishing a polarized BBB.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Ultrarapid Inflammation of the Olfactory Bulb After Spinal Cord Injury: Protective Effects of the Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor on Early Neurodegeneration in the Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.701702</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The correlation among olfactory dysfunction, spinal cord injury (SCI), subjective cognitive decline, and neurodegenerative dementia has been established. Impaired olfaction is considered a marker for neurodegeneration. Hence, there is a need to examine if SCI leads to olfactory dysfunction. In this study, the brain tissue of mice with spinal cord hemisection injury was subjected to microarray analysis. The mRNA expression levels of olfactory receptors in the brain began to decline at 8 h post-SCI. SCI promoted neuroinflammation, downregulated the expression of olfactory receptors, decreased the number of neural stem cells (NSCs), and inhibited the production of neurotrophic factors in the olfactory bulbs at 8 h post-SCI. In particular, the SCI group had upregulated mRNA and protein expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; a marker of astrocyte reactivation) and pro-inflammatory mediators [IL-1β, IL-6, and Nestin (marker of NSCs)] in the olfactory bulb compared to levels in the sham control group. The mRNA expression levels of olfactory receptors (Olfr1494, Olfr1324, Olfr1241, and Olfr979) and neurotrophic factors [brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and nerve growth factor (NGF)] were downregulated in the olfactory bulb of the SCI group mice at 8 h post-SCI. The administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mitigated these SCI-induced pathological changes in the olfactory bulb at 8 h post-SCI. These results indicate that the olfactory bulb is vulnerable to environmental damage even if the lesion is located at sites distant from the brain, such as the spinal cord. Additionally, SCI initiated pathological processes, including inflammatory response, and impaired neurogenesis, at an early stage. The findings of this study will provide a basis for future studies on pathological mechanisms of early neurodegenerative diseases involving the olfactory bulb and enable early clinical drug intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Apathy predicts poor outcomes in older adults, and its underlying neural mechanism needs further investigation. We examined the association between symptoms of apathy and functional connectivity (FC) in older adults without stroke or dementia. Participants included 48 individuals (mean age = 70.90) living independently in the community, who underwent resting-state fMRI and completed the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). Seed-to-voxel analysis (cluster-level p-FDR &amp;lt;0.05, voxel threshold p &amp;lt; 0.001) tested the association between AES scores and the whole-brain FC of brain regions involved in reward- and salience-related processing. We found that AES scores were negatively associated with FC of the right insula cortex and right anterior temporal regions (124 voxels, t = −5.10) and FC of the left orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate regions (160 voxels, t = −5.45), and were positively associated with FC of the left orbitofrontal cortex and left lateral prefrontal (282 voxels, t = 4.99) and anterior prefrontal (123 voxels, t = 4.52) regions. These findings suggest that apathy in older adults may reflect disruptions in neural connectivity involved in reward- and salience-related processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.690293</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lewy Body Disorders (LBDs) lie within the spectrum of age-related neurodegenerative diseases now frequently categorized as the synucleinopathies. LBDs are considered to be among the second most common form of neurodegenerative dementias after Alzheimer's disease. They are progressive conditions with variable clinical symptoms embodied within specific cognitive and behavioral disorders. There are currently no effective treatments for LBDs. LBDs are histopathologically characterized by the presence of abnormal neuronal inclusions commonly known as Lewy Bodies (LBs) and extracellular Lewy Neurites (LNs). The inclusions predominantly comprise aggregates of alpha-synuclein (aSyn). It has been proposed that post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as aSyn phosphorylation, ubiquitination SUMOylation, Nitration, o-GlcNacylation, and Truncation play important roles in the formation of toxic forms of the protein, which consequently facilitates the formation of these inclusions. This review focuses on the role of different PTMs in aSyn in the pathogenesis of LBDs. We highlight how these PTMs interact with aSyn to promote misfolding and aggregation and interplay with cell membranes leading to the potential functional and pathogenic consequences detected so far, and their involvement in the development of LBDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Altered Functional Connectivity of the Basal Nucleus of Meynert in Subjective Cognitive Impairment, Early Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Late Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.671351</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: The spectrum of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to include subjective cognitive impairment, early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI), and late mild cognitive impairment (lMCI). Choline dysfunction affects the early progression of AD, in which the basal nucleus of Meynert (BNM) is primarily responsible for cortical cholinergic innervation. The aims of this study were to determine the abnormal patterns of BNM-functional connectivity (BNM-FC) in the preclinical AD spectrum (SCD, eMCI, and lMCI) and further explore the relationships between these alterations and neuropsychological measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to investigate FC based on a seed mask (BNM mask) in 28 healthy controls (HC), 30 SCD, 24 eMCI, and 25 lMCI patients. Furthermore, the relationship between altered FC and neurocognitive performance was examined by a correlation analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of abnormal BNM-FC was used to specifically determine the classification ability to differentiate the early AD disease spectrum relative to HC (SCD and HC, eMCI and HC, lMCI and HC) and pairs of groups in the AD disease spectrum (eMCI and SCD, lMCI and SCD, eMCI and lMCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with HC, SCD patients showed increased FC in the bilateral SMA and decreased FC in the bilateral cerebellum and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), eMCI patients showed significantly decreased FC in the bilateral precuneus, and lMCI individuals showed decreased FC in the right lingual gyrus. Compared with the SCD group, the eMCI group showed decreased FC in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), while the lMCI group showed decreased FC in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Compared with the eMCI group, the lMCI group showed decreased FC in the right hippocampus. Interestingly, abnormal FC was associated with certain cognitive domains and functions including episodic memory, executive function, information processing speed, and visuospatial function in the disease groups. BNM-FC of SFG in distinguishing eMCI from SCD; BNM-FC of MTG in distinguishing lMCI from SCD; BNM-FC of the MTG, hippocampus, and cerebellum in distinguishing SCD from HC; and BNM-FC of the hippocampus and MFG in distinguishing eMCI from lMCI have high sensitivity and specificity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The abnormal BNM-FC patterns can characterize the early disease spectrum of AD (SCD, eMCI, and lMCI) and are closely related to the cognitive domains. These new and reliable findings will provide a new perspective in identifying the early disease spectrum of AD and further strengthen the role of cholinergic theory in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Gut Microbiota: Critical Controller and Intervention Target in Brain Aging and Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.671142</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The current trend for the rapid growth of the global aging population poses substantial challenges for society. The human aging process has been demonstrated to be closely associated with changes in gut microbiota composition, diversity, and functional features. During the first 2 years of life, the gut microbiota undergoes dramatic changes in composition and metabolic functions as it colonizes and develops in the body. Although the gut microbiota is nearly established by the age of three, it continues to mature until adulthood, when it comprises more stable and diverse microbial species. Meanwhile, as the physiological functions of the human body deteriorated with age, which may be a result of immunosenescence and “inflammaging,” the guts of elderly people are generally characterized by an enrichment of pro-inflammatory microbes and a reduced abundance of beneficial species. The gut microbiota affects the development of the brain through a bidirectional communication system, called the brain-gut-microbiota (BGM) axis, and dysregulation of this communication is pivotal in aging-related cognitive impairment. Microbiota-targeted dietary interventions and the intake of probiotics/prebiotics can increase the abundance of beneficial species, boost host immunity, and prevent gut-related diseases. This review summarizes the age-related changes in the human gut microbiota based on recent research developments. Understanding these changes will likely facilitate the design of novel therapeutic strategies to achieve healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.663837</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A worldwide increase in longevity is bringing novel challenges to public health and health care professionals. Cognitive impairment in the elderly may compromise living conditions and precede Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia. Therefore, finding molecular markers associated with cognitive impairment is of crucial importance. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2), an iron-related protein, has been suggested as a potential marker for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. This study aimed at investigating the association between LCN2 measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with cognitive impairment. A cross-sectional design based on two aging cohorts was used: individuals diagnosed with subjective cognitive complaints (SCC), MCI, and AD from a Swedish memory clinic-based cohort, and individuals diagnosed with SCC and AD from a Portuguese cohort. Binary logistic [for the outcome cognitive impairment (MCI + AD) in the Swedish cohort and AD in the Portuguese cohort] and multinomial logistic (for the outcomes MCI and AD) regression analyses were used. No associations were found in both cohorts when controlling for sex, education, and age. This explanatory study suggests that the association between serum and CSF LCN2 concentrations with cognitive impairment reported in the literature must be further analyzed for confounders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Post-stroke Anxiety Analysis via Machine Learning Methods</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.657937</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Post-stroke anxiety (PSA) has caused wide public concern in recent years, and the study on risk factors analysis and prediction is still an open issue. With the deepening of the research, machine learning has been widely applied to various scenarios and make great achievements increasingly, which brings new approaches to this field. In this paper, 395 patients with acute ischemic stroke are collected and evaluated by anxiety scales (i.e., HADS-A, HAMA, and SAS), hence the patients are divided into anxiety group and non-anxiety group. Afterward, the results of demographic data and general laboratory examination between the two groups are compared to identify the risk factors with statistical differences accordingly. Then the factors with statistical differences are incorporated into a multivariate logistic regression to obtain risk factors and protective factors of PSA. Statistical analysis shows great differences in gender, age, serious stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, drinking, and HDL-C level between PSA group and non-anxiety group with HADS-A and HAMA evaluation. Meanwhile, as evaluated by SAS scale, gender, serious stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, drinking, and HDL-C level differ in the PSA group and the non-anxiety group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of HADS-A, HAMA, and SAS scales suggest that hypertension, diabetes mellitus, drinking, high NIHSS score, and low serum HDL-C level are related to PSA. In other words, gender, age, disability, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, HDL-C, and drinking are closely related to anxiety during the acute stage of ischemic stroke. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, drinking, and disability increased the risk of PSA, and higher serum HDL-C level decreased the risk of PSA. Several machine learning methods are employed to predict PSA according to HADS-A, HAMA, and SAS scores, respectively. The experimental results indicate that random forest outperforms the competitive methods in PSA prediction, which contributes to early intervention for clinical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67856</link>
	<content:encoded>Melanoma cells have been shown to undergo fast amoeboid (leader bleb-based) migration, requiring a single large bleb for migration. In leader blebs, is a rapid flow of cortical actin that drives the cell forward. Using RNAi, we find that co-depleting cofilin-1 and ADF led to a large increase in cortical actin, suggesting that both proteins regulate cortical actin. Furthermore, severing factors can promote contractility through the regulation of actin architecture. However, RNAi of cofilin-1 but not ADF led to a significant decrease in cell stiffness. We found cofilin-1 to be enriched at leader bleb necks, whereas RNAi of cofilin-1 and ADF reduced bleb sizes and the frequency of motile cells. Strikingly, cells without cofilin-1 and ADF had blebs with abnormally long necks. Many of these blebs failed to retract and displayed slow actin turnover. Collectively, our data identifies cofilin-1 and ADF as actin remodeling factors required for fast amoeboid migration.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67078</link>
	<content:encoded>Integrin adhesion complexes regulate cytoskeletal dynamics during cell migration. Adhesion activates phosphorylation of integrin-associated signaling proteins, including Cas (p130Cas, BCAR1), by Src-family kinases. Cas regulates leading-edge protrusion and migration in cooperation with its binding partner, BCAR3. However, it has been unclear how Cas and BCAR3 cooperate. Here, using normal epithelial cells, we find that BCAR3 localization to integrin adhesions requires Cas. In return, Cas phosphorylation, as well as lamellipodia dynamics and cell migration, requires BCAR3. These functions require the BCAR3 SH2 domain and a specific phosphorylation site, Tyr 117, that is also required for BCAR3 downregulation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These findings place BCAR3 in a co-regulatory positive-feedback circuit with Cas, with BCAR3 requiring Cas for localization and Cas requiring BCAR3 for activation and downstream signaling. The use of a single phosphorylation site in BCAR3 for activation and degradation ensures reliable negative feedback by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: BAP1/ASXL complex modulation regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition during trophoblast differentiation and invasion</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63254</link>
	<content:encoded>Normal function of the placenta depends on the earliest developmental stages when trophoblast cells differentiate and invade into the endometrium to establish the definitive maternal-fetal interface. Previously, we identified the ubiquitously expressed tumour suppressor BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) as a central factor of a novel molecular node controlling early mouse placentation. However, functional insights into how BAP1 regulates trophoblast biology are still missing. Using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and overexpression technology in mouse trophoblast stem cells, here we demonstrate that the downregulation of BAP1 protein is essential to trigger epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during trophoblast differentiation associated with a gain of invasiveness. Moreover, we show that the function of BAP1 in suppressing EMT progression is dependent on the binding of BAP1 to additional sex comb-like (ASXL1/2) proteins to form the polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex. Finally, both endogenous expression patterns and BAP1 overexpression experiments in human trophoblast stem cells suggest that the molecular function of BAP1 in regulating trophoblast differentiation and EMT progression is conserved in mice and humans. Our results reveal that the physiological modulation of BAP1 determines the invasive properties of the trophoblast, delineating a new role of the BAP1 PR-DUB complex in regulating early placentation.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: De novo learning versus adaptation of continuous control in a manual tracking task</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62578</link>
	<content:encoded>How do people learn to perform tasks that require continuous adjustments of motor output, like riding a bicycle? People rely heavily on cognitive strategies when learning discrete movement tasks, but such time-consuming strategies are infeasible in continuous control tasks that demand rapid responses to ongoing sensory feedback. To understand how people can learn to perform such tasks without the benefit of cognitive strategies, we imposed a rotation/mirror reversal of visual feedback while participants performed a continuous tracking task. We analyzed behavior using a system identification approach which revealed two qualitatively different components of learning: adaptation of a baseline controller and formation of a new, task-specific continuous controller. These components exhibited different signatures in the frequency domain and were differentially engaged under the rotation/mirror reversal. Our results demonstrate that people can rapidly build a new continuous controller &lt;i&gt;de novo &lt;/i&gt;and can simultaneously deploy this process with adaptation of an existing controller.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62207</link>
	<content:encoded>The granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) is critical for both spatial and non-spatial behaviors, but the underlying neural codes remain poorly understood. Here, we use optogenetic circuit mapping in mice to reveal a double dissociation that allows parallel circuits in superficial RSG to process disparate inputs. The anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum, sources of spatial information, strongly and selectively recruit small low-rheobase (LR) pyramidal cells in RSG. In contrast, neighboring regular-spiking (RS) cells are preferentially controlled by claustral and anterior cingulate inputs, sources of mostly non-spatial information. Precise sublaminar axonal and dendritic arborization within RSG layer 1, in particular, permits this parallel processing. Observed thalamocortical synaptic dynamics enable computational models of LR neurons to compute the speed of head rotation, despite receiving head direction inputs that do not explicitly encode speed. Thus, parallel input streams identify a distinct principal neuronal subtype ideally positioned to support spatial orientation computations in the RSG.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60745</link>
	<content:encoded>Mortality from breast cancer is almost exclusively a result of tumor metastasis, and lungs are one of the main metastatic sites. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are prominent players in the microenvironment of breast cancer. However, their role in the metastatic niche is largely unknown. In this study, we profiled the transcriptional co-evolution of lung fibroblasts isolated from transgenic mice at defined stage-specific time points of metastases formation. Employing multiple knowledge-based platforms of data analysis provided powerful insights on functional and temporal regulation of the transcriptome of fibroblasts. We demonstrate that fibroblasts in lung metastases are transcriptionally dynamic and plastic, and reveal stage-specific gene signatures that imply functional tasks, including extracellular matrix remodeling, stress response and shaping the inflammatory microenvironment. Furthermore, we identified &lt;i&gt;Myc&lt;/i&gt; as a central regulator of fibroblast rewiring and found that stromal upregulation of &lt;i&gt;Myc&lt;/i&gt; transcriptional networks is associated with disease progression in human breast cancer.</content:encoded>

The effectiveness of immune responses depends on the precision of stimulus-responsive gene expression programs. Cells specify which genes to express by activating stimulus-specific combinations of stimulus-induced transcription factors (TFs). Their activities are decoded by a gene regulatory strategy (GRS) associated with each response gene. Here, we examined whether the GRSs of target genes may be inferred from stimulus-response (input-output) datasets, which remains an unresolved model-identifiability challenge. We developed a mechanistic modeling framework and computational workflow to determine the identifiability of all possible combinations of synergistic (AND) or non-synergistic (OR) GRSs involving three transcription factors. Considering different sets of perturbations for stimulus-response studies, we found that two thirds of GRSs are easily distinguishable but that substantially more quantitative data is required to distinguish the remaining third. To enhance the accuracy of the inference with timecourse experimental data, we developed an advanced error model that avoids error overestimates by distinguishing between value and temporal error. Incorporating this error model into a Bayesian framework, we show that GRS models can be identified for individual genes by considering multiple datasets. Our analysis rationalizes the allocation of experimental resources by identifying most informative TF stimulation conditions. Applying this computational workflow to experimental data of immune response genes in macrophages, we found that a much greater fraction of genes are combinatorially controlled than previously reported by considering compensation among transcription factors. Specifically, we revealed that a group of known NFκB target genes may also be regulated by IRF3, which is supported by chromatin immuno-precipitation analysis. Our study provides a computational workflow for designing and interpreting stimulus-response gene expression studies to identify underlying gene regulatory strategies and further a mechanistic understanding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/12RL_IX6X-Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Despite the unprecedented growth in our understanding of cell biology, it still remains challenging to connect it to experimental data obtained with cells and tissues’ physiopathological status under precise circumstances. This knowledge gap often results in difficulties in designing validation experiments, which are usually labor-intensive, expensive to perform, and hard to interpret. Here we propose PHENSIM, a computational tool using a systems biology approach to simulate how cell phenotypes are affected by the activation/inhibition of one or multiple biomolecules, and it does so by exploiting signaling pathways. Our tool’s applications include predicting the outcome of drug administration, knockdown experiments, gene transduction, and exposure to exosomal cargo. Importantly, PHENSIM enables the user to make inferences on well-defined cell lines and includes pathway maps from three different model organisms. To assess our approach’s reliability, we built a benchmark from transcriptomics data gathered from NCBI GEO and performed four case studies on known biological experiments. Our results show high prediction accuracy, thus highlighting the capabilities of this methodology. PHENSIM standalone Java application is available at https://github.com/alaimos/phensim, along with all data and source codes for benchmarking. A web-based user interface is accessible at https://phensim.tech/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3FcE-ZITjls&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In October of 2020, in response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, our team hosted our first fully online workshop teaching the QIIME 2 microbiome bioinformatics platform. We had 75 enrolled participants who joined from at least 25 different countries on 6 continents, and we had 22 instructors on 4 continents. In the 5-day workshop, participants worked hands-on with a cloud-based shared compute cluster that we deployed for this course. The event was well received, and participants provided feedback and suggestions in a postworkshop questionnaire. In January of 2021, we followed this workshop with a second fully online workshop, incorporating lessons from the first. Here, we present details on the technology and protocols that we used to run these workshops, focusing on the first workshop and then introducing changes made for the second workshop. We discuss what worked well, what didn’t work well, and what we plan to do differently in future workshops.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/57YiPJNjZ8U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, deep neural networks have been outperforming conventional machine
learning algorithms in many computer vision-related tasks. However, it is not
computationally acceptable to implement these models on mobile and IoT devices
and the majority of devices are harnessing the cloud computing methodology in
which outstanding deep learning models are responsible for analyzing the data
on the server. This can bring the communication cost for the devices and make
the whole system useless in those times where the communication is not
available. In this paper, a new framework for deploying on IoT devices has been
proposed which can take advantage of both the cloud and the on-device models by
extracting the meta-information from each sample's classification result and
evaluating the classification's performance for the necessity of sending the
sample to the server. Experimental results show that only 40 percent of the
test data should be sent to the server using this technique and the overall
accuracy of the framework is 92 percent which improves the accuracy of both
client and server models.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Self-training based unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has shown great
potential to address the problem of domain shift, when applying a trained deep
learning model in a source domain to unlabeled target domains. However, while
the self-training UDA has demonstrated its effectiveness on discriminative
tasks, such as classification and segmentation, via the reliable pseudo-label
selection based on the softmax discrete histogram, the self-training UDA for
generative tasks, such as image synthesis, is not fully investigated. In this
work, we propose a novel generative self-training (GST) UDA framework with
continuous value prediction and regression objective for cross-domain image
synthesis. Specifically, we propose to filter the pseudo-label with an
uncertainty mask, and quantify the predictive confidence of generated images
with practical variational Bayes learning. The fast test-time adaptation is
achieved by a round-based alternative optimization scheme. We validated our
framework on the tagged-to-cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) synthesis
problem, where datasets in the source and target domains were acquired from
different scanners or centers. Extensive validations were carried out to verify
our framework against popular adversarial training UDA methods. Results show
that our GST, with tagged MRI of test subjects in new target domains, improved
the synthesis quality by a large margin, compared with the adversarial training
UDA methods.

Integrated Circuit (ASIC) designs that implement these algorithms using
techniques such as charge sharing circuits and subthreshold transistors,

algorithms, focus has shifted to hardware digital accelerator designs that
implement the prevalent matrix-vector multiplication operations. Power in these
designs is usually dominated by the memory access power of off-chip DRAM needed
for storing the network weights and activations. Emerging dense non-volatile
memory technologies can help to provide on-chip memory and analog circuits can
be well suited to implement the needed multiplication-vector operations coupled
with in-computing memory approaches. This paper presents abrief review of
analog designs that implement various machine learning algorithms. It then

StyleGAN2 but differ dramatically in their internal representations, and they

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Applying artificial neural networks (ANN) to specific tasks, researchers,

layers in their designs. By implication, these ANNs hold too many parameters,

a convolutional layer can process, are strictly limited by its receptive field.
By layer-wise analyzing the expansion of the receptive fields, we can reliably
predict sequences of layers that will not contribute qualitatively to the

design strategies to resolve these inefficiencies, optimizing the
explainability and the computational performance of ANNs. Since neither the
strategies nor the analysis requires training of the actual model, these
insights allow for a very efficient design process of ANNs architectures which

Results showed that the networks clearly classified illusory images and others

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Cortical Activation to Social and Mechanical Stimuli in the Infant Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.510030</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;From the early days of life infants distinguish between social and non-social physical entities and have different expectations for the way these two entities should move and interact. At the same time, we know very little about the cortical systems that support this early emerging ability. The goal of the current research was to assess the extent to which infant’s processing of social and non-social physical entities is mediated by distinct information processing systems in the temporal cortex. Using a cross-sectional design, infants aged 6–9 months (Experiment 1) and 11–18 months (Experiment 2) were presented with two types of events: social interaction and mechanical interaction. In the social interaction event (patterned after Hamlin et al., 2007), an entity with googly eyes, hair tufts, and an implied goal of moving up the hill was either helped up, or pushed down, a hill through the actions of another social entity. In the mechanical interaction event, the googly eyes and hair tufts were replaced with vertical black dots and a hook and clasp, and the objects moved up or down the hill via mechanical interactions. FNIRS was used to measure activation from temporal cortex while infants viewed the test events. In both age groups, viewing social and mechanical interaction events elicited different patterns of activation in the right temporal cortex, although responses were more specialized in the older age group. Activation was not obtained in these areas when the objects moved in synchrony without interacting, suggesting that the causal nature of the interaction events may be responsible, in part, to the results obtained. This is one of the few fNIRS studies that has investigated age-related patterns of cortical activation and the first to provide insight into the functional development of networks specialized for processing of social and non-social physical entities engaged in interaction events.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Evaluation of Neuropathological Features in the SOD1-G93A Low Copy Number Transgenic Mouse Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.681868</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) still depicts an incurable and devastating disease. Drug development efforts are mostly based on superoxide dismutase 1 gene (SOD1)-G93A mice that present a very strong and early phenotype, allowing only a short time window for intervention. An alternative mouse model is available, that is based on the same founder line but has a reduced SOD1-G93A copy number, resulting in a weaker and delayed phenotype. To be able to use these SOD1-G93A/low mice for drug testing, we performed a characterization of ALS-typical pathologies. All analyses were performed compared to non-transgenic (ntg) littermates of the same sex and age. In vivo analysis of SOD1-G93A/low mice was performed by weekly body weight measurements, analysis of the survival rate, and measurement of the muscle strength of 24–30 weeks old female and male SOD1-G93A/low mice. Immunofluorescent labeling of SOD1, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) protein was performed in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar ventral horn of the spinal cord of 24–30 weeks old male and female SOD1-G93A/low mice. The musculus gastrocnemius of male SOD1-G93A/low mice was labeled with fluorophore-conjugated α-bungarotoxin and antibodies against phosphorylated neurofilaments. Fluorescent labeling was detected and quantified by macro-based image analysis. Although SOD1 protein levels were highly increased in both sexes and all age groups, levels strongly peaked in 30 weeks old male SOD1-G93A/low mice. Astrocytosis and activated microglia in the spinal cord ventral horn and phosphorylated neurofilaments in the motor unit of the musculus gastrocnemius progressively increased, while muscle strength progressively decreased in male SOD1-G93A/low mice. In female SOD1-G93A/low mice, only activated microglia increased progressively, while muscle strength was constantly reduced starting at 26 weeks. These differences result in a shorter survival time of male SOD1-G93A/low mice of about 3 weeks compared to female animals. The results suggest that male SOD1-G93A/low mice present a stronger pathology and are, therefore, better suitable to evaluate the efficacy of new drugs against ALS as most pathological features are developing progressively paralleled by a survival time that allows treatment to start before symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder With Soft Label-Decomposition for Mitochondria Segmentation in EM Images</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.687832</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Semantic segmentation of mitochondria from electron microscopy (EM) images is an essential step to obtain reliable morphological statistics about mitochondria. However, automatically delineating plenty of mitochondria of varied shapes from complex backgrounds with sufficient accuracy is challenging. To address these challenges, we develop a hierarchical encoder-decoder network (HED-Net), which has a three-level nested U-shape architecture to capture rich contextual information. Given the irregular shape of mitochondria, we introduce a novel soft label-decomposition strategy to exploit shape knowledge in manual labels. Rather than simply using the ground truth label maps as the unique supervision in the model training, we introduce additional subcategory-aware supervision by softly decomposing each manual label map into two complementary label maps according to mitochondria's ovality. The three label maps are integrated with our HED-Net to supervise the model training. While the original label map guides the network to segment all the mitochondria of varied shapes, the auxiliary label maps guide the network to segment subcategories of mitochondria of circular shape and elliptic shape, respectively, which are much more manageable tasks. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks show that our HED-Net performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.635657</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive whole-brain scans aid the diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorder diseases such as autism, dementia, and brain cancer. The assessable analysis for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is rationally challenging due to the limitations of publicly available datasets. For diagnostic or prognostic tools, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) exposed affirmation to the biomarkers in neuroimaging research because of fMRI pickup inherent connectivity between the brain and regions. There are profound studies in ASD with introducing machine learning or deep learning methods that have manifested advanced steps for ASD predictions based on fMRI data. However, utmost antecedent models have an inadequacy in their capacity to manipulate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. To overcome these problems, we proposed an avant-garde DarkASDNet, which has the competence to extract features from a lower level to a higher level and bring out promising results. In this work, we considered 3D fMRI data to predict binary classification between ASD and typical control (TC). Firstly, we pre-processed the 3D fMRI data by adopting proper slice time correction and normalization. Then, we introduced a novel DarkASDNet which surpassed the benchmark accuracy for the classification of ASD. Our model's outcomes unveil that our proposed method established state-of-the-art accuracy of 94.70% to classify ASD vs. TC in ABIDE-I, NYU dataset. Finally, we contemplated our model by performing evaluation metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC score, and legitimize by distinguishing with recent literature descriptions to vindicate our outcomes. The proposed DarkASDNet architecture provides a novel benchmark approach for ASD classification using fMRI processed data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: The Stroke Neuro-Imaging Phenotype Repository: An Open Data Science Platform for Stroke Research</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.597708</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Reducing this disease burden through drug discovery and evaluation of stroke patient outcomes requires broader characterization of stroke pathophysiology, yet the underlying biologic and genetic factors contributing to outcomes are largely unknown. Remedying this critical knowledge gap requires deeper phenotyping, including large-scale integration of demographic, clinical, genomic, and imaging features. Such big data approaches will be facilitated by developing and running processing pipelines to extract stroke-related phenotypes at large scale. Millions of stroke patients undergo routine brain imaging each year, capturing a rich set of data on stroke-related injury and outcomes. The Stroke Neuroimaging Phenotype Repository (SNIPR) was developed as a multi-center centralized imaging repository of clinical computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from stroke patients worldwide, based on the open source XNAT imaging informatics platform. The aims of this repository are to: (i) store, manage, process, and facilitate sharing of high-value stroke imaging data sets, (ii) implement containerized automated computational methods to extract image characteristics and disease-specific features from contributed images, (iii) facilitate integration of imaging, genomic, and clinical data to perform large-scale analysis of complications after stroke; and (iv) develop SNIPR as a collaborative platform aimed at both data scientists and clinical investigators. Currently, SNIPR hosts research projects encompassing ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, with data from 2,246 subjects, and 6,149 imaging sessions from Washington University’s clinical image archive as well as contributions from collaborators in different countries, including Finland, Poland, and Spain. Moreover, we have extended the XNAT data model to include relevant clinical features, including subject demographics, stroke severity (NIH Stroke Scale), stroke subtype (using TOAST classification), and outcome [modified Rankin Scale (mRS)]. Image processing pipelines are deployed on SNIPR using containerized modules, which facilitate replicability at a large scale. The first such pipeline identifies axial brain CT scans from DICOM header data and image data using a meta deep learning scan classifier, registers serial scans to an atlas, segments tissue compartments, and calculates CSF volume. The resulting volume can be used to quantify the progression of cerebral edema after ischemic stroke. SNIPR thus enables the development and validation of pipelines to automatically extract imaging phenotypes and couple them with clinical data with the overarching aim of enabling a broad understanding of stroke progression and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: An Investigation of a Frontal Negative Slow Wave in a Virtual Hedonic Purchase Task</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.674312</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is a connection between the frontal negative slow wave (FNSW) and the arousal inhibition in the hedonic purchase context. To calculate the FNSW (400–800 ms), event-related potentials (ERPs) method was applied to depict the neural substrates on prudent and impulsive consumers’ behaviors within various states of promotion. Promotion types include the pure price promotion and the mixed promotion (a mixture of a charitable donation and a discount). Behaviorally, consumers response more quickly in the pure price promotion condition and they express a preference for the mixed promotion. More importantly, a larger FNSW emerged in the impulsive consumers than the prudent, suggesting that the former might tend to control their eagerness to consume hedonic items. Compared with the price promotion as the worse option, the mixed promotion as the better option caused more perceptual conflict, leading to an increase in N2 amplitude. It suggests that consumers incline to reject the worse offers. These results also reveal that people primarily have to search negative promotion information by their insight and subsequently impulsive consumers inhibit the responses to the promotion information. The method of ERPs and FNSW should be helpful for marketing researchers and professionals on hedonic consumption and sales promotion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.654383</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Transient ischemic attack (TIA) has a high incidence of recurrent vascular events. Hypoperfusion is one of the factors that are closely correlated with 7-day recurrence of TIA. This study aimed to evaluate the power of hypoperfusion shown on magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging in predicting the incidence of 7-day recurrence of ischemic events after TIA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods/Design: REATTACK is a prospective multi-centered cohort study on the correlation between MR perfusion and TIA recurrence. Ninety patients aged ≥18 years with recent (&amp;lt;7 days after onset) clinical TIA will be continuously included. All the patients will undergo diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) assessments within 24 h after the onset of TIA. The subjects will then be divided into a PWI positive group and a PWI negative group according to the time-to-maximum of the residue function (T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;). PWI will be repeated after 7 days and in 3 months. The primary clinical outcome will be the recurrence of TIA within 7 days after the onset of TIA. Secondary outcomes will be the recurrence of TIA in 3 months and modified Rankin scale (mRS) score. A chi-square test will be performed to compare the difference in the incidence of recurrent TIA between the two groups, and rank sum test in the mRS score. Multivariate logistic regression will be simultaneously performed to analyze the risk factors for the recurrence of TIA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: The results of this study will confirm whether abnormal T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; helps to identify the patients with TIA who have high risks of recurrent ischemic events. This would largely improve the prognosis of patients with TIA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trial Registration:www.chictr.org.cn, registration number: ChiCTR2000031863, registered on 12 April 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Changes in EEG Brain Connectivity Caused by Short-Term BCI Neurofeedback-Rehabilitation Training: A Case Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.627100</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;In combined with neurofeedback, Motor Imagery (MI) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) has been an effective long-term treatment therapy for motor dysfunction caused by neurological injury in the brain (e.g., post-stroke hemiplegia). However, individual neurological differences have led to variability in the single sessions of rehabilitation training. Research on the impact of short training sessions on brain functioning patterns can help evaluate and standardize the short duration of rehabilitation training. In this paper, we use the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to explore the brain patterns’ changes after a short-term rehabilitation training.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Using an EEG-BCI system, we analyzed the changes in short-term (about 1-h) MI training data with and without visual feedback, respectively. We first examined the EEG signal’s Mu band power’s attenuation caused by Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD). Then we use the EEG’s Event-Related Potentials (ERP) features to construct brain networks and evaluate the training from multiple perspectives: small-scale based on single nodes, medium-scale based on hemispheres, and large-scale based on all-brain.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Results showed no significant difference in the ERD power attenuation estimation in both groups. But the neurofeedback group’s ERP brain network parameters had substantial changes and trend properties compared to the group without feedback. The neurofeedback group’s Mu band power’s attenuation increased but not significantly (fitting line slope = 0.2, t-test value p &amp;gt; 0.05) after the short-term MI training, while the non-feedback group occurred an insignificant decrease (fitting line slope = −0.4, t-test value p &amp;gt; 0.05). In the ERP-based brain network analysis, the neurofeedback group’s network parameters were attenuated in all scales significantly (t-test value: p &amp;lt; 0.01); while the non-feedback group’s most network parameters didn’t change significantly (t-test value: p &amp;gt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The MI-BCI training’s short-term effects does not show up in the ERD analysis significantly but can be detected by ERP-based network analysis significantly. Results inspire the efficient evaluation of short-term rehabilitation training and provide a useful reference for subsequent studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Defective Neuronal Positioning Correlates With Aberrant Motor Circuit Function in Zebrafish</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.690475</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Precise positioning of neurons resulting from cell division and migration during development is critical for normal brain function. Disruption of neuronal migration can cause a myriad of neurological disorders. To investigate the functional consequences of defective neuronal positioning on circuit function, we studied a zebrafish frizzled3a (fzd3a) loss-of-function mutant off-limits (olt) where the facial branchiomotor (FBM) neurons fail to migrate out of their birthplace. A jaw movement assay, which measures the opening of the zebrafish jaw (gape), showed that the frequency of gape events, but not their amplitude, was decreased in olt mutants. Consistent with this, a larval feeding assay revealed decreased food intake in olt mutants, indicating that the FBM circuit in mutants generates defective functional outputs. We tested various mechanisms that could generate defective functional outputs in mutants. While fzd3a is ubiquitously expressed in neural and non-neural tissues, jaw cartilage and muscle developed normally in olt mutants, and muscle function also appeared to be unaffected. Although FBM neurons were mispositioned in olt mutants, axon pathfinding to jaw muscles was unaffected. Moreover, neuromuscular junctions established by FBM neurons on jaw muscles were similar between wildtype siblings and olt mutants. Interestingly, motor axons innervating the interhyoideus jaw muscle were frequently defasciculated in olt mutants. Furthermore, GCaMP imaging revealed that mutant FBM neurons were less active than their wildtype counterparts. These data show that aberrant positioning of FBM neurons in olt mutants is correlated with subtle defects in fasciculation and neuronal activity, potentially generating defective functional outputs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Air We Breathe: Air Pollution as a Prevalent Proinflammatory Stimulus Contributing to Neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.647643</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is regarded as an important risk factor for many diseases that affect a large proportion of the human population. To date, accumulating reports have noted that particulate matter (PM) is closely associated with the course of cardiopulmonary disorders. As the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and autoimmune disorders have risen and as the world’s population is aging, there is an increasing interest in environmental health hazards, mainly air pollution, which has been slightly overlooked as one of many plausible detrimental stimuli contributing to neurodegenerative disease onset and progression. Epidemiological studies have indicated a noticeable association between exposure to PM and neurotoxicity, which has been gradually confirmed by in vivo and in vitro studies. After entering the body directly through the olfactory epithelium or indirectly by passing through the respiratory system into the circulatory system, air pollutants are subsequently able to reach the brain. Among the potential mechanisms underlying particle-induced detrimental effects in the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS), increased oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, microglial activation, disturbance of protein homeostasis, and ultimately, neuronal death are often postulated and concomitantly coincide with the main pathomechanisms of neurodegenerative processes. Other complementary mechanisms by which PM could mediate neurotoxicity and contribute to neurodegeneration remain unconfirmed. Furthermore, the question of how strong and proven air pollutants are as substantial adverse factors for neurodegenerative disease etiologies remains unsolved. This review highlights research advances regarding the issue of PM with an emphasis on neurodegeneration markers, symptoms, and mechanisms by which air pollutants could mediate damage in the CNS. Poor air quality and insufficient knowledge regarding its toxicity justify conducting scientific investigations to understand the biological impact of PM in the context of various types of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cholesterol and Alzheimer’s Disease; From Risk Genes to Pathological Effects</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.690372</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While the central nervous system compromises 2% of our body weight, it harbors up to 25% of the body’s cholesterol. Cholesterol levels in the brain are tightly regulated for physiological brain function, but mounting evidence indicates that excessive cholesterol accumulates in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), where it may drive AD-associated pathological changes. This seems especially relevant for late-onset AD, as several of the major genetic risk factors are functionally associated with cholesterol metabolism. In this review we discuss the different systems that maintain brain cholesterol metabolism in the healthy brain, and how dysregulation of these processes can lead, or contribute to, Alzheimer’s disease. We will also discuss how AD-risk genes might impact cholesterol metabolism and downstream AD pathology. Finally, we will address the major outstanding questions in the field and how recent technical advances in CRISPR/Cas9-gene editing and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-technology can aid to study these problems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.680205</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Increased aortic stiffness has been found to be associated with cognitive function decline, but the evidence is still under debate. It is of great significance to elucidate the evidence in this debate to help make primary prevention decisions to slow cognitive decline in our routine clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Electronic databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched to identify peer-reviewed articles published in English from January 1, 1986, to March 16, 2020, that reported the association between aortic stiffness and cognitive function. Studies that reported the association between aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and cognitive function, cognitive impairment, and dementia were included in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Thirty-nine studies were included in the qualitative analysis, and 29 studies were included in the quantitative analysis. The aortic PWV was inversely associated with memory and processing speed in the cross-sectional analysis. In the longitudinal analysis, the high category of aortic PWV was 44% increased risk of cognitive impairment (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.24–1.85) compared with low PWV, and the risk of cognitive impairment increased 3.9% (OR 1.039; 95% CI 1.005–1.073) per 1 m/s increase in aortic PWV. Besides, meta-regression analysis showed that age significantly increased the association between high aortic PWV and cognitive impairment risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Aortic stiffness measured by aortic PWV was inversely associated with memory and processing speed and could be an independent predictor for cognitive impairment, especially for older individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.650930</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cadmium (Cd) is an environmental contaminant, which is a potential risk factor in the progression of aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we have assessed the effects of chronic administration of Cd on cellular oxidative stress and its associated Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathologies in animal models. Two groups of mice were used, one group administered with saline and the other with Cd (1 mg/kg/day; intraperitoneally) for 3 months. After behavioral studies, molecular/biochemical (Immunoblotting, ELISAs, ROS, LPO, and GSH assays) and morphological analyses were performed. We observed an exacerbation of memory and synaptic deficits in chronic Cd-injected mice. Subacute and chronic Cd escalated reactive oxygen species (ROS), suppressed the master antioxidant enzymes, e.g., nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1, and evoked the stress kinase phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 signaling pathways, which may escalate AD pathologies possibly associated with amyloidogenic processes. These findings suggest the regulation of oxidative stress/ROS and its associated amyloid beta pathologies for targeting the Cd-exacerbated AD pathogenesis. In addition, these preclinical animal studies represent a paradigm for epidemiological studies of the human population exposed to chronic and subacute administration of Cd, suggesting avoiding environmental contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Different translation dynamics of β-and γ-actin regulates cell migration</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68712</link>
	<content:encoded>β- and γ-cytoplasmic actins are ubiquitously expressed in every cell type and are nearly identical at the amino acid level but play vastly different roles &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Their essential roles in embryogenesis and mesenchymal cell migration critically depend on the nucleotide sequences of their genes, rather than their amino acid sequence, however it is unclear which gene elements underlie this effect. Here we address the specific role of the coding sequence in β- and γ-cytoplasmic actins' intracellular functions, using stable polyclonal populations of immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts with exogenously expressed actin isoforms and their 'codon-switched' variants. When targeted to the cell periphery using the β-actin 3′UTR, β-actin and γ-actin have differential effects on cell migration. These effects directly depend on the coding sequence. Single molecule measurements of actin isoform translation, combined with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, demonstrate a pronounced difference in β- and γ-actins' translation elongation rates in cells, leading to changes in their dynamics at the focal adhesions, impairments in actin bundle formation, and reduced cell anchoring to the substrate during migration. Our results demonstrate that coding sequence-mediated differences in actin translation play a key role in cell migration.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68318</link>
	<content:encoded>The age dynamics of sexual partnership formation determine patterns of sexually transmitted disease transmission and have long been a focus of researchers studying human immunodeficiency virus. Data on self-reported sexual partner age distributions are available from a variety of sources. We sought to explore statistical models that accurately predict the distribution of sexual partner ages over age and sex. We identified which probability distributions and outcome specifications best captured variation in partner age and quantified the benefits of modelling these data using distributional regression. We found that distributional regression with a sinh-arcsinh distribution replicated observed partner age distributions most accurately across three geographically diverse data sets. This framework can be extended with well-known hierarchical modelling tools and can help improve estimates of sexual age-mixing dynamics.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66743</link>
	<content:encoded>A functional benefit of attention is to proactively enhance perceptual sensitivity in space and time. Although attentional orienting has traditionally been associated with cortico-thalamic networks, recent evidence has shown that individuals with cerebellar degeneration (CD) show a reduced reaction time benefit from cues that enable temporal anticipation. The present study examined whether the cerebellum contributes to the proactive attentional modulation in time of perceptual sensitivity. We tested CD participants on a non-speeded, challenging perceptual discrimination task, asking if they benefit from temporal cues. Strikingly, the CD group showed no duration-specific perceptual sensitivity benefit when cued by repeated but aperiodic presentation of the target interval. In contrast, they performed similar to controls when cued by a rhythmic stream. This dissociation further specifies the functional domain of the cerebellum and establishes its role in the attentional adjustment of perceptual sensitivity in time in addition to its well-documented role in motor timing.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66596</link>
	<content:encoded>Epithelial tissues are primed to respond to insults by activating epithelial cell motility and rapid inflammation. Such responses are also elicited upon overexpression of the membrane bound protease, Matriptase, or mutation of its inhibitor, Hai1. Unrestricted Matriptase activity also predisposes to carcinoma. How Matriptase leads to these cellular outcomes is unknown. We demonstrate that zebrafish &lt;i&gt;hai1a &lt;/i&gt;mutants show increased H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NfkB signalling, and IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;-mediated calcium flashes, and that these promote inflammation, but do not generate epithelial cell motility. In contrast, inhibition of the Gq subunit in&lt;i&gt; hai1a &lt;/i&gt;mutants rescues both the inflammation and epithelial phenotypes, with the latter recapitulated by the DAG analogue, PMA. We demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;hai1a &lt;/i&gt;has elevated MAPK pathway activity, inhibition of which rescues the epidermal defects. Finally, we identify RSK kinases as MAPK targets disrupting adherens junctions in &lt;i&gt;hai1a &lt;/i&gt;mutants. Our work maps novel signalling cascades mediating the potent effects of Matriptase on epithelia, with implications for tissue damage response and carcinoma progression.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64906</link>
	<content:encoded>The generation of the enormous diversity of neuronal cell types in a differentiating nervous system entails the activation of neuron type-specific gene batteries. To examine the regulatory logic that controls the expression of neuron type-specific gene batteries, we interrogate single cell expression profiles of all 118 neuron classes of the &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; nervous system for the presence of DNA binding motifs of 136 neuronally expressed &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; transcription factors. Using a phylogenetic footprinting pipeline, we identify &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;regulatory motif enrichments among neuron class-specific gene batteries and we identify cognate transcription factors for 117 of the 118 neuron classes. In addition to predicting novel regulators of neuronal identities, our nervous system-wide analysis at single cell resolution supports the hypothesis that many transcription factors directly co-regulate the cohort of effector genes that define a neuron type, thereby corroborating the concept of so-called terminal selectors of neuronal identity. Our analysis provides a blueprint for how individual components of an entire nervous system are genetically specified.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: The Prop1-like homeobox gene unc-42 specifies the identity of synaptically connected neurons</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64903</link>
	<content:encoded>Many neuronal identity regulators are expressed in distinct populations of cells in the nervous system, but their function is often analyzed only in specific isolated cellular contexts, thereby potentially leaving overarching themes in gene function undiscovered. We show here that the &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; Prop1-like homeobox gene &lt;i&gt;unc-42&lt;/i&gt; is expressed in 15 distinct sensory, inter- and motor neuron classes throughout the entire &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; nervous system. Strikingly, all 15 neuron classes expressing &lt;i&gt;unc-42&lt;/i&gt; are synaptically interconnected, prompting us to investigate whether &lt;i&gt;unc-42&lt;/i&gt; controls the functional properties of this circuit and perhaps also the assembly of these neurons into functional circuitry. We found that &lt;i&gt;unc-42&lt;/i&gt; defines the routes of communication between these interconnected neurons by controlling the expression of neurotransmitter pathway genes, neurotransmitter receptors, neuropeptides, and neuropeptide receptors. Anatomical analysis of &lt;i&gt;unc-42&lt;/i&gt; mutant animals reveals defects in axon pathfinding and synaptic connectivity, paralleled by expression defects of molecules involved in axon pathfinding, cell-cell recognition, and synaptic connectivity. We conclude that &lt;i&gt;unc-42&lt;/i&gt; establishes functional circuitry by acting as a terminal selector of functionally connected neuron types. We identify a number of additional transcription factors that are also expressed in synaptically connected neurons and propose that terminal selectors may also function as ‘circuit organizer transcription factors’ to control the assembly of functional circuitry throughout the nervous system. We hypothesize that such organizational properties of transcription factors may be reflective of not only ontogenetic, but perhaps also phylogenetic trajectories of neuronal circuit establishment.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Invasive species represent one of the foremost risks to global biodiversity. Here, we use population genomics to evaluate the history and consequences of an invasion of wild tomato-&lt;i&gt;Solanum pimpinellifolium&lt;/i&gt;-onto the Galápagos islands from continental South America. Using &amp;gt;300 archipelago and mainland collections, we infer this invasion was recent and largely the result of a single event from central Ecuador. Patterns of ancestry within the genomes of invasive plants also reveal post-colonization hybridization and introgression between &lt;i&gt;S. pimpinellifolium&lt;/i&gt; and the closely related Galapagos endemic &lt;i&gt;Solanum cheesmaniae&lt;/i&gt;. Of admixed invasive individuals, those that carry endemic alleles at one of two different carotenoid biosynthesis loci also have orange fruits-characteristic of the endemic species-instead of typical red &lt;i&gt;S. pimpinellifolium&lt;/i&gt; fruits. We infer that introgression of two independent fruit color loci explains this observed trait convergence, suggesting that selection has favored repeated transitions of red to orange fruits on the Galapagos.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Adaptation of metabolite leakiness leads to symbiotic chemical exchange and to a resilient microbial ecosystem</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/wmo7WSQdy_M/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jumpei F. Yamagishi, Nen Saito, Kunihiko Kaneko&lt;/p&gt;

Microbial communities display remarkable diversity, facilitated by the secretion of chemicals that can create new niches. However, it is unclear why cells often secrete even essential metabolites after evolution. Based on theoretical results indicating that cells can enhance their own growth rate by leaking even essential metabolites, we show that such “leaker” cells can establish an asymmetric form of mutualism with “consumer” cells that consume the leaked chemicals: the consumer cells benefit from the uptake of the secreted metabolites, while the leaker cells also benefit from such consumption, as it reduces the metabolite accumulation in the environment and thereby enables further secretion, resulting in frequency-dependent coexistence of multiple microbial species. As supported by extensive simulations, such symbiotic relationships generally evolve when each species has a complex reaction network and adapts its leakiness to optimize its own growth rate under crowded conditions and nutrient limitations. Accordingly, symbiotic ecosystems with diverse cell species that leak and exchange many metabolites with each other are shaped by cell-level adaptation of leakiness of metabolites. Moreover, the resultant ecosystems with entangled metabolite exchange are resilient against structural and environmental perturbations. Thus, we present a theory for the origin of resilient ecosystems with diverse microbes mediated by secretion and exchange of essential chemicals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wmo7WSQdy_M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The quantitative modeling of semantic representations in the brain plays a key role in understanding the neural basis of semantic processing. Previous studies have demonstrated that word vectors, which were originally developed for use in the field of natural language processing, provide a powerful tool for such quantitative modeling. However, whether semantic representations in the brain revealed by the word vector-based models actually capture our perception of semantic information remains unclear, as there has been no study explicitly examining the behavioral correlates of the modeled brain semantic representations. To address this issue, we compared the semantic structure of nouns and adjectives in the brain estimated from word vector-based brain models with that evaluated from human behavior. The brain models were constructed using voxelwise modeling to predict the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response to natural movies from semantic contents in each movie scene through a word vector space. The semantic dissimilarity of brain word representations was then evaluated using the brain models. Meanwhile, data on human behavior reflecting the perception of semantic dissimilarity between words were collected in psychological experiments. We found a significant correlation between brain model- and behavior-derived semantic dissimilarities of words. This finding suggests that semantic representations in the brain modeled via word vectors appropriately capture our perception of word meanings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ohcN714oyF4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Identification of those at greatest risk of death due to the substantial threat of COVID-19 can benefit from novel approaches to epidemiology that leverage large datasets and complex machine-learning models, provide data-driven intelligence, and guide decisions such as intensive-care unit admission (ICUA). The objective of this study is two-fold, one substantive and one methodological: substantively to evaluate the association of demographic and health records with two related, yet different, outcomes of severe COVID-19 (viz., death and ICUA); methodologically to compare interpretations based on logistic regression and on gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) predictions interpreted by means of the Shapley impacts of covariates. Very different association of some factors, e.g., obesity and chronic respiratory diseases, with death and ICUA may guide review of practice. Shapley explanation of GBDTs identified varying effects of some factors among patients, thus emphasising the importance of individual patient assessment. The results of this study are also relevant for the evaluation of complex automated clinical decision systems, which should optimise prediction scores whilst remaining interpretable to clinicians and mitigating potential biases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WaEcwTZNArA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The dynamics of tumors growth and associated events cover multiple time and spatial scales, generally including extracellular, cellular and intracellular modifications. The main goal of this study is to model the biological and physical behavior of tumor evolution in presence of normal healthy tissue, taking in consideration a variety of events involved in the process. These include hyper and hypoactivation of signaling pathways during tumor growth, vessels growth, intratumoral vascularization and competition of cancer cells with healthy host tissue. The work addresses two distinctive phases in tumor development—the avascular and vascular phases—and in each stage two cases are considered—with and without normal healthy cells. The tumor growth rate increases considerably as closed vessel loops (anastomoses) form around the tumor cells resulting from tumor induced vascularization. When taking into account the host tissue around the tumor, the results show that competition between normal cells and cancer cells leads to the formation of a hypoxic tumor core within a relatively short period of time. Moreover, a dense intratumoral vascular network is formed throughout the entire lesion as a sign of a high malignancy grade, which is consistent with reported experimental data for several types of solid carcinomas. In comparison with other mathematical models of tumor development, in this work we introduce a multiscale simulation that models the cellular interactions and cell behavior as a consequence of the activation of oncogenes and deactivation of gene signaling pathways within each cell. Simulating a therapy that blocks relevant signaling pathways results in the prevention of further tumor growth and leads to an expressive decrease in its size (82% in the simulation).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8I63kf_WyQs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The vertebrate hindbrain is segmented into rhombomeres (r) initially defined by distinct domains of gene expression. Previous studies have shown that noise-induced gene regulation and cell sorting are critical for the sharpening of rhombomere boundaries, which start out rough in the forming neural plate (NP) and sharpen over time. However, the mechanisms controlling simultaneous formation of multiple rhombomeres and accuracy in their sizes are unclear. We have developed a stochastic multiscale cell-based model that explicitly incorporates dynamic morphogenetic changes (i.e. convergent-extension of the NP), multiple morphogens, and gene regulatory networks to investigate the formation of rhombomeres and their corresponding boundaries in the zebrafish hindbrain. During pattern initiation, the short-range signal, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), works together with the longer-range morphogen, retinoic acid (RA), to specify all of these boundaries and maintain accurately sized segments with sharp boundaries. At later stages of patterning, we show a nonlinear change in the shape of rhombomeres with rapid left-right narrowing of the NP followed by slower dynamics. Rapid initial convergence improves boundary sharpness and segment size by regulating cell sorting and cell fate both independently and coordinately. Overall, multiple morphogens and tissue dynamics synergize to regulate the sizes and boundaries of multiple segments during development.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4z1N25Nh-Ro&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Sustaining a robust metabolic network requires a balanced and fully functioning proteome. In addition to amino acids, many enzymes require cofactors (coenzymes and engrafted prosthetic groups) to function properly. Extensively validated resource allocation models, such as genome-scale models of metabolism and gene expression (ME-models), have the ability to compute an optimal proteome composition underlying a metabolic phenotype, including the provision of all required cofactors. Here we apply the ME-model for &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 MG1655 to computationally examine how environmental conditions change the proteome and its accompanying cofactor usage. We found that: (1) The cofactor requirements computed by the ME-model mostly agree with the standard biomass objective function used in models of metabolism alone (M-models); (2) ME-model computations reveal non-intuitive variability in cofactor use under different growth conditions; (3) An analysis of ME-model predicted protein use in aerobic and anaerobic conditions suggests an enrichment in the use of peroxyl scavenging acids in the proteins used to sustain aerobic growth; (4) The ME-model could describe how limitation in key protein components affect the metabolic state of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;. Genome-scale models have thus reached a level of sophistication where they reveal intricate properties of functional proteomes and how they support different &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; lifestyles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/joVILwdy1gQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Possibilistic Clustering-Promoting Semi-Supervised Learning for EEG- based Emotion Recognition</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.690044</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the latest brain computer interface(BCI) is to perform accurate emotion recognition through the customized their recognizers to each subject. In the field of machine learning, graph-based semi-supervised learning has attracted more and more attention due to its intuitive and good learning performance for emotion recognition. However, each individual subject may present noise or outlier EEG patterns in the same scenario, the existing GSSL methods are sensitive or not enough robust to noise or outlier EEG-based data. To address the problem, in this paper, we invent a Possibilistic Clustering-Promoting semi-supervised learning for EEG-based Emotion Recognition (PCP-ER). Specifically, it constrains each instance to have the same label membership value with its local weighted mean (LWM), so as to improve the reliability of the recognition method. In addition, a regularization term about fuzzy entropy is introduced into the objective function, and the generalization ability of membership function is enhanced by increasing the amount of sample discrimination information, which improves the robustness of the method to noise and outlier. A large number of experimental results on the three real datasets (i.e., DEAP, SEED and SEED-IV) show that the proposed method improves the reliability and robustness of the EEG emotion recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Fetal Neuroprotective Strategies: Therapeutic Agents and Their Underlying Synaptic Pathways</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.680899</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic signaling is integral for proper brain function. During fetal development, exposure to inflammation or mild hypoxic-ischemic insult may lead to synaptic changes and neurological damage that impairs future brain function. Preterm neonates are most susceptible to these deleterious outcomes. Evaluating clinically used and novel fetal neuroprotective measures is essential for expanding treatment options to mitigate the short and long-term consequences of fetal brain injury. Magnesium sulfate is a clinical fetal neuroprotective agent utilized in cases of imminent preterm birth. By blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, magnesium sulfate reduces glutamatergic signaling, which alters calcium influx, leading to a decrease in excitotoxicity. Emerging evidence suggests that melatonin and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) may also serve as novel putative fetal neuroprotective candidates. Melatonin has important anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and is a known mediator of synaptic plasticity and neuronal generation. While NAC acts as an antioxidant and a precursor to glutathione, it also modulates the glutamate system. Glutamate excitotoxicity and dysregulation can induce perinatal preterm brain injury through damage to maturing oligodendrocytes and neurons. The improved drug efficacy and delivery of the dendrimer-bound NAC conjugate provides an opportunity for enhanced pharmacological intervention. Here, we review recent literature on the synaptic pathways underlying these therapeutic strategies, discuss the current gaps in knowledge, and propose future directions for the field of fetal neuroprotective agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Duration Comparisons for Vision and Touch Are Dependent on Presentation Order and Temporal Context</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.664264</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Integrating visual and tactile information in the temporal domain is critical for active perception. To accomplish this, coordinated timing is required. Here, we study perceived duration within and across these two modalities. Specifically, we examined how duration comparisons within and across vision and touch were influenced by temporal context and presentation order using a two-interval forced choice task. We asked participants to compare the duration of two temporal intervals defined by tactile or visual events. Two constant standard durations (700 ms and 1,000 ms in ‘shorter’ sessions; 1,000 ms and 1,500 ms in ‘longer’ sessions) were compared to variable comparison durations in different sessions. In crossmodal trials, standard and comparison durations were presented in different modalities, whereas in the intramodal trials, the two durations were presented in the same modality. The standard duration was either presented first (&amp;lt;sc&amp;gt;) or followed the comparison duration (&amp;lt;cs&amp;gt;). In both crossmodal and intramodal conditions, we found that the longer standard duration was overestimated in &amp;lt;cs&amp;gt; trials and underestimated in &amp;lt;sc&amp;gt; trials whereas the estimation of shorter standard duration was unbiased. Importantly, the estimation of 1,000ms was biased when it was the longer standard duration within the shorter sessions but not when it was the shorter standard duration within the longer sessions, indicating an effect of temporal context. The effects of presentation order can be explained by a central tendency effect applied in different ways to different presentation orders. Both crossmodal and intramodal conditions showed better discrimination performance for &amp;lt;sc&amp;gt; trials than &amp;lt;cs&amp;gt; trials, supporting the Type B effect for both crossmodal and intramodal duration comparison. Moreover, these results were not dependent on whether the standard duration was defined using tactile or visual stimuli. Overall, our results indicate that duration comparison between vision and touch is dependent on presentation order and temporal context, but not modality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Half of all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal spectrum disorder (ALS-FTSD) patients are classified as cognitively impaired, of which 10% have frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and an additional 40% suffer from a frontotemporal syndrome not severe enough to be described as dementia (cognitively impaired/ALSci). As changes in cerebral function measured by resting-state magnet resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are known in ALS, we investigated whether group differences in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) networks could be observed between ALS patients with different cognitive profiles against healthy controls (HC). Furthermore, we correlated cognition and motor functioning with network connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Healthy controls, 69, and 97 ALS patients underwent functional MRI scanning and cognitive assessment. The ALS patients were categorized as non-impaired (ALSni; n = 68), cognitively impaired (ALSci; n = 21), and ALS-FTD (n = 8). Group differences in connectivity of the default mode network (DMN), motor network (MN), and ventral attention network (VAN) were investigated using a full-factorial model; correlations between global cognitive performance, shifting, and motor symptom severity were established using Pearson’s correlation.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;At a liberal alpha level of uncorrected p &amp;lt; 0.005 and a cluster size exceeding 20 voxels, we found widespread decreases in functional connectivity in all three networks when comparing ALS patients to HC. Similar patterns of hypoconnectivity in the bilateral motor cortices and frontotemporal emerged when comparing the ALSci and ALS-FTD patients to those not cognitively impaired. Hyperconnectivity in the DMN temporal gyrus correlated with worse global cognition; moreover, hyperconnectivity in the VAN thalamus, insula, and putamen correlated with worse shifting ability. Better-preserved motor function correlated with higher MN connectivity. Only the motor-related effects prevailed at a more conservative significance level of p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt; 0.001.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Resting-state functional connectivity differs between cognitive profiles of ALS and is directly associated with clinical presentation, specifically with motor function, and cognitive shifting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Light-activated biointerfaces provide a non-genetic route for effective control of neural activity. InP quantum dots (QDs) have a high potential for such biomedical applications due to their uniquely tunable electronic properties, photostability, toxic-heavy-metal-free content, heterostructuring, and solution-processing ability. However, the effect of QD nanostructure and biointerface architecture on the photoelectrical cellular interfacing remained unexplored. Here, we unravel the control of the photoelectrical response of InP QD-based biointerfaces via nanoengineering from QD to device-level. At QD level, thin ZnS shell growth (∼0.65 nm) enhances the current level of biointerfaces over an order of magnitude with respect to only InP core QDs. At device-level, band alignment engineering allows for the bidirectional photoelectrochemical current generation, which enables light-induced temporally precise and rapidly reversible action potential generation and hyperpolarization on primary hippocampal neurons. Our findings show that nanoengineering QD-based biointerfaces hold great promise for next-generation neurostimulation devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Correlates of Causal Inferences in Discourse Understanding and Logical Problem-Solving: A Meta-Analysis Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.666179</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In discourse comprehension, we need to draw inferences to make sense of discourse. Previous neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural correlates of causal inferences in discourse understanding. However, these findings have been divergent, and how these types of inferences are related to causal inferences in logical problem-solving remains unclear. Using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach, the current meta-analysis analyzed 19 experiments on causal inferences in discourse understanding and 20 experiments on those in logical problem-solving to identify the neural correlates of these two cognitive processes and their shared and distinct neural correlates. We found that causal inferences in discourse comprehension recruited a left-lateralized frontotemporal brain system, including the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), while causal inferences in logical problem-solving engaged a nonoverlapping brain system in the frontal and parietal cortex, including the left inferior frontal gyrus, the bilateral middle frontal gyri, the dorsal MPFC, and the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Furthermore, the pattern similarity analyses showed that causal inferences in discourse understanding were primarily related to the terms about language processing and theory-of-mind processing. Both types of inferences were found to be related to the terms about memory and executive function. These findings suggest that causal inferences in discourse understanding recruit distinct neural bases from those in logical problem-solving and rely more on semantic knowledge and social interaction experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Comparison of Closed Loop vs. Fixed Frequency tACS on Modulating Brain Oscillations and Visual Detection</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.661432</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial alternating current stimulation has emerged as an effective tool for the exploration of brain oscillations. By applying a weak alternating current between electrodes placed on the scalp matched to the endogenous frequency, tACS enables the specific modulation of targeted brain oscillations This results in alterations in cognitive functions or persistent physiological changes. Most studies that utilize tACS determine a fixed stimulation frequency prior to the stimulation that is kept constant throughout the experiment. Yet it is known that brain rhythms can encounter shifts in their endogenous frequency. This could potentially move the ongoing brain oscillations into a frequency region where it is no longer affected by the stimulation, thereby decreasing or negating the effect of tACS. Such an effect of a mismatch between stimulation frequency and endogenous frequency on the outcome of stimulation has been shown before for the parietal alpha-activity. In this study, we employed an intermittent closed loop stimulation protocol, where the stimulation is divided into short epochs, between which an EEG is recorded and rapidly analyzed to determine a new stimulation frequency for the next stimulation epoch. This stimulation protocol was tested in a three-group study against a classical fixed stimulation protocol and a sham-treatment. We targeted the parietal alpha rhythm and hypothesized that this setup will ensure a constant close match between the frequencies of tACS and alpha activity. This closer match should lead to an increased modulation of detection of visual luminance changes depending on the phase of the tACS and an increased rise in alpha peak power post stimulation when compared to a protocol with fixed pre-determined stimulation frequency. Contrary to our hypothesis, our results show that only a fixed stimulation protocol leads to a persistent increase in post-stimulation alpha power as compared to sham. Furthermore, in none of the stimulated groups significant modulation of detection performance occurred. While the lack of behavioral effects is inconclusive due to the short selection of different phase bins and trials, the physiological results suggest that a constant stimulation with a fixed frequency is actually beneficial, when the goal is to produce persistent synaptic changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: BENDR: Using Transformers and a Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning Task to Learn From Massive Amounts of EEG Data</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.653659</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks (DNNs) used for brain–computer interface (BCI) classification are commonly expected to learn general features when trained across a variety of contexts, such that these features could be fine-tuned to specific contexts. While some success is found in such an approach, we suggest that this interpretation is limited and an alternative would better leverage the newly (publicly) available massive electroencephalography (EEG) datasets. We consider how to adapt techniques and architectures used for language modeling (LM) that appear capable of ingesting awesome amounts of data toward the development of encephalography modeling with DNNs in the same vein. We specifically adapt an approach effectively used for automatic speech recognition, which similarly (to LMs) uses a self-supervised training objective to learn compressed representations of raw data signals. After adaptation to EEG, we find that a single pre-trained model is capable of modeling completely novel raw EEG sequences recorded with differing hardware, and different subjects performing different tasks. Furthermore, both the internal representations of this model and the entire architecture can be fine-tuned to a variety of downstream BCI and EEG classification tasks, outperforming prior work in more task-specific (sleep stage classification) self-supervision.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Enhanced Information Flow From Cerebellum to Secondary Visual Cortices Leads to Better Surgery Outcome in Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy Patients: A Stochastic Dynamic Causal Modeling Study With Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.632829</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) damages the spinal cord, resulting in long-term neurological impairment including motor and visual deficits. Given that visual feedback is crucial in guiding movements, the visual disorder may be a cause of motor deficits in patients with DCM. It has been shown that increased functional connectivity between secondary visual cortices and cerebellum, which are functionally related to the visually guided movements, was correlated with motor function in patients with DCM. One possible explanation is that the information integration between these regions was increased to compensate for impaired visual acuity in patients with DCM and resulted in better visual feedback during motor function. However, direct evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking. To test this hypothesis and explore in more detail the information flow within the “visual-cerebellum” system, we measured the effective connectivity (EC) among the “visual-cerebellum” system via dynamic causal modeling and then tested the relationship between the EC and visual ability in patients with DCM. Furthermore, the multivariate pattern analysis was performed to detect the relationship between the pattern of EC and motor function in patients with DCM. We found (1) significant increases of the bidirectional connections between bilateral secondary visual cortices and cerebellum were observed in patients with DCM; (2) the increased self-connection of the cerebellum was positively correlated with the impaired visual acuity in patients; (3) the amplitude of effectivity from the cerebellum to secondary visual cortices was positively correlated with better visual recovery following spinal cord decompression surgery; and (4) the pattern of EC among the visual-cerebellum system could be used to predict the pre-operative motor function. In conclusion, this study provided direct evidence that the increased information integration within the “visual-cerebellum” system compensated for visual impairments, which might have importance for sustaining better motor function in patients with DCM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neuroinflammation-Driven Lymphangiogenesis in CNS Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.683676</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The central nervous system (CNS) undergoes immunosurveillance despite the lack of conventional antigen presenting cells and lymphatic vessels in the CNS parenchyma. Additionally, the CNS is bathed in a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is continuously produced, and consequently must continuously clear to maintain fluid homeostasis despite the lack of conventional lymphatics. During neuroinflammation, there is often an accumulation of fluid, antigens, and immune cells to affected areas of the brain parenchyma. Failure to effectively drain these factors may result in edema, prolonged immune response, and adverse clinical outcome as observed in conditions including traumatic brain injury, ischemic and hypoxic brain injury, CNS infection, multiple sclerosis (MS), and brain cancer. Consequently, there has been renewed interest surrounding the expansion of lymphatic vessels adjacent to the CNS which are now thought to be central in regulating the drainage of fluid, cells, and waste out of the CNS. These lymphatic vessels, found at the cribriform plate, dorsal dural meninges, base of the brain, and around the spinal cord have each been implicated to have important roles in various CNS diseases. In this review, we discuss the contribution of meningeal lymphatics to these processes during both steady-state conditions and neuroinflammation, as well as discuss some of the many still unknown aspects regarding the role of meningeal lymphatics in neuroinflammation. Specifically, we focus on the observed phenomenon of lymphangiogenesis by a subset of meningeal lymphatics near the cribriform plate during neuroinflammation, and discuss their potential roles in immunosurveillance, fluid clearance, and access to the CSF and CNS compartments. We propose that manipulating CNS lymphatics may be a new therapeutic way to treat CNS infections, stroke, and autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reissner’s fiber (RF) is a secreted filament that floats in the neural canal of chordates. Since its discovery in 1860, there has been no agreement on its primary function, and its strong conservation across chordate species has remained a mystery for comparative neuroanatomists. Several findings, including the chemical composition and the phylogenetic history of RF, clinical observations associating RF with the development of the neural canal, and more recent studies suggesting that RF is needed to develop a straight vertebral column, may shed light on the functions of this structure across chordates. In this article, we will briefly review the evidence mentioned above to suggest a role of RF in the origin of fundamental innovations of the chordate body plan, especially the elongation of the neural tube and maintenance of the body axis. We will also mention the relevance of RF for medical conditions like hydrocephalus, scoliosis of the vertebral spine and possibly regeneration of the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.696376</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system. They provide trophic, metabolic, and structural support to neurons. In several pathologies such as multiple sclerosis (MS), these cells are severely affected and fail to remyelinate, thereby leading to neuronal death. The gold standard for studying remyelination is the g-ratio, which is measured by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Therefore, studying the fine structure of the oligodendrocyte population in the human brain at different stages through TEM is a key feature in this field of study. Here we study the ultrastructure of oligodendrocytes, its progenitors, and myelin in 10 samples of human white matter using nine different markers of the oligodendrocyte lineage (NG2, PDGFRα, A2B5, Sox10, Olig2, BCAS1, APC-(CC1), MAG, and MBP). Our findings show that human oligodendrocytes constitute a very heterogeneous population within the human white matter and that its stages of differentiation present characteristic features that can be used to identify them by TEM. This study sheds light on how these cells interact with other cells within the human brain and clarify their fine characteristics from other glial cell types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.694629</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Despite emerging evidence suggesting that visceral fat may play a major role in obesity-induced neurodegeneration, little evidence exists on the association between visceral fat and brain cortical thickness in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;Purpose&lt;p&gt;We aimed to examine the association between abdominal fat and brain cortical thickness in a Korean elderly population.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This cross-sectional study included elderly individuals without dementia (n = 316). Areas of visceral fat and subcutaneous fat (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) were estimated from computed tomography scans. Regional cortical thicknesses (mm) were obtained by analyzing brain magnetic resonance images. Given the inverted U-shaped relationship between visceral fat area and global cortical thickness (examined using a generalized additive model), visceral fat area was categorized into quintiles, with the middle quintile being the reference group. A generalized linear model was built to explore brain regions associated with visceral fat. The same approach was used for subcutaneous fat.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The mean (standard deviation) age was 67.6 (5.0) years. The highest quintile (vs. the middle quintile) group of visceral fat area had reduced cortical thicknesses in the global [β = –0.04 mm, standard error (SE) = 0.02 mm, p = 0.004], parietal (β = –0.04 mm, SE = 0.02 mm, p = 0.01), temporal (β = –0.05 mm, SE = 0.02 mm, p = 0.002), cingulate (β = –0.06 mm, SE = 0.02 mm, p = 0.01), and insula lobes (β = –0.06 mm, SE = 0.03 mm, p = 0.02). None of the regional cortical thicknesses significantly differed between the highest and the middle quintile groups of subcutaneous fat area.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that a high level of visceral fat, but not subcutaneous fat, is associated with a reduced cortical thickness in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Role of Protein Persulfidation in Brain Aging and Neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.674135</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), originally considered a toxic gas, is now a recognized gasotransmitter. Numerous studies have revealed the role of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S as a redox signaling molecule that controls important physiological/pathophysiological functions. The underlying mechanism postulated to serve as an explanation of these effects is protein persulfidation (P-SSH, also known as S-sulfhydration), an oxidative posttranslational modification of cysteine thiols. Protein persulfidation has remained understudied due to its instability and chemical reactivity similar to other cysteine modifications, making it very difficult to selectively label. Recent developments of persulfide labeling techniques have started unraveling the role of this modification in (patho)physiology. PSSH levels are important for the cellular defense against oxidative injury, albeit they decrease with aging, leaving proteins vulnerable to oxidative damage. Aging is one of the main risk factors for many neurodegenerative diseases. Persulfidation has been shown to be dysregulated in Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's disease, and Spinocerebellar ataxia 3. This article reviews the latest discoveries that link protein persulfidation, aging and neurodegeneration, and provides future directions for this research field that could result in development of targeted drug design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.670463</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is frequently presumed to be secondary to cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and associated with cognitive decline. The cerebellum plays a key role in cognition and has dense connections with other brain regions. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate if cerebellar abnormalities could occur in CSVD patients with WMHs and the possible association with cognitive performances.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 104 right-handed patients with WMHs were divided into the mild WMHs group (n = 39), moderate WMHs group (n = 37), and severe WMHs group (n = 28) according to the Fazekas scale, and 36 healthy controls were matched for sex ratio, age, education years, and acquired resting-state functional MRI. Analysis of voxel-based morphometry of gray matter volume (GMV) and seed-to-whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) was performed from the perspective of the cerebellum, and their correlations with neuropsychological variables were explored.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed a lower GMV in the bilateral cerebellum lobule VI and decreased FC between the left- and right-sided cerebellar lobule VI with the left anterior cingulate gyri in CSVD patients with WMHs. Both changes in structure and function were correlated with cognitive impairment in patients with WMHs.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study revealed damaged GMV and FC in the cerebellum associated with cognitive impairment. This indicates that the cerebellum may play a key role in the modulation of cognitive function in CSVD patients with WMHs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Stress Granules and Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Scoping Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.650740</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins called stress granules (SGs) are considered as one of the main cellular solutions against stress. Their temporary presence ends with stress relief. Any factor such as chronic stress or mutations in the structure of the components of SGs that lead to their permanent presence can affect their interactions with pathological aggregations and increase the degenerative effects. SGs involved in RNA mechanisms are important factors in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), and Alzheimer's diseases (AD). Although many studies have been performed in the field of SGs and neurodegenerative disorders, so far, no systematic studies have been executed in this field. The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive perspective of all studies about the role of SGs in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders with a focus on the protein ingredients of these granules. This scoping review is based on a six-stage methodology structure and the PRISMA guideline. A systematic search of seven databases for qualified articles was conducted until December 2020. Publications were screened independently by two reviewers and quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed on the extracted data. Bioinformatics analysis was used to plot the network and predict interprotein interactions. In addition, GO analysis was performed. A total of 48 articles were identified that comply the inclusion criteria. Most studies on neurodegenerative diseases have been conducted on ALS, AD, and FTD using human post mortem tissues. Human derived cell line studies have been used only in ALS. A total 29 genes of protein components of SGs have been studied, the most important of which are TDP-43, TIA-1, PABP-1. Bioinformatics studies have predicted 15 proteins to interact with the protein components of SGs, which may be the constituents of SGs. Understanding the interactions between SGs and pathological aggregations in neurodegenerative diseases can provide new targets for treatment of these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/70339</link>
	<content:encoded>The dynamics and diversity of the appearance of genetic variants play an essential role in the evolution of the genome and the shaping of biodiversity. Recent population-wide genome sequencing surveys have highlighted the importance of loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events and have shown that they are a neglected part of the genetic diversity landscape. To assess the extent, variability, and spectrum, we explored the accumulation of LOH events in 169 heterozygous diploid &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; mutation accumulation lines across nine genetic backgrounds. In total, we detected a large set of 22,828 LOH events across distinct genetic backgrounds with a heterozygous level ranging from 0.1 to 1%. LOH events are very frequent with a rate consistently much higher than the mutation rate, showing their importance for genome evolution. We observed that the interstitial LOH (I-LOH) events, resulting in internal short LOH tracts, were much frequent (n = 19,660) than the terminal LOH (T-LOH) events, &lt;i&gt;i.e.,&lt;/i&gt; tracts extending to the end of the chromosome (n = 3,168). However, the spectrum, the rate, and the fraction of the genome under LOH vary across genetic backgrounds. Interestingly, we observed that the more the ancestors were heterozygous, the more they accumulated T-LOH events. In addition, frequent short I-LOH tracts are a signature of the lines derived from hybrids with low spore fertility. Finally, we found lines showing almost complete homozygotization during vegetative progression. Overall, our results highlight that the variable dynamics of the LOH accumulation across distinct genetic backgrounds might lead to rapid differential genome evolution during vegetative growth.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69454</link>
	<content:encoded>Targeting DNA repair pathway offers an important therapeutic strategy for Homo sapiens (human) cancers. However, the failure of DNA repair inhibitors to markedly benefit patients necessitates the development of new strategies. Here, we show that exosome component 1 (EXOSC1) promotes DNA damages and sensitizes human kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) cells to DNA repair inhibitor. Considering that endogenous source of mutation (ESM) constantly assaults genomic DNA and likely sensitize human cancer cells to the inhibitor, we first analyzed the statistical relationship between the expression of individual genes and the mutations for KIRC. Among the candidates, EXOSC1 most notably promoted DNA damages and subsequent mutations via preferentially cleaving C site(s) in single-stranded DNA. Consistently, EXOSC1 was more significantly correlated with C&amp;gt;A transversions in coding strands than these in template strands in human KIRC. Notably, KIRC patients with high EXOSC1 showed a poor prognosis, and EXOSC1 sensitized human cancer cells to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor. These results show that EXOSC1 acts as an ESM in KIRC, and targeting EXOSC1 might be a potential therapeutic strategy.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
The hippocampus and posterior parietal cortex are implicated in both episodic memory and encoding of position in an environment. In the present study, we examine the impact of locomotor behaviors associated with movement in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions on population activity patterns in these two brain structures. We utilized a five‐looped, squared spiral track containing stair segments, ramp segments, and flat segments. In addition to encoding locations along the full route, posterior parietal cortex population activity demonstrates strong pattern recurrence for similar action types at different locations in the environment. Additionally, posterior parietal and hippocampal neurons exhibit parallel modulation in the scale of representation that follows behavioral dynamics required for track traversal. These findings build on prior work examining spatial mapping in the vertical dimension and provide a better understanding of how a series of actions and visited locations can be coordinated in the generation of episodic memory.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23319?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Sex differences in brain activity have been reported across various types of long‐term memory. To our knowledge, sex differences in functional connectivity during long‐term memory have not been investigated. A previous study on the structural connectome identified that female brains have a greater degree of interhemispheric connectivity than males, whereas males have a greater degree of intrahemispheric connectivity than females. The aim of the current investigation was twofold: (a) identify which brain regions were functionally connected to the hippocampus during spatial long‐term memory, and (b) determine if there were sex differences in the functionally connected regions. During the study phase, abstract shapes were presented to the left or right of fixation. During the test phase, abstract shapes were presented at fixation and participants classified each item as previously on the “left” or “right”. A hippocampal region of interest (ROI) was identified by contrasting spatial memory hits and misses. The peak coordinate from this ROI was used to define the center of a sphere that was used as the seed for the functional connectivity analysis. The connectivity analysis produced many connected activations including the medial posterior frontal cortex, lateral posterior frontal cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and caudate/putamen. Although there were no regions with greater connectivity in females than males, the male versus female comparison produced connected activations in the medial posterior frontal cortex, anterior prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and cingulate sulcus. Females also had greater interhemispheric connectivity than males. The current findings suggest collapsing across sex in cognitive neuroscience studies may not be warranted.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Rodent mnemonic similarity task performance requires the prefrontal cortex</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23316?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Mnemonic similarity task performance, in which a known target stimulus must be distinguished from similar lures, is supported by the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex. Impairments on this task are known to manifest with advancing age. Interestingly, disrupting hippocampal activity leads to mnemonic discrimination impairments when lures are novel, but not when they are familiar. This observation suggests that other brain structures support discrimination abilities as stimuli are learned. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for retrieval of remote events and executive functions, such as working memory, and is also particularly vulnerable to dysfunction in aging. Importantly, the medial PFC is reciprocally connected to the perirhinal cortex and neuron firing in this region coordinates communication between lateral entorhinal and perirhinal cortices to presumably modulate hippocampal activity. This anatomical organization and function of the medial PFC suggests that it contributes to mnemonic discrimination; however, this notion has not been empirically tested. In the current study, rats were trained on a LEGO object‐based mnemonic similarity task adapted for rodents, and surgically implanted with guide cannulae targeting prelimbic and infralimbic regions of the medial PFC. Prior to mnemonic discrimination tests, rats received PFC infusions of the GABAA agonist muscimol. Analyses of expression of the neuronal activity‐dependent immediate‐early gene Arc in medial PFC and adjacent cortical regions confirmed muscimol infusions led to neuronal inactivation in the infralimbic and prelimbic cortices. Moreover, muscimol infusions in PFC impaired mnemonic discrimination performance relative to the vehicle control across all testing blocks when lures shared 50–90% feature overlap with the target. Thus, in contrast hippocampal infusions, PFC inactivation impaired target‐lure discrimination regardless of the novelty or familiarity of the lures. These findings indicate the PFC plays a critical role in mnemonic similarity task performance, but the time course of PFC involvement is dissociable from that of the hippocampus.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Extrahippocampal contributions to spatial navigation in humans: A review of the neuroimaging evidence</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23313?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Spatial navigation is a crucial everyday skill, which when impaired leads to a significant decrease in quality of life. In humans, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has provided extensive insights into the neural underpinnings of navigation skills. Whereas the hippocampus has been recognized as the prime region underpinning navigation abilities, by providing a cognitive map of the environment, imaging studies have also implicated a range of other brain regions. In this review, we provide an overview of the fMRI evidence for extrahippocampal contributions to spatial navigation. We show that the parahippocampal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, dorsal striatum, and the posterior parietal cortex provide important complementary functions, and ultimately form part of a functional network that regulates successful way‐finding behavior.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: A selective role for the mPFC during choice and deliberation, but not spatial memory retention over short delays</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23306?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Important interactions between memory and decision‐making processes are required to maintain high‐levels of spatial working memory task performance. Past research reveals that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HPC) are both vital structures involved in these processes. Recent evidence suggests that interactions between these two structures are dynamic and task dependent. However, there exists uncertainty surrounding the specific conditions that recruit mPFC contributions to these tasks, specifically regarding its role in retaining information online during delay periods. To address this issue, we tested rats on a spatial‐delayed alternation task in which we utilized a closed‐loop optogenetic system to transiently disrupt mPFC activity during different task epochs (delay, choice, return). By analyzing the effects of mPFC disruption on choice accuracy and a deliberative behavior known as vicarious‐trial‐and‐error (VTE), our study revealed several interesting findings regarding the role of the mPFC in spatial‐working memory tasks. The main findings include: (a) choice accuracy in the spatial‐delayed alternation (SDA) task was impaired when the mPFC was disrupted during the choice epoch and not delay or return epochs, (b) mPFC disruption resulted in a non‐epoch specific reduction in VTE occurrence which correlated with impairments in task performance. Taken together, findings from this study suggest that, during spatial decision‐making, contributions made by the mPFC are specific to points of deliberation and choice (not delay), and that VTEs are a deliberative behavior which relies on intact mPFC function.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Reconciling the object and spatial processing views of the perirhinal cortex through task‐relevant unitization</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23304?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The perirhinal cortex is situated on the border between sensory association cortex and the hippocampal formation. It serves an important function as a transition area between the sensory neocortex and the medial temporal lobe. While the perirhinal cortex has traditionally been associated with object coding and the “what” pathway of the temporal lobe, current evidence suggests a broader function of the perirhinal cortex in solving feature ambiguity and processing complex stimuli. Besides fulfilling functions in object coding, recent neurophysiological findings in freely moving rodents indicate that the perirhinal cortex also contributes to spatial and contextual processing beyond individual sensory modalities. Here, we address how these two opposing views on perirhinal cortex—the object‐centered and spatial‐contextual processing hypotheses—may be reconciled. The perirhinal cortex is consistently recruited when different features can be merged perceptually or conceptually into a single entity. Features that are unitized in these entities include object information from multiple sensory domains, reward associations, semantic features and spatial/contextual associations. We propose that the same perirhinal network circuits can be flexibly deployed for multiple cognitive functions, such that the perirhinal cortex performs similar unitization operations on different types of information, depending on behavioral demands and ranging from the object‐related domain to spatial, contextual and semantic information.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Role of the reuniens and rhomboid thalamic nuclei in anxiety‐like avoidance behavior in the rat</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23302?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The nucleus reuniens (RE) and rhomboid (RH) nuclei of the ventral midline thalamus are reciprocally connected with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HF) and serve as key intermediaries between these structures, regulating cognitive and emotional behaviors. Regarding affective behavior, several recent reports have described the involvement of RE/RH in the acquisition and retention of conditioned fear, but little is known regarding their role (RE/RH) in anxiety‐like behaviors. We examined the role of RH/RE on avoidance and defensive behaviors in male Long Evans rats using the elevated plus maze (EPM). We found that the reversible suppression of RE/RH with muscimol increased avoidance behavior to the open arms of the plus maze as shown by: (a) significant reductions in open arm entries; (b) reductions in the mean duration of time spent in the open arms; and (c) significant increases in retreats during open arm exploration. This was coupled with decreases in the number of head dips in the maze. Consistent with these behavioral effects, a single exposure of naïve rats to the plus maze produced significant increases in c‐fos expression selectively in RE and RH of midline thalamic nuclei. We posit that RE/RH normally acts to optimize adaptive responses to anxiety‐eliciting situations, and disruptions of RE/RH produce severe deficits in coping behaviors—or as shown here increases in avoidance/defensive behaviors. In sum, the present results establish a novel role for RE/RH in anxiety‐like avoidance behavior. In addition to its role in attention, working memory, and executive control, RE/RH also regulates adaptative responses to not only fear but also to anxiogenic stimuli. As such, dysfunction of RE/RH may contribute to the amalgamation of symptoms common to many mental health disorders including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and PTSD.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Extinction and discrimination in a Bayesian model of context fear conditioning (BaconX)</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23298?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The extinction of contextual fear is commonly an essential requirement for successful exposure therapy for fear disorders. However, experimental work on extinction of contextual fear is limited, and there little or no directly relevant theoretical work. Here, we extend BACON, a neurocomputational model of context fear conditioning that provides plausible explanations for a number of aspects of context fear conditioning, to deal with extinction (calling the model BaconX). In this model, contextual representations are formed in the hippocampus and association of fear to them occurs in the amygdala. Representation creation, conditionability, and development of between‐session extinction are controlled by degree of confidence (assessed by the Bayesian weight of evidence) that an active contextual representation is in fact that of the current context (i.e., is “valid”). The model predicts that: (1) extinction which persists between sessions will occur only if at a sessions end there is high confidence that the active representation is valid. It follows that the shorter the context placement‐to‐US (shock) interval (“PSI”) and the less is therefore learned about context, the longer extinction sessions must be for enduring extinction to occur, while too short PSIs will preclude successful extinction. (2) Short‐PSI deficits can be rescued by contextual exposure even after conditioning has occurred. (3) Learning to discriminate well between a conditioned and similar safe context requires representations of each to form, which may not occur if PSI was too short. (4) Extinction‐causing inhibition must be applied downstream of the conditioning locus for reasonable generalization properties to be generated. (5) Context change tends to cause return of extinguished contextual fear. (6). Extinction carried out in the conditioning context generalizes better than extinction executed in contexts to which fear has generalized (as done in exposure therapy). (7) BaconX suggests novel approaches to exposure therapy.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Goal‐directed interaction of stimulus and task demand in the parahippocampal region</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23295?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The hippocampus and parahippocampal region are essential for representing episodic memories involving various spatial locations and objects, and for using those memories for future adaptive behavior. The “dual‐stream model” was initially formulated based on anatomical characteristics of the medial temporal lobe, dividing the parahippocampal region into two streams that separately process and relay spatial and nonspatial information to the hippocampus. Despite its significance, the dual‐stream model in its original form cannot explain recent experimental results, and many researchers have recognized the need for a modification of the model. Here, we argue that dividing the parahippocampal region into spatial and nonspatial streams a priori may be too simplistic, particularly in light of ambiguous situations in which a sensory cue alone (e.g., visual scene) may not allow such a definitive categorization. Upon reviewing evidence, including our own, that reveals the importance of goal‐directed behavioral responses in determining the relative involvement of the parahippocampal processing streams, we propose the Goal‐directed Interaction of Stimulus and Task‐demand (GIST) model. In the GIST model, input stimuli such as visual scenes and objects are first processed by both the postrhinal and perirhinal cortices—the postrhinal cortex more heavily involved with visual scenes and perirhinal cortex with objects—with relatively little dependence on behavioral task demand. However, once perceptual ambiguities are resolved and the scenes and objects are identified and recognized, the information is then processed through the medial or lateral entorhinal cortex, depending on whether it is used to fulfill navigational or non‐navigational goals, respectively. As complex sensory stimuli are utilized for both navigational and non‐navigational purposes in an intermixed fashion in naturalistic settings, the hippocampus may be required to then put together these experiences into a coherent map to allow flexible cognitive operations for adaptive behavior to occur.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Functional connectivity with the anterior and posterior hippocampus during spatial memory</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23283?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Evidence of differential connectivity and activity patterns across the long‐axis of the hippocampus has led to many hypotheses about functional specialization of the anterior and posterior hippocampus, including a hypothesis linking the anterior hippocampus to memory encoding and the posterior hippocampus to memory retrieval. The hippocampal encoding/retrieval and network (HERNET) model of memory predicts that encoding should engage the anterior hippocampus and the attention network, whereas retrieval should engage the posterior hippocampus and the default network. In a previous fMRI study that employed multivoxel pattern analysis, we found that the patterns of activity in the anterior hippocampus predicted the quadrant of spatial memory encoding. In the current fMRI study, we investigated whether the spatial memory encoding activity in the anterior hippocampus and retrieval activity in the posterior hippocampus had a higher degree of connectivity to the attention network or the default network. During the study phase, abstract shapes were presented in each quadrant of the visual field and participants were instructed to remember each shape's location while maintaining central fixation. During the test phase, the same shapes were presented in the center of the screen and participants identified the previous location of each shape. Generalized psychophysiological interaction analyses were conducted between the anatomically defined anterior and posterior hippocampus and the rest of the brain. This revealed preferential connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and regions of the attention network during encoding and between the posterior hippocampus and regions of the default network during retrieval. In addition, there were location‐specific patterns of connectivity with the anterior hippocampus and posterior hippocampus during encoding and retrieval of right visual field items. These results suggest that the anterior and posterior hippocampus interact with regions of the attention network and default network during spatial memory encoding and retrieval, respectively, and support the HERNET model of memory.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Calretinin and calbindin architecture of the midline thalamus associated with prefrontal–hippocampal circuitry</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23271?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The midline thalamus bidirectionally connects the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HC) creating a unique cortico‐thalamo‐cortical circuit fundamental to memory and executive function. While the anatomical connectivity of midline thalamus has been thoroughly investigated, little is known about its cellular organization within each nucleus. Here we used immunohistological techniques to examine cellular distributions in the midline thalamus based on the calcium binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calretinin (CR), and calbindin (CB). We also examined these calcium binding proteins in a population of reuniens cells known to project to both mPFC and HC using a dual fluorescence retrograde adenoassociated virus‐based tracing approach. These dual reuniens mPFC‐HC projecting cells, in particular, are thought to be important for synchronizing mPFC and HC activity. First, we confirmed the absence of PV+ neurons in the midline thalamus. Second, we found a common pattern of CR+ and CB+ cells throughout midline thalamus with CR+ cells running along the nearby third ventricle (3V) and penetrating the midline. CB+ cells were consistently more lateral and toward the middle of the dorsal‐ventral extent of the midline thalamus. Notably, single‐labeled CR+ and CB+ zones were partially overlapping and included dual‐labeled CR+/CB+ cells. Within RE, we also observed a CR and CB subzone specific diversity. Interestingly, dual mPFC‐HC projecting neurons in RE expressed none of the calcium binding proteins examined, but were contained in nests of CR+ and CB+ cells. Overall, the midline thalamus was well organized into CR+ and CB+ rich zones distributed throughout the region, with dual mPFC‐HC projecting cells in reuniens representing a unique cell population. These results provide a cytoarchitectural organization in the midline thalamus based on calcium binding protein expression, and set the stage for future cell‐type specific interrogations of the functional role of these different cell populations in mPFC‐HC interactions.</content:encoded>

Lung cancer is still a leading cause of death worldwide. In recent years, knowledge has been obtained of the mechanisms modulating ion channel kinetics and thus of cell bioelectric properties, which is promising for oncological biomarkers and targets. The complex interplay of channel expression and its consequences on malignant processes, however, is still insufficiently understood. We here introduce the first approach of an in-silico whole-cell ion current model of a cancer cell, in particular of the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma, including the main functionally expressed ion channels in the plasma membrane as so far known. This hidden Markov-based model represents the electrophysiology behind proliferation of the A549 cell, describing its rhythmic oscillation of the membrane potential able to trigger the transition between cell cycle phases, and it predicts membrane potential changes over the cell cycle provoked by targeted ion channel modulation. This first A549 in-silico cell model opens up a deeper insight and understanding of possible ion channel interactions in tumor development and progression, and is a valuable tool for simulating altered ion channel function in lung cancer electrophysiology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QAN6p9QfX0M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Intrathecal Immunoglobulin M Synthesis is an Independent Biomarker for Higher Disease Activity and Severity in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26137?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
We aimed to determine in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) whether intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG is associated with outcomes reflecting inflammatory activity and chronic worsening.


Methods
We compared cerebrospinal fluid analysis, clinical and magnetic resonance imaging data, and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels at baseline and follow‐up in 530 patients with relapsing MS. Patients were categorized by the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands (OCGB) and intrathecal synthesis of IgG and IgM (intrathecal fraction [IF]: IgGIF and IgMIF). Relationships with the time to first relapse, sNfL concentrations, T2‐weighted (T2w) lesions, MS Severity Score (MSSS), and time to initiation of high‐efficacy therapy were analyzed in covariate‐adjusted statistical models.


Results
By categorical analysis, in patients with IgMIF the median time to first relapse was 28 months shorter and MSSS on average higher by 1.11 steps compared with patients without intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis. Moreover, patients with IgMIF had higher sNfL concentrations, more new/enlarging T2w lesions, and higher total T2w lesion counts (all p ≤ 0.01). These associations were absent or equally smaller in patients who were positive for only OCGB or OCGB/IgGIF. Furthermore, quantitative analyses revealed that in patients with IgMIF ≥ median, the time to first relapse and to initiation of high‐efficacy therapy was shorter by 32 and by 203 months, respectively (both p &amp;lt; 0.01), in comparison to patients with IgMIF &amp;lt; median. Dose‐dependent associations were also found for IgMIF but not for IgGIF with magnetic resonance imaging‐defined disease activity and sNfL.


Interpretation
This large study supports the value of intrathecal IgM synthesis as an independent biomarker of disease activity and severity in relapsing MS. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>As of April 22, 2021, around 1.5 million individuals in three districts of Kerala, India had been vaccinated with COVID‐19 vaccines. Over 80% of these individuals (1.2 million) received the ChAdOx1‐S/nCoV‐19 vaccine. In this population, during this period of 4 weeks (mid‐March to mid‐April 2021), we observed seven cases of Guillain‐Barre syndrome (GBS) that occurred within 2 weeks of the first dose of vaccination. All seven patients developed severe GBS. The frequency of GBS was 1.4‐ to 10‐fold higher than that expected in this period for a population of this magnitude. In addition, the frequency of bilateral facial weakness, which typically occurs in &amp;lt;20% of GBS cases, suggests a pattern associated with the vaccination. While the benefits of vaccination substantially outweigh the risk of this relatively rare outcome (5.8 per million), clinicians should be alert to this possible adverse event, as six out of seven patients progressed to areflexic quadriplegia and required mechanical ventilatory support.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Effect of Unilateral Acoustic Trauma on Neuronal Firing Activity in the Inferior Colliculus of Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.684141</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural hyperactivity induced by sound exposure often correlates with the development of hyperacusis and/or tinnitus. In laboratory animals, hyperactivity is typically induced by unilateral sound exposure to preserve one ear for further testing of hearing performance. Most ascending fibers in the auditory system cross into the superior olivary complex and then ascend contralaterally. Therefore, unilateral exposure should be expected to mostly affect the contralateral side above the auditory brain stem. On the other hand, it is well known that a significant number of neurons have crossing fibers at every level of the auditory pathway, which may spread the effect of unilateral exposure onto the ipsilateral side. Here we demonstrate that unilateral sound exposure causes development of hyperactivity in both the contra and ipsilateral inferior colliculus in mice. We found that both the spontaneous firing rate and bursting activity were increased significantly compared to unexposed mice. The neurons with characteristic frequencies at or above the center frequency of exposure showed the greatest increase. Surprisingly, this increase was more pronounced in the ipsilateral inferior colliculus. This study highlights the importance of considering both ipsi- and contralateral effects in future studies utilizing unilateral sound exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Clinical Application of Machine Learning Models for Brain Imaging in Epilepsy: A Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.684825</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent and disabling seizures. An increasing number of clinical and experimental applications of machine learning (ML) methods for epilepsy and other neurological and psychiatric disorders are available. ML methods have the potential to provide a reliable and optimal performance for clinical diagnoses, prediction, and personalized medicine by using mathematical algorithms and computational approaches. There are now several applications of ML for epilepsy, including neuroimaging analyses. For precise and reliable clinical applications in epilepsy and neuroimaging, the diverse ML methodologies should be examined and validated. We review the clinical applications of ML models for brain imaging in epilepsy obtained from a PubMed database search in February 2021. We first present an overview of typical neuroimaging modalities and ML models used in the epilepsy studies and then focus on the existing applications of ML models for brain imaging in epilepsy based on the following clinical aspects: (i) distinguishing individuals with epilepsy from healthy controls, (ii) lateralization of the temporal lobe epilepsy focus, (iii) the identification of epileptogenic foci, (iv) the prediction of clinical outcomes, and (v) brain-age prediction. We address the practical problems and challenges described in the literature and suggest some future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Small, Seeding-Competent Huntingtin Fibrils Are Prominent Aggregate Species in Brains of zQ175 Huntington’s Disease Knock-in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682172</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The deposition of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein aggregates in neurons of patients is a pathological hallmark of Huntington’s disease (HD). Previous investigations in cell-free and cell-based disease models showed mHTT exon-1 (mHTTex1) fragments with pathogenic polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts (&amp;gt;40 glutamines) to self-assemble into highly stable, β-sheet-rich protein aggregates with a fibrillar morphology. HD knock-in mouse models have not been extensively studied with regard to mHTT aggregation. They endogenously produce full-length mHTT with a pathogenic polyQ tract as well as mHTTex1 fragments. Here, we demonstrate that seeding-competent, fibrillar mHTT aggregates can be readily detected in brains of zQ175 knock-in HD mice. To do this, we applied a highly sensitive FRET-based protein amplification assay that is capable of detecting seeding-competent mHTT aggregate species down to the femtomolar range. Furthermore, we show that fibrillar structures with an average length of ∼200 nm can be enriched with aggregate-specific mouse and human antibodies from zQ175 mouse brain extracts through immunoprecipitations, confirming that such structures are formed in vivo. Together these studies indicate that small, fibrillar, seeding-competent mHTT structures are prominent aggregate species in brains of zQ175 mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: FlywheelTools: Data Curation and Manipulation on the Flywheel Platform</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.678403</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The recent and growing focus on reproducibility in neuroimaging studies has led many major academic centers to use cloud-based imaging databases for storing, analyzing, and sharing complex imaging data. Flywheel is one such database platform that offers easily accessible, large-scale data management, along with a framework for reproducible analyses through containerized pipelines. The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is the de facto standard for neuroimaging data, but curating neuroimaging data into BIDS can be a challenging and time-consuming task. In particular, standard solutions for BIDS curation are limited on Flywheel. To address these challenges, we developed “FlywheelTools,” a software toolbox for reproducible data curation and manipulation on Flywheel. FlywheelTools includes two elements: fw-heudiconv, for heuristic-driven curation of data into BIDS, and flaudit, which audits and inventories projects on Flywheel. Together, these tools accelerate reproducible neuroscience research on the widely used Flywheel platform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Degree and Complexity of Non-conscious Emotional Information Processing – A Review of Masked Priming Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.689369</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Whether and to what degree information can be processed non-consciously has been a matter of debate since the emergence of psychology as a science. Emotional information, in particular, has often been assumed to have a privileged status because of its relevance for well-being and survival (e.g., to detect a threat). Indeed, many studies have explored non-conscious processing of evaluative (i.e., “emotional” in a broad sense) or emotional (e.g., facial expressions) features using the “silver bullet” of non-consciousness research – the masked sequential priming paradigm. In its prototypical form, this paradigm involves the categorization of target stimuli according to valence (e.g., is the target positive or negative?). Each target is preceded by a briefly presented prime that is followed by a mask to constrain awareness. Non-conscious processing is inferred from subtle influences of the prime on target processing, that is, whether responses are faster if prime and target are valence-congruent or not. We will review this research with a focus on three questions: first, which methods are used in this area to establish non-conscious processing? Second, is there evidence for non-conscious extraction of evaluative information? Third, is there evidence for non-conscious processing beyond a simple valence (positive/negative) discrimination, for example, processing of emotion-specific information? We will highlight important current debates and potential directions in which the field will move in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Usefulness of Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy for the Assessment of Post-Stroke Depression</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.680847</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common mood disorder following stroke and is also the main factor that limits the recovery and rehabilitation of patients with stroke. The prevalence of PSD is ~30%. Since there is no gold standard for the diagnosis and evaluation of PSD, it is important to raise awareness of PSD and to establish methods for its evaluation, early diagnosis, and treatment. In the field of psychiatry, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been used as a diagnostic tool for the measurement of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb). This study aimed to assess whether fNIRS could be applied in the diagnosis and evaluation of PSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We recruited 45 patients with stroke, who were admitted to Nagasaki Kita Hospital between May 2015 and April 2019. The 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD17), which is considered to be a useful screening and evaluation tool for PSD, was used for the assessment of patients after stroke; moreover, oxy-Hb was measured in the pre-frontal cortex. The subjects were divided into two groups: the depressed group (n = 13) and the non-depressed group (n = 32). We evaluated the correlation between the oxy-Hb integral values and HAMD17 scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We investigated the relationship between the oxy-Hb integral values and HAMD17 total scores, and found a negative correlation between them (ρ = −0.331, P &amp;lt; 0.005). There was a significant difference in the oxy-Hb integral values during the activation task period between the depressed and non-depressed groups (3.16 ± 2.7 and 1.71 ± 2.4, respectively; P = 0.040). The results indicated that the patients of the depressed group showed lower oxy-Hb integral values and lower activation in the frontal lobe in comparison with the patients of the non-depressed group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The present study highlights that the measurement of oxy-Hb by using fNIRS is a useful methodology for the diagnosis of PSD in patients after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neurofeedback Training of Auditory Selective Attention Enhances Speech-In-Noise Perception</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.676992</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Selective attention enhances cortical responses to attended sensory inputs while suppressing others, which can be an effective strategy for speech-in-noise (SiN) understanding. Emerging evidence exhibits a large variance in attentional control during SiN tasks, even among normal-hearing listeners. Yet whether training can enhance the efficacy of attentional control and, if so, whether the training effects can be transferred to performance on a SiN task has not been explicitly studied. Here, we introduce a neurofeedback training paradigm designed to reinforce the attentional modulation of auditory evoked responses. Young normal-hearing adults attended one of two competing speech streams consisting of five repeating words (“up”) in a straight rhythm spoken by a female speaker and four straight words (“down”) spoken by a male speaker. Our electroencephalography-based attention decoder classified every single trial using a template-matching method based on pre-defined patterns of cortical auditory responses elicited by either an “up” or “down” stream. The result of decoding was provided on the screen as online feedback. After four sessions of this neurofeedback training over 4 weeks, the subjects exhibited improved attentional modulation of evoked responses to the training stimuli as well as enhanced cortical responses to target speech and better performance during a post-training SiN task. Such training effects were not found in the Placebo Group that underwent similar attention training except that feedback was given only based on behavioral accuracy. These results indicate that the neurofeedback training may reinforce the strength of attentional modulation, which likely improves SiN understanding. Our finding suggests a potential rehabilitation strategy for SiN deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Influence of Visual Stimulation-Induced Passive Reproduction of Motor Images in the Brain on Motor Paralysis After Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.674139</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Finger flexor spasticity, which is commonly observed among patients with stroke, disrupts finger extension movement, consequently influencing not only upper limb function in daily life but also the outcomes of upper limb therapeutic exercise. Kinesthetic illusion induced by visual stimulation (KINVIS) has been proposed as a potential treatment for spasticity in patients with stroke. However, it remains unclear whether KINVIS intervention alone could improve finger flexor spasticity and finger extension movements without other intervention modalities. Therefore, the current study investigated the effects of a single KINVIS session on finger flexor spasticity, including its underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, and finger extension movements. To this end, 14 patients who experienced their first episode of stroke participated in this study. A computer screen placed over the patient’s forearm displayed a pre-recorded mirror image video of the patient’s non-paretic hand performing flexion–extension movements during KINVIS. The position and size of the artificial hand were adjusted appropriately to create a perception that the artificial hand was the patient’s own. Before and after the 20-min intervention, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) scores and active range of finger extension movements of the paretic hand were determined. Accordingly, MAS scores and active metacarpophalangeal joint extension range of motion improved significantly after the intervention. Moreover, additional experimentation was performed using F-waves on eight patients whose spasticity was reduced by KINVIS to determine whether the same intervention also decreased spinal excitability. Our results showed no change in F-wave amplitude and persistence after the intervention. These results demonstrate the potential clinical significance of KINVIS as a novel intervention for improving finger flexor spasticity and extension movements, one of the most significant impairments among patients with stroke. The decrease in finger flexor spasticity following KINVIS may be attributed to neurophysiological changes not detectable by the F-wave, such as changes in presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents. Further studies are certainly needed to determine the long-term effects of KINVIS on finger spasticity, as well as the neurophysiological mechanisms explaining the reduction in spasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sweet Taste Is Complex: Signaling Cascades and Circuits Involved in Sweet Sensation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.667709</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sweetness is the preferred taste of humans and many animals, likely because sugars are a primary source of energy. In many mammals, sweet compounds are sensed in the tongue by the gustatory organ, the taste buds. Here, a group of taste bud cells expresses a canonical sweet taste receptor, whose activation induces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; rise, cell depolarization and ATP release to communicate with afferent gustatory nerves. The discovery of the sweet taste receptor, 20 years ago, was a milestone in the understanding of sweet signal transduction and is described here from a historical perspective. Our review briefly summarizes the major findings of the canonical sweet taste pathway, and then focuses on molecular details, about the related downstream signaling, that are still elusive or have been neglected. In this context, we discuss evidence supporting the existence of an alternative pathway, independent of the sweet taste receptor, to sense sugars and its proposed role in glucose homeostasis. Further, given that sweet taste receptor expression has been reported in many other organs, the physiological role of these extraoral receptors is addressed. Finally, and along these lines, we expand on the multiple direct and indirect effects of sugars on the brain. In summary, the review tries to stimulate a comprehensive understanding of how sweet compounds signal to the brain upon taste bud cells activation, and how this gustatory process is integrated with gastro-intestinal sugar sensing to create a hedonic and metabolic representation of sugars, which finally drives our behavior. Understanding of this is indeed a crucial step in developing new strategies to prevent obesity and associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Early Screening of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder Based on Electroencephalogram Signal Feature Selection With L1-Norm Regularization</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.656578</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Early screening is vital and helpful for implementing intensive intervention and rehabilitation therapy for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Research has shown that electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can reflect abnormal brain function of children with ASD, and screening with EEG signals has the characteristics of good real-time performance and high sensitivity. However, the existing EEG screening algorithms mostly focus on the data analysis in the resting state, and the extracted EEG features have some disadvantages such as weak representation capacity and information redundancy. In this study, we utilized the event-related potential (ERP) technique to acquire the EEG data of the subjects under positive and negative emotional stimulation and proposed an EEG Feature Selection Algorithm based on L1-norm regularization to perform screening of autism. The proposed EEG Feature Selection Algorithm includes the following steps: (1) extracting 20 EEG features from the raw data, (2) classification with support vector machine, (3) selecting appropriate EEG feature with L1-norm regularization according to the classification performance. The experimental results show that the accuracy for screening of children with ASD can reach 93.8% and 87.5% under positive and negative emotional stimulation and the proposed algorithm can effectively eliminate redundant features and improve screening accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.650838</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present study aimed to use event-related potentials with the stop-signal task to investigate the effects of trait anxiety on inhibitory control, error monitoring, and post-error adjustments. The stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) was used to evaluate the behavioral competence of inhibitory control. Electrophysiological signals of error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) were used to study error perception and error awareness, respectively. Post-error slowing (PES) was applied to examine the behavioral adjustments after making errors. The results showed that SSRT and PES did not differ significantly between individuals with high trait anxiety (HTA) and those with low trait anxiety (LTA). However, individuals with HTA demonstrated reduced ERN amplitudes and prolonged Pe latencies than those with LTA. Prolonged Pe latencies were also significantly associated with poorer post-error adjustments. In conclusion, HTA led to reduced cortical responses to error monitoring. Furthermore, inefficient conscious awareness of errors might lead to maladaptive post-error adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sex-Specific Associations Between Trauma Exposure, Pubertal Timing, and Anxiety in Black Children</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.636199</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent research has linked early life stress (ELS), such as trauma exposure, with early puberty. Early puberty has also been identified as a risk factor for poor mental health outcomes. However, these two paths have primarily been examined independently. In addition, more studies have examined these associations in girls than boys, and findings for boys remain mixed. We hypothesized that early puberty (relative to peers) would be positively associated with both prior trauma exposure and concurrent anxiety symptoms. We anticipated that these associations might differ by sex. We tested these hypotheses within a cross-sectional sample of 133 8- to 13-year-old Black girls and boys with trauma exposure. The association between trauma and accelerated pubertal timing was sex-specific: it was positive for girls and negative for boys. We stratified subsequent analyses by sex. Regression analyses indicated that early puberty relative to peers predicted more anxiety symptoms for girls but not boys, after accounting for trauma exposure. A statistical mediation analysis indicated that, for girls, the positive association between trauma exposure and anxiety was partially mediated by pubertal timing. These results indicate that trauma exposure may have sex-specific effects on pubertal timing and anxiety risk in Black children. We also found that, for girls, trauma may increase risk for adverse outcomes by prompting earlier puberty, which is linked to higher anxiety. These findings are consistent with cascading effects of trauma across development, and highlight the need for further study of sex-specific mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Role of the Right Hemisphere White Matter Tracts in Chronic Aphasic Patients After Damage of the Language Tracts in the Left Hemisphere</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.635750</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The involvement of the right hemisphere (RH) in language, and especially after aphasia resulting from left hemisphere (LH) lesions, has been recently highlighted. The present study investigates white matter structure in the right hemisphere of 25 chronic post-stroke aphasic patients after LH lesions in comparison with 24 healthy controls, focusing on the four cortico-cortical tracts that link posterior parietal and temporal language-related areas with Broca’s region in the inferior frontal gyrus of the LH: the Superior Longitudinal Fasciculi II and III (SLF II and SLF III), the Arcuate Fasciculus (AF), and the Temporo-Frontal extreme capsule Fasciculus (TFexcF). Additionally, the relationship of these RH white matter tracts to language performance was examined. The patients with post-stroke aphasia in the chronic phase and the healthy control participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) examination. The aphasic patients were assessed with standard aphasia tests. The results demonstrated increased axial diffusivity in the RH tracts of the aphasic patients. Patients were then divided according to the extent of the left hemisphere white matter loss. Correlations of language performance with radial diffusivity (RD) in the right hemisphere homologs of the tracts examined were demonstrated for the TFexcF, SLF III, and AF in the subgroup with limited damage to the LH language networks and only with the TFexcF in the subgroup with extensive damage. The results argue in favor of compensatory roles of the right hemisphere tracts in language functions when the LH networks are disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Fractional Anisotropy in Selected, Motor-Related White Matter Tracts and Its Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Associations With Motor Function in Healthy Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.621263</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;While it is well-known that deficits in motor performance and brain structural connectivity occur in the course of healthy aging, it is still unclear if and how these changes are related to each other. While some cross-sectional studies suggest that white matter (WM) microstructure is positively associated with motor function in healthy older adults, more evidence is needed. Moreover, longitudinal data is required to estimate whether similar associations can be found between trajectories of change in WM microstructure and motor function. The current study addresses this gap by investigating age-associations and longitudinal changes in WM microstructure and motor function, and the cross-sectional (level-level) and longitudinal (level-change, change-change) association between these two domains.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;We used multiple-occasion data (covering 4 years) from a large sample (N = 231) of healthy older adults from the Longitudinal Healthy Aging Brain (LHAB) database. To measure WM microstructure, we used diffusion-weighted imaging data to compute mean FA in three selected WM tracts [forceps minor (FMIN); superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF); corticospinal tract (CST)]. Motor function was measured via two motor speed tests (grooved pegboard, finger tapping) and one motor strength test (grip force test), separately for the left and the right hand. The statistical analysis was conducted with longitudinal growth curve models in the structural equation modeling framework.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The results revealed longitudinal decline and negative cross-sectional age-associations for mean WM FA in the FMIN and SLF, and for motor function in all tests, with a higher vulnerability for left than right hand motor performance. Regarding cross-domain associations, we found a significant positive level-level correlation among mean WM FA in the FMIN with motor speed. Mean FA in SLF and CST was not correlated with motor performance measures, and none of the level-change or change-change associations were significant. Overall, our results (a) provide important insights into aging-related changes of fine motor abilities and FA in selected white matter tracts associated with motor control, (b) support previous cross-sectional work showing that neural control of movement in older adults also involves brain structures outside the core motor system and (c) align with the idea that, in healthy aging, compensatory mechanisms may be in place and longer time delays may be needed to reveal level-change or change-change associations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

IL-17 has been detected direct toxicity on oligodendrocyte (Ol) lineage cells and inhibition on oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation, and thus promotes myelin damage. The cellular mechanism of IL-17 in CNS inflammatory diseases remains obscure. Voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (Kv) channel 1.3 is the predominant Kv channel in Ol and potentially involved in Ol function and cell cycle regulation. Kv1.3 of T cells involves in immunomodulation of inflammatory progression, but the role of Ol Kv1.3 in inflammation-related pathogenesis has not been fully investigated. We hypothesized that IL-17 induces myelin injury through Kv1.3 activation. To test the hypothesis, we studied the involvement of OPC/Ol Kv1.3 in IL-17-induced Ol/myelin injury in vitro and in vivo. Kv1.3 currents and channel expression gradually decreased during the OPC development. Application of IL-17 to OPC culture increased Kv1.3 expression, leading to a decrease of AKT activation, inhibition of proliferation and myelin basic protein reduction, which were prevented by a specific Kv1.3 blocker 5-(4-phenoxybutoxy) psoralen. IL-17-caused myelin injury was validated in LPC-induced demyelination mouse model, particularly in corpus callosum, which was also mitigated by aforementioned Kv1.3 antagonist. IL-17 altered Kv1.3 expression and resultant inhibitory effects on OPC proliferation and differentiation may by interrupting AKT phosphorylating activation. Taken together, our results suggested that IL-17 impairs remyelination and promotes myelin damage by Kv1.3-mediated Ol/myelin injury. Thus, blockade of Kv1.3 as a potential therapeutic strategy for inflammatory CNS disease may partially attribute to the direct protection on OPC proliferation and differentiation other than immunomodulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide in Learning and Memory</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.663418</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that regulates neuronal physiology and transcription through Gs/Gq-coupled receptors. Its actions within hypothalamic, limbic, and mnemonic systems underlie its roles in stress regulation, affective processing, neuroprotection, and cognition. Recently, elevated PACAP levels and genetic disruption of PAC1 receptor signaling in humans has been linked to maladaptive threat learning and pathological stress and fear in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PACAP is positioned to integrate stress and memory in PTSD for which memory of the traumatic experience is central to the disorder. However, PACAP’s role in memory has received comparatively less attention than its role in stress. In this review, we consider the evidence for PACAP-PAC1 receptor signaling in learning and plasticity, discuss emerging data on sex differences in PACAP signaling, and raise key questions for further study toward elucidating the contribution of PACAP to adaptive and maladaptive fear learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Modulation of Neural Microcircuits That Control Complex Dynamics in Olfactory Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.662184</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation influences neuronal processing, conferring neuronal circuits the flexibility to integrate sensory inputs with behavioral states and the ability to adapt to a continuously changing environment. In this original research report, we broadly discuss the basis of neuromodulation that is known to regulate intrinsic firing activity, synaptic communication, and voltage-dependent channels in the olfactory bulb. Because the olfactory system is positioned to integrate sensory inputs with information regarding the internal chemical and behavioral state of an animal, how olfactory information is modulated provides flexibility in coding and behavioral output. Herein we discuss how neuronal microcircuits control complex dynamics of the olfactory networks by homing in on a special class of local interneurons as an example. While receptors for neuromodulation and metabolic peptides are widely expressed in the olfactory circuitry, centrifugal serotonergic and cholinergic inputs modulate glomerular activity and are involved in odor investigation and odor-dependent learning. Little is known about how metabolic peptides and neuromodulators control specific neuronal subpopulations. There is a microcircuit between mitral cells and interneurons that is comprised of deep-short-axon cells in the granule cell layer. These local interneurons express pre-pro-glucagon (PPG) and regulate mitral cell activity, but it is unknown what initiates this type of regulation. Our study investigates the means by which PPG neurons could be recruited by classical neuromodulators and hormonal peptides. We found that two gut hormones, leptin and cholecystokinin, differentially modulate PPG neurons. Cholecystokinin reduces or increases spike frequency, suggesting a heterogeneous signaling pathway in different PPG neurons, while leptin does not affect PPG neuronal firing. Acetylcholine modulates PPG neurons by increasing the spike frequency and eliciting bursts of action potentials, while serotonin does not affect PPG neuron excitability. The mechanisms behind this diverse modulation are not known, however, these results clearly indicate a complex interplay of metabolic signaling molecules and neuromodulators that may fine-tune neuronal microcircuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Central Nervous System (CNS) homeostasis and function rely on intercellular synchronization of metabolic pathways. Developmental and neurochemical imbalances arising from mutations are frequently associated with devastating and often intractable neurological dysfunction.

Consideration of leukodystrophies provide a case in point; we review cell type – specific expression pattern of the disease – causing genes and reflect on genetic and cellular treatment approaches including ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell gene therapies and in vivo approaches using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. We link recent advances in vectorology to glial targeting directed towards gene therapies for specific leukodystrophies and related developmental or neurometabolic disorders affecting the CNS white matter and frame strategies for therapy development in future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dysregulation of Systemic Immunity in Aging and Dementia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.652111</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation and the tissue-resident innate immune cells, the microglia, respond and contribute to neurodegenerative pathology. Although microglia have been the focus of work linking neuroinflammation and associated dementias like Alzheimer’s Disease, the inflammatory milieu of brain is a conglomerate of cross-talk amongst microglia, systemic immune cells and soluble mediators like cytokines. Age-related changes in the inflammatory profile at the levels of both the brain and periphery are largely orchestrated by immune system cells. Strong evidence indicates that both innate and adaptive immune cells, the latter including T cells and B cells, contribute to chronic neuroinflammation and thus dementia. Neurodegenerative hallmarks coupled with more traditional immune system stimuli like infection or injury likely combine to trigger and maintain persistent microglial and thus brain inflammation. This review summarizes age-related changes in immune cell function, with special emphasis on lymphocytes as a source of inflammation, and discusses how such changes may potentiate both systemic and central nervous system inflammation to culminate in dementia. We recap the understudied area of AD-associated changes in systemic lymphocytes in greater detail to provide a unifying perspective of inflammation-fueled dementia, with an eye toward evidence of two-way communication between the brain parenchyma and blood immune cells. We focused our review on human subjects studies, adding key data from animal models as relevant.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Relaxin-3 Innervation From the Nucleus Incertus to the Parahippocampal Cortex of the Rat</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.674649</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatial learning and memory processes depend on anatomical and functional interactions between the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. A key neurophysiological component of these processes is hippocampal theta rhythm, which can be driven from subcortical areas including the pontine nucleus incertus (NI). The NI contains the largest population of neurons that produce and presumably release the neuropeptide, relaxin-3, which acts via the G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-protein-coupled receptor, relaxin-family peptide 3 receptor (RXFP3). NI activation induces general arousal including hippocampal theta, and inactivation induces impairment of spatial memory acquisition or retrieval. The primary aim of this study was to map the NI/relaxin-3 innervation of the parahippocampal cortex (PHC), including the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex, endopiriform cortex, perirhinal, postrhinal, and ectorhinal cortex, the amygdalohippocampal transition area and posteromedial cortical amygdala. Retrograde tracer injections were placed in different parts of the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex, which produced prominent retrograde labeling in the ipsilateral NI and some labeling in the contralateral NI. Anterograde tracer injections into the NI and immunostaining for relaxin-3 produced fiber labeling in deep layers of all parahippocampal areas and some dispersed fibers in superficial layers. Double-labeling studies revealed that both hippocampal projecting and calcium-binding protein-positive (presumed GABAergic) neurons received a relaxin-3 NI innervation. Some of these fibers also displayed synaptophysin (Syn) immunoreactivity, consistent with the presence of the peptide at synapses; and relaxin-3-positive fibers containing Syn bouton-like staining were frequently observed in contact with hippocampal-projecting or calcium-binding protein-positive neuronal somata and more distal elements. Finally, in situ hybridization studies revealed that entorhinal neurons in the superficial layers, and to a lesser extent in deep layers, contain RXFP3 mRNA. Together, our data support functional actions of the NI/relaxin-3-parahippocampal innervation on processes related to memory, spatial navigation and contextual analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: There is a strong need for short and effective methods to screen for cognitive impairment. Recent studies have created short forms of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (s-MoCA) in English-speaking populations. It is also important to develop a validated Chinese short version to detect cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Item response theory and computerized adaptive testing analytics were used to construct abbreviated MoCAs across a large neurological sample comprising 6,981 community-dwelling Chinese veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Six MoCA items with high discrimination and appropriate difficulty were included in the s-MoCA. The Chinese short versions (sensitivity 0.89/0.90, specificity 0.72/0.77) are similar in performance to the full MoCA in identifying cognitive impairment (sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.82).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These short variants of the MoCA may serve as quick and effective instruments when the original MoCA cannot be feasibly administered in clinical services with a high patient burden and limited cognitive testing resources.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Characterization of Lenticulostriate Arteries and Its Associations With Vascular Risk Factors in Community-Dwelling Elderly</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.685571</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lenticulostriate arteries (LSAs) supply blood to important subcortical areas and are, therefore, essential for maintaining the optimal functioning of the brain’s most metabolically active nuclei. Past studies have demonstrated the potential for quantifying the morphology of LSAs as biomarkers of vascular fragility or underlying arteriopathies. Thus, the current study aims to evaluate the morphological features of LSAs, their potential value in cerebrovascular risk stratification, and their concordance with other vascular risk factors in community-dwelling elderly people. A total of 125 community-dwelling elderly subjects who underwent a brain MRI scan were selected from our prospectively collected imaging database. The morphological measures of LSAs were calculated on the vascular skeletons obtained by manual tracing, and the number of LSAs was counted. Additionally, imaging biomarkers of small vessel disease were evaluated, and the diameters of major cerebral arteries were measured. The effects of vascular risk factors on LSA morphometry, as well as the relationship between LSA measures and other imaging biomarkers, were investigated. We found that smokers had shorter (p = 0.04) and straighter LSAs (p &amp;lt; 0.01) compared to nonsmokers, and the presence of hypertension is associated with less tortuous LSAs (p = 0.03) in community-dwelling elderly. Moreover, the middle cerebral artery diameter was positively correlated with LSA count (r = 0.278, p = 0.025) and vessel tortuosity (r = 0.257, p = 0.04). The posterior cerebral artery diameter was positively correlated with vessel tortuosity and vessel length. Considering the scarcity of noninvasive methods for measuring small artery abnormalities in the brain, the LSA morphological measures may provide valuable information to better understand cerebral small vessel degeneration during aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Modeling the impact of single-cell stochasticity and size control on the population growth rate in asymmetrically dividing cells</title>

Microbial populations show striking diversity in cell growth morphology and lifecycle; however, our understanding of how these factors influence the growth rate of cell populations remains limited. We use theory and simulations to predict the impact of asymmetric cell division, cell size regulation and single-cell stochasticity on the population growth rate. Our model predicts that coarse-grained noise in the single-cell growth rate λ decreases the population growth rate, as previously seen for symmetrically dividing cells. However, for a given noise in λ we find that dividing asymmetrically can enhance the population growth rate for cells with strong size control (between a “sizer” and an “adder”). To reconcile this finding with the abundance of symmetrically dividing organisms in nature, we propose that additional constraints on cell growth and division must be present which are not included in our model, and we explore the effects of selected extensions thereof. Further, we find that within our model, epigenetically inherited generation times may arise due to size control in asymmetrically dividing cells, providing a possible explanation for recent experimental observations in budding yeast. Taken together, our findings provide insight into the complex effects generated by non-canonical growth morphologies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/g1HQjGTKbG8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

It is computationally challenging to detect variation by aligning single-molecule sequencing (SMS) reads, or contigs from SMS assemblies. One approach to efficiently align SMS reads is sparse dynamic programming (SDP), where optimal chains of exact matches are found between the sequence and the genome. While straightforward implementations of SDP penalize gaps with a cost that is a linear function of gap length, biological variation is more accurately represented when gap cost is a concave function of gap length. We have developed a method, lra, that uses SDP with a concave-cost gap penalty, and used lra to align long-read sequences from PacBio and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) instruments as well as de novo assembly contigs. This alignment approach increases sensitivity and specificity for SV discovery, particularly for variants above 1kb and when discovering variation from ONT reads, while having runtime that are comparable (1.05-3.76×) to current methods. When applied to calling variation from &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; assembly contigs, there is a 3.2% increase in Truvari F1 score compared to minimap2+htsbox. lra is available in bioconda (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/lra) and github (https://github.com/ChaissonLab/LRA).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2xVBVLC1hG0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is transmitted by saliva and is a major cause of cancer, particularly in people living with HIV/AIDS. Here, we describe the frequency and quantity of EBV detection in the saliva of Ugandan adults with and without HIV-1 infection and use these data to develop a novel mathematical model of EBV infection in the tonsils. Eligible cohort participants were not taking antiviral medications, and those with HIV-1 infection had a CD4 count &amp;gt;200 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Over a 4-week period, participants provided daily oral swabs that we analysed for the presence and quantity of EBV. Compared with HIV-1 uninfected participants, HIV-1 coinfected participants had an increased risk of EBV detection in their saliva (IRR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.10–1.47) and higher viral loads in positive samples. We used these data to develop a stochastic, mechanistic mathematical model that describes the dynamics of EBV, infected cells, and immune response within the tonsillar epithelium to analyse potential factors that may cause EBV infection to be more severe in HIV-1 coinfected participants. The model, fit using Approximate Bayesian Computation, showed high fidelity to daily oral shedding data and matched key summary statistics. When evaluating how model parameters differed among participants with and without HIV-1 coinfection, results suggest HIV-1 coinfected individuals have higher rates of B cell reactivation, which can seed new infection in the tonsils and lower rates of an EBV-specific immune response. Subsequently, both these traits may explain higher and more frequent EBV detection in the saliva of HIV-1 coinfected individuals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/h-FIW7cLmaQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The P2 purinergic receptor family implicated in many physiological processes, including neurotransmission, mechanical adaptation and inflammation, consists of ATP-gated non-specific cation channels P2XRs and G-protein coupled receptors P2YRs. Different cells, including bone forming osteoblasts, express multiple P2 receptors; however, how P2X and P2Y receptors interact in generating cellular responses to various doses of [ATP] remains poorly understood. Using primary bone marrow and compact bone derived osteoblasts and BMP2-expressing C2C12 osteoblastic cells, we demonstrated conserved features in the P2-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses to ATP, including a transition of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; response signatures from transient at low [ATP] to oscillatory at moderate [ATP], and back to transient at high [ATP], and a non-monotonic changes in the response magnitudes which exhibited two troughs at 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; M [ATP]. We identified P2Y2 and P2X7 receptors as predominantly contributing to these responses and constructed a mathematical model of P2Y2R-induced inositol trisphosphate (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release coupled to a Markov model of P2X7R dynamics to study this system. Model predictions were validated using parental and CRISPR/Cas9-generated P2Y2 and P2Y7 knockouts in osteoblastic C2C12-BMP cells. Activation of P2Y2 by progressively increasing [ATP] induced a transition from transient to oscillatory to transient Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses due to the biphasic nature of IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and the interaction of SERCA pumps with IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs. At high [ATP], activation of P2X7R modulated the response magnitudes through an interplay between the biphasic nature of IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and the desensitization kinetics of P2X7Rs. Moreover, we found that P2Y2 activity may alter the kinetics of P2X7 towards favouring naïve state activation. Finally, we demonstrated the functional consequences of lacking P2Y2 or P2X7 in osteoblast mechanotransduction. This study thus provides important insights into the biophysical mechanisms underlying ATP-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; response signatures, which are important in mediating bone mechanoadaptation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0oaZkVb-YpA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Tumour cell heterogeneity is a major barrier for efficient design of targeted anti-cancer therapies. A diverse distribution of phenotypically distinct tumour-cell subpopulations prior to drug treatment predisposes to non-uniform responses, leading to the elimination of sensitive cancer cells whilst leaving resistant subpopulations unharmed. Few strategies have been proposed for quantifying the variability associated to individual cancer-cell heterogeneity and minimizing its undesirable impact on clinical outcomes. Here, we report a computational approach that allows the rational design of combinatorial therapies involving epigenetic drugs against chromatin modifiers. We have formulated a stochastic model of a bivalent transcription factor that allows us to characterise three different qualitative behaviours, namely: bistable, high- and low-gene expression. Comparison between analytical results and experimental data determined that the so-called bistable and high-gene expression behaviours can be identified with undifferentiated and differentiated cell types, respectively. Since undifferentiated cells with an aberrant self-renewing potential might exhibit a cancer/metastasis-initiating phenotype, we analysed the efficiency of combining epigenetic drugs against the background of heterogeneity within the bistable sub-ensemble. Whereas single-targeted approaches mostly failed to circumvent the therapeutic problems represented by tumour heterogeneity, combinatorial strategies fared much better. Specifically, the more successful combinations were predicted to involve modulators of the histone H3K4 and H3K27 demethylases KDM5 and KDM6A/UTX. Those strategies involving the H3K4 and H3K27 methyltransferases MLL2 and EZH2, however, were predicted to be less effective. Our theoretical framework provides a coherent basis for the development of an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; platform capable of identifying the epigenetic drugs combinations best-suited to therapeutically manage non-uniform responses of heterogenous cancer cell populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1sjLZ8UdrgE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cellular force generation and force transmission are of fundamental importance for numerous biological processes and can be studied with the methods of Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) and Monolayer Stress Microscopy. Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy solve the inverse problem of reconstructing cell-matrix tractions and inter- and intra-cellular stresses from the measured cell force-induced deformations of an adhesive substrate with known elasticity. Although several laboratories have developed software for Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy computations, there is currently no software package available that allows non-expert users to perform a full evaluation of such experiments. Here we present pyTFM, a tool to perform Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy on cell patches and cell layers grown in a 2-dimensional environment. pyTFM was optimized for ease-of-use; it is open-source and well documented (hosted at https://pytfm.readthedocs.io/) including usage examples and explanations of the theoretical background. pyTFM can be used as a standalone Python package or as an add-on to the image annotation tool &lt;i&gt;ClickPoints&lt;/i&gt;. In combination with the &lt;i&gt;ClickPoints&lt;/i&gt; environment, pyTFM allows the user to set all necessary analysis parameters, select regions of interest, examine the input data and intermediary results, and calculate a wide range of parameters describing forces, stresses, and their distribution. In this work, we also thoroughly analyze the accuracy and performance of the Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy algorithms of pyTFM using synthetic and experimental data from epithelial cell patches.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Qmm2fhn5cA4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Synaptic plasticity is a cellular model for learning and memory. However, the expression mechanisms underlying presynaptic forms of plasticity are not well understood. Here, we investigate functional and structural correlates of presynaptic potentiation at large hippocampal mossy fiber boutons induced by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. We performed 2-photon imaging of the genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGlu&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; that revealed an increase in the surface area used for glutamate release at potentiated terminals. Time-gated stimulated emission depletion microscopy revealed no change in the coupling distance between P/Q-type calcium channels and release sites mapped by Munc13-1 cluster position. Finally, by high-pressure freezing and transmission electron microscopy analysis, we found a fast remodeling of synaptic ultrastructure at potentiated boutons: Synaptic vesicles dispersed in the terminal and accumulated at the active zones, while active zone density and synaptic complexity increased. We suggest that these rapid and early structural rearrangements might enable long-term increase in synaptic strength.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/epQIgyneSMY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Cytoarchitectural characteristics associated with cognitive flexibility in raccoons</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25197?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We confirmed the presence of von Economo neurons in the frontoinsular cortex of all animals. Focusing on problem‐solving ability, raccoons exhibiting high levels of cognitive flexibility had increased total cell counts (via isotropic fractionation) and higher numbers of fusiform cells (via thionin histology) in the hippocampus.







Abstract
With rates of psychiatric illnesses such as depression continuing to rise, additional preclinical models are needed to facilitate translational neuroscience research. In the current study, the raccoon (Procyon lotor) was investigated due to its similarities with primate brains, including comparable proportional neuronal densities, cortical magnification of the forepaw area, and cortical gyrification. Specifically, we report on the cytoarchitectural characteristics of raccoons profiled as high, intermediate, or low solvers in a multiaccess problem‐solving task. Isotropic fractionation indicated that high‐solvers had significantly more cells in the hippocampus (HC) than the other solving groups; further, a nonsignificant trend suggested that this increase in cell profile density was due to increased nonneuronal (e.g., glial) cells. Group differences were not observed in the cellular density of the somatosensory cortex. Thionin‐based staining confirmed the presence of von Economo neurons (VENs) in the frontoinsular cortex, although no impact of solving ability on VEN cell profile density levels was observed. Elongated fusiform cells were quantified in the HC dentate gyrus where high‐solvers were observed to have higher levels of this cell type than the other solving groups. In sum, the current findings suggest that varying cytoarchitectural phenotypes contribute to cognitive flexibility. Additional research is necessary to determine the translational value of cytoarchitectural distribution patterns on adaptive behavioral outcomes associated with cognitive performance and mental health.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.688673</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the complex neural circuits that underpin brain function and behavior has been a long-standing goal of neuroscience. Yet this is no small feat considering the interconnectedness of neurons and other cell types, both within and across brain regions. In this review, we describe recent advances in mouse molecular genetic engineering that can be used to integrate information on brain activity and structure at regional, cellular, and subcellular levels. The convergence of structural inputs can be mapped throughout the brain in a cell type-specific manner by antero- and retrograde viral systems expressing various fluorescent proteins and genetic switches. Furthermore, neural activity can be manipulated using opto- and chemo-genetic tools to interrogate the functional significance of this input convergence. Monitoring neuronal activity is obtained with precise spatiotemporal resolution using genetically encoded sensors for calcium changes and specific neurotransmitters. Combining these genetically engineered mapping tools is a compelling approach for unraveling the structural and functional brain architecture of complex behaviors and malfunctioned states of neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Long Non-coding RNA LINC01119 Promotes Neuropathic Pain by Stabilizing BDNF Transcript</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.673669</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain (NP) is caused by primary injury or dysfunction of the peripheral and the central nervous system. Long non-coding RNAs were critical regulators involved in nervous system diseases, however, the precise regulatory mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to uncover the essential role of LINC01119 in NP progression and further clarify the underlying regulatory mechanism at post-transcriptional level. LINC01119 was significantly upregulated in rats of spare nerve injury (SNI) group compared to sham group. Functionally, silencing of LINC01119 significantly alleviated the neuropathic pain-induced hypersensitivity and reduced the increase in IL−6, IL−1β, and TNF−α caused by SNI. Mechanistically, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was identified as the functional target of LINC01119. Besides, an RNA binding protein, ELAVL1 could directly interact with LINC01119, and this formed LINC01119- ELAVL1 complex binds to BDNF mRNA, strengthening its RNA stability and increasing the expression level of BDNF at both transcript and protein levels. Clinically, serum LINC01119 was verified as a promising diagnostic biomarker for NP patients. LINC01119 induces NP progression via binding with ELAVL1 and increasing BDNF mRNA stability and expression level. Therefore, LINC01119 may serve as a promising diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for NP treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.683426</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning implementations using convolutional neural nets have recently demonstrated promise in many areas of medical imaging. In this article we lay out the methods by which we have achieved consistently high quality, high throughput computation of intra-cranial segmentation from whole head magnetic resonance images, an essential but typically time-consuming bottleneck for brain image analysis. We refer to this output as “production-level” because it is suitable for routine use in processing pipelines. Training and testing with an extremely large archive of structural images, our segmentation algorithm performs uniformly well over a wide variety of separate national imaging cohorts, giving Dice metric scores exceeding those of other recent deep learning brain extractions. We describe the components involved to achieve this performance, including size, variety and quality of ground truth, and appropriate neural net architecture. We demonstrate the crucial role of appropriately large and varied datasets, suggesting a less prominent role for algorithm development beyond a threshold of capability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Neurofilament Light Chain as Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Dementia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.679199</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are two related currently incurable neurodegenerative diseases. ALS is characterized by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons causing relentless paralysis of voluntary muscles, whereas in FTD, progressive atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain results in deterioration of cognitive functions, language, personality, and behavior. In contrast to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), ALS and FTD still lack a specific neurochemical biomarker reflecting neuropathology ex vivo. However, in the past 10 years, considerable progress has been made in the characterization of neurofilament light chain (NFL) as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood biomarker for both diseases. NFL is a structural component of the axonal cytoskeleton and is released into the CSF as a consequence of axonal damage or degeneration, thus behaving in general as a relatively non-specific marker of neuroaxonal pathology. However, in ALS, the elevation of its CSF levels exceeds that observed in most other neurological diseases, making it useful for the discrimination from mimic conditions and potentially worthy of consideration for introduction into diagnostic criteria. Moreover, NFL correlates with disease progression rate and is negatively associated with survival, thus providing prognostic information. In FTD patients, CSF NFL is elevated compared with healthy individuals and, to a lesser extent, patients with other forms of dementia, but the latter difference is not sufficient to enable a satisfying diagnostic performance at individual patient level. However, also in FTD, CSF NFL correlates with several measures of disease severity. Due to technological progress, NFL can now be quantified also in peripheral blood, where it is present at much lower concentrations compared with CSF, thus allowing less invasive sampling, scalability, and longitudinal measurements. The latter has promoted innovative studies demonstrating longitudinal kinetics of NFL in presymptomatic individuals harboring gene mutations causing ALS and FTD. Especially in ALS, NFL levels are generally stable over time, which, together with their correlation with progression rate, makes NFL an ideal pharmacodynamic biomarker for therapeutic trials. In this review, we illustrate the significance of NFL as biomarker for ALS and FTD and discuss unsolved issues and potential for future developments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.661504</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives To characterize subcortical nuclei by multi-parametric quantitative magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: The following quantitative multiparametric MR data of five healthy volunteers were acquired on a 7T MRI system: 3D gradient echo (GRE) data for the calculation of quantitative susceptibility maps (QSM), GRE sequences with and without off-resonant magnetic transfer pulse for magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) calculation, a magnetization−prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence for T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; mapping, and (after a coil change) a density-adapted 3D radial pulse sequence for &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Na imaging. First, all data were co-registered to the GRE data, volumes of interest (VOIs) for 21 subcortical structures were drawn manually for each volunteer, and a combined voxel-wise analysis of the four MR contrasts (QSM, MTR, T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Na) in each structure was conducted to assess the quantitative, MR value-based differentiability of structures. Second, a machine learning algorithm based on random forests was trained to automatically classify the groups of multi-parametric voxel values from each VOI according to their association to one of the 21 subcortical structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results The analysis of the integrated multimodal visualization of quantitative MR values in each structure yielded a successful classification among nuclei of the ascending reticular activation system (ARAS), the limbic system and the extrapyramidal system, while classification among (epi-)thalamic nuclei was less successful. The machine learning-based approach facilitated quantitative MR value-based structure classification especially in the group of extrapyramidal nuclei and reached an overall accuracy of 85% regarding all selected nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion Multimodal quantitative MR enabled excellent differentiation of a wide spectrum of subcortical nuclei with reasonable accuracy and may thus enable sensitive detection of disease and nucleus-specific MR-based contrast alterations in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Parametric Estimation of Reference Signal Intensity for Semi-Quantification of Tau Deposition: A Flortaucipir and [18F]-APN-1607 Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.598234</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can reveal the pathophysiology and neurodegeneration that occurs in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in vivo. The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) is widely used for semi-quantification of tau deposition but is susceptible to disturbance from the reference region and the partial volume effect (PVE). To overcome this problem, we applied the parametric estimation of reference signal intensity (PERSI) method—which was previously evaluated for flortaucipir imaging—to two tau tracers, flortaucipir and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-APN-1607.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Two cohorts underwent tau PET scanning. Flortaucipir PET imaging data for cohort I (65 healthy controls [HCs], 60 patients with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 12 AD patients) were from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative database. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-APN-1607 ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-PM-PBB3) PET imaging data were for Cohort II, which included 21 patients with a clinical diagnosis of amyloid PET-positive AD and 15 HCs recruited at Huashan Hospital. We used white matter (WM) postprocessed by PERSI (PERSI-WM) as the reference region and compared this with the traditional semi-quantification method that uses the whole cerebellum as the reference. SUVRs were calculated for regions of interest including the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes; anterior and posterior cingulate; precuneus; and Braak I/II (entorhinal cortex and hippocampus). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and effect sizes were used to compare the two methods in terms of ability to discriminate between different clinical groups.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In both cohorts, regional SUVR determined using the PERSI-WM method was superior to using the cerebellum as reference region for measuring tau retention in AD patients (e.g., SUVR of the temporal lobe: flortaucipir, 1.08 ± 0.17 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-APN-1607, 1.57 ± 0.34); and estimates of the effect size and areas under the ROC curve (AUC) indicated that it also increased between-group differences (e.g., AUC of the temporal lobe for HC vs AD: flortaucipir, 0.893 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-APN-1607: 0.949).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The PERSI-WM method significantly improves diagnostic discrimination compared to conventional approach of using the cerebellum as a reference region and can mitigate the PVE; it can thus enhance the efficacy of semi-quantification of multiple tau tracers in PET scanning, making it suitable for large-scale clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Prefrontal Theta-Phase Synchronized Brain Stimulation With Real-Time EEG-Triggered TMS</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.691821</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Theta-band neuronal oscillations in the prefrontal cortex are associated with several cognitive functions. Oscillatory phase is an important correlate of excitability and phase synchrony mediates information transfer between neuronal populations oscillating at that frequency. The ability to extract and exploit the prefrontal theta rhythm in real time in humans would facilitate insight into neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive processes involving the prefrontal cortex, and development of brain-state-dependent stimulation for therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;We investigate individual source-space beamforming-based estimation of the prefrontal theta oscillation as a method to target specific phases of the ongoing theta oscillations in the human dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) with real-time EEG-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Different spatial filters for extracting the prefrontal theta oscillation from EEG signals are compared and additional signal quality criteria are assessed to take into account the dynamics of this cortical oscillation.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty two healthy participants were recruited for anatomical MRI scans and EEG recordings with 18 composing the final analysis. We calculated individual spatial filters based on EEG beamforming in source space. The extracted EEG signal was then used to simulate real-time phase-detection and quantify the accuracy as compared to post-hoc phase estimates. Different spatial filters and triggering parameters were compared. Finally, we validated the feasibility of this approach by actual real-time triggering of TMS pulses at different phases of the prefrontal theta oscillation.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Higher phase-detection accuracy was achieved using individualized source-based spatial filters, as compared to an average or standard Laplacian filter, and also by detecting and avoiding periods of low theta amplitude and periods containing a phase reset. Using optimized parameters, prefrontal theta-phase synchronized TMS of DMPFC was achieved with an accuracy of ±55°.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates the feasibility of triggering TMS pulses during different phases of the ongoing prefrontal theta oscillation in real time. This method is relevant for brain state-dependent stimulation in human studies of cognition. It will also enable new personalized therapeutic repetitive TMS protocols for more effective treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Groupitizing Improves Estimation of Numerosity of Auditory Sequences</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.687321</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Groupitizing is a recently described phenomenon of numerosity perception where clustering items of a set into smaller “subitizable” groups improves discrimination. Groupitizing is thought to be rooted on the subitizing system, with which it shares several properties: both phenomena accelerate counting and decrease estimation thresholds irrespective of stimulus format (for both simultaneous and sequential numerosity perception) and both rely on attention. As previous research on groupitizing has been almost completely limited to vision, the current study investigates whether it generalizes to other sensory modalities. Participants estimated the numerosity of a series of tones clustered either by proximity in time or by similarity in frequency. We found that compared with unstructured tone sequences, grouping lowered auditory estimation thresholds by up to 20%. The groupitizing advantage was similar across different grouping conditions, temporal proximity and tone frequency similarity. These results mirror the groupitizing effect for visual stimuli, suggesting that, like subitizing, groupitizing is an a-modal phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Changes in Corticospinal Circuits During Premovement Facilitation in Physiological Conditions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.684013</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Changes in corticospinal excitability have been well documented in the preparatory period before movement, however, their mechanisms and physiological role have not been entirely elucidated. We aimed to investigate the functional changes of excitatory corticospinal circuits during a reaction time (RT) motor task (thumb abduction) in healthy subjects (HS). 26 HS received single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor cortex (M1). After a visual go signal, we calculated RT and delivered TMS at three intervals (50, 100, and 150 ms) within RT and before movement onset, recording motor evoked potentials (MEP) from the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and the task-irrelevant abductor digiti minimi (ADM). We found that TMS increased MEP&lt;sub&gt;APB&lt;/sub&gt; amplitude when delivered at 150, 100, and 50 ms before movement onset, demonstrating the occurrence of premovement facilitation (PMF). MEP increase was greater at the shorter interval (MEP&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) and restricted to APB (no significant effects were detected recording from ADM). We also reported time-dependent changes of the RT and a TMS side-dependent effect on MEP amplitude (greater on the dominant side). In conclusion, we here report changes of RT and side-dependent, selective and facilitatory effects on the MEP&lt;sub&gt;APB&lt;/sub&gt; amplitude when TMS is delivered before movement onset (PMF), supporting the role of excitatory corticospinal mechanisms at the basis of the selective PMF of the target muscle during the RT protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Accurate Prediction of Children's ADHD Severity Using Family Burden Information: A Neural Lasso Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.674028</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The deep lasso algorithm (dlasso) is introduced as a neural version of the statistical linear lasso algorithm that holds benefits from both methodologies: feature selection and automatic optimization of the parameters (including the regularization parameter). This last property makes dlasso particularly attractive for feature selection on small samples. In the two first conducted experiments, it was observed that dlasso is capable of obtaining better performance than its non-neuronal version (traditional lasso), in terms of predictive error and correct variable selection. Once that dlasso performance has been assessed, it is used to determine whether it is possible to predict the severity of symptoms in children with ADHD from four scales that measure family burden, family functioning, parental satisfaction, and parental mental health. Results show that dlasso is able to predict parents' assessment of the severity of their children's inattention from only seven items from the previous scales. These items are related to parents' satisfaction and degree of parental burden.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: HTsort: Enabling Fast and Accurate Spike Sorting on Multi-Electrode Arrays</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.657151</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spike sorting is used to classify the spikes (action potentials acquired by physiological electrodes), aiming to identify their respective firing units. Now it has been developed to classify the spikes recorded by multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), with the improvement of micro-electrode technology. However, how to improve classification accuracy and maintain low time complexity simultaneously becomes a difficulty. A fast and accurate spike sorting approach named HTsort is proposed for high-density multi-electrode arrays in this paper. Several improvements have been introduced to the traditional pipeline that is composed of threshold detection and clustering method. First, the divide-and-conquer method is employed to utilize electrode spatial information to achieve pre-clustering. Second, the clustering method HDBSCAN (hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) is used to classify spikes and detect overlapping events (multiple spikes firing simultaneously). Third, the template merging method is used to merge redundant exported templates according to the template similarity and the spatial distribution of electrodes. Finally, the template matching method is used to resolve overlapping events. Our approach is validated on simulation data constructed by ourselves and publicly available data and compared to other state-of-the-art spike sorters. We found that the proposed HTsort has a more favorable trade-off between accuracy and time consumption. Compared with MountainSort and SpykingCircus, the time consumption is reduced by at least 40% when the number of electrodes is 64 and below. Compared with HerdingSpikes, the classification accuracy can typically improve by more than 10%. Meanwhile, HTsort exhibits stronger robustness against background noise than other sorters. Our more sophisticated spike sorter would facilitate neurophysiologists to complete spike sorting more quickly and accurately.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Engagement of Neurotropic Viruses in Fast Axonal Transport: Mechanisms, Potential Role of Host Kinases and Implications for Neuronal Dysfunction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.684762</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Much remains unknown about mechanisms sustaining the various stages in the life cycle of neurotropic viruses. An understanding of those mechanisms operating before their replication and propagation could advance the development of effective anti-viral strategies. Here, we review our current knowledge of strategies used by neurotropic viruses to undergo bidirectional movement along axons. We discuss how the invasion strategies used by specific viruses might influence their mode of interaction with selected components of the host’s fast axonal transport (FAT) machinery, including specialized membrane-bounded organelles and microtubule-based motor proteins. As part of this discussion, we provide a critical evaluation of various reported interactions among viral and motor proteins and highlight limitations of some in vitro approaches that led to their identification. Based on a large body of evidence documenting activation of host kinases by neurotropic viruses, and on recent work revealing regulation of FAT through phosphorylation-based mechanisms, we posit a potential role of host kinases on the engagement of viruses in retrograde FAT. Finally, we briefly describe recent evidence linking aberrant activation of kinase pathways to deficits in FAT and neuronal degeneration in the context of human neurodegenerative diseases. Based on these findings, we speculate that neurotoxicity elicited by viral infection may involve deregulation of host kinases involved in the regulation of FAT and other cellular processes sustaining neuronal function and survival.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Altered Grooming Syntax and Amphetamine-Induced Dopamine Release in EAAT3 Overexpressing Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.661478</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The excitatory amino acid transporter EAAT3 plays an important role in the neuronal uptake of glutamate regulating the activation of glutamate receptors. Polymorphisms in the gene-encoding EAAT3 have been associated with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), although the mechanisms underlying this relationship are still unknown. We recently reported that mice with increased EAAT3 expression in forebrain neurons (EAAT3&lt;sup&gt;glo&lt;/sup&gt;/CMKII) display behavioral and synaptic features relevant to OCD, including increased grooming, higher anxiety-like behavior and altered cortico-striatal synaptic function. The dopamine neurotransmitter system is implicated in ritualistic behaviors. Indeed, dopaminergic neurons express EAAT3, and mice lacking EAAT3 exhibit decreased dopamine release and decreased expression of the dopamine D1 receptor. Moreover, EAAT3 plays a role on the effect of the psychostimulant amphetamine. As such, we sought to determine if the OCD-like behavior in EAAT3&lt;sup&gt;glo&lt;/sup&gt;/CMKII mice is accompanied by altered nigro-striatal dopaminergic transmission. The aim of this study was to analyze dopamine transmission both in basal conditions and after an acute challenge of amphetamine, using behavioral, neurochemical, molecular, and cellular approaches. We found that in basal conditions, EAAT3&lt;sup&gt;glo&lt;/sup&gt;/CMKII mice performed more grooming events and that they remained in phase 1 of the grooming chain syntax compared with control littermates. Administration of amphetamine increased the number of grooming events in control mice, while EAAT3&lt;sup&gt;glo&lt;/sup&gt;/CMKII mice remain unaffected. Interestingly, the grooming syntax of amphetamine-control mice resembled that of EAAT3&lt;sup&gt;glo&lt;/sup&gt;/CMKII mice in basal conditions. Using in vivo microdialysis, we found decreased basal dopamine levels in EAAT3&lt;sup&gt;glo&lt;/sup&gt;/CMKII compared with control mice. Unexpectedly, we found that after acute amphetamine, EAAT3&lt;sup&gt;glo&lt;/sup&gt;/CMKII mice had a higher release of dopamine compared with that of control mice, suggesting that EAAT3 overexpression leads to increased dopamine releasability. To determine postsynaptic effect of EAAT3 overexpression over dopamine transmission, we performed Western blot analysis of dopaminergic proteins and found that EAAT3&lt;sup&gt;glo&lt;/sup&gt;/CMKII mice have higher expression of D2 receptors, suggesting a higher inhibition of the indirect striatal pathway. Together, the data indicate that EAAT3 overexpression impacts on dopamine transmission, making dopamine neurons more sensitive to the effect of amphetamine and leading to a disbalance between the direct and indirect striatal pathways that favors the performance of repetitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Connecting Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration in Multiple Sclerosis: Are Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells a Nexus of Disease?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.654284</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pathology in neurodegenerative diseases is often accompanied by inflammation. It is well-known that many cells within the central nervous system (CNS) also contribute to ongoing neuroinflammation, which can promote neurodegeneration. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is both an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease in which there is a complex interplay between resident CNS cells to mediate myelin and axonal damage, and this communication network can vary depending on the subtype and chronicity of disease. Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cell of the CNS, and their precursors, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), are often thought of as the targets of autoimmune pathology during MS and in several animal models of MS; however, there is emerging evidence that OPCs actively contribute to inflammation that directly and indirectly contributes to neurodegeneration. Here we discuss several contributors to MS disease progression starting with lesion pathology and murine models amenable to studying particular aspects of disease. We then review how OPCs themselves can play an active role in promoting neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and how other resident CNS cells including microglia, astrocytes, and neurons can impact OPC function. Further, we outline the very complex and pleiotropic role(s) of several inflammatory cytokines and other secreted factors classically described as solely deleterious during MS and its animal models, but in fact, have many neuroprotective functions and promote a return to homeostasis, in part via modulation of OPC function. Finally, since MS affects patients from the onset of disease throughout their lifespan, we discuss the impact of aging on OPC function and CNS recovery. It is becoming clear that OPCs are not simply a bystander during MS progression and uncovering the active roles they play during different stages of disease will help uncover potential new avenues for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.646921</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is a neurological disease responsible for significant morbidity and disability worldwide. However, there remains a dearth of effective therapies. The failure of many therapies for stroke in clinical trials has promoted the development of human cell-based models, such as brain organoids. Brain organoids differ from pluripotent stem cells in that they recapitulate various key features of the human central nervous system (CNS) in three-dimensional (3D) space. Recent studies have demonstrated that brain organoids could serve as a new platform to study various neurological diseases. However, there are several limitations, such as the scarcity of glia and vasculature in organoids, which are important for studying stroke. Herein, we have summarized the application of brain organoid technology in stroke research, such as for modeling and transplantation purposes. We also discuss methods to overcome the limitations of brain organoid technology, as well as future prospects for its application in stroke research. Although there are many difficulties and challenges associated with brain organoid technology, it is clear that this approach will play a critical role in the future exploration of stroke treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Characterization of Individual Projections Reveal That Neuromasts of the Zebrafish Lateral Line are Innervated by Multiple Inhibitory Efferent Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.666109</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The zebrafish lateral line is a sensory system used to detect changes in water flow. It is comprized of clusters of superficial hair cells called neuromasts. Modulation occurs via excitatory and inhibitory efferent neurons located in the brain. Using mosaic transgenic labeling we provide an anatomical overview of the lateral line projections made by individual inhibitory efferent neurons in 5-day old zebrafish larvae. For each hemisphere we estimate there to be six inhibitory efferent neurons located in two different nuclei. Three distinct cell types were classified based on their projections; to the anterior lateral line around the head, to the posterior lateral line along the body, or to both. Our analyses corroborate previous studies employing back-fills, but our transgenic labeling allowed a more thorough characterization of their morphology. We found that individual inhibitory efferent cells connect to multiple neuromasts and that a single neuromast is connected by multiple inhibitory efferent cells. The efferent axons project to the sensory ganglia and follow the sensory axon tract along the lateral line. Time-lapse imaging revealed that inhibitory efferent axons do not migrate with the primordium as the primary sensory afferent does, but follow with an 8–14 h lag. These data bring new insights into the formation of a sensory circuit and support the hypothesis that different classes of inhibitory efferent cells have different functions. Our findings provide a foundation for future studies focussed toward unraveling how and when sensory perception is modulated by different efferent cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We examined the effects of age and exhaustive rSTS on muscle activation magnitude, onset, and duration during ascent and descent phases of the STS task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Healthy older (n = 12) and younger (n = 11) adults performed rSTS, at a controlled frequency dictated by a metronome (2 s for cycle), to failure or for 30 min. We assessed muscle activation magnitude, onset, and duration of plantar flexors, dorsiflexors, knee flexors, knee extensors, and hip stabilizers during the initial and late stages of rSTS. Before and after rSTS, we measured maximal voluntary isometric knee extension force, and rate of perceived exertion, which was also recorded during rSTS task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Older vs. younger adults generated 35% lower maximum voluntary isometric knee extension force. During the initial stage of rSTS, older vs. younger adults activated the dorsiflexor 60% higher, all 5 muscle groups 37% longer, and the hip stabilizers 80% earlier. Older vs. younger adults completed 467 fewer STS trials and, at failure, their rate of perceived exertion was ~17 of 20 on the Borg scale. At the end of the rSTS, maximum voluntary isometric knee extension force decreased 16% similarly in older and younger, as well as the similar age groups decline in activation of the dorsiflexor and knee extensor muscles (all p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: By performing 467 fewer STS trials, older adults minimized the potential effects of fatigability on muscle activation, voluntary force, and motor function. Such a sparing effect may explain the minimal changes in gait after rSTS reported in previous studies, suggesting a limited scope of this perturbation model to probe age-effects on muscle adaptation in functional tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Assessing Nigrostriatal Dopaminergic Pathways via 123I-FP-CIT SPECT in Dementia With Lewy Bodies in a Psychiatric Patient Cohort</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.672956</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;(123)-I-2-ß-carbomethoxy-3ß-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl) nortro- pane single photon emission computed tomography (123I-FP-CIT SPECT) was validated to distinguish Alzheimer’s dementia from dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) by European medical agencies. Little evidence exists that validates 123 I-FP-CIT SPECT as a supplementary method to diagnose probable DLB in a psychiatric cohort of patients with psychiatric symptomatology and suspected DLB. We aim to elucidate differences in the clinical phenotype of DLB between those patients with and those without a positive 123 I-FP-CIT SPECT indicating a nigrostriatal deficit.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, we included 67 patients from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at University Medical Center Göttingen (UMG) in our study who had undergone 123I-FP-CIT SPECT in the Department of Nuclear Medicine (UMG) by evaluating their patient files.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;55% with a positive-123I-FP-CIT SPECT and probable DLB after the 123I-FP-CIT SPECT exhibited psychiatric features. The number of probable DLB patients in those exhibiting psychiatric symptoms was higher post-123I-FP-CIT SPECT than pre-123I-FP-CIT SPECT assessed cross-sectionally over a 6-year period (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In addition, prodromal DLB and prodromal DLB patients with a psychiatric-phenotype yielded higher numbers post-123I-FP-CIT SPECT than pre-123I-FP-CIT SPECT (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, we discovered no phenotypical differences between those DLB patients with a positive and those with a negative 123I-FP-CIT SPECT. 123I-FP-CIT SPECT-positive DLB patients in our psychiatric cohort revealed a psychiatric onset more often (52%); DLB was less often characterized by an MCI onset (26%) (p &amp;lt; 0.005).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;Our findings support 123I-FP-CIT SPECT as an adjuvant tool for improving the diagnosis of probable DLB and prodromal DLB in a cohort of psychiatric patients with often concomitant psychiatric symptomatology. The psychiatric-onset is more frequent than an MCI-onset in DLB patients presenting nigrostriatal dysfunction, giving us an indication of the relevance of deep clinical phenotyping in memory clinics that includes the assessment of psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mechanisms of Ischemic Stroke in Patients with Cancer: A Prospective Study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26129?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The objective of this study was to examine the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke with cancer.


Methods
We conducted a prospective cross‐sectional study from 2016 to 2020 at 2 hospitals. We enrolled 3 groups of 50 adult participants each. The main group included patients with active solid tumor cancer and acute ischemic stroke. The control groups included patients with acute ischemic stroke only or active cancer only. The patients with stroke‐only and patients with cancer‐only were matched to the patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke by age, sex, and cancer type, if applicable. The outcomes were prespecified hematological biomarkers and transcranial Doppler microemboli detection. Hematological biomarkers included markers of coagulation (D‐dimer and thrombin‐antithrombin), platelet function (P‐selectin), and endothelial integrity (thrombomodulin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 [sICAM‐1], and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule‐1 [sVCAM‐1]). Hematological biomarkers were compared between groups using the Kruskal‐Wallis and Wilcoxon Rank‐Sum tests. In multivariable linear regression models, we adjusted for race, number of stroke risk factors, smoking, stroke severity, and antithrombotic use. Transcranial Doppler microemboli presence was compared between groups using chi‐square tests.


Results
Levels of all study biomarkers were different between groups. In univariate between‐group comparisons, patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke had higher levels of D‐dimer, sICAM‐1, sVCAM‐1, and thrombomodulin than both control groups; higher levels of thrombin‐antithrombin than patients with cancer‐only; and higher levels of P‐selectin than patients with stroke‐only. Findings were similar in multivariable analyses. Transcranial Doppler microemboli were detected in 32% of patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke, 16% of patients with stroke‐only, and 6% of patients with cancer‐only (p = 0.005).


Interpretation
Patients with cancer‐related stroke have higher markers of coagulation, platelet, and endothelial dysfunction, and more circulating microemboli, than matched controls. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:159–169</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mutations in HID1 Cause Syndromic Infantile Encephalopathy and Hypopituitarism</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26127?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Precursors of peptide hormones undergo posttranslational modifications within the trans‐Golgi network (TGN). Dysfunction of proteins involved at different steps of this process cause several complex syndromes affecting the central nervous system (CNS). We aimed to clarify the genetic cause in a group of patients characterized by hypopituitarism in combination with brain atrophy, thin corpus callosum, severe developmental delay, visual impairment, and epilepsy.


Methods
Whole exome sequencing was performed in seven individuals of six unrelated families with these features. Postmortem histopathological and HID1 expression analysis of brain tissue and pituitary gland were conducted in one patient. Functional consequences of the homozygous HID1 variant p.R433W were investigated by Seahorse XF Assay in fibroblasts of two patients.


Results
Bi‐allelic variants in the gene HID1 domain‐containing protein 1 (HID1) were identified in all patients. Postmortem examination confirmed cerebral atrophy with enlarged lateral ventricles. Markedly reduced expression of pituitary hormones was found in pituitary gland tissue. Colocalization of HID1 protein with the TGN was not altered in fibroblasts of patients compared to controls, while the extracellular acidification rate upon stimulation with potassium chloride was significantly reduced in patient fibroblasts compared to controls.


Interpretation
Our findings indicate that mutations in HID1 cause an early infantile encephalopathy with hypopituitarism as the leading presentation, and expand the list of syndromic CNS diseases caused by interference of TGN function. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:149–164</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: α4β2* Nicotinic Cholinergic Receptor Target Engagement in Parkinson Disease Gait–Balance Disorders</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26102?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Attentional deficits following degeneration of brain cholinergic systems contribute to gait–balance deficits in Parkinson disease (PD). As a step toward assessing whether α4β2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) stimulation improves gait–balance function, we assessed target engagement of the α4β2* nAChR partial agonist varenicline.


Methods
Nondemented PD participants with cholinergic deficits were identified with [18F]fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol positron emission tomography (PET). α4β2* nAChR occupancy after subacute oral varenicline treatment was measured with [18F]flubatine PET. With a dose selected from the nAChR occupancy experiment, varenicline effects on gait, balance, and cognition were assessed in a double‐masked placebo‐controlled crossover study. Primary endpoints were normal pace gait speed and a measure of postural stability.


Results
Varenicline doses (0.25mg per day, 0.25mg twice daily [b.i.d.], 0.5mg b.i.d., and 1.0mg b.i.d.) produced 60 to 70% receptor occupancy. We selected 0.5mg orally b.i.d for the crossover study. Thirty‐three participants completed the crossover study with excellent tolerability. Varenicline had no significant impact on the postural stability measure and caused slower normal pace gait speed. Varenicline narrowed the difference in normal pace gait speed between dual task and no dual task gait conditions, reduced dual task cost, and improved sustained attention test performance. We obtained identical conclusions in 28 participants with treatment compliance confirmed by plasma varenicline measurements.


Interpretation
Varenicline occupied α4β2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, was tolerated well, enhanced attention, and altered gait performance. These results are consistent with target engagement. α4β2* agonists may be worth further evaluation for mitigation of gait and balance disorders in PD. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:130–142</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Characterization of Extracranial Giant Cell Arteritis with Intracranial Involvement and its Rapidly Progressive Subtype</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26101?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The objective of this study was to characterize patients with extracranial giant cell arteritis with intracranial involvement.


Methods
In a multicenter retrospective study, we included 31 patients with systemic giant cell arteritis (GCA) with intracranial involvement. Clinical characteristics, pattern of arterial involvement, and cytokine profiles were assessed. Patients with GCA without intracranial involvement (n = 17), and with intracranial atherosclerosis (n = 25) served as controls.


Results
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated in 18 patients (69.2%) with and in 16 patients (100%) without intracranial involvement (p = 0.02). Headache was complained by 15 patients (50.0%) with and 13 patients (76.5%) without intracranial involvement (p = 0.03). Posterior circulation arteries were affected in 26 patients (83.9%), anterior circulation arteries in 17 patients (54.8%), and both territories in 12 patients (38.7%). Patients with GCA had vertebral artery stenosis proximal and, in contrast, patients with atherosclerosis distal to the origin of posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Among patients with GCA with intracranial involvement, 11 patients (37.9%) had a rapid progressive disease course characterized by short‐term recurrent ischemic events. The median modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at follow‐up in these patients was 4 (interquartile range [IQR] = 2.0–6.0) and 4 patients (36.4%) died. Vessel wall expression of IL‐6 and IL‐17 was significantly increased in patients with rapid progressive course.


Interpretation
Typical characteristics of GCA, headache, and an elevated ESR, are frequently absent in patients with intracranial involvement. However, differentiation of intracranial GCA from atherosclerosis can be facilitated by the typical pattern of vertebral artery stenosis. About one‐third of patients with intracranial GCA had a rapid progressive course with poor outcome. IL‐17 and IL‐6 may represent potential future treatment targets.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Encephalitis with Autoantibodies against the Glutamate Kainate Receptors GluK2</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26098?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The objective of this study was to report the identification of antibodies against the glutamate kainate receptor subunit 2 (GluK2‐abs) in patients with autoimmune encephalitis, and describe the clinical‐immunological features and antibody effects.


Methods
Two sera from 8 patients with similar rat brain immunostaining were used to precipitate the antigen from neuronal cultures. A cell‐based assay (CBA) with GluK2‐expressing HEK293 cells was used to assess 596 patients with different neurological disorders, and 23 healthy controls. GluK2‐ab effects were determined by confocal microscopy in cultured neurons and electrophysiology in GluK2‐expressing HEK293 cells.


Results
Patients’ antibodies precipitated GluK2. GluK2 antibody‐specificity was confirmed by CBA, immunoprecipitation, GluK2‐immunoabsorption, and GluK2 knockout brain immunohistochemistry. In 2 of 8 samples, antibodies reacted with additional GluK2 epitopes present in GluK1 or GluK3; in both, the reactivity was abrogated after GluK2 immuno‐absorption. Six of 8 patients developed acute encephalitis and clinical or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of predominant cerebellar involvement (4 presenting as cerebellitis, which in 2 patients caused obstructive hydrocephalus), and 2 patients had other syndromes (1 with cerebellar symptoms). One of the samples showed mild reactivity with non‐kainate receptors (alpha‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid receptors [AMPAR] and N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors [NMDAR]) leading to identify 6 additional cases with GluK2‐abs among patients with anti‐AMPAR (5/71) or anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (1/73). GluK2‐abs internalized GluK2 in HEK293 cells and neurons; these antibody‐effects were reversible in neurons. A significant reduction of GluK2‐mediated currents was observed in cells treated with patients’ GluK2 serum following the time frame of antibody‐mediated GluK2 internalization.


Interpretation
GluK2‐abs associate with an encephalitis with prominent clinicoradiological cerebellar involvement. The antibody effects are predominantly mediated by internalization of GluK2. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:107–123</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Preservation of Brain Activity in Unresponsive Patients Identifies MCS Star</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26095?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Brain‐injured patients who are unresponsive at the bedside (ie, vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome – VS/UWS) may present brain activity similar to patients in minimally conscious state (MCS). This peculiar condition has been termed “non‐behavioural MCS” or “MCS*”. In the present study we aimed to investigate the proportion and underlying brain characteristics of patients in MCS*.


Methods
Brain 18F‐fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG‐PET) was acquired on 135 brain‐injured patients diagnosed in prolonged VS/UWS (n = 48) or MCS (n = 87). From an existing database, relative metabolic preservation in the fronto‐parietal network (measured with standardized uptake value) was visually inspected by three experts. Patients with hypometabolism of the fronto‐parietal network were labelled “VS/UWS”, while its (partial) preservation either confirmed the behavioural diagnosis of “MCS” or, in absence of behavioural signs of consciousness, suggested a diagnosis of “MCS*”. Clinical outcome at 1‐year follow‐up, functional connectivity, grey matter atrophy, and regional brain metabolic patterns were investigated in the three groups (VS/UWS, MCS* and MCS).


Results
67% of behavioural VS/UWS presented a partial preservation of brain metabolism (ie, MCS*). Compared to VS/UWS patients, MCS* patients demonstrated a better outcome, global functional connectivity and grey matter preservation more compatible with the diagnosis of MCS. MCS* patients presented lower brain metabolism mostly in the posterior brain regions compared to MCS patients.


Interpretation
MCS* is a frequent phenomenon that is associated with better outcome and better brain preservation than the diagnosis of VS/UWS. Complementary exams should be provided to all unresponsive patients before taking medical decisions. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:89–100</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genomewide Association Studies of LRRK2 Modifiers of Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26094?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The aim of this study was to search for genes/variants that modify the effect of LRRK2 mutations in terms of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of Parkinson's disease.


Methods
We performed the first genomewide association study of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of Parkinson's disease in LRRK2 mutation carriers (776 cases and 1,103 non‐cases at their last evaluation). Cox proportional hazard models and linear mixed models were used to identify modifiers of penetrance and age‐at‐onset of LRRK2 mutations, respectively. We also investigated whether a polygenic risk score derived from a published genomewide association study of Parkinson's disease was able to explain variability in penetrance and age‐at‐onset in LRRK2 mutation carriers.


Results
A variant located in the intronic region of CORO1C on chromosome 12 (rs77395454; p value = 2.5E‐08, beta = 1.27, SE = 0.23, risk allele: C) met genomewide significance for the penetrance model. Co‐immunoprecipitation analyses of LRRK2 and CORO1C supported an interaction between these 2 proteins. A region on chromosome 3, within a previously reported linkage peak for Parkinson's disease susceptibility, showed suggestive associations in both models (penetrance top variant: p value = 1.1E‐07; age‐at‐onset top variant: p value = 9.3E‐07). A polygenic risk score derived from publicly available Parkinson's disease summary statistics was a significant predictor of penetrance, but not of age‐at‐onset.


Interpretation
This study suggests that variants within or near CORO1C may modify the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations. In addition, common Parkinson's disease associated variants collectively increase the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:82–94</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Investigation of Autosomal Genetic Sex Differences in Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26090?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder. Men are on average ~ 1.5 times more likely to develop PD compared to women with European ancestry. Over the years, genomewide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic risk factors for PD, however, it is unclear whether genetics contribute to disease etiology in a sex‐specific manner.


Methods
In an effort to study sex‐specific genetic factors associated with PD, we explored 2 large genetic datasets from the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium and the UK Biobank consisting of 13,020 male PD cases, 7,936 paternal proxy cases, 89,660 male controls, 7,947 female PD cases, 5,473 maternal proxy cases, and 90,662 female controls. We performed GWAS meta‐analyses to identify distinct patterns of genetic risk contributing to disease in male versus female PD cases.


Results
In total, 19 genomewide significant regions were identified and no sex‐specific effects were observed. A high genetic correlation between the male and female PD GWAS were identified (rg = 0.877) and heritability estimates were identical between male and female PD cases (~ 20%).


Interpretation
We did not detect any significant genetic differences between male or female PD cases. Our study does not support the notion that common genetic variation on the autosomes could explain the difference in prevalence of PD between males and females cases at least when considering the current sample size under study. Further studies are warranted to investigate the genetic architecture of PD explained by X and Y chromosomes and further evaluate environmental effects that could potentially contribute to PD etiology in male versus female patients.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26085?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
This multilanguage study used simple speech recording and high‐end pattern analysis to provide sensitive and reliable noninvasive biomarkers of prodromal versus manifest α‐synucleinopathy in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and early‐stage Parkinson disease (PD).


Methods
We performed a multicenter study across the Czech, English, German, French, and Italian languages at 7 centers in Europe and North America. A total of 448 participants (337 males), including 150 with iRBD (mean duration of iRBD across language groups 0.5–3.4 years), 149 with PD (mean duration of disease across language groups 1.7–2.5 years), and 149 healthy controls were recorded; 350 of the participants completed the 12‐month follow‐up. We developed a fully automated acoustic quantitative assessment approach for the 7 distinctive patterns of hypokinetic dysarthria.


Results
No differences in language that impacted clinical parkinsonian phenotypes were found. Compared with the controls, we found significant abnormalities of an overall acoustic speech severity measure via composite dysarthria index for both iRBD (p = 0.002) and PD (p &amp;lt; 0.001). However, only PD (p &amp;lt; 0.001) was perceptually distinct in a blinded subjective analysis. We found significant group differences between PD and controls for monopitch (p &amp;lt; 0.001), prolonged pauses (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and imprecise consonants (p = 0.03); only monopitch was able to differentiate iRBD patients from controls (p = 0.004). At the 12‐month follow‐up, a slight progression of overall acoustic speech impairment was noted for the iRBD (p = 0.04) and PD (p = 0.03) groups.


Interpretation
Automated speech analysis might provide a useful additional biomarker of parkinsonism for the assessment of disease progression and therapeutic interventions. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:62–75</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Cerebrovascular Neuroprotection after Acute Concussion in Adolescents</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26082?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
To assess acute cerebrovascular function in concussed adolescents (14–21 years of age), whether it is related to resting cerebral hemodynamics, and whether it recovers chronically.


Methods
Cerebral vasoreactivity and autoregulation, based on middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity, was assessed in 28 concussed participants (≤14 days of injury) and 29 matched controls. The participants in the concussion group returned for an 8‐week follow‐up assessment. Over the course of those 8‐weeks, participants recorded aerobic exercise frequency and duration.


Results
Between groups, demographic, clinical, and hemodynamic variables were not significantly different. Vasoreactivity was significantly higher in the concussed group (p = 0.02). Within the concussed group, 60% of the variability in resting cerebral blood flow velocity was explained by vasoreactivity and two components of autoregulation – falling slope and effectiveness of autoregulation (adjusted R2 = 0.60, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Moreover, lower mean arterial pressure, lower responses to increases in arterial pressure, and lower vasoreactivity were significantly associated with larger symptom burden (adjusted R2 = 0.72, p &amp;lt; 0.01). By the 8‐week timepoint, symptom burden, but not vasoreactivity, improved in all but four concussed participants (p &amp;lt; 0.01). 8‐week change in vasoreactivity was positively associated with aerobic exercise volume (adjusted R2 = 0.19, p = 0.02).


Interpretation
Concussion resulted in changes in cerebrovascular regulatory mechanisms, which in turn explained the variability in resting cerebral blood flow velocity and acute symptom burden. Furthermore, these alterations persisted chronically despite symptom resolution, but was positively modified by aerobic exercise volume. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for further investigation into underlying cerebrovascular related symptomatology. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:43–51</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Foslevodopa/Foscarbidopa: A New Subcutaneous Treatment for Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26073?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The aim was to demonstrate that continuous s.c. infusion of a soluble levodopa (LD)/carbidopa (CD) phosphate prodrug combination effectively delivers stable LD exposure via a minimally invasive and convenient mode and has the potential to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who are not well controlled on oral medication.


Methods
Foslevodopa and foscarbidopa were prepared and the equilibrium solubility and chemical stability examined in aqueous media with different values of pH. Solutions of foslevodopa/foscarbidopa (ratios ranging from 4:1 to 20:1) were prepared by dissolving pH‐adjusted lyophilized materials in water and infused s.c. in healthy volunteers for ≤72 hours. Frequent blood samples were collected to measure LD and CD exposure, and safety was monitored throughout the study.


Results
Foslevodopa/foscarbidopa (ABBV‐951) demonstrates high water solubility and excellent chemical stability near physiological pH, enabling continuous s.c. infusion therapy. After s.c. infusion, a stable LD pharmacokinetic (PK) profile was maintained for ≤72 hours, and the infusion was well tolerated.


Interpretation
Preparation of foslevodopa and foscarbidopa enables preclinical and clinical PK, safety, and tolerability studies in support of their advancement for the treatment of PD. In phase 1 clinical trials, foslevodopa/foscarbidopa demonstrates consistent and stable LD plasma exposure, supporting further studies of this treatment as a potentially transformational option for those suffering from PD.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Common X‐Chromosome Variants Are Associated with Parkinson Disease Risk</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26051?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The objective of this study was to identify genetic variants on the X‐chromosome associated with Parkinson disease (PD) risk.


Methods
We performed an X‐chromosome–wide association study (XWAS) of PD risk by meta‐analyzing results from sex‐stratified analyses. To avoid spurious associations, we designed a specific harmonization pipeline for the X‐chromosome and focused on a European ancestry sample. We included 11,142 cases, 280,164 controls, and 5,379 proxy cases, based on parental history of PD. Additionally, we tested the association of significant variants with (1) PD risk in an independent replication with 1,561 cases and 2,465 controls and (2) putamen volume in 33,360 individuals from the UK Biobank.


Results
In the discovery meta‐analysis, we identified rs7066890 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06–1.14, p = 2.2 × 10−9), intron of GPM6B, and rs28602900 (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.07–1.14, p = 1.6 × 10−8) in a high gene density region including RPL10, ATP6A1, FAM50A, and PLXNA3. The rs28602900 association with PD was replicated (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.03–1.30, p = 0.016) and shown to colocalize with a significant expression quantitative locus (eQTL) regulating RPL10 expression in the putamen and other brain tissues in the Genotype‐Tissue Expression Project. Additionally, the rs28602900 locus was found to be associated with reduced brain putamen volume. No results reached genome‐wide significance in the sex‐stratified analyses.


Interpretation
We report the first XWAS of PD and identify 2 genome‐wide significant loci. The rs28602900 association was replicated in an independent PD dataset and showed concordant effects in its association with putamen volume. Critically, rs26802900 is a significant eQTL of RPL10. These results support a role for ribosomal proteins in PD pathogenesis and show that the X‐chromosome contributes to PD genetic risk. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:22–34</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Endosome Dysregulation in Down Syndrome: A Potential Contributor to Alzheimer Disease Pathology</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26042?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Intracellular protein trafficking via the endosomes plays a key role in the maintenance of normal neuronal function. Although many diseases of the central nervous system exhibit specific pathological hallmarks, abnormalities of the endosome system are common traits for several of them, including Alzheimer disease (AD). Three main routes originate from the endosomes: the recycling, degradation, and retrograde pathways. Studies have shown that the majority of Down syndrome subjects develop AD pathology and manifest altered morphology and number of endosomes, and abnormalities in lysosome acidification and exosome secretion, suggesting that dysfunction of one of these pathways could play a functional role in the AD‐like phenotype of the syndrome. Two of the major endosomal routes are mediated by the retromer complex, a multimeric system responsible for transport of cargo from the endosome to the trans‐Golgi network or to the cell membrane. Recently, a new endosome system structurally related to the retromer, called “retriever,” has been reported. Whereas we know a great deal about the neuropathophysiology of the retromer complex, no precise pathogenic role for the retriever has yet been identified. Here, we will review the neurobiology of the endosome system and its role as key player in the development of AD‐like pathology in Down syndrome. Additionally, we will discuss current knowledge on these two main endosome systems, retromer and retriever, and their potential as novel therapeutic targets. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:4–14</content:encoded>

The advent of high-throughput metagenomic sequencing has prompted the development of efficient taxonomic profiling methods allowing to measure the presence, abundance and phylogeny of organisms in a wide range of environmental samples. Multivariate sequence-derived abundance data further has the potential to enable inference of ecological associations between microbial populations, but several technical issues need to be accounted for, like the compositional nature of the data, its extreme sparsity and overdispersion, as well as the frequent need to operate in under-determined regimes.
The ecological network reconstruction problem is frequently cast into the paradigm of Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) for which efficient structure inference algorithms are available, like the graphical lasso and neighborhood selection. Unfortunately, GGMs or variants thereof can not properly account for the extremely sparse patterns occurring in real-world metagenomic taxonomic profiles. In particular, structural zeros (as opposed to sampling zeros) corresponding to true absences of biological signals fail to be properly handled by most statistical methods.
We present here a zero-inflated log-normal graphical model (available at https://github.com/vincentprost/Zi-LN) specifically aimed at handling such “biological” zeros, and demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art statistical methods for the inference of microbial association networks, with most notable gains obtained when analyzing taxonomic profiles displaying sparsity levels on par with real-world metagenomic datasets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AYAqogm1C3o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Analyzing cancer gene expression data through the lens of normal tissue-specificity</title>

The genetic alterations that underlie cancer development are highly tissue-specific with the majority of driving alterations occurring in only a few cancer types and with alterations common to multiple cancer types often showing a tissue-specific functional impact. This tissue-specificity means that the biology of normal tissues carries important information regarding the pathophysiology of the associated cancers, information that can be leveraged to improve the power and accuracy of cancer genomic analyses. Research exploring the use of normal tissue data for the analysis of cancer genomics has primarily focused on the paired analysis of tumor and adjacent normal samples. Efforts to leverage the general characteristics of normal tissue for cancer analysis has received less attention with most investigations focusing on understanding the tissue-specific factors that lead to individual genomic alterations or dysregulated pathways within a single cancer type. To address this gap and support scenarios where adjacent normal tissue samples are not available, we explored the genome-wide association between the transcriptomes of 21 solid human cancers and their associated normal tissues as profiled in healthy individuals. While the average gene expression profiles of normal and cancerous tissue may appear distinct, with normal tissues more similar to other normal tissues than to the associated cancer types, when transformed into relative expression values, i.e., the ratio of expression in one tissue or cancer relative to the mean in other tissues or cancers, the close association between gene activity in normal tissues and related cancers is revealed. As we demonstrate through an analysis of tumor data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and normal tissue data from the Human Protein Atlas, this association between tissue-specific and cancer-specific expression values can be leveraged to improve the prognostic modeling of cancer, the comparative analysis of different cancer types, and the analysis of cancer and normal tissue pairs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vvB0Lh3g_K0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The search for potential antibody-based diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics for pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has focused almost exclusively on the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Coronavirus membrane (M), ORF3a, and ORF8 proteins are humoral immunogens in other coronaviruses (CoVs) but remain largely uninvestigated for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we use ultradense peptide microarray mapping to show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces robust antibody responses to epitopes throughout the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, particularly in M, in which 1 epitope achieved excellent diagnostic accuracy. We map 79 B cell epitopes throughout the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and demonstrate that antibodies that develop in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection bind homologous peptide sequences in the 6 other known human CoVs. We also confirm reactivity against 4 of our top-ranking epitopes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Illness severity correlated with increased reactivity to 9 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in S, M, N, and ORF3a in our population. Our results demonstrate previously unknown, highly reactive B cell epitopes throughout the full proteome of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV proteins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/IhHbcSX1zJQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Oscillatory Activity in Mouse Lemur Primary Motor Cortex During Natural Locomotor Behavior</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.655980</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In arboreal environments, substrate orientation determines the biomechanical strategy for postural maintenance and locomotion. In this study, we investigated possible neuronal correlates of these mechanisms in an ancestral primate model, the gray mouse lemur. We conducted telemetric recordings of electrocorticographic activity in left primary motor cortex of two mouse lemurs moving on a branch-like small-diameter pole, fixed horizontally, or vertically. Analysis of cortical oscillations in high β (25–35 Hz) and low γ (35–50 Hz) bands showed stronger resting power on horizontal than vertical substrate, potentially illustrating sensorimotor processes for postural maintenance. Locomotion on horizontal substrate was associated with stronger event-related desynchronization than vertical substrate, which could relate to locomotor adjustments and/or derive from differences in baseline activity. Spectrograms of cortical activity showed modulation throughout individual locomotor cycles, with higher values in the first than second half cycle. However, substrate orientation did not significantly influence these variations. Overall, these results confirm that specific cortical mechanisms are solicited during arboreal locomotion, whereby mouse lemurs adjust cortical activity to substrate orientation during static posture and locomotion, and modulate this activity throughout locomotor cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Riboflavin Inhibits Histamine-Dependent Itch by Modulating Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.643483</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, isfound in foods and is used as a dietary supplement. Its deficiency (also called ariboflavinosis) results in some skin lesions and inflammations, such as stomatitis, cheilosis, oily scaly skin rashes, and itchy, watery eyes. Various therapeutic effects of riboflavin, such as anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-nociceptive effects, are well known. Although some studies have identified the clinical effect of riboflavin on skin problems, including itch and inflammation, its underlying mechanism of action remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the effects of riboflavin on histamine-dependent itch based on behavioral tests and electrophysiological experiments. Riboflavin significantly reduced histamine-induced scratching behaviors in mice and histamine-induced discharges in single-nerve fiber recordings, while it did not alter motor function in the rotarod test. In cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, riboflavin showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the histamine- and capsaicin-induced inward current. Further tests wereconducted to determine whether two endogenous metabolites of riboflavin, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), have similar effects to those of riboflavin. Here, FMN, but not FAD, significantly inhibited capsaicin-induced currents and itching responses caused by histamine. In addition, in transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-transfected HEK293 cells, both riboflavin and FMN blocked capsaicin-induced currents, whereas FAD did not. These results revealed that riboflavin inhibits histamine-dependent itch by modulating TRPV1 activity. This study will be helpful in understanding how riboflavin exerts antipruritic effects and suggests that it might be a useful drug for the treatment of histamine-dependent itch.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: The Paraventricular Thalamus as a Critical Node of Motivated Behavior via the Hypothalamic-Thalamic-Striatal Circuit</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.706713</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this review, we highlight evidence that supports a role for the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) in motivated behavior. We include a neuroanatomical and neurochemical overview, outlining what is known of the cellular makeup of the region and its most prominent afferent and efferent connections. We discuss how these connections and distinctions across the anterior-posterior axis correspond to the perceived function of the PVT. We then focus on the hypothalamic-thalamic-striatal circuit and the neuroanatomical and functional placement of the PVT within this circuit. In this regard, the PVT is ideally positioned to integrate information regarding internal states and the external environment and translate it into motivated actions. Based on data that has emerged in recent years, including that from our laboratory, we posit that orexinergic (OX) innervation from the lateral hypothalamus (LH) to the PVT encodes the incentive motivational value of reward cues and thereby alters the signaling of the glutamatergic neurons projecting from the PVT to the shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAcSh). The PVT-NAcSh pathway then modulates dopamine activity and resultant cue-motivated behaviors. As we and others apply novel tools and approaches to studying the PVT we will continue to refine the anatomical, cellular, and functional definitions currently ascribed to this nucleus and further elucidate its role in motivated behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Serum and Fecal Markers of Intestinal Inflammation and Intestinal Barrier Permeability Are Elevated in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.689723</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by alpha-synuclein misfolding with subsequent intraneuronal amyloid formation and accumulation, low grade neuroinflammatory changes, and selective neurodegeneration. Available evidence suggests that the pathology usually begins in the gut and olfactory mucosa, spreading to the brain via the vagus and olfactory nerves, by a prion-like mechanism. A causal relationship has not been established, but gut dysbiosis is prevalent in PD and may lead to intestinal inflammation and barrier dysfunction. Additionally, epidemiological data indicate a link between inflammatory bowel diseases and PD. Calprotectin and zonulin are markers of intestinal inflammation and barrier permeability, respectively. We evaluated their serum and fecal levels in 22 patients with sporadic PD and 16 unmatched healthy controls. Mean calprotectin was higher in PD, both in serum (14.26 mcg/ml ± 4.50 vs. 5.94 mcg/ml ± 3.80, p = 0.0125) and stool (164.54 mcg/g ± 54.19 vs. 56.19 mcg/g ± 35.88, p = 0.0048). Mean zonulin was also higher in PD serum (26.69 ng/ml ± 3.55 vs. 19.43 ng/ml ± 2.56, p = 0.0046) and stool (100.19 ng/ml ± 28.25 vs. 37.3 ng/ml ± 13.26, p = 0.0012). Calprotectin was above the upper reference limit in 19 PD serums and 6 controls (OR = 10.56, 95% CI = 2.17–51.42, p = 0.0025) and in 20 PD stool samples and 4 controls (OR = 30, 95% CI = 4.75–189.30, p = 0.000045). Increased zonulin was found only in the stool samples of 8 PD patients. Despite the small sample size, our findings are robust, complementing and supporting other recently published results. The relation between serum and fecal calprotectin and zonulin levels and sporadic PD warrants further investigation in larger cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Rabbit PrP Is Partially Resistant to in vitro Aggregation Induced by Different Biological Cofactors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.689315</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prion diseases have been described in humans and other mammals, including sheep, goats, cattle, and deer. Since mice, hamsters, and cats are susceptible to prion infection, they are often used to study the mechanisms of prion infection and conversion. Mammals, such as horses and dogs, however, do not naturally contract the disease and are resistant to infection, while others, like rabbits, have exhibited low susceptibility. Infection involves the conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) to the scrapie form (PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;), and several cofactors have already been identified as important adjuvants in this process, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), lipids, and nucleic acids. The molecular mechanisms that determine transmissibility between species remain unclear, as well as the barriers to transmission. In this study, we examine the interaction of recombinant rabbit PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; (RaPrP) with different biological cofactors such as GAGs (heparin and dermatan sulfate), phosphatidic acid, and DNA oligonucleotides (A1 and D67) to evaluate the importance of these cofactors in modulating the aggregation of rabbit PrP and explain the animal’s different degrees of resistance to infection. We used spectroscopic and chromatographic approaches to evaluate the interaction with cofactors and their effect on RaPrP aggregation, which we compared with murine PrP (MuPrP). Our data show that all cofactors induce RaPrP aggregation and exhibit pH dependence. However, RaPrP aggregated to a lesser extent than MuPrP in the presence of any of the cofactors tested. The binding affinity with cofactors does not correlate with these low levels of aggregation, suggesting that the latter are related to the stability of PrP at acidic pH. The absence of the N-terminus affected the interaction with cofactors, influencing the efficiency of aggregation. These findings demonstrate that the interaction with polyanionic cofactors is related to rabbit PrP being less susceptible to aggregation in vitro and that the N-terminal domain is important to the efficiency of conversion, increasing the interaction with cofactors. The decreased effect of cofactors in rabbit PrP likely explains its lower propensity to prion conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: The Potential Role of Inflammation in Modulating Endogenous Hippocampal Neurogenesis After Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682259</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Currently there are approximately 291,000 people suffering from a spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States. SCI is associated with traumatic changes in mobility and neuralgia, as well as many other long-term chronic health complications, including metabolic disorders, diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, osteoporosis, and elevated inflammatory markers. Due to medical advances, patients with SCI survive much longer than previously. This increase in life expectancy exposes them to novel neurological complications such as memory loss, cognitive decline, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease. In fact, these usually age-associated disorders are more prevalent in people living with SCI. A common factor of these disorders is the reduction in hippocampal neurogenesis. Inflammation, which is elevated after SCI, plays a major role in modulating hippocampal neurogenesis. While there is no clear consensus on the mechanism of the decline in hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition after SCI, we will examine in this review how SCI-induced inflammation could modulate hippocampal neurogenesis and provoke age-associated neurological disorders. Thereafter, we will discuss possible therapeutic options which may mitigate the influence of SCI associated complications on hippocampal neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Whole-Brain Functional Network Connectivity Abnormalities in Affective and Non-Affective Early Phase Psychosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682110</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Psychosis disorders share overlapping symptoms and are characterized by a wide-spread breakdown in functional brain integration. Although neuroimaging studies have identified numerous connectivity abnormalities in affective and non-affective psychoses, whether they have specific or unique connectivity abnormalities, especially within the early stage is still poorly understood. The early phase of psychosis is a critical period with fewer chronic confounds and when treatment intervention may be most effective. In this work, we examined whole-brain functional network connectivity (FNC) from both static and dynamic perspectives in patients with affective psychosis (PAP) or with non-affective psychosis (PnAP) and healthy controls (HCs). A fully automated independent component analysis (ICA) pipeline called “Neuromark” was applied to high-quality functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data with 113 early-phase psychosis patients (32 PAP and 81 PnAP) and 52 HCs. Relative to the HCs, both psychosis groups showed common abnormalities in static FNC (sFNC) between the thalamus and sensorimotor domain, and between subcortical regions and the cerebellum. PAP had specifically decreased sFNC between the superior temporal gyrus and the paracentral lobule, and between the cerebellum and the middle temporal gyrus/inferior parietal lobule. On the other hand, PnAP showed increased sFNC between the fusiform gyrus and the superior medial frontal gyrus. Dynamic FNC (dFNC) was investigated using a combination of a sliding window approach, clustering analysis, and graph analysis. Three reoccurring brain states were identified, among which both psychosis groups had fewer occurrences in one antagonism state (state 2) and showed decreased network efficiency within an intermediate state (state 1). Compared with HCs and PnAP, PAP also showed a significantly increased number of state transitions, indicating more unstable brain connections in affective psychosis. We further found that the identified connectivity features were associated with the overall positive and negative syndrome scale, an assessment instrument for general psychopathology and positive symptoms. Our findings support the view that subcortical-cortical information processing is disrupted within five years of the initial onset of psychosis and provide new evidence that abnormalities in both static and dynamic connectivity consist of shared and unique features for the early affective and non-affective psychoses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682036</link>
	<content:encoded>Aims&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a known risk factor for the development of acute symptomatic as well as late unprovoked seizures. The underlying pathophysiology of post-ICH seizures is incompletely understood and there are no reliable predictive biomarkers. An animal model to study post-ICH seizures is currently lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate (1) the occurrence of seizures and interictal epileptiform activity in the ICH rat collagenase model using long-term video-EEG monitoring (VEM) and (2) whether seizure occurrence was associated with interictal epileptiform activity and histological features.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with epidural electrodes. After 1 week of baseline VEM, collagenase was injected in left striatum to induce an ICH. VEM was continued for 180 days to assess the occurrence of post-ICH seizures and interictal epileptiform activity (spikes and epileptiform discharges). At the end of the experiment, animals were euthanized for histological characterization of the hemorrhagic lesion, using cresyl violet, Prussian blue and immunofluorescence staining.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Acute symptomatic seizures occurred in 4/12 animals between 46 and 80 h after ICH induction. Late unprovoked seizures were present in 2/12 animals and started at 90 and 103 days post-ICH. Animals with late unprovoked seizures did not have acute symptomatic seizures. All electrographic seizures were accompanied by clear behavioral changes. Interictal spikes and epileptiform discharges were observed in all animals but occurred more frequently in rats with late seizures (p = 0.019 and p &amp;lt; 0.001, respectively). Animals with acute symptomatic seizures had more extended hemorrhagic lesions and hemosiderin deposits in the piriform cortex.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Both acute symptomatic and late unprovoked seizures were observed in the rat collagenase model. Interictal epileptiform activity was more frequently seen in animals with late seizures. Rats with acute symptomatic seizures showed more extensive lesions and hemosiderin deposits in the piriform cortex. This model could be used to further explore possible biomarkers for epileptogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Squalamine and Its Derivatives Modulate the Aggregation of Amyloid-β and α-Synuclein and Suppress the Toxicity of Their Oligomers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.680026</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The aberrant aggregation of proteins is a key molecular event in the development and progression of a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders. We have shown previously that squalamine and trodusquemine, two natural products in the aminosterol class, can modulate the aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and of α-synuclein (αS), which are associated with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. In this work, we expand our previous analyses to two squalamine derivatives, des-squalamine and α-squalamine, obtaining further insights into the mechanism by which aminosterols modulate Aβ and αS aggregation. We then characterize the ability of these small molecules to alter the physicochemical properties of stabilized oligomeric species in vitro and to suppress the toxicity of these aggregates to varying degrees toward human neuroblastoma cells. We found that, despite the fact that these aminosterols exert opposing effects on Aβ and αS aggregation under the conditions that we tested, the modifications that they induced to the toxicity of oligomers were similar. Our results indicate that the suppression of toxicity is mediated by the displacement of toxic oligomeric species from cellular membranes by the aminosterols. This study, thus, provides evidence that aminosterols could be rationally optimized in drug discovery programs to target oligomer toxicity in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.676220</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human pupil behavior has gained increased attention due to the discovery of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells and the afferent pupil control path’s role as a biomarker for cognitive processes. Diameter changes in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;–2&lt;/sup&gt; mm are of interest, requiring reliable and characterized measurement equipment to accurately detect neurocognitive effects on the pupil. Mostly commercial solutions are used as measurement devices in pupillometry which is associated with high investments. Moreover, commercial systems rely on closed software, restricting conclusions about the used pupil-tracking algorithms. Here, we developed an open-source pupillometry platform consisting of hardware and software competitive with high-end commercial stereo eye-tracking systems. Our goal was to make a professional remote pupil measurement pipeline for laboratory conditions accessible for everyone. This work’s core outcome is an integrated cross-platform (macOS, Windows and Linux) pupillometry software called PupilEXT, featuring a user-friendly graphical interface covering the relevant requirements of professional pupil response research. We offer a selection of six state-of-the-art open-source pupil detection algorithms (Starburst, Swirski, ExCuSe, ElSe, PuRe and PuReST) to perform the pupil measurement. A developed 120-fps pupillometry demo system was able to achieve a calibration accuracy of 0.003 mm and an averaged temporal pupil measurement detection accuracy of 0.0059 mm in stereo mode. The PupilEXT software has extended features in pupil detection, measurement validation, image acquisition, data acquisition, offline pupil measurement, camera calibration, stereo vision, data visualization and system independence, all combined in a single open-source interface, available at https://github.com/openPupil/Open-PupilEXT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis, many studies have been conducted on inter-subject variability as well as intra-subject reproducibility. These studies indicate that fMRI could have unique characteristics for individuals. In this study, we hypothesized that the dynamic information during 1 min of fMRI was unique and repetitive enough for each subject, so we applied long short-term memory (LSTM) using initial time points of dynamic resting-state fMRI for individual identification. Siamese network is used to obtain robust individual identification performance without additional learning on a new dataset. In particular, by adding a new structure called region of interest–wise average pooling (RAP), individual identification performance could be improved, and key intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) for individual identification were also identified. The average performance of individual identification was 97.88% using the test dataset in eightfold cross-validation analysis. Through the visualization of features learned by Siamese LSTM with RAP, ICNs spanning the parietal region were observed as the key ICNs in identifying individuals. These results suggest the key ICNs in fMRI could represent individual uniqueness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Pericytes for Therapeutic Approaches to Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.629297</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pericytes are perivascular multipotent cells located on capillaries. Although pericytes are discovered in the nineteenth century, recent studies have found that pericytes play an important role in maintaining the blood—brain barrier (BBB) and regulating the neurovascular system. In the neurovascular unit, pericytes perform their functions by coordinating the crosstalk between endothelial, glial, and neuronal cells. Dysfunction of pericytes can lead to a variety of diseases, including stroke and other neurological disorders. Recent studies have suggested that pericytes can serve as a therapeutic target in ischemic stroke. In this review, we first summarize the biology and functions of pericytes in the central nervous system. Then, we focus on the role of dysfunctional pericytes in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Finally, we discuss new therapies for ischemic stroke based on targeting pericytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: 3D Segmentation of Perivascular Spaces on T1-Weighted 3 Tesla MR Images With a Convolutional Autoencoder and a U-Shaped Neural Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.641600</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We implemented a deep learning (DL) algorithm for the 3-dimensional segmentation of perivascular spaces (PVSs) in deep white matter (DWM) and basal ganglia (BG). This algorithm is based on an autoencoder and a U-shaped network (U-net), and was trained and tested using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from a large database of 1,832 healthy young adults. An important feature of this approach is the ability to learn from relatively sparse data, which gives the present algorithm a major advantage over other DL algorithms. Here, we trained the algorithm with 40 T1-weighted MRI datasets in which all “visible” PVSs were manually annotated by an experienced operator. After learning, performance was assessed using another set of 10 MRI scans from the same database in which PVSs were also traced by the same operator and were checked by consensus with another experienced operator. The Sorensen-Dice coefficients for PVS voxel detection in DWM (resp. BG) were 0.51 (resp. 0.66), and 0.64 (resp. 0.71) for PVS cluster detection (volume threshold of 0.5 within a range of 0 to 1). Dice values above 0.90 could be reached for detecting PVSs larger than 10 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and 0.95 for PVSs larger than 15 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. We then applied the trained algorithm to the rest of the database (1,782 individuals). The individual PVS load provided by the algorithm showed a high agreement with a semi-quantitative visual rating done by an independent expert rater, both for DWM and for BG. Finally, we applied the trained algorithm to an age-matched sample from another MRI database acquired using a different scanner. We obtained a very similar distribution of PVS load, demonstrating the interoperability of this algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Computational Evidence for a Competitive Thalamocortical Model of Spikes and Spindle Activity in Rolandic Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.680549</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is the most common idiopathic focal childhood epilepsy syndrome, characterized by sleep-activated epileptiform spikes and seizures and cognitive deficits in school age children. Recent evidence suggests that this disease may be caused by disruptions to the Rolandic thalamocortical circuit, resulting in both an abundance of epileptiform spikes and a paucity of sleep spindles in the Rolandic cortex during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM); electrographic features linked to seizures and cognitive symptoms, respectively. The neuronal mechanisms that support the competitive shared thalamocortical circuitry between pathological epileptiform spikes and physiological sleep spindles are not well-understood. In this study we introduce a computational thalamocortical model for the sleep-activated epileptiform spikes observed in RE. The cellular and neuronal circuits of this model incorporate recent experimental observations in RE, and replicate the electrophysiological features of RE. Using this model, we demonstrate that: (1) epileptiform spikes can be triggered and promoted by either a reduced NMDA current or h-type current; and (2) changes in inhibitory transmission in the thalamic reticular nucleus mediates an antagonistic dynamic between epileptiform spikes and spindles. This work provides the first computational model that both recapitulates electrophysiological features and provides a mechanistic explanation for the thalamocortical switch between the pathological and physiological electrophysiological rhythms observed during NREM sleep in this common epileptic encephalopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Human Schwann Cell Transplantation for Spinal Cord Injury: Prospects and Challenges in Translational Medicine</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.690894</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The benefits of transplanting cultured Schwann cells (SCs) for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) have been systematically investigated in experimental animals since the early 1990s. Importantly, human SC (hSC) transplantation for SCI has advanced to clinical testing and safety has been established via clinical trials conducted in the USA and abroad. However, multiple barriers must be overcome to enable accessible and effective treatments for SCI patients. This review presents available information on hSC transplantation for SCI with the intention to uncover gaps in our knowledge and discuss areas for future development. To this end, we introduce the historical progression of the work that supports existing and prospective clinical initiatives and explain the reasons for the choice of hSCs while also addressing their limitations as cell therapy products. A search of the relevant literature revealed that rat SCs have served as a preclinical model of reference since the onset of investigations, and that hSC transplants are relatively understudied, possibly due to the sophisticated resources and expertise needed for the traditional processing of hSC cultures from human nerves. In turn, we reason that additional experimentation and a reexamination of the available data are needed to understand the therapeutic value of hSC transplants taking into consideration that the manufacturing of the hSCs themselves may require further development for extended uses in basic research and clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Poly (ADP-ribose) Interacts With Phosphorylated α-Synuclein in Post Mortem PD Samples</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.704041</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) is a negatively charged polymer that is biosynthesized by Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and regulates various cellular processes. Alpha-synuclein (αSyn) is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that has been directly implicated with driving the onset and progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The mechanisms by which α-synuclein (αSyn) elicits its neurotoxic effects remain unclear, though it is well established that the main components of Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) in PD patients are aggregated hyperphosphorylated (S129) forms of αSyn (pαSyn). In the present study, we used immunofluorescence-based assays to explore if PARP-1 enzymatic product (PAR) promotes the aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation of pαSyn. We also performed quantitative measurements using in situ proximity ligation assays (PLA) on a transgenic murine model of α-synucleinopathy (M83-SNCA&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;A53T) and post mortem PD/PDD patient samples to characterize PAR–pαSyn interactions. Additionally, we used bioinformatic approaches and site-directed mutagenesis to identify PAR-binding regions on αSyn. In summary, our studies show that PAR–pαSyn interactions are predominantly observed in PD-relevant transgenic murine models of αSyn pathology and post mortem PD/PDD patient samples. Moreover, we confirm that the interactions between PAR and αSyn involve electrostatic forces between negatively charged PAR and lysine residues on the N-terminal region of αSyn.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Prenatal androgen influences on the brain: A review, critique, and illustration of research on congenital adrenal hyperplasia</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24900?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Sex hormones, especially androgens, contribute to sex and gender differences in the brain and behavior. Organizational effects are particularly important because they are thought to be permanent, reflecting hormone exposure during sensitive periods of development. In human beings, they are often studied with natural experiments in which sex hormones are dissociated from other biopsychosocial aspects of development, such as genes and experiences. Indeed, the greatest evidence for organizational effects on sex differences in human behavior comes from studies of females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), who have heightened prenatal androgen exposure, female‐typical rearing, and masculinized toy play, activity and career interests, spatial skills, and some personal characteristics. Interestingly, however, neuroimaging studies of females with CAH have revealed few neural mechanisms underlying these hormone‐behavior links, with the exception of emotion processing; studies have instead shown reduced gray matter volumes and reduced white matter integrity most consistent with other disease‐related processes. The goals of this narrative review are to: (a) describe methods for studying prenatal androgen influences, while offering a brief overview of behavioral outcomes; (b) provide a critical methodological review of neuroimaging research on females with CAH; (c) present an illustrative analysis that overcomes methodological limitations of previous work, focusing on person‐specific neural reward networks (and their associations with sensation seeking) in women with CAH and their unaffected sisters in order to inform future research questions and approaches that are most likely to reveal organizational hormone effects on brain structure and function.</content:encoded>

More than 1.6 million Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests were administered daily in the United States at the peak of the epidemic, with a significant focus on individual treatment. Here, we show that objective-driven, strategic sampling designs and analyses can maximize information gain at the population level, which is necessary to increase situational awareness and predict, prepare for, and respond to a pandemic, while also continuing to inform individual treatment. By focusing on specific objectives such as individual treatment or disease prediction and control (e.g., via the collection of population-level statistics to inform lockdown measures or vaccine rollout) and drawing from the literature on capture–recapture methods to deal with nonrandom sampling and testing errors, we illustrate how public health objectives can be achieved even with limited test availability when testing programs are designed a priori to meet those objectives.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ioJn_S3Md0o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Comprehensive glycoproteomics shines new light on the complexity and extent of glycosylation in archaea</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/3LiSINPzrjQ/article</link>

Glycosylation is one of the most complex posttranslational protein modifications. Its importance has been established not only for eukaryotes but also for a variety of prokaryotic cellular processes, such as biofilm formation, motility, and mating. However, comprehensive glycoproteomic analyses are largely missing in prokaryotes. Here, we extend the phenotypic characterization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation pathway mutants in &lt;i&gt;Haloferax volcanii&lt;/i&gt; and provide a detailed glycoproteome for this model archaeon through the mass spectrometric analysis of intact glycopeptides. Using in-depth glycoproteomic datasets generated for the wild-type (WT) and mutant strains as well as a reanalysis of datasets within the Archaeal Proteome Project (ArcPP), we identify the largest archaeal glycoproteome described so far. We further show that different &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation pathways can modify the same glycosites under the same culture conditions. The extent and complexity of the &lt;i&gt;Hfx&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;volcanii N&lt;/i&gt;-glycoproteome revealed here provide new insights into the roles of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation in archaeal cell biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3LiSINPzrjQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Response thresholds alone cannot explain empirical patterns of division of labor in social insects</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/7Frc4eP-AYw/article</link>

The effects of heterogeneity in group composition remain a major hurdle to our understanding of collective behavior across disciplines. In social insects, division of labor (DOL) is an emergent, colony-level trait thought to depend on colony composition. Theoretically, behavioral response threshold models have most commonly been employed to investigate the impact of heterogeneity on DOL. However, empirical studies that systematically test their predictions are lacking because they require control over colony composition and the ability to monitor individual behavior in groups, both of which are challenging. Here, we employ automated behavioral tracking in 120 colonies of the clonal raider ant with unparalleled control over genetic, morphological, and demographic composition. We find that each of these sources of variation in colony composition generates a distinct pattern of behavioral organization, ranging from the amplification to the dampening of inherent behavioral differences in heterogeneous colonies. Furthermore, larvae modulate interactions between adults, exacerbating the apparent complexity. Models based on threshold variation alone only partially recapitulate these empirical patterns. However, by incorporating the potential for variability in task efficiency among adults and task demand among larvae, we account for all the observed phenomena. Our findings highlight the significance of previously overlooked parameters pertaining to both larvae and workers, allow the formulation of theoretical predictions for increasing colony complexity, and suggest new avenues of empirical study.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7Frc4eP-AYw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Erythrocyte adenosine A2B receptor prevents cognitive and auditory dysfunction by promoting hypoxic and metabolic reprogramming</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/JKRydZnMyQc/article</link>

Reisz, George Edwards III, Fred A. Perreira, Rodney E. Kellems, Claudio Soto, Angelo D’Alessandro, Yang Xia&lt;/p&gt;

Hypoxia drives aging and promotes age-related cognition and hearing functional decline. Despite the role of erythrocytes in oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) transport, their role in the onset of aging and age-related cognitive decline and hearing loss (HL) remains undetermined. Recent studies revealed that signaling through the erythrocyte adenosine A2B receptor (ADORA2B) promotes O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release to counteract hypoxia at high altitude. However, nothing is known about a role for erythrocyte ADORA2B in age-related functional decline. Here, we report that loss of murine erythrocyte–specific ADORA2B (e&lt;i&gt;Adora2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) accelerates early onset of age-related impairments in spatial learning, memory, and hearing ability. &lt;i&gt;eAdora2b-/-&lt;/i&gt; mice display the early aging-like cellular and molecular features including the proliferation and activation of microglia and macrophages, elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and attenuation of hypoxia-induced glycolytic gene expression to counteract hypoxia in the hippocampus (HIP), cortex, or cochlea. Hypoxia sufficiently accelerates early onset of cognitive and cochlear functional decline and inflammatory response in e&lt;i&gt;Adora2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Mechanistically, erythrocyte ADORA2B-mediated activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) promotes hypoxic and metabolic reprogramming to enhance production of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), an erythrocyte-specific metabolite triggering O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; delivery. Significantly, this finding led us to further discover that murine erythroblast ADORA2B and BPGM mRNA levels and erythrocyte BPGM activity are reduced during normal aging. Overall, we determined that erythrocyte ADORA2B–BPGM axis is a key component for anti-aging and anti-age–related functional decline.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/JKRydZnMyQc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>
