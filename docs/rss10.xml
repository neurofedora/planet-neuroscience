	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Modulation of Beta Bursts in the Subthalamic Nucleus Predicts Motor Performance</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8905?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Considerable evidence suggests a role of beta-band oscillations in voluntary movements. However, most of the studies linking beta power to motor performance are based on data averaged across trials that ignore the fast dynamics of oscillatory activity and trial-to-trial variations in motor responses. Recently, emphasis has shifted from the functional implications of the mean beta power to the presence and nature of episodic bursts of beta activity. Here we test the hypothesis that beta bursts, though short in duration in more physiological state, may help explain spontaneous variations in motor behavior of human adults at the single-trial level. To this end, we recorded local field potential activity from the subthalamic nucleus of parkinsonian patients of both genders whose motor behavior had been normalized as far as possible through treatment with the dopamine prodrug, levodopa. We found that beta bursts present in a time-limited window well before movement onset in the contralateral subthalamic nucleus reduce the peak velocity of that movement and that this effect is further amplified by the amplitude of the burst. Additionally, prolonged reaction times are observed when bursts occur immediately after the GO cue. Together, these results suggest that the modulation of the timing and amplitude of beta bursts might serve to dynamically adapt motor performance. These results offer new insight in the pathology of Parkinson's disease, and suggest that beta bursts whose presence and nature are modulated by context may have a physiological role in modulating behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Beta oscillations (~13–30 Hz) have been increasingly interpreted as transient bursts rather than as rhythmically sustained oscillations (Feingold et al., 2015). Prolonged and increased probability of beta bursts in the subthalamic nucleus correlates with the severity of motor impairment in Parkinson's disease (Tinkhauser et al., 2017a, b). However, it remains unclear whether beta bursts act to modify motor performance on a trial-by-trial basis under more physiological condition. Here, we found that, according to the time window in which they fall, beta bursts reduced the velocity of the forthcoming movement or prolonged the reaction time. These results offer new insight in the pathology of Parkinson's disease and also suggest that the modulation of beta bursts might serve to dynamically adapt motor performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Microglia Play an Active Role in Obesity-Associated Cognitive Decline</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8889?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Obesity affects &amp;gt;600 million people worldwide, a staggering number that appears to be on the rise. One of the lesser known consequences of obesity is its deleterious effects on cognition, which have been well documented across many cognitive domains and age groups. To investigate the cellular mechanisms that underlie obesity-associated cognitive decline, we used diet-induced obesity in male mice and found memory impairments along with reductions in dendritic spines, sites of excitatory synapses, increases in the activation of microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, and increases in synaptic profiles within microglia, in the hippocampus, a brain region linked to cognition. We found that partial knockdown of the receptor for fractalkine, a chemokine that can serve as a &quot;find me&quot; cue for microglia, prevented microglial activation and cognitive decline induced by obesity. Furthermore, we found that pharmacological inhibition of microglial activation in obese mice was associated with prevention of both dendritic spine loss and cognitive degradation. Finally, we observed that pharmacological blockade of microglial phagocytosis lessened obesity-associated cognitive decline. These findings suggest that microglia play an active role in obesity-associated cognitive decline by phagocytosis of synapses that are important for optimal function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Obesity in humans correlates with reduced cognitive function. To investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying this, we used diet-induced obesity in mice and found impaired performance on cognitive tests of hippocampal function. These deficits were accompanied by reduced numbers of dendritic spines, increased microglial activation, and increased synaptic profiles within microglia. Inhibition of microglial activation by transgenic and pharmacological methods prevented cognitive decline and dendritic spine loss in obese mice. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of the phagocytic activity of microglia was also sufficient to prevent cognitive degradation. This work suggests that microglia may be responsible for obesity-associated cognitive decline and dendritic spine loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Differentiating between Models of Perceptual Decision Making Using Pupil Size Inferred Confidence</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8874?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;During perceptual decisions, subjects often rely more strongly on early, rather than late, sensory evidence, even in tasks when both are equally informative about the correct decision. This early psychophysical weighting has been explained by an integration-to-bound decision process, in which the stimulus is ignored after the accumulated evidence reaches a certain bound, or confidence level. Here, we derive predictions about how the average temporal weighting of the evidence depends on a subject's decision confidence in this model. To test these predictions empirically, we devised a method to infer decision confidence from pupil size in 2 male monkeys performing a disparity discrimination task. Our animals' data confirmed the integration-to-bound predictions, with different internal decision bounds and different levels of correlation between pupil size and decision confidence accounting for differences between animals. However, the data were less compatible with two alternative accounts for early psychophysical weighting: attractor dynamics either within the decision area or due to feedback to sensory areas, or a feedforward account due to neuronal response adaptation. This approach also opens the door to using confidence more broadly when studying the neural basis of decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; An animal's ability to adjust decisions based on its level of confidence, sometimes referred to as &quot;metacognition,&quot; has generated substantial interest in neuroscience. Here, we show how measurements of pupil diameter in macaques can be used to infer their confidence. This technique opens the door to more neurophysiological studies of confidence because it eliminates the need for training on behavioral paradigms to evaluate confidence. We then use this technique to test predictions from competing explanations of why subjects in perceptual decision making often rely more strongly on early evidence: the way in which the strength of this effect should depend on a subject's decision confidence. We find that a bounded decision formation process best explains our empirical data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sarcoglycan Alpha Mitigates Neuromuscular Junction Decline in Aged Mice by Stabilizing LRP4</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8860?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;During aging, acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters become fragmented and denervated at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Underpinning molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We showed that LRP4, a receptor for agrin and critical for NMJ formation and maintenance, was reduced at protein level in aged mice, which was associated with decreased MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting compromised agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling in aged muscles. Transgenic expression of LRP4 in muscles alleviated AChR fragmentation and denervation and improved neuromuscular transmission in aged mice. LRP4 ubiquitination was augmented in aged muscles, suggesting increased LRP4 degradation as a mechanism for reduced LRP4. We found that sarcoglycan α (SGα) interacted with LRP4 and delayed LRP4 degradation in cotransfected cells. AAV9-mediated expression of SGα in muscles mitigated AChR fragmentation and denervation and improved neuromuscular transmission in aged mice. These observations support a model where compromised agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling serves as a pathological mechanism of age-related NMJ decline and identify a novel function of SGα in stabilizing LRP4 for NMJ stability in aged mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study provides evidence that LRP4, a receptor of agrin that is critical for NMJ formation and maintenance, is reduced at protein level in aged muscles. Transgenic expression of LRP4 in muscles ameliorates AChR fragmentation and denervation and improves neuromuscular transmission in aged mice, demonstrating a critical role of the agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling. Our study also reveals a novel function of SGα to prevent LRP4 degradation in aged muscles. Finally, we show that NMJ decline in aged mice can be mitigated by AAV9-mediated expression of SGα in muscles. These observations provide insight into pathological mechanisms of age-related NMJ decline and suggest that improved agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling may be a target for potential therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor Enhances Reward Learning through Potentiation of Mesolimbic Dopamine System Function</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8845?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deficits in motivation and cognition are hallmark symptoms of multiple psychiatric diseases. These symptoms are disruptive to quality of life and often do not improve with available medications. In recent years there has been increased interest in the role of the immune system in neuropsychiatric illness, but to date no immune-related treatment strategies have come to fruition. The cytokine granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is known to have trophic and neuroprotective properties in the brain, and we recently identified it as a modulator of neuronal and behavioral plasticity. By combining operant tasks that assess discrete aspects of motivated behavior and decision-making in male mice and rats with subsecond dopamine monitoring via fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, we defined the role of G-CSF in these processes as well as the neural mechanism by which it modulates dopamine function to exert these effects. G-CSF enhanced motivation for sucrose as well as cognitive flexibility as measured by reversal learning. These behavioral outcomes were driven by mesolimbic dopamine system plasticity, as systemically administered G-CSF increased evoked dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens independent of clearance mechanisms. Importantly, sustained increases in G-CSF were required for these effects as acute exposure did not enhance behavioral outcomes and decreased dopamine release. These effects seem to be a result of the ability of G-CSF to alter local inflammatory signaling cascades, particularly tumor necrosis factor α. Together, these data show G-CSF as a potent modulator of the mesolimbic dopamine circuit and its ability to appropriately attend to salient stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Emerging evidence has highlighted the importance of the immune system in psychiatric diseases states. However, the effects of peripheral cytokines on motivation and cognitive function are largely unknown. Here, we report that granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), a pleiotropic cytokine with known trophic and neuroprotective properties in the brain, acts directly on dopaminergic circuits to enhance their function. These changes in dopaminergic dynamics enhance reward learning and motivation for natural stimuli. Together, these results suggest that targeting immune factors may provide a new avenue for therapeutic intervention in the multiple psychiatric disorders that are characterized by motivational and cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Medial Auditory Thalamus Is Necessary for Expression of Auditory Trace Eyelid Conditioning</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8831?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transforming a brief sensory event into a persistent neural response represents a mechanism for linking temporally disparate stimuli together to support learning. The cerebellum requires this type of persistent input during trace conditioning to engage associative plasticity and acquire adaptively timed conditioned responses (CRs). An initial step toward identifying the sites and mechanisms generating and transmitting persistent signals to the cerebellum is to identify the input pathway. The medial auditory thalamic nuclei (MATN) are the necessary and sufficient source of auditory input to the cerebellum for delay conditioning in rodents and a possible input to forebrain sites generating persistent signals. Using pharmacological and computational approaches, we test (1) whether the necessity of MATN during auditory eyelid conditioning is conserved across species, (2) whether the MATN are necessary for the expression of trace eyelid CRs, and if so, (3)whether this relates to the generation of persistent signals. We find that contralateral inactivation of MATN with muscimol largely abolished trace and delay CRs in male rabbits. Residual CRs were decreased in amplitude, but CR timing was unaffected. Results from large-scale cerebellar simulations are consistent with previous experimental demonstrations that silencing only CS-duration inputs does not abolish trace CRs, and instead affects their timing. Together, these results suggest that the MATN are a necessary component of both the direct auditory stimulus pathway to the cerebellum and the pathway generating task-essential persistent signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Persistent activity is required for working memory-dependent tasks, such as trace conditioning, and represents a mechanism by which sensory information can be used over time for learning and cognition. This neuronal response entails the transformation of a discrete sensory-evoked response into a signal that extends beyond the stimulus event. Understanding the generation and transmission of this stimulus transformation requires identifying the input sources necessary for task-essential persistent signals. We report that the medial auditory thalamic nuclei are required for the expression of auditory trace conditioning and suggest that these nuclei are a component of the pathway-generating persistent signals. Our study provides a foundation for testing circuit-level mechanisms underlying persistent activity in a cerebellar learning model with identified inputs and well defined behavioral outputs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Brief, But Not Prolonged, Pauses in the Firing of Midbrain Dopamine Neurons Are Sufficient to Produce a Conditioned Inhibitor</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8822?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prediction errors are critical for associative learning. In the brain, these errors are thought to be signaled, in part, by midbrain dopamine neurons. However, although there is substantial direct evidence that brief increases in the firing of these neurons can mimic positive prediction errors, there is less evidence that brief pauses mimic negative errors. Whereas pauses in the firing of midbrain dopamine neurons can substitute for missing negative prediction errors to drive extinction, it has been suggested that this effect might be attributable to changes in salience rather than the operation of this signal as a negative prediction error. Here we address this concern by showing that the same pattern of inhibition will create a cue able to meet the classic definition of a conditioned inhibitor by showing suppression of responding in a summation test and slower learning in a retardation test. Importantly, these classic criteria were designed to rule out explanations founded on attention or salience; thus the results cannot be explained in this manner. We also show that this pattern of behavior is not produced by a single, prolonged, ramped period of inhibition, suggesting that it is precisely timed, sudden change and not duration that conveys the teaching signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we show that brief pauses in the firing of midbrain dopamine neurons are sufficient to produce a cue that meets the classic criteria defining a conditioned inhibitor, or a cue that predicts the omission of a reward. These criteria were developed to distinguish actual learning from salience or attentional effects; thus these results formally show that brief pauses in the firing of dopamine neurons can serve as key teaching signals in the brain. Interestingly, this was not true for gradual prolonged pauses, suggesting it is the dynamic change in firing that serves as the teaching signal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Presynaptic Inhibition of Primary Nociceptive Signals to Dorsal Horn Lamina I Neurons by Dopamine</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8809?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The dorsal horn of the spinal cord represents the first relay station in the pain pathway where primary nociceptive inputs are modulated by local circuits and by descending signals before being relayed to supraspinal nuclei. To determine whether dopamine can modulate primary nociceptive A- and C-fiber signals, the effects of dopamine were tested on the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) recorded from large lamina I neurons and from retrograde-labeled spinoparabrachial lamina I neurons upon stimulation of the L4/L5 dorsal root in horizontal spinal cord slices &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Dopamine inhibited the EPSCs in a dose-dependent manner, with substantial inhibition (33%) at 1 μm and maximum inhibition (~70%) at 10–20 μm. Dopamine reduced the frequency of miniature EPSCs recorded from large lamina I neurons, increased the paired pulse depression ratio of paired EPSCs, and induced similar inhibition of EPSCs after dialysis of large lamina I neurons with GDP-β-S, consistent with actions at presynaptic sites. Pharmacological experiments suggested that the inhibitory effects of dopamine were largely mediated by D4 receptors (53%). Similar inhibition (66%) by dopamine was observed on EPSCs recorded from ipsilateral large lamina I neurons 6 d after injection of complete Freund's adjuvant in the hindpaw, suggesting that dopamine downregulates primary nociceptive inputs to lamina I neurons during chronic inflammatory pain. We propose that presynaptic inhibition of primary nociceptive inputs to lamina I projection neurons is a mechanism whereby dopamine can inhibit incoming noxious stimuli to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Lamina I projection neurons represent the main output for the pain signals from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to brainstem and thalamic nuclei. We found that dopamine inhibits the nociceptive A- and C-fiber synaptic inputs to lamina I projection neurons via presynaptic actions. Similar inhibitory effects of dopamine on the EPSCs were observed in rats subjected to complete Freund's adjuvant to induce peripheral inflammation, suggesting that dopamine inhibits the synaptic inputs to lamina I neurons in the setting of injury. A better understanding of how primary nociceptive inputs to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord are modulated by descending monoaminergic signals may help in the development of new pharmacological strategies to selectively downregulate the output from lamina I projection neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Role of Cholinergic Midbrain Neurons in Startle and Prepulse Inhibition</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8798?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of the two major cholinergic centers of the mammalian brain is located in the midbrain, i.e., the pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPTg) and the adjacent laterodorsal tegmentum. These cholinergic neurons have been shown to be important for e.g., arousal, reward associations, and sleep. They also have been suggested to mediate sensorimotor gating, measured as prepulse inhibition of startle (PPI). PPI disruptions are a hallmark of schizophrenia and are observed in various other psychiatric disorders, where they are associated with, and often predictive of, other cognitive symptoms. PPI has been proposed to be mediated by a short midbrain circuitry including inhibitory cholinergic projections from PPTg to the startle pathway. Although the data indicating the involvement of the PPTg is very robust, some more recent evidence challenges that there is a cholinergic contribution to PPI. We here use transient optogenetic activation of specifically the cholinergic PPTg neurons in male and female rats to address their role in startle modulation in general, and in PPI specifically. Although we could confirm the crucial role of PPTg cholinergic neurons in associative reward learning, validating our experimental approach, we found that activation of cholinergic PPTg neurons did not inhibit startle responses. In contrast, activation of cholinergic PPTg neurons enhanced startle, which is in accordance with their general role in arousal and indicate a potential involvement in sensitization of startle. We conclude that noncholinergic PPTg neurons mediate PPI in contrast to the longstanding hypothetical view that PPI is mediated by cholinergic PPTg neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Activation of cholinergic neurons in the midbrain has been assumed to mediate prepulse inhibition of startle (PPI), a common measure of sensorimotor gating that is disrupted in schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. We here revisit this long-standing hypothesis using optogenetic activation of these specific neurons combined with startle testing in rats. In contrast to the hypothetical role of these neurons in startle modulation, we show that their activation leads to an increase of baseline startle and to prepulse facilitation. This supports recent data by others that have started to cast some doubt on the cholinergic hypothesis of PPI, and calls for a revision of the theoretical construct of PPI mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Anterolateral Motor Cortex Connects with a Medial Subdivision of Ventromedial Thalamus through Cell Type-Specific Circuits, Forming an Excitatory Thalamo-Cortico-Thalamic Loop via Layer 1 Apical Tuft Dendrites of Layer 5B Pyramidal Tract Type Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8787?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The anterolateral motor cortex (ALM) and ventral medial (VM) thalamus are functionally linked to support persistent activity during motor planning. We analyzed the underlying synaptic interconnections using optogenetics and electrophysiology in mice (female/male). In cortex, thalamocortical (TC) axons from VM thalamus excited VM-projecting pyramidal tract (PT) neurons in layer 5B of ALM. These axons also strongly excited layer 2/3 neurons (which strongly excite PT neurons, as previously shown) but not VM-projecting corticothalamic (CT) neurons in layer 6. The strongest connections in the VM -&amp;gt; PT circuit were localized to apical tuft dendrites of PT neurons, in layer 1. These tuft inputs were selectively augmented after blocking hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. In thalamus, axons from ALM PT neurons excited ALM-projecting VM neurons, located medially in VM. These axons provided weak input to neurons in mediodorsal nucleus, and little or no input either to neurons in the GABAergic reticular thalamic nucleus or to neurons in VM projecting to primary motor cortex (M1). Conversely, M1 PT axons excited M1- but not ALM-projecting VM neurons. Our findings indicate, first, a set of cell type-specific connections forming an excitatory thalamo-cortico-thalamic loop for ALM  VM communication and a circuit-level substrate for supporting reverberant activity in this system. Second, a key feature of this loop is the prominent involvement of layer 1 synapses onto apical dendrites, a subcellular compartment with distinct signaling properties, including HCN-mediated gain control. Third, the segregation of the ALM  VM loop from M1-related circuits of VM adds cellular-level support for the concept of parallel pathway organization in the motor system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Anterolateral motor cortex (ALM), a higher-order motor area in the mouse, and ventromedial (VM) thalamus are anatomically and functionally linked, but their synaptic interconnections at the cellular level are unknown. Our results show that ALM pyramidal tract neurons monosynaptically excite ALM-projecting thalamocortical neurons in a medial subdivision of VM thalamus, and vice versa. The thalamo-cortico-thalamic loop formed by these recurrent connections constitutes a circuit-level substrate for supporting reverberant activity in this system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Thalamus Controls Development and Expression of Arousal States in Visual Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8772?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two major checkpoints of development in cerebral cortex are the acquisition of continuous spontaneous activity and the modulation of this activity by behavioral state. Despite the critical importance of these functions, the circuit mechanisms of their development remain unknown. Here we use the rodent visual system as a model to test the hypothesis that the locus of circuit change responsible for the developmental acquisition of continuity and state dependence measured in sensory cortex is relay thalamus, rather than the local cortical circuitry or the interconnectivity of the two structures. We conducted simultaneous recordings in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and primary visual cortex (VC) of awake, head-fixed male and female rats using linear multielectrode arrays throughout early development. We find that activity in dLGN becomes continuous and positively correlated with movement (a measure of state dependence) on P13, the same day as VC, and that these properties are not dependent on VC activity. By contrast, silencing dLGN after P13 causes activity in VC to become discontinuous and movement to suppress, rather than augment, cortical firing, effectively reversing development. Thalamic bursting, a core characteristic of non-aroused states, emerged later, on P16, suggesting these processes are developmentally independent. Together our results indicate that cellular or circuit changes in relay thalamus are critical drivers for the maturation of background activity, which occurs around term in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The developing brain acquires two crucial features, continuous spontaneous activity and its modulation by arousal state, around term in humans and before the onset of sensory experience in rodents. This developmental transition in cortical activity, as measured by electroencephalogram (EEG), is an important milestone for normal brain development and indicates a good prognosis for babies born preterm and/or suffering brain damage such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. By using the awake rodent visual system as a model, we identify changes occurring at the level of relay thalamus, the major input to cortex, as the critical driver of EEG maturation. These results could help understand the circuit basis of human EEG development to improve diagnosis and treatment of infants in vulnerable situations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Muscle Synergies Obtained from Comprehensive Mapping of the Cortical Forelimb Representation Using Stimulus Triggered Averaging of EMG Activity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8759?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuromuscular control of voluntary movement may be simplified using muscle synergies similar to those found using non-negative matrix factorization. We recently identified synergies in electromyography (EMG) recordings associated with both voluntary movement and movement evoked by high-frequency long-duration intracortical microstimulation applied to the forelimb representation of the primary motor cortex (M1). The goal of this study was to use stimulus-triggered averaging (StTA) of EMG activity to investigate the synergy profiles and weighting coefficients associated with poststimulus facilitation, as synergies may be hard-wired into elemental cortical output modules and revealed by StTA. We applied StTA at low (LOW, ~15 μA) and high intensities (HIGH, ~110 μA) to 247 cortical locations of the M1 forelimb region in two male rhesus macaques while recording the EMG of 24 forelimb muscles. Our results show that 10–11 synergies accounted for 90% of the variation in poststimulus EMG facilitation peaks from the LOW-intensity StTA dataset while only 4–5 synergies were needed for the HIGH-intensity dataset. Synergies were similar across monkeys and current intensities. Most synergy profiles strongly activated only one or two muscles; all joints were represented and most, but not all, joint directions of motion were represented. Cortical maps of the synergy weighting coefficients suggest only a weak organization. StTA of M1 resulted in highly diverse muscle activations, suggestive of the limiting condition of requiring a synergy for each muscle to account for the patterns observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Coordination of muscle activity and the neural origin of potential muscle synergies remains a fundamental question of neuroscience. We previously demonstrated that high-frequency long-duration intracortical microstimulation-evoked synergies were unrelated to voluntary movement synergies and were not clearly organized in the cortex. Here we present stimulus-triggered averaging facilitation-related muscle synergies, suggesting that when fundamental cortical output modules are activated, synergies approach the limit of single-muscle control. Thus, we conclude that if the CNS controls movement via linear synergies, those synergies are unlikely to be called from M1. This information is critical for understanding neural control of movement and the development of brain–machine interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Retinal Detachment-Induced Müller Glial Cell Swelling Activates TRPV4 Ion Channels and Triggers Photoreceptor Death at Body Temperature</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8745?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using region-specific injection of hyaluronic acid, we developed a mouse model of acute retinal detachment (RD) to investigate molecular mechanisms of photoreceptor cell death triggered by RD. We focused on the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ion channel, which functions as a thermosensor, osmosensor, and/or mechanosensor. After RD, the number of apoptotic photoreceptors was reduced by ~50% in TRPV4KO mice relative to wild-type mice, indicating the possible involvement of TRPV4 activation in RD-induced photoreceptor cell death. Furthermore, TRPV4 expressed in Müller glial cells can be activated by mechanical stimuli caused by RD-induced swelling of these cells, resulting in release of the cytokine MCP-1, which is reported as a mediator of Müller glia-derived strong mediator for RD-induced photoreceptor death. We also found that the TRPV4 activation by the Müller glial swelling was potentiated by body temperature. Together, our results suggest that RD adversely impacts photoreceptor viability via TRPV4-dependent cytokine release from Müller glial cells and that TRPV4 is part of a novel molecular pathway that could exacerbate the effects of hypoxia on photoreceptor survival after RD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Identification of the mechanisms of photoreceptor death in retinal detachment is required for establishment of therapeutic targets for preventing loss of visual acuity. In this study, we found that TRPV4 expressed in Müller glial cells can be activated by mechanical stimuli caused by RD-induced swelling of these cells, resulting in release of the cytokine MCP-1, which is reported as a mediator of Müller glia-derived strong mediator for RD-induced photoreceptor death. We also found that the TRPV4 activation by the Müller glial swelling was potentiated by body temperature. Hence, TRPV4 inhibition could suppress cell death in RD pathological conditions and suggests that TRPV4 in Müller glial cells might be a novel therapeutic target for preventing photoreceptor cell death after RD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Regulators of G-Protein Signaling (RGS) Proteins Promote Receptor Coupling to G-Protein-Coupled Inwardly Rectifying Potassium (GIRK) Channels</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8737?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins negatively modulate presynaptic μ-opioid receptor inhibition of GABA release in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG). Paradoxically, we find that G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation of G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (GIRKs) in the vlPAG is reduced in an agonist- and receptor-dependent manner in transgenic knock-in mice of either sex expressing mutant RGS-insensitive Gαo proteins. μ-Opioid receptor agonist activation of GIRK currents was reduced for DAMGO and fentanyl but not for [Met&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;]-enkephalin acetate salt hydrate (ME) in the RGS-insensitive heterozygous (Het) mice compared with wild-type mice. The GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; agonist baclofen-induced GIRK currents were also reduced in the Het mice. We confirmed the role of Gαo proteins in μ-opioid receptor and GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor signaling pathways in wild-type mice using myristoylated peptide inhibitors of Gαo&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Gαi&lt;sub&gt;1–3&lt;/sub&gt;. The results using these inhibitors indicate that receptor activation of GIRK channels is dependent on the preference of the agonist-stimulated receptor for Gαo versus that for Gαi. DAMGO and fentanyl-mediated GIRK currents were reduced in the presence of the Gαo&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitor, but not the Gαi&lt;sub&gt;1–3&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitors. In contrast, the Gαo&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; peptide inhibitor did not affect ME activation of GIRK currents, which is consistent with results in the Het mice, but the Gαi&lt;sub&gt;1–3&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitors significantly reduced ME-mediated GIRK currents. Finally, the reduction in GIRK activation in the Het mice plays a role in opioid- and baclofen-mediated spinal antinociception, but not supraspinal antinociception. Thus, our studies indicate that RGS proteins have multiple mechanisms of modulating GPCR signaling that produce negative and positive regulation of signaling depending on the effector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins positively modulate GPCR coupling to GIRKs, and this coupling is critical for opioid- and baclofen-mediated spinal antinociception, whereas μ-opioid receptor-mediated supraspinal antinociception depends on presynaptic inhibition that is negatively regulated by RGS proteins. The identification of these opposite roles for RGS proteins has implications for signaling via other GPCRs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Experimental Traumatic Brain Injury Identifies Distinct Early and Late Phase Axonal Conduction Deficits of White Matter Pathophysiology, and Reveals Intervening Recovery</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8723?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients often exhibit slowed information processing speed that can underlie diverse symptoms. Processing speed depends on neural circuit function at synapses, in the soma, and along axons. Long axons in white matter (WM) tracts are particularly vulnerable to TBI. We hypothesized that disrupted axon–myelin interactions that slow or block action potential conduction in WM tracts may contribute to slowed processing speed after TBI. Concussive TBI in male/female mice was used to produce traumatic axonal injury in the corpus callosum (CC), similar to WM pathology in human TBI cases. Compound action potential velocity was slowed along myelinated axons at 3 d after TBI with partial recovery by 2 weeks, suggesting early demyelination followed by remyelination. Ultrastructurally, dispersed demyelinated axons and disorganized myelin attachment to axons at paranodes were apparent within CC regions exhibiting traumatic axonal injury. Action potential conduction is exquisitely sensitive to paranode abnormalities. Molecular identification of paranodes and nodes of Ranvier detected asymmetrical paranode pairs and abnormal heminodes after TBI. Fluorescent labeling of oligodendrocyte progenitors in &lt;i&gt;NG2CreER;mTmG&lt;/i&gt; mice showed increased synthesis of new membranes extended along axons to paranodes, indicating remyelination after TBI. At later times after TBI, an overall loss of conducting axons was observed at 6 weeks followed by CC atrophy at 8 weeks. These studies identify a progression of both myelinated axon conduction deficits and axon–myelin pathology in the CC, implicating WM injury in impaired information processing at early and late phases after TBI. Furthermore, the intervening recovery reveals a potential therapeutic window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major global health concern. Across the spectrum of TBI severities, impaired information processing can contribute to diverse functional deficits that underlie persistent symptoms. We used experimental TBI to exploit technical advantages in mice while modeling traumatic axonal injury in white matter tracts, which is a key pathological feature of human TBI. A combination of approaches revealed slowed and failed signal conduction along with damage to the structure and molecular composition of myelinated axons in the white matter after TBI. An early regenerative response was not sustained yet reveals a potential time window for intervention. These insights into white matter abnormalities underlying axon conduction deficits can inform strategies to improve treatment options for TBI patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04026</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We take an image science perspective on the problem of determining brain
network connectivity given functional activity. But adapting the concept of
image resolution to this problem, we provide a new perspective on network
partitioning for individual brain parcellation. The typical goal here is to
determine densely-interconnected subnetworks within a larger network by
choosing the best edges to cut. We instead define these subnetworks as
resolution cells, where highly-correlated activity within the cells makes edge
weights difficult to determine from the data. Subdividing the resolution
estimates into disjoint resolution cells via clustering yields a new variation,
and new perspective, on spectral clustering. This provides insight and
strategies for open questions such as the selection of model order and the
optimal choice of preprocessing steps for functional imaging data. The approach
is demonstrated using functional imaging data, where we find the proposed
approach produces parcellations which are more predictive across multiple scans
versus conventional methods, as well as versus alternative forms of spectral
clustering.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03856</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While objects from different categories can be reliably decoded from fMRI
brain response patterns, it has proved more difficult to distinguish visually
similar inputs, such as different instances of the same category. Here, we
apply a recently developed deep learning system to the reconstruction of face
images from human fMRI patterns. We trained a variational auto-encoder (VAE)
neural network using a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) unsupervised
training procedure over a large dataset of celebrity faces. The auto-encoder
latent space provides a meaningful, topologically organized 1024-dimensional
description of each image. We then presented several thousand face images to
human subjects, and learned a simple linear mapping between the multi-voxel
fMRI activation patterns and the 1024 latent dimensions. Finally, we applied
this mapping to novel test images, turning the obtained fMRI patterns into VAE
latent codes, and ultimately the codes into face reconstructions. Qualitative
and quantitative evaluation of the reconstructions revealed robust pairwise
decoding (&amp;gt;95% correct), and a strong improvement relative to a baseline model

recycled to probe human face perception along many dimensions of interest; for
example, the technique allowed for accurate gender classification, and even to
decode which face was imagined, rather than seen by the subject.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03855</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The flow of information through the brain is reflected by the activity
patterns of neural cells. Indeed, these firing patterns are widely used as
input data to predictive models that relate stimuli and animal behavior to the
activity of a population of neurons. However, relatively little attention was
paid to single neuron spike trains as predictors of cell or network properties
in the brain. In this work, we introduce an approach to neuronal spike train
data mining which enables effective classification and clustering of neuron
types and network activity states based on single-cell spiking patterns. This
approach is centered around applying state-of-the-art time series
classification/clustering methods to sequences of interspike intervals recorded
from single neurons. We demonstrate good performance of these methods in tasks
involving classification of neuron type (e.g. excitatory vs. inhibitory cells)
and/or neural circuit activity state (e.g. awake vs. REM sleep vs. nonREM sleep
states) on an open-access cortical spiking activity dataset.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03661</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Temporal resolution of visual information processing is thought to be an
important factor in predator-prey interactions, shaped in the course of
evolution by animals' ecology. Here I show that light can be considered to have
a dual role of a source of information, which guides motor actions, and an
environmental feedback for those actions. I consequently show how temporal
perception might depend on behavioral adaptations realized by the nervous
system. I propose an underlying mechanism of synaptic clock, with every synapse
having its characteristic time unit, determined by the persistence of memory
traces of synaptic inputs, which is used by the synapse to tell time. The
present theory offers a testable framework, which may account for numerous
experimental findings, including the interspecies variation in temporal
resolution and the properties of subjective time perception, specifically the
variable speed of perceived time passage, depending on emotional and
attentional states or tasks performed.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39689</link>
	<content:encoded>A better understanding of processes controlling the development and function of pancreatic islets is critical for diabetes prevention and treatment. Here, we reveal a previously unappreciated function for pancreatic β2-adrenergic receptors (Adrb2) in controlling glucose homeostasis by restricting islet vascular growth during development. Pancreas-specific deletion of &lt;i&gt;Adrb2&lt;/i&gt; results in glucose intolerance and impaired insulin secretion in mice, and unexpectedly, specifically in females. The metabolic phenotypes were recapitulated by &lt;i&gt;Adrb2&lt;/i&gt; deletion from neonatal, but not adult, b-cells. Mechanistically, &lt;i&gt;Adrb2&lt;/i&gt; loss increases production of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF-A) in female neonatal b-cells and results in hyper-vascularized islets during development, which in turn, disrupts insulin production and exocytosis. Neonatal correction of islet hyper-vascularization, via VEGF-A receptor blockade, fully rescues functional deficits in glucose homeostasis in adult mutant mice. These findings uncover a regulatory pathway that functions in a sex-specific manner to control glucose metabolism by restraining excessive vascular growth during islet development.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Ongoing, rational calibration of reward-driven perceptual biases</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36018</link>
	<content:encoded>Decision-making is often interpreted in terms of normative computations that maximize a particular reward function for stable, average behaviors. Aberrations from the reward-maximizing solutions, either across subjects or across different sessions for the same subject, are often interpreted as reflecting poor learning or physical limitations. Here we show that such aberrations may instead reflect the involvement of additional satisficing and heuristic principles. For an asymmetric-reward perceptual decision-making task, three monkeys produced adaptive biases in response to changes in reward asymmetries and perceptual sensitivity. Their choices and response times were consistent with a normative accumulate-to-bound process. However, their context-dependent adjustments to this process deviated slightly but systematically from the reward-maximizing solutions. These adjustments were instead consistent with a rational process to find satisficing solutions based on the gradient of each monkey's reward-rate function. These results suggest new dimensions for assessing the rational and idiosyncratic aspects of flexible decision-making.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/438952v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Only a minority of individuals who experience traumatic event(s) subsequently develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, whether differences in vulnerability to PTSD result from predisposition or a consequence of trauma exposure remains unclear. A major challenge in differentiating these possibilities is that clinical studies focus on individuals already exposed to traumatic experiences, and do not take into account pre-trauma conditions. Here using the predator scent model of PTSD in rats and a longitudinal design, we measured pre-trauma brain-wide neural circuit functional connectivity (FC), behavioral and corticosterone responses to trauma exposure, and post-trauma anxiety. Individual differences in freezing responses to predator scent exposure correlated with differences in pre-trauma FC in a set of neural circuits, especially in olfactory and stress-related systems, indicating that pre-existing function in these circuits could predispose animals to differential fearful responses to threats. Counterintuitively, rats with the lowest freezing showed more avoidance of the predator scent, a blunted corticosterone response, and higher anxiety long after exposure. This study provides a comprehensive framework of pre-existing circuit function that determines threat response strategy, which might be directly related to the development of PTSD-like behaviors.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/438861v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Autism spectrum disorders are early onset neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social communication and restricted repetitive behaviors, yet they are quite heterogeneous in terms of their genetic basis and phenotypic manifestations. Recently, de novo pathogenic mutations in DYRK1A, a chromosome 21 gene associated to neuropathological traits of Down syndrome, have been identified in patients presenting a recognizable syndrome included in the autism spectrum. These mutations produce DYRK1A kinases with partial or complete absence of the catalytic domain, or they represent missense mutations located within this domain. Here, we undertook an extensive biochemical characterization of the DYRK1A missense mutations reported to date and show that most of them, but not all, result in enzymatically dead DYRK1A proteins. We also show that haploinsufficient Dyrk1a+/- mutant mice mirror the neurological traits associated with the human pathology, such as defective social interactions, stereotypic behaviors and epileptic activity. These mutant mice present altered proportions of excitatory and inhibitory neocortical neurons and synapses. Moreover, we provide evidence that alterations in the production of cortical excitatory neurons are contributing to these defects. Indeed, by the end of the neurogenic period, the expression of developmental regulated genes involved in neuron differentiation and/or activity is altered. Therefore, our data indicate that altered neocortical neurogenesis could critically affect the formation of cortical circuits, thereby contributing to the neuropathological changes in DYRK1A haploinsufficiency syndrome.</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Zic4-lineage cells increase their contribution to visual thalamic nuclei during murine embryogenesis if they are homozygous or heterozygous for loss of Pax6 function</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0367-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Our aim was to study the mechanisms that contribute to the development of discrete thalamic nuclei during mouse embryogenesis (both sexes included). We characterized the expression of the transcription factor coding gene &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt; and the distribution of cells that expressed &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt; in their lineage. We used genetic fate mapping to show that &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt;-lineage cells mainly contribute to a subset of thalamic nuclei, in particular the lateral geniculate nuclei, which are crucial components of the visual pathway. We observed that almost all &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt;-lineage diencephalic progenitors express the transcription factor Pax6 at variable location-dependent levels. We used conditional mutagenesis to delete either one or both copies of &lt;i&gt;Pax6&lt;/i&gt; from &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt;-lineage cells. We found that &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt;-lineage cells carrying either homozygous or heterozygous loss of &lt;i&gt;Pax6&lt;/i&gt; contributed in abnormally high numbers to one or both of the main lateral geniculate nuclei. This could not be attributed to a change in cell production and was likely due to altered sorting of thalamic cells. Our results indicate that positional information encoded by the levels of Pax6 in diencephalic progenitors is an important determinant of the eventual locations of their daughter cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The development of the thalamus is a process in which cells that initially appear similar give rise to distinct cell groups called nuclei. How these nuclei form is poorly understood. We utilised a mouse model in which cells that express the gene &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt; can be followed. We studied the consequences of knocking out either one or both copies of the gene encoding the Pax6 transcription factor in these &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt;-lineage cells.

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0220-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;GPCRs such as 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; and D2 are implicated in the therapeutic and the side effects of antipsychotics. However, the pattern of brain activity that leads to the behavioural effects of antipsychotics is poorly understood. To address this question, we used the transgenic ‘FosTRAP’ mice (&lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt;), where a fluorescent reporter marks the cells responsive to the stimulus of interest. Here the stimulus was an administration of various antipsychotic drugs. In case of typical antipsychotics such as Haloperidol, the &lt;i&gt;c-fos&lt;/i&gt; active cells were predominantly found in the striatum whereas in case of the atypical antipsychotics (Clozapine and Olanzapine) &lt;i&gt;c-fos&lt;/i&gt; induced cells were more numerous in the cortical regions e.g., orbital cortex, piriform cortex. Curiously, we also observed ependymal cells to be a novel cellular target of atypical antipsychotics. 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; is considered to be a major target for atypical antipsychotics. Therefore, we bred ‘FosTRAP’ mice with 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; knockout mice and tested their response to the prototype of atypical antipsychotics- Clozapine. Interestingly, the absence of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; did not significantly affect the number of &lt;i&gt;c-fos&lt;/i&gt; induced cells in the cortical regions. However, the ependymal cells showed a dramatically reduced response to Clozapine in the absence of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;. In summary, the TRAP system has allowed us to identify various region-specific activity induced by antipsychotics and novel cellular targets of the antipsychotics. These results serve as a ‘proof of principle’ study that can be extended to explore the biochemical and physiological changes brought about by antipsychotics and specifically identify antipsychotic-responsive cells in the live tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Antipsychotic drugs have been the first choice of treatment for mental illnesses such as Schizophrenia. Thorough understanding of the cellular and neuronal targets of these drugs should deepen our understanding of the pathophysiology of the mental disorders and help the development of improved therapy. We report here the use of FosTrap mice that allowed us to label cells and brain areas that were responsive to the antipsychotic treatment. We identified brain regions such as orbital cortex, piriform cortex and ventral posteromedial thalamus as the targets of the atypical class of antipsychotics. Importantly, we also report for the first time that, ependymal cells, lining the ventricles, are targeted by the atypical antipsychotics and this effect is modulated by the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on visual evoked potentials (VEP)
allow for spelling from a keyboard of flashing characters. Among VEP BCIs,
code-modulated visual evoked potentials (c-VEPs) are designed for high-speed
communication . In c-VEPs, all characters flash simultaneously. In particular,
each character flashes according to a predefined 63-bit binary sequence
(m-sequence), circular-shifted by a different time lag. For a given character,
the m-sequence evokes a VEP in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of the subject,
which can be used as a template. This template is obtained during a calibration
phase at the beginning of each session. Then, the system outputs the desired
character after a predefined number of repetitions by estimating its time lag
with respect to the template. Our work avoids the calibration phase, by
extracting from the VEP relative lags between successive characters, and
predicting the full word using a dictionary.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03262</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal morphology is an essential element for brain activity and function.
We take advantage of current availability of brain-wide neuron digital
reconstructions of the Pyramidal cells from a mouse brain, and analyze several
emergent features of brain-wide neuronal morphology. We observe that axonal
trees are self-affine while dendritic trees are self-similar. We also show that
tree size appear to be random, independent of the number of dendrites within
single neurons. Moreover, we consider inhomogeneous branching model which
stochastically generates rooted 3-Cayley trees for the brain-wide neuron
topology. Based on estimated order-dependent branching probability from actual
axonal and dendritic trees, our inhomogeneous model quantitatively captures a
number of topological features including size and shape of both axons and
dendrites. This sheds lights on a universal mechanism behind the topological
formation of brain-wide axonal and dendritic trees.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Testing two potentially multivariate variables for statistical dependence on
the basis finite samples is a fundamental statistical challenge. Here we
explore a family of tests that adapt to the complexity of the relationship
between the variables, promising robust power across scenarios. Building on the
distance correlation, we introduce a family of adaptive independence criteria
based on nonlinear monotonic transformations of distances. We show that these
criteria, like the distance correlation and RKHS-based criteria, provide
dependence indicators. We propose a class of adaptive (multi-threshold) test
statistics, which form the basis for permutation tests. These tests empirically
outperform some of the established tests in average and worst-case statistical
sensitivity across a range of univariate and multivariate relationships and
might deserve further exploration.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02842</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain computer interfaces
have shown its robustness in achieving high information transfer rate.
State-of-the-art training-based SSVEP decoding methods such as extended
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Task-Related Component Analysis (TRCA)
are the major players that elevate the efficiency of SSVEP-based BCI through
individualized calibration process. However, the calibration may be
time-consuming in order to collect sufficient training templates, deteriorating
the practicality in real-world context. This study aims to develop a
cross-subject transferring approach to reduce the need of training data from a
new user. The proposed least-squares transformation (LST) method was able to
significantly reduce the training templates required for TRCA-based SSVEP
detection on a 40-class SSVEP dataset from 8 subjects. This study shed light on
plug-and-play high speed SSVEP-based BCI for further practical applications.

	<content:encoded>Flying squirrels are the only group of gliding mammals with a remarkable diversity and wide geographical range. However, their evolutionary story is not well known. Thus far, identification of extinct flying squirrels has been exclusively based on dental features, which, contrary to certain postcranial characters, are not unique to them. Therefore, fossils attributed to this clade may indeed belong to other squirrel groups. Here we report the oldest fossil skeleton of a flying squirrel (11.6 Ma) that displays the gliding-related diagnostic features shared by extant forms and allows for a recalibration of the divergence time between tree and flying squirrels. Our phylogenetic analyses combining morphological and molecular data generally support older dates than previous molecular estimates (~23 Ma), being congruent with the inclusion of some of the earliest fossils (~36 Ma) into this clade. They also show that flying squirrels experienced little morphological change for almost 12 million years.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39234</link>
	<content:encoded>Cells constantly adapt to environmental fluctuations. These physiological changes require time and therefore cause a lag phase during which the cells do not function optimally. Interestingly, past exposure to an environmental condition can shorten the time needed to adapt when the condition re-occurs, even in daughter cells that never directly encountered the initial condition. Here, we use the molecular toolbox of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; to systematically unravel the molecular mechanism underlying such history-dependent behavior in transitions between glucose and maltose. In contrast to previous hypotheses, the behavior does not depend on persistence of proteins involved in metabolism of a specific sugar. Instead, presence of glucose induces a gradual decline in the cells' ability to activate respiration, which is needed to metabolize alternative carbon sources. These results reveal how trans-generational transitions in central carbon metabolism generate history-dependent behavior in yeast, and provide a mechanistic framework for similar phenomena in other cell types.</content:encoded>

We recently discovered a micropeptide named DWORF (&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;DW&lt;/span&gt;arf &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;pen &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;eading &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;rame) that enhances SERCA activity by displacing phospholamban (PLN), a potent SERCA inhibitor. Here we show that DWORF has a higher apparent binding affinity for SERCA than PLN and that DWORF overexpression mitigates the contractile dysfunction associated with PLN overexpression, substantiating its role as a potent activator of SERCA. Additionally, using a well-characterized mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) due to genetic deletion of the muscle-specific LIM domain protein (MLP), we show that DWORF overexpression restores cardiac function and prevents the pathological remodeling and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dysregulation classically exhibited by MLP knockout mice. Our results establish DWORF as a potent activator of SERCA within the heart and as an attractive candidate for a heart failure therapeutic.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38281</link>
	<content:encoded>Stimulus- or context-dependent routing of neural signals through parallel pathways can permit flexible processing of diverse inputs. For example, work in mouse shows that rod photoreceptor signals are routed through several retinal pathways, each specialized for different light levels. This light-level-dependent routing of rod signals has been invoked to explain several human perceptual results, but it has not been tested in primate retina. Here we show, surprisingly, that rod signals traverse the primate retina almost exclusively through a single pathway - the dedicated rod bipolar pathway. Identical experiments in mouse and primate reveal substantial differences in how rod signals traverse the retina. These results require reevaluating human perceptual results in terms of flexible computation within this single pathway. This includes a prominent speeding of rod signals with light level - which we show is inherited directly from the rod photoreceptors themselves rather than from different pathways with distinct kinetics.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37059</link>
	<content:encoded>The role of pro-inflammatory macrophage activation in cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a complex one amenable to network approaches. While an indispensible tool for elucidating the molecular underpinnings of complex diseases including CVD, the interactome is limited in its utility as it is not specific to any cell type, experimental condition or disease state. We introduced context-specificity to the interactome by combining it with co-abundance networks derived from unbiased proteomics measurements from activated macrophage-like cells. Each macrophage phenotype contributed to certain regions of the interactome. Using a network proximity-based prioritization method on the combined network, we predicted potential regulators of macrophage activation. Prediction performance significantly increased with the addition of co-abundance edges, and the prioritized candidates captured inflammation, immunity and CVD signatures. Integrating the novel network topology with transcriptomics and proteomics revealed top candidate drivers of inflammation. In vitro loss-of-function experiments demonstrated the regulatory role of these proteins in pro-inflammatory signaling.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36045</link>
	<content:encoded>Morphogenesis involves interactions of asymmetric cell populations to form complex multicellular patterns and structures comprised of distinct cell types. However, current methods to model morphogenic events lack control over cell-type co-emergence and offer little capability to selectively perturb specific cell subpopulations. Our &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; system interrogates cell-cell interactions and multicellular organization within human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) colonies. We examined effects of induced mosaic knockdown of molecular regulators of cortical tension (ROCK1) and cell-cell adhesion (CDH1) with CRISPR interference. Mosaic knockdown of ROCK1 or CDH1 resulted in differential patterning within hiPSC colonies due to cellular self-organization, while retaining an epithelial pluripotent phenotype. Knockdown induction stimulates a transient wave of differential gene expression within the mixed populations that stabilized in coordination with observed self-organization. Mosaic patterning enables genetic interrogation of emergent multicellular properties, which can facilitate better understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate symmetry-breaking during morphogenesis.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35685</link>
	<content:encoded>Most cells spend the majority of their life in a non-proliferating state. When proliferation cessation is irreversible, cells are senescent. By contrast, if the arrest is only temporary, cells are defined as quiescent. These cellular states are hardly distinguishable without triggering proliferation resumption, hampering thus the study of quiescent cells properties. Here we show that quiescent and senescent yeast cells are recognizable based on their mitochondrial network morphology. Indeed, while quiescent yeast cells display numerous small vesicular mitochondria, senescent cells exhibit few globular mitochondria. This allowed us to reconsider at the individual-cell level, properties previously attributed to quiescent cells using population-based approaches. We demonstrate that cell’s propensity to enter quiescence is not influenced by replicative age, volume or density. Overall, our findings reveal that quiescent cells are not all identical but that their ability to survive is significantly improved when they exhibit the specific reorganization of several cellular machineries.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34594</link>
	<content:encoded>The ancient mechanisms that caused developmental gene regulatory networks to diversify among distantly related taxa are not well understood. Here we use ancestral protein reconstruction, biochemical experiments, and developmental assays of transgenic animals carrying reconstructed ancestral genes to investigate how the transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd) evolved its central role in anterior-posterior patterning in flies. We show that most of Bcd’s derived functions are attributable to evolutionary changes within its homeodomain (HD) during a phylogenetic interval &amp;gt;140 million years ago. A single substitution from this period (Q50K) accounts almost entirely for the evolution of Bcd’s derived DNA specificity in vitro. In transgenic embryos expressing the reconstructed ancestral HD, however, Q50K confers activation of only a few of Bcd’s transcriptional targets and yields a very partial rescue of anterior development. Adding a second historical substitution (M54R) confers regulation of additional Bcd targets and further rescues anterior development. These results indicate that two epistatically interacting mutations played a major role in the evolution of Bcd’s controlling regulatory role in early development. They also show how ancestral sequence reconstruction can be combined with in vivo characterization of transgenic animals to illuminate the historical mechanisms of developmental evolution.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Life history strategies for optimizing individual fitness fall on a spectrum between maximizing reproductive efforts and maintaining physical health over time. Strategies across this spectrum are viable and different suites of personality traits evolved to support these strategies. Using data from 538 captive chimpanzees (&lt;i&gt;Pan troglodytes&lt;/i&gt;) we tested whether any of the dimensions of chimpanzee personality – agreeableness, conscientiousness, dominance, extraversion, neuroticism, and openness – were associated with longevity, an attribute of slow life history strategies that is especially important in primates given their relatively long lives. We found that higher agreeableness was related to longevity in males, with weaker evidence suggesting that higher openness is related to longer life in females. Our results link the literature on human and nonhuman primate survival and suggest that, for males, evolution has favored the protective effects of low aggression and high quality social bonds.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: To Overwrite or to Recall? Individual Differences in Motor Adaptation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/439406v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The central nervous system predicts the consequences of motor commands by leaning multiple internal models of external perturbations and of the body. It is not well understood, however, how new internal models are created. Here, we propose a novel computational model of motor adaptation in which a stochastic Bayesian decision-making process determines whether i) a previously updated expert perturbation model is recalled and updated, ii) a novice model is selected and is updated into a new expert, or iii) the body model is updated. Results from computer simulations provide insights into various and contradictory experimental data on savings and error-clamp, and predicts qualitative individual differences in adaptation. We verified these predictions in a visuomotor adaptation experiment in which we varied the perturbation amplitudes as well as the amount of noise added to perturbation, and added trigger trials in the error-clamp condition. Single trigger trials led to largely qualitatively different behavior and can therefore be used to probe individual differences in memory updates between one-model and two-model learners. One-model learners continuously update the body model, showing no savings during re-adaptation to the perturbation, and gradual decay during error clamp. In contrast, two-model learners switch between an updated expert model and the body model, showing large savings during re-adaptation and stochastic lags during error clamp. Our results thus support the view that motor adaptation belongs to the general class of human learning according to which new memories are created when no existing memories can account for discontinuities in sensory data.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Selective D2 and D3 receptor antagonists oppositely modulate cocaine responses in mice via distinct postsynaptic mechanisms in nucleus accumbens</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/439398v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: The D3 receptor (D3R) has emerged as a promising pharmacotherapeutic target for the treatment of several diseases including schizophrenia, Parkinsons disease, and substance use disorders. However, studies investigating the modulatory impact of D3R antagonism on dopamine neurotransmission or the effects drugs of abuse have produced mixed results, in part because D3R-targeted compounds often also interact with D2 receptors (D2R). The purpose of this study was to compare the consequences of selective D2R or D3R antagonism on the behavioral effects of cocaine in mice, and to identify the neurobiological mechanisms underlying their modulatory effects. Methods: We characterized the effects of selective D2R or D3R antagonism in mice on 1) basal and cocaine-induced locomotor activity, 2) presynaptic dopamine release and clearance in the nucleus accumbens using ex vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry, and 3) dopamine-mediated signaling in D1-expressing and D2-expressing medium spiny neurons using ex vivo electrophysiology. Results: Pretreatment with the selective D2R antagonist L-741,626 attenuated, while pretreatment with the selective D3R antagonist PG01037 enhanced, the locomotor-activating effects of acute and repeated cocaine administration. While both antagonists potentiated cocaine-induced increases in presynaptic DA release, D3R blockade uniquely facilitated DA-mediated excitation of D1-expressing medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens. Conclusions: Selective D3R antagonism potentiates the behavioral-stimulant effects of cocaine in mice, an effect that is in direct opposition to that produced by selective D2R antagonism or nonselective D2-like receptor antagonists, likely by facilitating D1-mediated excitation in the nucleus accumbens. These findings provide important insights into the neuropharmacological actions of D3R antagonists on mesolimbic dopamine neurotransmission.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/439356v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Different terminals of the sensorimotor network show varied somatotopic arrangements of body-part representations. Since somatotopy is best characterized in the primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices, these terminals have been the main target for research on somatotopic alterations following loss of sensory input (e.g. arm amputation). Such reorganization is generally considered to be driven by the spatial layout of the underlying somatotopy, such that neighboring body-part representations tend to occupy the deprived brain region. For example, following arm deafferentation in non-human primates, the S1 deprived hand area becomes responsive to inputs from the chin, which has a native representation that cortically neighbors that of the (now deprived) hand region. Here we challenge the assumption of proximity-based reorganization, by comparing patterns of reorganization in people born without one hand (hereafter, one-handers, n=26, 15 female) in the cerebellum and the primary sensorimotor cortex. We first report that in the cerebellum of one-handers, the deprived hand region represents multiple body-parts, despite varying distances between the native representations of these body-parts and the deprived hand region. We further replicate our previous finding, showing a similar pattern of reorganization in the deprived hand region of the cerebral cortex in one-handers. Since the cerebellar and cerebral cortices contain different somatotopic layouts, the parallel reorganization observed in these two terminals demonstrates that the mere spatial layout of body-part representations may not exclusively dictate reorganization in the sensorimotor network. Instead, we discuss alternative drivers of reorganization, and particularly, the possible role of adaptive behavior and sub-cortical plasticity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/439158v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Syntax is the engine that allows us to create an infinitude of linguistic expressions, and the construction of syntactic structures, such as noun phrases and verb phrases, is considered a fundamental component of language processing. Nevertheless, insights concerning the neurobiological basis of syntax have remained elusive, in part because it is difficult to isolate syntax from semantic composition. Consequently, many studies of syntax have relied on meaningless artificial stimuli, such as jabberwocky expressions or artificial grammars. However, while pure manipulations of syntax are challenging to design, natural language grammars do have a sparse set of constructions presenting this possibility. Here we examined one such case, English post-nominal adjectives (mountain TALL enough for a strenuous hike), which were contrasted with semantically parallel but structurally simpler noun-adjective sequences in an MEG experiment. We observed a sharp activity increase in the left posterior temporal lobe (PTL) when syntactic composition was more straightforward, approximately 200 ms after adjective onset. The semantic fit between the noun and adjective was also varied, but this affected anterior temporal cortex, consistent with prior work. These findings offer a unique demonstration of the relevance of posterior temporal cortex for syntactic processing in natural language. We also present connectivity evidence that the syntax-related PTL responses were relayed to ipsilateral inferior frontal and anterior temporal regions. The combined results draw an initial picture of the rapid spatio-temporal dynamics of the syntactic and semantic composition network in sentence processing.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/438978v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Understanding the relationship between the diffusion-weighted MRI signal and the arrangement of white matter fibers is fundamental for accurate voxel-wise reconstruction of the fiber orientation distribution (FOD) and subsequent fiber tractography. Spherical deconvolution reconstruction techniques model the diffusion signal as the convolution of the FOD with a response function which represents the signal profile of a single fiber orientation. Thus, given the signal and a fiber response function, the FOD can be estimated in every imaging voxel by deconvolution. However, the selection of the appropriate response function remains relatively un-studied, and requires further validation. In this work, using 3D histologically-defined FODs and the corresponding diffusion signal from three ex vivo squirrel monkey brains, we derive the ground truth response functions. We find that the histologically-derived response functions differ from those conventionally used. Next, we find that response functions statistically vary across brain regions, which suggests that the practice of using the same kernel throughout the brain is not optimal. Additionally, response functions vary significantly across subjects. We show that different kernels lead to different FOD reconstructions, which in turn can lead to different tractography results depending on algorithmic parameters, with large variations in the accuracy of resulting reconstructions. Together, this suggests that there is room for improvement in estimating and understanding the relationship between the diffusion signal and the underlying FOD.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disease resulting from a complex interplay between genetics and environment. Impairments in the basic neuronal process of axonal transport have been identified in several ALS models. However, in vivo evidence of early/pre-symptomatic deficiencies in neuronal cargo trafficking remains limited, thus the pathogenic importance of axonal transport to the ALS disease spectrum remains to be fully resolved. We therefore analysed the in vivo dynamics of retrogradely transported, neurotrophin-containing signalling endosomes in motor neuron axons of two new mouse models of ALS that have mutations in different RNA processing genes (Tardbp and Fus). TDP-43M337V mice, which show neuromuscular pathology but no overt motor neuron loss, displayed in vivo perturbations in axonal transport that manifested between 1.5 and 3 months and preceded motor symptom onset. In contrast, signalling endosome transport remained largely unaffected in mutant Fus{Delta}14/+ mice, despite 20% motor neuron loss. These findings indicate that deficiencies in retrograde neurotrophin signalling and axonal transport are not common to all ALS-linked genes, and that there are inherent and mechanistic distinctions in the pathogenesis of ALS caused by mutations in different RNA processing genes.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/438788v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>High frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) of skin nociceptors triggers central sensitization, manifested as increased pinprick sensitivity of the skin surrounding the site at which HFS was applied. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of HFS on pupil dilation and brain responses elicited by pinprick stimulation delivered in the area of increased pinprick sensitivity. In fourteen healthy volunteers HFS was applied to one of the two forearms. Before and twenty minutes after applying HFS, mechanical pinprick stimuli (64 mN and 96 mN) were delivered to the area surrounding the site at which HFS was applied as well as the contralateral control arm. During pinprick stimulation both the pupil size and electroencephalogram were recorded. HFS induced a clear and comparable increase in pinprick sensitivity for both the 64 and 96 mN stimulation intensity. Both pinprick stimulation intensities elicited a greater pupil dilation response when delivered to the area of increased pinprick sensitivity. However, this greater pupil dilation response was larger for the 64 mN compared to the 96 mN stimulation intensity. A similar pattern was observed for the negative wave of the pinprick-evoked brain potentials (PEPs), however, the increase was not significant for the 96 mN and showed only a trend towards significance for the 64 mN. These results show that there is a correspondence between the increase in pupil dilation and the increase in PEPs, but that pupil size is a more sensitive measure for detecting the effects of central sensitization than PEPs.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The unique nested gene ALZAS as a potential source of A{beta}-peptides in Alzheimer\'s disease</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/438630v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Amyloid-beta (A{beta}) peptides are considered to be the cause of neuronal and synaptic cell death in Alzheimer's disease (AD) since approximately 100 years. To date, it is assumed that A{beta}-peptides arise from the proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, within the APP gene, a nested gene called ALZheimer ASsociated (ALZAS) exists, which includes the entire A{beta}42-sequence and thus may also be the origin of various A{beta}-species. Here, we firstly confirmed expression and the postulated amino acid sequence of ALZAS and revealed the binding of selected monoclonal A{beta}-antibodies to A{beta}- and ALZAS protein. We confirmed the specificity of the anti-ALZAS antibody to ALZAS by protein sequence analysis. This anti-ALZAS antibody detects the same amino acid sequence as the autoantibody found in human blood of AD patients. Since no detailed data are currently available concerning ALZAS expression and the amount, localization and function of ALZAS protein in human cells and tissue, we performed gene (over)expression experiments on transcriptional and translational level. We verified a considerably lower mRNA amount of ALZAS compared to the host gene APP. Nevertheless, ALZAS transcription and translation seems to be heavily regulated in different human tissues and cells. Artificially increased mRNA levels of ALZAS did not led to an enhanced protein amount or considerable increase in cell death. Notably, cell localization of the ALZAS protein showed accordance to endosomes indicating that ALZAS, which contains the whole transmembrane domain of APP, might be a peripheral membrane protein. Since endosome dysfunctions are a characteristic event in early stages of AD and the highest ALZAS-autoantibody levels were already detected in early AD stages, ALZAS might play a crucial role in AD pathology and could possibly be a further diagnostic marker.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/G8Cye4lL4dQ/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Vasileios Vavourakis, Triantafyllos Stylianopoulos, Peter A. Wijeratne&lt;/p&gt;

The delivery of blood-borne therapeutic agents to solid tumours depends on a broad range of biophysical factors. We present a novel multiscale, multiphysics, in-silico modelling framework that encompasses dynamic tumour growth, angiogenesis and drug delivery, and use this model to simulate the intravenous delivery of cytotoxic drugs. The model accounts for chemo-, hapto- and mechanotactic vessel sprouting, extracellular matrix remodelling, mechano-sensitive vascular remodelling and collapse, intra- and extravascular drug transport, and tumour regression as an effect of a cytotoxic cancer drug. The modelling framework is flexible, allowing the drug properties to be specified, which provides realistic predictions of in-vivo vascular development and structure at different tumour stages. The model also enables the effects of neoadjuvant vascular normalisation to be implicitly tested by decreasing vessel wall pore size. We use the model to test the interplay between time of treatment, drug affinity rate and the size of the vessels endothelium pores on the delivery and subsequent tumour regression and vessel remodelling. Model predictions confirm that small-molecule drug delivery is dominated by diffusive transport and further predict that the time of treatment is important for low affinity but not high affinity cytotoxic drugs, the size of the vessel wall pores plays an important role in the effect of low affinity but not high affinity drugs, that high affinity cytotoxic drugs remodel the tumour vasculature providing a large window for the normalisation of the vascular architecture, and that the combination of large pores and high affinity enhances cytotoxic drug delivery efficiency. These results have implications for treatment planning and methods to enhance drug delivery, and highlight the importance of in-silico modelling in investigating the optimisation of cancer therapy on a personalised setting.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/G8Cye4lL4dQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Interactive reservoir computing for chunking information streams</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/QfNrS1Ht3hA/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Toshitake Asabuki, Naoki Hiratani, Tomoki Fukai&lt;/p&gt;

Chunking is the process by which frequently repeated segments of temporal inputs are concatenated into single units that are easy to process. Such a process is fundamental to time-series analysis in biological and artificial information processing systems. The brain efficiently acquires chunks from various information streams in an unsupervised manner; however, the underlying mechanisms of this process remain elusive. A widely-adopted statistical method for chunking consists of predicting frequently repeated contiguous elements in an input sequence based on unequal transition probabilities over sequence elements. However, recent experimental findings suggest that the brain is unlikely to adopt this method, as human subjects can chunk sequences with uniform transition probabilities. In this study, we propose a novel conceptual framework to overcome this limitation. In this process, neural networks learn to predict dynamical response patterns to sequence input rather than to directly learn transition patterns. Using a mutually supervising pair of reservoir computing modules, we demonstrate how this mechanism works in chunking sequences of letters or visual images with variable regularity and complexity. In addition, we demonstrate that background noise plays a crucial role in correctly learning chunks in this model. In particular, the model can successfully chunk sequences that conventional statistical approaches fail to chunk due to uniform transition probabilities. In addition, the neural responses of the model exhibit an interesting similarity to those of the basal ganglia observed after motor habit formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QfNrS1Ht3hA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Hybrid Active Inference. (arXiv:1810.02647v1 [cs.AI])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02647</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We describe a framework of hybrid cognition by formulating a hybrid cognitive
agent that performs hierarchical active inference across a human and a machine
part. We suggest that, in addition to enhancing human cognitive functions with
an intelligent and adaptive interface, integrated cognitive processing could
accelerate emergent properties within artificial intelligence. To establish
this, a machine learning part learns to integrate into human cognition by
explaining away multi-modal sensory measurements from the environment and
physiology simultaneously with the brain signal. With ongoing training, the
amount of predictable brain signal increases. This lends the agent the ability
to self-supervise on increasingly high levels of cognitive processing in order
to further minimize surprise in predicting the brain signal. Furthermore, with
increasing level of integration, the access to sensory information about
environment and physiology is substituted with access to their representation
in the brain. While integrating into a joint embodiment of human and machine,
human action and perception are treated as the machine's own. The framework can
be implemented with invasive as well as non-invasive sensors for environment,
body and brain interfacing. Online and offline training with different machine
learning approaches are thinkable. Building on previous research on shared
representation learning, we suggest a first implementation leading towards
hybrid active inference with non-invasive brain interfacing and state of the
art probabilistic deep learning methods. We further discuss how implementation
might have effect on the meta-cognitive abilities of the described agent and
suggest that with adequate implementation the machine part can continue to
execute and build upon the learned cognitive processes autonomously.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning can extract information from neural recordings, e.g.,
surface EEG, ECoG and {\mu}ECoG, and therefore plays an important role in many
research and clinical applications. Deep learning with artificial neural
networks has recently seen increasing attention as a new approach in brain
signal decoding. Here, we apply a deep learning approach using convolutional
neural networks to {\mu}ECoG data obtained with a wireless, chronically
implanted system in an ovine animal model. Regularized linear discriminant
analysis (rLDA), a filter bank component spatial pattern (FBCSP) algorithm and
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) were applied to auditory evoked
responses captured by {\mu}ECoG. We show that compared with rLDA and FBCSP,
significantly higher decoding accuracy can be obtained by ConvNets trained in
an end-to-end manner, i.e., without any predefined signal features. Deep
learning thus proves a promising technique for {\mu}ECoG-based brain-machine
interfacing applications.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence algorithms are capable of fantastic exploits, yet
they are still grossly inefficient compared with the brain's ability to learn
from few exemplars or solve problems that have not been explicitly defined.
What is the secret that the evolution of human intelligence has unlocked?
Generalization is one answer, but there is more to it. The brain does not
directly solve difficult problems, it is able to recast them into new and more
tractable problems. Here we propose a model whereby higher cognitive functions
profoundly interact with reinforcement learning to drastically reduce the
degrees of freedom of the search space, simplifying complex problems and
fostering more efficient learning.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39984</link>
	<content:encoded>Cyclic G/AMP synthase (cGAS) initiates type-1 interferon responses against cytosolic double-stranded (ds)DNA, which range from antiviral gene expression to apoptosis. The mechanism by which cGAS shapes this diverse signaling landscape remains poorly defined. We find that substrate-binding and dsDNA length-dependent binding are coupled to the intrinsic dimerization equilibrium of cGAS, with its N-terminal domain potentiating dimerization. Notably, increasing the dimeric fraction by raising cGAS and substrate concentrations diminishes duplex length-dependent activation, but does not negate the requirement for dsDNA. These results demonstrate that reaction context dictates the duplex length dependence, reconciling competing claims on the role of dsDNA length in cGAS activation. Overall, our study reveals how ligand-mediated allostery positions cGAS in standby, ready to tune its signaling pathway in a switch-like fashion.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39979</link>
	<content:encoded>TOPBP1 and its fission yeast homologue Rad4, are critical players in a range of DNA replication, repair and damage signalling processes. They are composed of multiple BRCT domains, some of which bind phosphorylated motifs in other proteins. They thus act as multi-point adaptors bringing proteins together into functional combinations, dependent on post-translational modifications downstream of cell cycle and DNA damage signals. We have now structurally and/or biochemically characterised a sufficient number of high-affinity complexes for the conserved N-terminal region of TOPBP1 and Rad4 with diverse phospho-ligands, including human RAD9 and Treslin, and &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&lt;/i&gt; Crb2 and Sld3, to define the determinants of BRCT domain specificity. We use this to identify and characterise previously unknown phosphorylation-dependent TOPBP1/Rad4-binding motifs in human RHNO1 and the fission yeast homologue of MDC1, Mdb1. These results provide important insights into how multiple BRCT domains within TOPBP1/Rad4 achieve selective and combinatorial binding of their multiple partner proteins.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39786</link>
	<content:encoded>Dopamine neurons have different synaptic actions in the ventral and dorsal striatum (dStr), but whether this heterogeneity extends to dStr subregions has not been addressed. We have found that optogenetic activation of dStr dopamine neuron terminals in mouse brain slices pauses the firing of cholinergic interneurons in both the medial and lateral subregions, while in the lateral subregion the pause is shorter due to a subsequent excitation. This excitation is mediated mainly by metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) and partially by dopamine D1-like receptors coupled to transient receptor potential channel 3 and 7. DA neurons do not signal to spiny projection neurons in the medial dStr, while they elicit ionotropic glutamate responses in the lateral dStr. The DA neurons mediating these excitatory signals are in the substantia nigra (SN). Thus, SN dopamine neurons engage different receptors in different postsynaptic neurons in different dStr subregions to convey strikingly different signals.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Motor thalamus supports striatum-driven reinforcement</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34032</link>
	<content:encoded>Reinforcement has long been thought to require striatal synaptic plasticity. Indeed, direct striatal manipulations such as self-stimulation of direct-pathway projection neurons (dMSNs) are sufficient to induce reinforcement within minutes. However, it's unclear what role, if any, is played by downstream circuitry. Here, we used dMSN self-stimulation in mice as a model for striatum-driven reinforcement and mapped the underlying circuitry across multiple basal ganglia nuclei and output targets. We found that mimicking the effects of dMSN activation on downstream circuitry, through optogenetic suppression of basal ganglia output nucleus substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) or activation of SNr targets in the brainstem or thalamus, was also sufficient to drive rapid reinforcement. Remarkably, silencing motor thalamus-but not other selected targets of SNr-was the only manipulation that reduced dMSN-driven reinforcement. Together, these results point to an unexpected role for basal ganglia output to motor thalamus in striatum-driven reinforcement.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Causal evidence for LTP-based interference in visual learning</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/438598v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Training related skills in close succession results in interference but the reasons for this interference are not understood. Here we test the hypothesis that interference occurs due to competition of long-term potentiation (LTP): the LTP induced by one task impedes the LTP induced by the other. Human subjects performed two consecutive training sessions on different Gabor orientations. Immediately after the offset of the first training, we applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to interfere with the LTP processes produced by the first training. We found that cTBS to a control site (vertex) resulted in substantial anterograde interference for the second training. Critically, cTBS to the visual cortex not only disrupted learning on the immediately preceding training, but also released the second training from the anterograde interference. These results provide strong support for the LTP-based theory of interference and suggest the possibility of directly manipulating the competition between different learning periods.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens shell does not decrease cocaine self-administration in cocaine-dependent rats but increases GluR1/GluA1 in the central nucleus of the amygdala</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/438507v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Cocaine addiction is a major public health problem. Despite decades of intense research, no effective treatments are available. Both preclinical and clinical studies of drug addiction strongly suggest that the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is a viable target for deep brain stimulation (DBS). Objective: Although previous studies have shown that DBS of the NAcc decreases cocaine seeking and reinstatement, the effects of DBS on cocaine intake in cocaine-dependent animals have not yet been investigated. Methods: Rats were made cocaine-dependent by allowing them to self-administer cocaine in long-access sessions (6 h, 0.5 mg/kg/infusion). The effects of high-frequency DBS of the NAcc shell on cocaine intake was then studied. Furthermore, cocaine-induced locomotor activity, irritability-like behavior during cocaine abstinence and the levels of the -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunits 1 and 2 (GluR1/GluA1 and GluR2/GluA2) after DBS were investigated. Results: Contrary to our expectations, DBS of the NAcc shell induced a slight increase in both cocaine self-administration and cocaine-induced locomotor activity. In addition, 18 h into cocaine withdrawal, we found that DBS decreased irritability-like behavior. We also found that DBS-induced a robust increase in both cytosolic and synaptosomal levels of GluR1, but not GluR2, specifically in the central nucleus of the amygdala but not in other brain regions. Conclusions: These preclinical results with cocaine-dependent animals do not support high-frequency DBS of the NAcc shell as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of cocaine addiction in active cocaine users. However, the decrease in irritability-like behavior during cocaine abstinence, together with previous findings showing that DBS of the NAcc shell reduces the reinstatement of cocaine seeking in abstinent animals, warrants future investigations of DBS as a treatment for negative emotional states and craving during abstinence.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/438267v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The ability of animals to perform coordinated movements depends on the precise organization of neural circuits controlling motor function. Motor neurons (MNs), which are key components of these circuits, must project their axons out of the central nervous system and form precise terminal branching patterns at specific muscles in the periphery. By focusing on the Drosophila adult leg neuromuscular system we show that the stereotyped terminal branching of a subset of leg MNs is mediated by interacting transmembrane Ig superfamily (IgSF) proteins DIP- and Dpr10, present in MNs and target muscles, respectively. Importantly, the DIP-/Dpr10 interaction is needed only after MN axons reach the vicinity of their muscle targets. Live imaging of this process suggests that precise terminal branching patterns are gradually established by DIP-/Dpr10-dependent interactions between fine axon filopodia and developing muscles. Further, different leg MNs depend on the DIP- and Dpr10 interaction to varying degrees that correlate with the morphological complexity of the MNs and their muscle targets, suggesting that some MNs depend upon multiple sets of interacting proteins to establish terminal axon branching.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/438010v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The amplitude of the auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) generated in the brainstem exponentially decreases over the averaging of subsequent EEG epochs. This behavior is partially due to the adaptation of the auditory response to the continuous and monotonous stimulation. We analyzed the potential clinical relevance of the ASSR adaptation. Specifically, we compare the ASSR amplitude computed in two conditions: (1) when the auditory responses -embedded in the EEG epochs that are averaged in the estimation procedure- are influenced by the previous stimulation; and (2) when they are independent of the previous stimulation. ASSR were elicited in eight anesthetized adult rats by 8-kHz tones, modulated in amplitude at 115 Hz. ASSR amplitudes were computed using three averaging methods (standard, weighted and sorted averaging). We evaluated the ASSR amplitude as a function of sub-set of epochs selected for the averaging and the improvement in the ASSR detection resulting from averaging independent epochs. Due to adaptation, the ASSR amplitude computed by averaging dependent EEG epochs relied upon the averaging method. Lower ASSR amplitudes were obtained as EEG segments containing unadapted responses were systematically excluded from the averaging. In the absence of EEG artifacts, the ASSR amplitudes did not depend on the averaging method when they were computed from independent EEG epochs. The amplitude of independent ASSRs were up to 35% higher than those obtained by processing dependent EEG segments. Extracting the ASSR amplitude from independent epochs halved the number of EEG segments needed to be averaged to achieve the maximum detection rate of the response. Acquisition paradigm based on a discrete acoustic stimulation (in which segments of AM-sounds of several seconds in length are presented after a given inter stimulus interval), in combination with appropriated averaging methods might increase the accuracy of audiological tests based on ASSRs.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/437988v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In early blind individuals, brain activation by a variety of non-perceptual cognitive tasks extends to the visual cortex, while in the sighted it is restricted to supramodal association areas. We hypothesized that such activation results from the integration of different sectors of the visual cortex into typical task-dependent networks. We tested this hypothesis with fMRI in blind and sighted subjects using tasks assessing speech comprehension, incidental long-term memory and both verbal and non-verbal executive control, in addition to collecting resting-state data. All tasks activated the visual cortex in blind relative to sighted subjects, which enabled its segmentation according to task sensitivity. We then assessed the unique brain-scale functional connectivity of the segmented areas during resting state. Language-related seeds were preferentially connected to frontal and temporal language areas; the seed derived from the executive task was connected to the right dorsal frontoparietal executive network; the memory-related seed was uniquely connected to mesial frontoparietal areas involved in episodic memory retrieval. Thus, using a broad set of language, executive, and memory tasks in the same subjects, combined with resting state connectivity, we demonstrate the selective integration of different patches of the visual cortex into brain-scale networks with distinct localization, lateralization, and functional roles.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/437848v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective: We aimed at identifying the potential relationship between the dynamical properties of the human functional network at rest and one of the most prominent traits of personality, namely resilience. Approach: To tackle this issue, we used resting-state EEG data recorded from 45 healthy subjects. Resilience was quantified using the 10-items Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD- RISC). Using a sliding windows approach, brain networks in each EEG frequency band (delta, theta, alpha and beta) were constructed using the EEG source-space connectivity method. Brain networks dynamics were evaluated using the network flexibility, linked with the tendency of a given node to change its modular affiliation over time. Main Results: The results revealed a negative correlation between the psychological resilience and the brain network flexibility for a limited number of brain regions within the delta, alpha and beta bands. Significance: This study provides evidence that network flexibility, a metric of dynamic functional networks, is strongly correlated with psychological resilience as assessed from personality testing. Beyond this proof-of-principle that reliable EEG-based quantities representative of personality traits can be identified, this motivates further investigation regarding the full spectrum of personality aspects and their relationship with functional networks.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Intracellular tau accumulation forming neurofibrillary tangles is hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how tau accumulation induces synapse impairment is elusive. By overexpressing human full-length wildtype tau (termed hTau) to mimic tau abnormality as seen in the brain of sporadic AD patients, we found that hTau accumulation activated JAK2 to phosphorylate STAT1 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1) at Tyr701 leading to STAT1 dimerization, nuclear translocation and its activation. STAT1 activation suppressed expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) through direct binding to the specific GAS element of GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B promoters, while knockdown STAT1 by AAV-Cre in STAT1flox/flox mice or expressing dominant negative Y701F-STAT1 efficiently rescued hTau-induced suppression of NMDARs expression with amelioration of synaptic functions and memory performance. These findings indicate that hTau accumulation impairs synaptic plasticity through JAK2/STAT1-induced suppression of NMDARs expression, revealing a novel mechanism for hTau-associated synapse and memory deficits.</content:encoded>

Yet, the nature of this variability across the full spectrum of waking states is often not completely characterized, leaving the characteristics of the optimal state for sensory processing unresolved. Using pupillometry in concert with extracellular multiunit and intracellular whole-cell recordings, we found that the magnitude and reliability of visually evoked responses in primary visual cortex (V1) of awake, passively behaving male mice increase as a function of arousal and are largest during sustained locomotion periods. During these high-arousal, sustained locomotion periods, cortical neuronal membrane potential was at its most depolarized and least variable. Contrastingly, behavioral performance of mice on two distinct visual detection tasks was generally best at a range of intermediate arousal levels, but worst during locomotion. These results suggest that large, reliable responses to visual stimuli in V1 occur at a distinct arousal level from that associated with optimal visual detection performance. Our results clarify the relation between neuronal responsiveness and the continuum of waking states, and suggest new complexities in the relation between primary sensory cortical activity and behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/437657v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Genetic analysis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease risk has previously identified a network of largely microglial genes that form a transcriptional network. In transgenic mouse models of amyloid deposition we have previously shown that the expression of many of the mouse orthologs of these genes are co-ordinately up-regulated by amyloid deposition. Here we investigate whether systematic analysis of other members of this mouse amyloid-responsive network predicts other Alzheimer's risk loci. This statistical comparison of the mouse amyloid-response network with Alzheimer's disease genome-wide association studies identifies 5 other genetic risk loci for the disease (OAS1, CXCL10, LAPTM5, ITGAM and LILRB4). This work suggests that genetic variability in the microglial response to amyloid deposition is a major determinant for Alzheimer's risk.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Automated lesion segmentation with BIANCA: impact of population-level features, classification algorithm and locally adaptive thresholding</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/437608v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>White matter hyperintensities (WMH) or white matter lesions exhibit high variability in their characteristics both at population- and subject-level, making their detection a challenging task. Population-level factors such as age, vascular risk factors and neurodegenerative diseases affect lesion load and spatial distribution. At the individual level, WMH vary in contrast, amount and distribution in different white matter regions. In this work, we aimed to improve BIANCA, the FSL tool for WMH segmentation, in order to better deal with these sources of variability. We worked on two stages of BIANCA by improving the lesion probability map estimation (classification stage) and making the lesion probability map thresholding stage automated and adaptive to local lesion probabilities. Firstly, in order to take into account the effect of population-level factors, we included population-level lesion probabilities, modelled with respect to a parametric factor (e.g. age), in the classification stage. Secondly, we tested BIANCA performance when using four alternative classifiers commonly used in the literature, with respect to K-nearest neighbour algorithm currently used for lesion probability map estimation in BIANCA. Finally, we propose LOCally Adaptive Threshold Estimation (LOCATE), a supervised method for determining optimal local thresholds to apply to the estimated lesion probability map, as an alternative option to global thresholding (i.e. applying the same threshold to the entire lesion probability map). For these experiments we used data from a neurodegenerative cohort and a vascular cohort. We observed that including population-level parametric lesion probabilities with respect to age and using alternative machine learning techniques provided negligible improvement. However, LOCATE provided a substantial improvement in the lesion segmentation performance when compared to the global thresholding currently used in BIANCA. We further validated LOCATE on a cohort of CADASIL (Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) patients, a genetic form of cerebral small vessel disease characterised by extensive WMH burden, and healthy controls showing that LOCATE adapts well to wide variations in lesion load and spatial distribution.</content:encoded>

Early studies suggested the presence of D2 receptors in several cortical areas, albeit with major technical limitations. We used combinations of transgenic reporter systems, recombinase activated viral vectors, quantitative translatome analysis, and high sensitivity in situ hybridization to identify D2 receptor expressing cells and establish a map of their respective projections. Our results identified previously uncharacterized clusters of D2 expressing neurons in limbic and sensory regions of the adult mouse brain cortex. Characterization of these clusters by translatome analysis and cell type specific labeling revealed highly heterogeneous expression of D2 receptors in principal neurons and various populations of interneurons across cortical areas. Transcript enrichment analysis also demonstrated variable levels of D2 receptor expression and several orphan G-protein-coupled receptors coexpression in different neuronal clusters, thus suggesting strategies for genetic and therapeutic targeting of D2 expressing neurons in specific cortical areas. These results pave the way for a thorough re-examination of cortical D2 receptor functions, which could provide information about neuronal circuits involved in psychotic and mood disorders.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Diadenosine-Polyphosphate Analogue AppCH2ppA Suppresses Seizures by Enhancing Adenosine Signaling in the Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy257/5122731?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Epilepsy is a multifactorial disorder associated with neuronal hyperexcitability that affects more than 1% of the human population. It has long been known that adenosine can reduce seizure generation in animal models of epilepsies. However, in addition to various side effects, the instability of adenosine has precluded its use as an anticonvulsant treatment. Here we report that a stable analogue of diadenosine-tetraphosphate: AppCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ppA effectively suppresses spontaneous epileptiform activity in vitro and in vivo in a Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) mouse model (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Tsc1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;+/−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), and in postsurgery cortical samples from TSC human patients. These effects are mediated by enhanced adenosine signaling in the cortex post local neuronal adenosine release. The released adenosine induces A1 receptor-dependent activation of potassium channels thereby reducing neuronal excitability, temporal summation, and hypersynchronicity. AppCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ppA does not cause any disturbances of the main vital autonomous functions of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Tsc1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;+/&lt;/span&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; mice in vivo. Therefore, we propose this compound to be a potent new candidate for adenosine-related treatment strategies to suppress intractable epilepsies.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Psychiatric conditions marked by impairments in cognitive control often emerge during adolescence, when the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its inputs undergo structural and functional maturation and are vulnerable to disruption by external events. It is not known, however, whether there exists a specific temporal window within the broad range of adolescence when the development of PFC circuitry and its related behaviors are sensitive to disruption. Here we show, in male mice, that repeated exposure to amphetamine during early adolescence leads to impaired behavioral inhibition, aberrant PFC dopamine connectivity, and reduced PFC dopamine function in adulthood. Remarkably, these deficits are not observed following exposure to the exact same amphetamine regimen at later times. These findings demonstrate that there is a critical period for the disruption of the adolescent maturation of cognitive control and PFC dopamine function and suggest that early adolescence is particularly relevant to the emergence of psychopathology in humans.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Attention and saccadic adaptation (SA) are critical components of visual perception, the former enhancing sensory processing of selected objects, the latter maintaining the eye movements accuracy toward them. Recent studies propelled the hypothesis of a tight functional coupling between these mechanisms, possibly due to shared neural substrates. Here, we used magnetoencephalography to investigate for the first time the neurophysiological bases of this coupling and of SA per se. We compared visual discrimination performance of 12 healthy subjects before and after SA. Eye movements and magnetic signals were recorded continuously. Analyses focused on gamma band activity (GBA) during the pretarget period of the discrimination and the saccadic tasks. We found that GBA increases after SA. This increase was found in the right hemisphere for both postadaptation saccadic and discrimination tasks. For the latter, GBA also increased in the left hemisphere. We conclude that oculomotor plasticity involves GBA modulation within an extended neural network which persists after SA, suggesting a possible role of gamma oscillations in the coupling between SA and attention.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;There is now converging evidence that others’ actions are represented in the motor system. However, social cognition requires us to represent not only the actions but also the interactions of others. To do so, it is imperative that the motor system can represent multiple observed actions. The current fMRI study investigated whether this is possible by measuring brain activity from 29 participants while they observed 2 right hands performing sign language gestures. Three key results were obtained. First, brain activity in the premotor and parietal motor cortex was stronger when 2 hands performed 2 different gestures than when 1 hand performed a single gesture. Second, both individual observed gestures could be decoded from brain activity in the same 2 regions. Third, observing 2 different gestures compared with 2 identical gestures activated brain areas related to motor conflict, and this activity was correlated with parietal motor activity. Together, these results show that the motor system is able to represent multiple observed actions, and as such reveal a potential mechanism by which third-party social encounters could be processed in the brain.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent advances in epigenomics have made it possible to map genome-wide regulatory regions using empirical methods. Subsequent comparative epigenomic studies have revealed that regulatory regions diverge rapidly between genome of different species, and that the divergence is more pronounced in enhancers than in promoters. To understand genomic changes underlying these patterns, we investigated if we can identify specific sequence fragments that are over-enriched in regulatory regions, thus potentially contributing to regulatory functions of such regions. Here we report numerous sequence fragments that are statistically over-enriched in enhancers and promoters of different mammals (which we refer to as ‘sequence determinants’). Interestingly, the degree of statistical enrichment, which presumably is associated with the degree of regulatory impacts of the specific sequence determinant, was significantly higher for promoter sequence determinants than enhancer sequence determinants. We further used a machine learning method to construct prediction models using sequence determinants. Remarkably, prediction models constructed from one species could be used to predict regulatory regions of other species with high accuracy. This observation indicates that even though the precise locations of regulatory regions diverge rapidly during evolution, the functional potential of sequence determinants underlying regulatory sequences may be conserved between species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Q4TbfATi4e4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In bacterial cells, gene expression, metabolism, and growth are highly interdependent and tightly coordinated. As a result, stochastic fluctuations in expression levels and instantaneous growth rate show intricate cross-correlations. These correlations are shaped by feedback loops, trade-offs and constraints acting at the cellular level; therefore a quantitative understanding requires an integrated approach. To that end, we here present a mathematical model describing a cell that contains multiple proteins that are each expressed stochastically and jointly limit the growth rate. Conversely, metabolism and growth affect protein synthesis and dilution. Thus, expression noise originating in one gene propagates to metabolism, growth, and the expression of all other genes. Nevertheless, under a small-noise approximation many statistical quantities can be calculated analytically. We identify several routes of noise propagation, illustrate their origins and scaling, and establish important connections between noise propagation and the field of metabolic control analysis. We then present a many-protein model containing &amp;gt;1000 proteins parameterized by previously measured abundance data and demonstrate that the predicted cross-correlations between gene expression and growth rate are in broad agreement with published measurements.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BQy09pr4TN8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Cocaine Exposure Modulates Perineuronal Nets and Synaptic Excitability of Fast-Spiking Interneurons in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0221-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;We previously reported that perineuronal nets (PNNs) are required for cocaine-associated memories. Perineuronal nets are extracellular matrix that primarily surrounds parvalbumin (PV)-containing, GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Here we measured the impact of acute (1 d) or repeated (5 d) cocaine exposure on PNNs and PV cells within the prelimbic and infralimbic regions of the mPFC. Adult rats were exposed to 1 or 5 d of cocaine and stained for PNNs (using &lt;i&gt;Wisteria floribunda&lt;/i&gt; agglutinin) and PV intensity 2 or 24 h later. In the prelimbic and infralimbic PFC, PNN staining intensity decreased 2 h after 1 d of cocaine exposure but increased after 5 d of cocaine exposure. Cocaine also produced changes in PV intensity, which generally lagged behind that of PNNs. In the prelimbic PFC, both 1 and 5 d of cocaine exposure increased GAD65/67 puncta near PNN-surrounded PV cells, with an increase in the GAD65/67-to-VGluT1 puncta ratio after 5 d of cocaine exposure. In the prelimbic PFC, slice electrophysiology studies in FSIs surrounded by PNNs revealed that both 1 and 5 d of cocaine exposure reduced the number of action potentials 2 h later. Synaptic changes demonstrated that 5 d of cocaine exposure increased the inhibition of FSIs, potentially reducing the inhibition of pyramidal neurons and contributing to their hyperexcitability during relapse behavior. These early and rapid responses to cocaine may alter the network stability of PV FSIs that partially mediate the persistent and chronic nature of drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A framework for the comparison of different EEG acquisition solutions. (arXiv:1810.02107v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02107</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this work is to propose a framework for the benchmarking of
EEG amplifiers, headsets, and electrodes providing objective recommendation for
a given application. The framework covers: data collection paradigm, data
analysis, and statistical framework. To illustrate, data was collected from 12
different devices totaling up to 6 subjects per device. Two data acquisition
protocols were implemented: a resting-state protocol eyes-open (EO) and
eyes-closed (EC), and an Auditory Evoked Potential (AEP) protocol.
Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on alpha band (EO/EC) and Event Related Potential
(ERP) were extracted as objective quantification of physiologically meaningful
information. Then, visual representation, univariate statistical analysis, and
multivariate model were performed to increase results interpretability.
Objective criteria show that the spectral SNR in alpha does not provide much
discrimination between systems, suggesting that the acquisition quality might
not be of primary importance for spectral and specifically alpha-based
applications. On the contrary, AEP SNR proved much more variable stressing the
importance of the acquisition setting for ERP experiments. The multivariate
analysis identified some individuals and some systems as independent
statistically significant contributors to the SNR. It highlights the importance
of inter-individual differences in neurophysiological experiments (sample size)
and suggests some device might objectively be superior to others when it comes
to ERP recordings. However, the illustration of the proposed benchmarking
framework suffers from severe limitations including small sample size and sound
card jitter in the auditory stimulations. While these limitations hinders a
definite ranking of the evaluated hardware, we believe the proposed
benchmarking framework to be a modest yet valuable contribution to the field.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01933</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We consider a one-dimensional directional array of diffusively coupled
oscillators. They are perturbed by the injection of a small additive noise,
typically orders of magnitude smaller than the oscillation amplitude, and the
system is studied in a region of the parameters that would yield deterministic
synchronization. Non normal directed couplings seed a coherent amplification of
the perturbation: this latter manifests as a modulation, transversal to the
limit cycle, which gains in potency node after node. If the lattice extends
long enough, the initial synchrony gets eventually lost and the system moves
toward a non trivial attractor, which can be analytically characterized as an
asymptotic splay state. The noise assisted instability, ultimately vehiculated
and amplified by the non normal nature of the imposed couplings, eventually
destabilizes also this second attractor. This phenomenon yields spatiotemporal
patterns, which cannot be anticipated by a conventional linear stability
analysis.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40045</link>
	<content:encoded>DLL1 and DLL4 are Notch ligands with high structural similarity but context-dependent functional differences. Here, we analyze their functional divergence using cellular co-culture assays, biochemical studies, and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments. DLL1 and DLL4 activate NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 differently in cell-based assays and this discriminating potential lies in the region between the N-terminus and EGF repeat three. Mice expressing chimeric ligands indicate that the ectodomains dictate ligand function during somitogenesis, and that during myogenesis even regions C-terminal to EGF3 are interchangeable. Substitution of NOTCH1-interface residues in the MNNL and DSL domains of DLL1 with the corresponding amino acids of DLL4, however, does not disrupt DLL1 function &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Collectively, our data show that DLL4 preferentially activates NOTCH1 over NOTCH2, whereas DLL1 is equally effective in activating NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, establishing that the ectodomains dictate selective ligand function &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and that features outside the known binding interface contribute to their differences.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>IS&lt;i&gt;607&lt;/i&gt;-family transposons are unusual because they do not have terminal inverted repeats or generate target site duplications. They encode two protein-coding genes, but only &lt;i&gt;tnpA&lt;/i&gt; is required for transposition. Our X-ray structures confirm that TnpA is a member of the serine recombinase (SR) family, but the chemically-inactive quaternary structure of the dimer, along with the N-terminal location of the DNA binding domain, are different from other SRs. TnpA dimers from IS&lt;i&gt;1535&lt;/i&gt; cooperatively associate with multiple subterminal repeats, which together with additional nonspecific binding, form a nucleoprotein filament on one transposon end that efficiently captures a second unbound end to generate the paired-end complex (PEC). Formation of the PEC does not require a change in the dimeric structure of the catalytic domain, but remodeling of the C-terminal α-helical region is involved. We posit that the PEC recruits a chemically-active conformer of TnpA to the transposon end to initiate DNA chemistry.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38935</link>
	<content:encoded>Growing evidence suggests that sensory neurons achieve optimal encoding by matching their tuning properties to the natural stimulus statistics. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that feedback pathways from higher brain areas mediate optimized encoding of naturalistic stimuli via temporal whitening in the weakly electric fish &lt;i&gt;Apteronotus leptorhynchus&lt;/i&gt;. While one source of direct feedback uniformly enhances neural responses, a separate source of indirect feedback selectively attenuates responses to low frequencies, thus creating a high-pass neural tuning curve that opposes the decaying spectral power of natural stimuli. Additionally, we recorded from two populations of higher brain neurons responsible for the direct and indirect descending inputs. While one population displayed broadband tuning, the other displayed high-pass tuning and thus performed temporal whitening. Hence, our results demonstrate a novel function for descending input in optimizing neural responses to sensory input through temporal whitening that is likely to be conserved across systems and species.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Speech has long been recognized as ‘special’. Here, we suggest that one of the reasons for speech being special is that our auditory system has evolved to encode it in an efficient, optimal way. The theory of efficient neural coding argues that our perceptual systems have evolved to encode environmental stimuli in the most efficient way. Mathematically, this can be achieved if the optimally efficient codes match the statistics of the signals they represent. Experimental evidence suggests that the auditory code is optimal in this mathematical sense: statistical properties of speech closely match response properties of the cochlea, the auditory nerve, and the auditory cortex.</content:encoded>

Many pathological conditions, such as seizures, stroke, and spreading depression, are associated with substantial changes in ion concentrations in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain. An understanding of the mechanisms that govern ECS concentration dynamics may be a prerequisite for understanding such pathologies. To estimate the transport of ions due to electrodiffusive effects, one must keep track of both the ion concentrations and the electric potential simultaneously in the relevant regions of the brain. Although this is currently unfeasible experimentally, it is in principle achievable with computational models based on biophysical principles and constraints. Previous computational models of extracellular ion-concentration dynamics have required extensive computing power, and therefore have been limited to either phenomena on very small spatiotemporal scales (micrometers and milliseconds), or simplified and idealized 1-dimensional (1-D) transport processes on a larger scale. Here, we present the 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) framework, tailored to explore electrodiffusive effects on large spatiotemporal scales. By assuming electroneutrality, the KNP-framework circumvents charge-relaxation processes on the spatiotemporal scales of nanometers and nanoseconds, and makes it feasible to run simulations on the spatiotemporal scales of millimeters and seconds on a standard desktop computer. In the present work, we use the 3-D KNP framework to simulate the dynamics of ion concentrations and the electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell. In addition to elucidating the single neuron contribution to electrodiffusive effects in the ECS, the simulation demonstrates the efficiency of the 3-D KNP framework. We envision that future applications of the framework to more complex and biologically realistic systems will be useful in exploring pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/m141eIlY3sI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Prediction of gene regulatory enhancers across species reveals evolutionarily conserved sequence properties</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/b9OpfD0Vd78/article</link>

Genomic regions with gene regulatory enhancer activity turnover rapidly across mammals. In contrast, gene expression patterns and transcription factor binding preferences are largely conserved between mammalian species. Based on this conservation, we hypothesized that enhancers active in different mammals would exhibit conserved sequence patterns in spite of their different genomic locations. To investigate this hypothesis, we evaluated the extent to which sequence patterns that are predictive of enhancers in one species are predictive of enhancers in other mammalian species by training and testing two types of machine learning models. We trained support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers to distinguish enhancers defined by histone marks from the genomic background based on DNA sequence patterns in human, macaque, mouse, dog, cow, and opossum. The classifiers accurately identified many adult liver, developing limb, and developing brain enhancers, and the CNNs outperformed the SVMs. Furthermore, classifiers trained in one species and tested in another performed nearly as well as classifiers trained and tested on the same species. We observed similar cross-species conservation when applying the models to human and mouse enhancers validated in transgenic assays. This indicates that many short sequence patterns predictive of enhancers are largely conserved. The sequence patterns most predictive of enhancers in each species matched the binding motifs for a common set of TFs enriched for expression in relevant tissues, supporting the biological relevance of the learned features. Thus, despite the rapid change of active enhancer locations between mammals, cross-species enhancer prediction is often possible. Our results suggest that short sequence patterns encoding enhancer activity have been maintained across more than 180 million years of mammalian evolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/b9OpfD0Vd78&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Role of the K+-Cl- co-transporter KCC2a isoform in mammalian respiration at birth</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0264-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In central respiratory circuitry, synaptic excitation is responsible for synchronizing neuronal activity in the different respiratory rhythm phases, whereas chloride-mediated inhibition is important for shaping the respiratory pattern itself. The potassium chloride co-transporter KCC2, which serves to maintain low intraneuronal Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; concentration and thus render chloride-mediated synaptic signaling inhibitory, exists in two isoforms, KCC2a and KCC2b. KCC2 is essential for functional breathing motor control at birth, but the specific contribution of the KCC2a isoform remains unknown. Here, to address this issue we investigated the respiratory phenotype of mice deficient for KCC2a. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; plethysmographic recordings revealed that KCC2a-deficient pups at P0 transiently express an abnormally low breathing rate and a high occurrence of apneas. Immunostainings confirmed that KCC2a is normally expressed in the brainstem neuronal groups involved in breathing (preBötzinger complex, parafacial respiratory group, hypoglossus nucleus), and is absent in these regions in the KCC2a&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mutant. However, in variously reduced &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; medullary preparations, spontaneous rhythmic respiratory activity is similar to that expressed in wild-type preparations, as is hypoglossal motor output, and no respiratory pauses are detected, suggesting that the rhythm-generating networks are not intrinsically affected in mutants at P0. In contrast, inhibitory neuromodulatory influences exerted by the pons on respiratory rhythmogenesis are stronger in the mutant, thereby explaining the breathing anomalies observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, our results indicate that the KCC2a isoform is important for establishing proper breathing behavior at the time of birth, but by acting at site(s) that are extrinsic to the central respiratory networks themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The expression of the neuronal specific potassium chloride co-transporter KCC2 is necessary for the generation of respiratory activity at birth, but the specific role of the KCC2a isoform in this process remains unknown. By examining &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; the breathing motor output of newborn KCC2a&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice we observed a lower breathing frequency and a high occurrence of apneas at birth. These anomalies, expressed mainly at P0 (day of birth), do not arise from changes in the brainstem respiratory rhythm-generating circuits, but appear to result from abnormally strong inhibitory pontine neuromodulatory influences that target these networks. Our results provide evidence for a transient but important role of the KCC2a isoform in the proper development of the central respiratory command.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Projection patterns of corticofugal neurons associated with vibrissa movement</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0190-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Rodents actively whisk their vibrissae, which, when they come in contact with surrounding objects, enables rodents to gather spatial information about the environment. Cortical motor command of whisking is crucial for the control of vibrissa movement. Using awake and head-fixed rats, we investigated the correlations between axonal projection patterns and firing properties in identified layer 5 neurons in the motor cortex, which are associated with vibrissa movement. We found that cortical neurons that sent axons to the brainstem fired preferentially during large-amplitude vibrissae movements and that corticocallosal neurons exhibited a high firing rate during small vibrissa movements or during a quiet state. The differences between these two corticofugal circuits may be related to the mechanisms of motor-associated information processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The contents of cortical motor commands and the pathways that they take are two important questions in neuroscience. Previous studies in rodents reported that motor cortex neurons exhibit variable activity patterns during whisking behavior. We combined physiological and morphological analyses of single neurons to provide more detail for understanding the neural circuit related to motor control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Functional categories of visuomotor neurons in macaque frontal eye field</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0131-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Frontal eye field (FEF) in macaque monkeys contributes to visual attention, visual-motor transformations and production of eye movements. Traditionally, neurons in FEF have been classified by the magnitude of increased discharge rates following visual stimulus presentation, during a waiting period, and associated with eye movement production. However, considerable heterogeneity remains within the traditional visual, visuomovement and movement categories. Cluster analysis is a data-driven method of identifying self-segregating groups within a dataset. Because many cluster analysis techniques exist and outcomes vary with analysis assumptions, consensus clustering aggregates over multiple analyses, identifying robust groups. To describe more comprehensively the neuronal composition of FEF, we applied a consensus clustering technique for unsupervised categorization of patterns of spike rate modulation measured during a memory-guided saccade task. We report ten functional categories, expanding on the traditional three. Categories were distinguished by latency, magnitude, and sign of visual response, presence of sustained activity, and dynamics, magnitude and sign of saccade-related modulation. Consensus clustering can include other metrics and can be applied to datasets from other brain regions to provide better information guiding microcircuit models of cortical function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The contribution of a brain region cannot be understood without knowing the diversity, arrangement, and circuitry of constituent neurons. Traditional descriptions of frontal eye field include visual, visuo-saccadic, and saccadic categories. Here, we employ a novel consensus clustering method to identify more reliably functional categories in neural data. While confirming the traditional categories, consensus clustering distinguishes additional, previously unappreciated diversity in neural activity patterns. Such information is necessary to formulate correct microcircuit models of cortical function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

of individual neurons and how they give rise to network dynamics when
interconnected. Historically, researchers have resorted to graph theory,
statistics, and statistical mechanics to describe the spatiotemporal structure
of such network dynamics. Our novel approach employs tools from algebraic
topology to characterize the global properties of network structure and
dynamics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose a method based on persistent homology to automatically classify
network dynamics using topological features of spaces built from various
spike-train distances. We investigate the efficacy of our method by simulating
activity in three small artificial neural networks with different sets of
parameters, giving rise to dynamics that can be classified into four regimes.
We then compute three measures of spike train similarity and use persistent
homology to extract topological features that are fundamentally different from
those used in traditional methods. Our results show that a machine learning
classifier trained on these features can accurately predict the regime of the
network it was trained on and also generalize to other networks that were not
presented during training. Moreover, we demonstrate that using features
extracted from multiple spike-train distances systematically improves the
performance of our method.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01485</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that can affect a person's
movement, speech, dexterity, and cognition. Physicians primarily diagnose
Parkinson's disease by performing a clinical assessment of symptoms. However,
misdiagnoses are common. One factor that contributes to misdiagnoses is that
the symptoms of Parkinson's disease may not be prominent at the time the
clinical assessment is performed. Here, we present a machine-learning approach
towards distinguishing between healthy people and people with Parkinson's
disease using long-term data collected from smartphone-based tests, including
walking, voice, tapping and memory tests. We demonstrate that the presented
approach leads to significant performance improvements over existing methods
(area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.85) in data from a
cohort of 1853 participants. Our results confirm that smartphone data collected
over extended periods of time could in the future potentially be used as
additional evidence for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.

	<content:encoded>A major aspect of the regulatory function of mast cells appears to be their role as intermediaries between the nervous and immune systems. Mast cells are activated by neurotransmitters allowing neural control of innate and adaptive immunity. Conversely, mast cells secrete mediators including neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors that directly influence nerves, causing acute activation and/or long-lasting changes in excitability and phenotype. While some basic mechanisms underlying mast cell–nerve communication are well-established, the full extent to which this relationship influences health and disease is unclear.</content:encoded>

Biologists and environmental scientists now routinely solve computational problems that were unimaginable a generation ago. Examples include processing geospatial data, analyzing -omics data, and running large-scale simulations. Conventional desktop computing cannot handle these tasks when they are large, and high-performance computing is not always available nor the most appropriate solution for all computationally intense problems. High-throughput computing (HTC) is one method for handling computationally intense research. In contrast to high-performance computing, which uses a single &quot;supercomputer,&quot; HTC can distribute tasks over many computers (e.g., idle desktop computers, dedicated servers, or cloud-based resources). HTC facilities exist at many academic and government institutes and are relatively easy to create from commodity hardware. Additionally, consortia such as Open Science Grid facilitate HTC, and commercial entities sell cloud-based solutions for researchers who lack HTC at their institution. We provide an introduction to HTC for biologists and environmental scientists. Our examples from biology and the environmental sciences use HTCondor, an open source HTC system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dyQK2MYcEVQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Suppressing Interferon-{gamma} Stimulates Microglial Responses and Repair of Microbleeds in the Diabetic Brain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8707?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microcirculatory damage is a common complication for those with vascular risk factors, such as diabetes. To resolve vascular insults, the brain's immune cells (microglia) must rapidly envelop the site of injury. Currently, it is unknown whether Type 1 diabetes, a condition associated with chronic immune system dysfunction, alters microglial responses to damage and what mechanisms are responsible. Using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon microscopy in adult male mice, we show that microglial envelopment of laser-induced cerebral microbleeds is diminished in a hyperglycemic mouse model of Type 1 diabetes, which could not be fully rescued with chronic insulin treatment. Microglia were important for vessel repair because reduced microglial accumulation in diabetic mice or near-complete depletion in healthy controls was associated with greater secondary leakage of the damaged vessel. Broadly suppressing inflammation with dexamethasone in diabetic mice but not healthy controls, significantly enhanced microglial responses to microbleeds and attenuated secondary vessel leakage. These enhancements were associated with changes in IFN- signaling because dexamethasone suppressed abnormally high levels of IFN- protein levels in brain and blood serum of diabetic mice. Further, blocking IFN- in diabetic mice with neutralizing antibodies restored normal microglial chemotaxic responses and purinoceptor &lt;i&gt;P2ry12&lt;/i&gt; gene expression, as well as mitigated secondary leakage. These results suggest that abnormal IFN- signaling disrupts microglial function in the diabetic brain, and that immunotherapies targeting IFN- can stimulate microglial repair of damaged vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although Type 1 diabetes is an established risk factor for vascular complications, such as microbleeds, and is known to hinder wound healing in the body, no study has examined how diabetes impacts the brain's innate immune reparative response (involving cells called microglia) to vascular injury. Here we show that microglial responses to brain microbleeds were diminished in diabetic animals, which also exacerbated secondary leakage from damaged vessels. These impairments were related to abnormally high levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN- because reducing IFN- with immunosuppressant drugs or blocking antibodies helped restore normal microglial responses and repair of damaged vessels. These data highlight the use of IFN- modulating therapeutics to enhance vascular repair in at-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Eye-Movement Intervention Enhances Extinction via Amygdala Deactivation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8694?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Improving extinction learning is essential to optimize psychotherapy for persistent fear-related disorders. In two independent studies (both &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 24), we found that goal-directed eye movements activate a dorsal frontoparietal network and transiently deactivate the amygdala (&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17). Connectivity analyses revealed that this downregulation potentially engages a ventromedial prefrontal pathway known to be involved in cognitive regulation of emotion. Critically, when eye movements followed memory reactivation during extinction learning, it reduced spontaneous fear recovery 24 h later (&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.21). Stronger amygdala deactivation furthermore predicted a stronger reduction in subsequent fear recovery after reinstatement (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.39). In conclusion, we show that extinction learning can be improved with a noninvasive eye-movement intervention that triggers a transient suppression of the amygdala. Our finding that another task which taxes working memory leads to a similar amygdala suppression furthermore indicates that this effect is likely not specific to eye movements, which is in line with a large body of behavioral studies. This study contributes to the understanding of a widely used treatment for traumatic symptoms by providing a parsimonious account for how working-memory tasks and goal-directed eye movements can enhance extinction-based psychotherapy, namely through neural circuits (e.g., amygdala deactivation) similar to those that support cognitive control of emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Fear-related disorders represent a significant burden on individual sufferers and society. There is a high need to optimize treatment, in particular via noninvasive means. One potentially effective intervention is execution of eye movements following trauma recall. However, a neurobiological understanding of how eye movements reduce traumatic symptoms is lacking. We demonstrate that goal-directed eye-movements, like working-memory tasks, deactivate the amygdala, the core neural substrate of fear learning. Effective connectivity analyses revealed amygdala deactivation potentially engaged dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal pathways. When applied during safety learning, this deactivation predicts a reduction in later fear recovery. These findings provide a parsimonious and mechanistic account of how behavioral manipulations taxing working memory and suppressing amygdala activity can alter retention of emotional memories.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Not All Predictions Are Equal: &quot;What&quot; and &quot;When&quot; Predictions Modulate Activity in Auditory Cortex through Different Mechanisms</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8680?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using predictions based on environmental regularities is fundamental for adaptive behavior. While it is widely accepted that predictions across different stimulus attributes (e.g., time and content) facilitate sensory processing, it is unknown whether predictions across these attributes rely on the same neural mechanism. Here, to elucidate the neural mechanisms of predictions, we combine invasive electrophysiological recordings (human electrocorticography in 4 females and 2 males) with computational modeling while manipulating predictions about content (&quot;what&quot;) and time (&quot;when&quot;). We found that &quot;when&quot; predictions increased evoked activity over motor and prefrontal regions both at early (~180 ms) and late (430–450 ms) latencies. &quot;What&quot; predictability, however, increased evoked activity only over prefrontal areas late in time (420–460 ms). Beyond these dissociable influences, we found that &quot;what&quot; and &quot;when&quot; predictability interactively modulated the amplitude of early (165 ms) evoked responses in the superior temporal gyrus. We modeled the observed neural responses using biophysically realistic neural mass models, to better understand whether &quot;what&quot; and &quot;when&quot; predictions tap into similar or different neurophysiological mechanisms. Our modeling results suggest that &quot;what&quot; and &quot;when&quot; predictability rely on complementary neural processes: &quot;what&quot; predictions increased short-term plasticity in auditory areas, whereas &quot;when&quot; predictability increased synaptic gain in motor areas. Thus, content and temporal predictions engage complementary neural mechanisms in different regions, suggesting domain-specific prediction signaling along the cortical hierarchy. Encoding predictions through different mechanisms may endow the brain with the flexibility to efficiently signal different sources of predictions, weight them by their reliability, and allow for their encoding without mutual interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Predictions of different stimulus features facilitate sensory processing. However, it is unclear whether predictions of different attributes rely on similar or different neural mechanisms. By combining invasive electrophysiological recordings of cortical activity with experimental manipulations of participants' predictions about content and time of acoustic events, we found that the two types of predictions had dissociable influences on cortical activity, both in terms of the regions involved and the timing of the observed effects. Further, our biophysical modeling analysis suggests that predictability of content and time rely on complementary neural processes: short-term plasticity in auditory areas and synaptic gain in motor areas, respectively. This suggests that predictions of different features are encoded with complementary neural mechanisms in different brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Characterizing the Short-Term Habituation of Event-Related Evoked Potentials</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0014-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Fast-rising sensory events evoke a series of functionally heterogeneous event-related potentials (ERPs). Stimulus repetition at 1 Hz induces a strong habituation of the largest ERP responses, the vertex waves (VWs). VWs are elicited by stimuli regardless of their modality, provided that they are salient and behaviorally relevant. In contrast, the effect of stimulus repetition on the earlier sensory components of ERPs has been less explored, and the few existing results are inconsistent. To characterize how the different ERP waves habituate over time, we recorded the responses elicited by 60 identical somatosensory stimuli (activating either non-nociceptive Aβ or nociceptive A afferents), delivered at 1 Hz to healthy human participants. We show that the well-described spatiotemporal sequence of lateralized and vertex ERP components elicited by the first stimulus of the series is largely preserved in the smaller-amplitude, habituated response elicited by the last stimuli of the series. We also found that the earlier lateralized sensory wave habituates across the 60 trials following the same decay function of the VWs: this decay function is characterized by a large drop at the first stimulus repetition followed by smaller decreases at subsequent repetitions. Interestingly, the same decay functions described the habituation of ERPs elicited by repeated non-nociceptive and nociceptive stimuli. This study provides a neurophysiological characterization of the effect of prolonged and repeated stimulation on the main components of somatosensory ERPs. It also demonstrates that both lateralized waves and VWs are obligatory components of ERPs elicited by non-nociceptive and nociceptive stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Note on the Estimation of Embedded Hermitian Gaussian Graphical Models for MEEG Source Activity and Connectivity Analysis in the Frequency Domain. Part I: Single Frequency Component and Subject. (arXiv:1810.01174v1 [stat.ME])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01174</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This technical note presents an inference framework for hierarchically
conditioned (embedded) Hermitian Gaussian Graphical Models (GGM). Our
methodology, although extendible to several GGMs applications, is mainly
centered on the specific neuroscientific context encompassing the estimation of
brain sources activity and connectivity from Magnetoencephalography or
Electroencephalography (MEEG) signals. This will be conceived in a series of
papers with two parts. Part I: Analysis of a single frequency component from a
single subject. Part II: Analysis of the Cross-Spectra for multiple subjects in
a population. The strategy is based on Maximum Posterior Analysis, via the
Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, of the Hermitian GGMs Parameters and
Hyperparameters. The Hyperparameters set, which comprises MEEG signal noise
covariance and source precision (connectivity) matrices of the MEEG generative
model, is informed with Priors of special interest in the field and whose
implementation in GGM estimation still poses a technical challenge. The theory
presented here encapsulates two essential contributions. First: The formulation
of a target function for the connectivity estimator that resembles an effective
GGM of source activity, which is merged to the maximization step of the
iterative EM strategy. Second: A new procedure for the estimation of the source
activity effective GGM. These theoretical contributions provide for an explicit
and highly optimal connectivity estimation procedure.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00816</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep and anesthesia have contrasting effects on memory, yet at the
microscopic scale they appear to produce similar neural network dynamics
consisting of slow waves associated with alternating transients of high
activity (UP states) and silence (DOWN states). Here, UP and DOWN state
dynamics are analyzed in cortical recordings from human, monkey, and rat and
found to be robustly different between deep sleep and anesthesia. We found that
the temporal statistics of UP and DOWN states is robustly different in natural
slow-wave sleep compared to the slow-waves of anesthesia. Computational models
predict that an interplay between noise and spike-frequency adaptation can
yield a transition from sleep-like to anesthesia-like slow-wave dynamics. These
predictions were confirmed by pharmacological manipulations in vitro, inducing
a switch between the two types of slow-waves. The results show that the strong
adaptation found in anesthesia, but not in sleep, can produce a different type
of slow oscillations, less sensitive to external inputs, that may prevent
memory formation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Caulking the Leakage Effect in MEEG Source Connectivity Analysis. (arXiv:1810.00786v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00786</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Simplistic estimation of neural connectivity in MEEG sensor space is
impossible due to volume conduction. The only viable alternative is to carry
out connectivity estimation in source space. Among the neuroscience community
this is claimed to be impossible or misleading due to Leakage: linear mixing of
the reconstructed sources. To address this problematic we propose a novel
solution method that caulks the Leakage in MEEG source activity and
connectivity estimates: BC-VARETA. It is based on a joint estimation of source
activity and connectivity in the frequency domain representation of MEEG time
series. To achieve this, we go beyond current methods that assume a fixed
gaussian graphical model for source connectivity. In contrast we estimate this
graphical model in a Bayesian framework by placing priors on it, which allows
for highly optimized computations of the connectivity, via a new procedure
based on the local quadratic approximation under quite general prior models. A
further contribution of this paper is the rigorous definition of leakage via
the Spatial Dispersion Measure and Earth Movers Distance based on the geodesic
distances over the cortical manifold. Both measures are extended for the first
time to quantify Connectivity Leakage by defining them on the cartesian product
of cortical manifolds. Using these measures, we show that BC-VARETA outperforms
most state of the art inverse solvers by several orders of magnitude.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Stable Brain-Machine Interfaces. (arXiv:1810.00045v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00045</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) have recently emerged as a clinically viable
option to restore voluntary movements after paralysis. These devices are based
on the ability to extract information about movement intent from neural signals
recorded using multi-electrode arrays chronically implanted in the motor
cortices of the brain. However, the inherent loss and turnover of recorded
neurons requires repeated recalibrations of the interface, which can
potentially alter the day-to-day user experience. The resulting need for
continued user adaptation interferes with the natural, subconscious use of the
BMI. Here, we introduce a new computational approach that decodes movement
intent from a low-dimensional latent representation of the neural data. We
implement various domain adaptation methods to stabilize the interface over
significantly long times. This includes Canonical Correlation Analysis used to
align the latent variables across days; this method requires prior
point-to-point correspondence of the time series across domains. Alternatively,
we match the empirical probability distributions of the latent variables across
days through the minimization of their Kullback-Leibler divergence. These two
methods provide a significant and comparable improvement in the performance of
the interface. However, implementation of an Adversarial Domain Adaptation
Network trained to match the empirical probability distribution of the
residuals of the reconstructed neural signals outperforms the two methods based
on latent variables, while requiring remarkably few data points to solve the
domain adaptation problem.

Here we present an open-source R package ‘meaRtools’ that provides a platform for analyzing neuronal networks recorded on Microelectrode Arrays (MEAs). Cultured neuronal networks monitored with MEAs are now being widely used to characterize &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models of neurological disorders and to evaluate pharmaceutical compounds. meaRtools provides core algorithms for MEA spike train analysis, feature extraction, statistical analysis and plotting of multiple MEA recordings with multiple genotypes and treatments. meaRtools functionality covers novel solutions for spike train analysis, including algorithms to assess electrode cross-correlation using the spike train tiling coefficient (STTC), mutual information, synchronized bursts and entropy within cultured wells. Also integrated is a solution to account for bursts variability originating from mixed-cell neuronal cultures. The package provides a statistical platform built specifically for MEA data that can combine multiple MEA recordings and compare extracted features between different genetic models or treatments. We demonstrate the utilization of meaRtools to successfully identify epilepsy-like phenotypes in neuronal networks from &lt;i&gt;Celf4&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice. The package is freely available under the GPL license (GPL&amp;gt; = 3) and is updated frequently on the CRAN web-server repository. The package, along with full documentation can be downloaded from: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meaRtools/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pDffSPfFxsQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Handel, Yan Li, Brian McKay, Kasia A. Pawelek, Veronika Zarnitsyna, Rustom Antia&lt;/p&gt;

Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases. An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used. Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. We illustrate the concept of using data and models to inform inoculum dose determination for vaccines, wby fitting a mathematical model to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We use the model to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity and to explore how such a framework might be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose. We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. Our findings illustrate that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, our proposed framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tR55K82RYTM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Collective cell migration in cohesive units is vital for tissue morphogenesis, wound repair, and immune response. While the fundamental driving forces for collective cell motion stem from contractile and protrusive activities of individual cells, it remains unknown how their balance is optimized to maintain tissue cohesiveness and the fluidity for motion. Here we present a cell-based computational model for collective cell migration during wound healing that incorporates mechanochemical coupling of cell motion and adhesion kinetics with stochastic transformation of active motility forces. We show that a balance of protrusive motility and actomyosin contractility is optimized for accelerating the rate of wound repair, which is robust to variations in cell and substrate mechanical properties. This balance underlies rapid collective cell motion during wound healing, resulting from a tradeoff between tension mediated collective cell guidance and active stress relaxation in the tissue.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jnAyESMj4zg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Many research questions in visual perception involve determining whether stimulus properties are represented and processed independently. In visual neuroscience, there is great interest in determining whether important object dimensions are represented independently in the brain. For example, theories of face recognition have proposed either completely or partially independent processing of identity and emotional expression. Unfortunately, most previous research has only vaguely defined what is meant by “independence,” which hinders its precise quantification and testing. This article develops a new quantitative framework that links signal detection theory from psychophysics and encoding models from computational neuroscience, focusing on a special form of independence defined in the psychophysics literature: perceptual separability. The new theory allowed us, for the first time, to precisely define separability of neural representations and to theoretically link behavioral and brain measures of separability. The framework formally specifies the relation between these different levels of perceptual and brain representation, providing the tools for a truly integrative research approach. In particular, the theory identifies exactly what valid inferences can be made about independent encoding of stimulus dimensions from the results of multivariate analyses of neuroimaging data and psychophysical studies. In addition, commonly used operational tests of independence are re-interpreted within this new theoretical framework, providing insights on their correct use and interpretation. Finally, we apply this new framework to the study of separability of brain representations of face identity and emotional expression (neutral/sad) in a human fMRI study with male and female participants.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qnPjy-Per_4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Use of an individual-based model of pneumococcal carriage for planning a randomized trial of a whole-cell vaccine</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/c40RPkVFr3Q/article</link>

For encapsulated bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, asymptomatic carriage is more common and longer in duration than disease, and hence is often a more convenient endpoint for clinical trials of vaccines against these bacteria. However, using a carriage endpoint entails specific challenges. Carriage is almost always measured as prevalence, whereas the vaccine may act by reducing incidence or duration. Thus, to determine sample size requirements, its impact on prevalence must first be estimated. The relationship between incidence and prevalence (or duration and prevalence) is convex, saturating at 100% prevalence. For this reason, the proportional effect of a vaccine on prevalence is typically less than its proportional effect on incidence or duration. This relationship is further complicated in the presence of multiple pathogen strains. In addition, host immunity to carriage accumulates rapidly with frequent exposures in early years of life, creating potentially complex interactions with the vaccine’s effect. We conducted a simulation study to predict the impact of an inactivated whole cell pneumococcal vaccine—believed to reduce carriage duration—on carriage prevalence in different age groups and trial settings. We used an individual-based model of pneumococcal carriage that incorporates relevant immunological processes, both vaccine-induced and naturally acquired. Our simulations showed that for a wide range of vaccine efficacies, sampling time and age at vaccination are important determinants of sample size. There is a window of favorable sampling times during which the required sample size is relatively low, and this window is prolonged with a younger age at vaccination, and in a trial setting with lower transmission intensity. These results illustrate the ability of simulation studies to inform the planning of vaccine trials with carriage endpoints, and the methods we present here can be applied to trials evaluating other pneumococcal vaccine candidates or comparing alternative dosing schedules for the existing conjugate vaccines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c40RPkVFr3Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Cocaine Exposure Modulates Perineuronal Nets and Synaptic Excitability of Fast-spiking Interneurons in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0221-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;We previously reported that perineuronal nets (PNNs) are required for cocaine-associated memories. Perineuronal nets are extracellular matrix that primarily surrounds parvalbumin (PV)-containing, GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Here we measured the impact of acute (1 day) or repeated (5 days) cocaine exposure on PNNs and PV cells within the prelimbic and infralimbic regions of the mPFC. Adult rats were exposed to 1 day or 5 days of cocaine and stained for PNNs (using &lt;i&gt;Wisteria floribunda&lt;/i&gt; agglutinin, WFA) and PV intensity 2 h or 24 h later. In the prelimbic and infralimbic PFC, PNN staining intensity decreased 2 hr after 1 day of cocaine but increased after 5 days of cocaine. Cocaine also produced changes in PV intensity, which generally lagged behind that of PNNs. In the prelimbic PFC, both 1 and 5 days of cocaine increased GAD65/67 puncta near PNN-surrounded PV cells, with an increase in the ratio of GAD65/67:VGluT1 puncta after 5 days of cocaine exposure. In the prelimbic PFC, slice electrophysiology studies in FSIs surrounded by PNNs revealed that both 1 and 5 days of cocaine reduced the number of action potentials 2 h later. Synaptic changes demonstrated that 5 d cocaine increased inhibition of FSIs, potentially reducing the inhibition of pyramidal neurons and contributing to their hyperexcitability during relapse behavior. These early and rapid responses to cocaine may alter network stability of PV FSIs that partially mediate the persistent and chronic nature of drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Parvalbumin-containing, FSIs control the inhibitory:excitatory balance in the adult CNS, and the majority of these are surrounded by PNNs. The mPFC is critical to relapse in cocaine addiction, yet few studies have focused on the impact of cocaine exposure on PV interneurons that profoundly control output of the mPFC. Our studies highlight the impact of cocaine on PV and PNN levels and intrinsic and synaptic properties of PNN-surrounded FSIs in the mPFC. These findings point to a key upstream mechanism by which FSIs may contribute to the consistently observed increase in mPFC excitatory output of pyramidal neurons that contribute to cocaine reinstatement, and they have broader implications for understanding how PNN-surrounded neurons may control aberrant learning processes involved in addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Simultaneous assessment of homonymous and heteronymous monosynaptic reflex excitability in the adult rat</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0227-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In order to successfully produce motor tasks such as locomotion, the central nervous system must coordinate contractions of antagonistic and synergistic muscles across multiple joints. This coordination is largely dependent upon the function of proprioceptive afferents, which make monosynaptic connections with homonymous motoneurons. Homonymous pathways have been well studied in both health and disease but their collateral fibres projecting to heteronymous, synergistic muscles receive relatively less attention. This is surprising given that proprioceptive afferent collaterals have significant effects on the excitability of heteronymous motoneurons, and that their synaptic terminal density is activity dependent. It is likely that the relative lack of literature is due to the lack of a preparation which allows synergistic heteronymous pathways to be assessed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here we describe a method to simultaneously evoke homonymous and heteronymous (synergistic) monosynaptic reflexes and study their modulation by descending pathways in adult rats. Through stimulation of the medial plantar nerve, we were able to produce an H reflex in the intrinsic foot muscles of the hind paw with a latency of 10.52 ± 3.8 ms. Increasing the stimulus intensity evoked a robust signal with a monosynaptic latency (11.32 ± 0.35 ms), recorded in the ipsilateral gastrocnemius. Our subsequent analyses suggest that gastrocnemius motoneurons were activated via heteronymous afferent collaterals from the medial plantar nerve. These reflexes could be evoked bilaterally and were modulated by conditioning stimuli to the cortex and reticular formation. Interestingly, cortical stimulation was equally efficient at modulating both ipsilateral and contralateral reflexes, indicating that cortical modulation of lumbar sensory afferents lacks the laterality demonstrated by studies of cortical muscle activation. This technique represents a novel, relatively simple way to assess heteronymous afferent pathways in normal motor control as well as in models of motor disorders where adaptive and maladaptive plasticity of proprioceptive afferents and descending systems affects functional outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; This study describes a method for simultaneously recording bilateral homonymous and heteronymous proprioceptive afferent reflexes in rodents. Bilateral stimulation of the medial plantar nerve produced homonymous H reflexes in intrinsic foot muscles of both hind paws as well as heteronymous monosynaptic reflexes in the gastrocnemius muscles. We used this technique to assess cortical and reticular modulation of homonymous and heteronymous reflexes. Surprisingly, cortical conditioning of reflexes revealed a lack of laterality in modulation of homonymous and heteronymous reflexes. This technique will be extremely useful for further studies of heteronymous afferent pathways in normal and dysfunctional motor states, such as spinal cord injury, stroke and cerebral palsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Idiosyncratic, retinotopic bias in face identification modulated by familiarity</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0054-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The perception of gender and age of unfamiliar faces is reported to vary idiosyncratically across retinal locations such that, for example, the same androgynous face may appear to be male at one location but female at another. Here we test spatial heterogeneity for the recognition of the &lt;i&gt;identity&lt;/i&gt; of personally familiar faces in human participants. We found idiosyncratic biases that were stable within participants and that varied more across locations for low as compared to high familiar faces. These data suggest that like face gender and age, face identity is processed, in part, by independent populations of neurons monitoring restricted spatial regions and that the recognition responses vary for the same face across these different locations. Moreover, repeated and varied social interactions appear to lead to adjustments of these independent face recognition neurons so that the same familiar face is eventually more likely to elicit the same recognition response across widely separated visual field locations. We provide a mechanistic account of this reduced retinotopic bias based on computational simulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; In this work we tested spatial heterogeneity for the recognition of personally familiar faces. We found retinotopic biases that varied more across locations for low as compared to highly familiar faces. The retinotopic biases were idiosyncratic and stable within participants. Our data suggest that, like face gender and age, face identity is processed by independent populations of neurons monitoring restricted spatial regions and that recognition may vary for the same face at these different locations. Unlike previous findings, our data and computational simulation address the effects of learning and show how increased familiarity modifies the representation of face identity in face-responsive cortical areas. This new perspective has broader implications for understanding how learning optimizes visual processes for socially salient stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

experiments where persistent activity patterns encode internal representations
of external attributes like head direction or spatial location. However, the
conditions under which the emergent bump of neural activity in such networks

internal representations encoded along continuous attractors can be updated by
an external signal. We apply these results to place cell networks to derive a
velocity-dependent non-equilibrium memory capacity.

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We have previously reported that the blockage of TrkB and TrkC signaling in primary culture of opossum neocortical cells affects neurogenesis that involves a range of processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Here, we studied whether TrkB and TrkC activity specifically affects various types of progenitor cell populations during neocortex formation in the Monodelphis opossum in vivo. We found that the inhibition of TrkB and TrkC activities affects the same proliferative cellular phenotype, but TrkC causes more pronounced changes in the rate of cell divisions. Additionally, inhibition of TrkB and TrkC does not affect apoptosis in vivo, which was found in cell culture experiments. The lack of TrkB and TrkC receptor activity caused the arrest of newly generated neurons; therefore, they could not penetrate the subplate zone. We suggest that at this time point in development, migration consists of 2 steps. During the initial step, neurons migrate and reach the base of the subplate, whereas during the next step the migration of neurons to their final position is regulated by TrkB or TrkC signaling.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hippocampal Shape Maturation in Childhood and Adolescence</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy244/5112943?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The hippocampus is a subcortical structure critical for learning and memory, and a thorough understanding of its neurodevelopment is important for studying these processes in health and disease. However, few studies have quantified the typical developmental trajectory of the structure in childhood and adolescence. This study examined the cross-sectional age-related changes and sex differences in hippocampal shape in a multisite, multistudy cohort of 1676 typically developing children (age 1–22 years) using a novel intrinsic brain mapping method based on Laplace–Beltrami embedding of surfaces. Significant age-related expansion was observed bilaterally and nonlinear growth was observed primarily in the right head and tail of the hippocampus. Sex differences were also observed bilaterally along the lateral and medial aspects of the surface, with females exhibiting relatively larger surface expansion than males. Additionally, the superior posterior lateral surface of the left hippocampus exhibited an age–sex interaction with females expanding faster than males. Shape analysis provides enhanced sensitivity to regional changes in hippocampal morphology over traditional volumetric approaches and allows for the localization of developmental effects. Our results further support evidence that hippocampal structures follow distinct maturational trajectories that may coincide with the development of learning and memory skills during critical periods of development.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The brain has separate specialized computational units to process faces and voices located in occipital and temporal cortices. However, humans seamlessly integrate signals from the faces and voices of others for optimal social interaction. How are emotional expressions, when delivered by different sensory modalities (faces and voices), integrated in the brain? In this study, we characterized the brains’ response to faces, voices, and combined face–voice information (congruent, incongruent), which varied in expression (neutral, fearful). Using a whole-brain approach, we found that only the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS) responded more to bimodal stimuli than to face or voice alone but only when the stimuli contained emotional expression. Face- and voice-selective regions of interest, extracted from independent functional localizers, similarly revealed multisensory integration in the face-selective rpSTS only; further, this was the only face-selective region that also responded significantly to voices. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that the rpSTS receives unidirectional information from the face-selective fusiform face area, and voice-selective temporal voice area, with emotional expression affecting the connection strength. Our study promotes a hierarchical model of face and voice integration, with convergence in the rpSTS, and that such integration depends on the (emotional) salience of the stimuli.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a genetic condition associated with a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric conditions that include autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While evidence suggests that clinical phenotypes represent distinct neurodevelopmental outcomes, it remains unknown whether this translates to the level of neurobiology. To fractionate the 22q11.2DS phenotype on the level of neuroanatomy, we examined differences in vertex-wise estimates of cortical volume, surface area, and cortical thickness between 1) individuals with 22q11.2DS (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 62) and neurotypical controls (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 57) and 2) 22q11.2DS individuals with ASD symptomatology (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 30) and those without (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 25). We firstly observed significant differences in surface anatomy between 22q11.2DS individuals and controls for all 3 neuroanatomical features, predominantly in parietotemporal regions, cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. We also established that 22q11.2DS individuals with ASD symptomatology were neuroanatomically distinct from 22q11.2DS individuals without ASD symptoms, particularly in brain regions that have previously been linked to ASD (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and the entorhinal cortex). Our findings indicate that different clinical 22q11.2DS phenotypes, including those with ASD symptomatology, may represent different neurobiological subgroups. The spatially distributed patterns of neuroanatomical differences associated with ASD symptomatology in 22q11.2DS may thus provide useful information for patient stratification and the prediction of clinical outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Theories of right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) function in social cognition include self–other distinction, self-inhibition, or embodied rotation, whereas the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is associated with integrating social information. However, no study has provided causal evidence for dissociable roles of the rTPJ and dmPFC in social cognition. A total of 52 healthy young adults were stratified to receive either dmPFC or rTPJ anodal high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) in a sham-controlled, double-blinded, repeated measures design. Self–other processing was assessed across implicit and explicit level 1 (line-of-sight) and level 2 (mental rotation) visual perspective taking (VPT) tasks, and self–other effects on memory. DmPFC stimulation selectively increased the influence of the allocentric perspective during egocentric perspective taking, indexed by an increase in congruency effect across explicit VPT tasks. Moreover, dmPFC stimulation removed the self-reference effect in episodic memory by increasing the recognition of other and decreasing the recognition of self-encoded words. Stimulation of the rTPJ resulted in improved inhibition of the egocentric-perspective during level 2 VPT only, indexed by a reduction of the congruency effect when taking the allocentric perspective. This research supports theories suggesting that the rTPJ facilitates embodied mental rotation of the self into an alternate perspective, whereas the dmPFC integrates social information relevant to self-directed processes.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

However, the intersulcal relationships contributing to global sulcal pattern remain unknown. This study applied a novel method for examining the geometric and topological relationships between sulci to fetal brain MRIs from 21–30 gestational weeks in CHD fetuses (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 19) and typically developing (TD) fetuses (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 17). Sulcal pattern similarity index (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;SI&lt;/span&gt;) to template fetal brain MRIs was determined for the position, area, and depth for corresponding sulcal basins and intersulcal relationships for each subject. CHD fetuses demonstrated altered global sulcal patterns in the left hemisphere compared with TD fetuses (TD [&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;SI&lt;/span&gt;, mean ± SD]: 0.822 ± 0.023, CHD: 0.795 ± 0.030, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.002). These differences were present in the earliest emerging sulci and were driven by differences in the position of corresponding sulcal basins (TD: 0.897 ± 0.024, CHD: 0.878 ± 0.019, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P =&lt;/span&gt; 0.006) and intersulcal relationships (TD: 0.876 ± 0.031, CHD: 0.857 ± 0.018, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.033). No differences in cortical gyrification index, mean curvature, or surface area were present. These data suggest our methods may be more sensitive than traditional measures for evaluating cortical developmental alterations early in gestation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Tonotopy is an essential functional organization in the mammalian auditory cortex, and its source in the primary auditory cortex (A1) is the incoming frequency-related topographical projections from the ventral division of the medial geniculate body (MGv). However, circuits that relay this functional organization to higher-order regions such as the secondary auditory field (A2) have yet to be identified. Here, we discovered a new pathway that projects directly from MGv to A2 in mice. Tonotopy was established in A2 even when primary fields including A1 were removed, which indicates that tonotopy in A2 can be established solely by thalamic input. Moreover, the structural nature of differing thalamocortical connections was consistent with the functional organization of the target regions in the auditory cortex. Retrograde tracing revealed that the region of MGv input to a local area in A2 was broader than the region of MGv input to A1. Consistent with this anatomy, two-photon calcium imaging revealed that neuronal responses in the thalamocortical recipient layer of A2 showed wider bandwidth and greater heterogeneity of the best frequency distribution than those of A1. The current study demonstrates a new thalamocortical pathway that relays frequency information to A2 on the basis of the MGv compartmentalization.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy233/5112942?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Understanding the migration of newborn neurons within the brain presents a major challenge in contemporary biology. Neuronal migration is widespread within the developing brain but is also important within the adult brain. For instance, stem cells within the ventricular–subventricular zone (V-SVZ) and the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus of the adult rodent brain produce neuroblasts that migrate to the olfactory bulb and granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, respectively, where they regulate key brain functions including innate olfactory responses, learning, and memory. Critically, our understanding of the factors mediating neuroblast migration remains limited. The transcription factor nuclear factor I X (NFIX) has previously been implicated in embryonic cortical development. Here, we employed conditional ablation of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nfix&lt;/span&gt; from the adult mouse brain and demonstrated that the removal of this gene from either neural stem and progenitor cells, or neuroblasts, within the V-SVZ culminated in neuroblast migration defects. Mechanistically, we identified aberrant neuroblast branching, due in part to increased expression of the guanylyl cyclase natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Npr2&lt;/span&gt;), as a factor contributing to abnormal migration in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nfix&lt;/span&gt;-deficient adult mice. Collectively, these data provide new insights into how neuroblast migration is regulated at a transcriptional level within the adult brain.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Reconfiguration of Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Sensory and Perceptual System in Schizophrenia</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy232/5112936?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Schizophrenia is thought as a self-disorder with dysfunctional brain connectivity. This self-disorder is often attributed to high-order cognitive impairment. Yet due to the frequent report of sensorial and perceptual deficits, it has been hypothesized that self-disorder in schizophrenia is dysfunctional communication between sensory and cognitive processes. To further verify this assumption, the present study comprehensively examined dynamic reconfigurations of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in schizophrenia at voxel level, region level, and network levels (102 patients vs. 124 controls). We found patients who show consistently increased rsFC variability in sensory and perceptual system, including visual network, sensorimotor network, attention network, and thalamus at all the three levels. However, decreased variability in high-order networks, such as default mode network and frontal–parietal network were only consistently observed at region and network levels. Taken together, these findings highlighted the rudimentary role of elevated instability of information communication in sensory and perceptual system and attenuated whole-brain integration of high-order network in schizophrenia, which provided novel neural evidence to support the hypothesis of disrupted perceptual and cognitive function in schizophrenia. The foci of effects also highlighted that targeting perceptual deficits can be regarded as the key to enhance our understanding of pathophysiology in schizophrenia and promote new treatment intervention.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Despite the absence of cortical malformations, they have intellectual and social disabilities. To search for potential etiologies for these deficits, we compared their brain's structural and white matter organization to 22 controls using structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion images were processed to calculate fractional anisotropy (FA) and perform tract reconstructions. Cortical parcellation-based network analysis and gyral topology-based FA analyses were performed. Major interhemispheric, projection and intrahemispheric tracts were manually segmented. Subjects had decreased corpus callosum volume and decreased network efficiency. While only pediatric subjects had diffuse decreases in FA predominantly affecting mid- and long-range tracts, only adult subjects had white matter volume loss associated with decreased cortical surface area. All subjects showed aberrant corticospinal tract trajectory and bilateral absence of the dorsal language network long segment. Furthermore, pediatric subjects had more tracts with decreased FA compared with controls than did adult subjects. These findings define a TUBB3 E410K neuroimaging endophenotype and lead to the hypothesis that the age-related changes are due to microscopic intrahemispheric misguided axons that are pruned during maturation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Given the important information obtained from body movements, we still know surprisingly little about the details of brain mechanisms underlying movement perception. In this fMRI study, we investigated the relations between movement features obtained from automated computational analyses of video clips and the corresponding brain activity. Our results show that low-level computational features map to specific brain areas related to early visual- and motion-sensitive regions, while mid-level computational features are related to dynamic aspects of posture encoded in occipital–temporal cortex, posterior superior temporal sulcus and superior parietal lobe. Furthermore, behavioral features obtained from subjective ratings correlated with activity in higher action observation regions. Our computational feature-based analysis suggests that the neural mechanism of movement encoding is organized in the brain not so much by semantic categories than by feature statistics of the body movements.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we studied the developmental changes in neural pathways underlying visual social engagement in the translational rhesus monkey model. Changes in functional connectivity (FC) along the ventral object and motion pathways and the dorsal attention/visuo-spatial pathways were studied longitudinally using resting-state functional MRI in infant rhesus monkeys, from birth through early weaning (3 months), given the socioemotional changes experienced during this period. Our results revealed that (1) maturation along the visual pathways proceeds in a caudo-rostral progression with primary visual areas (V1–V3) showing strong FC as early as 2 weeks of age, whereas higher-order visual and attentional areas (e.g., MT–AST, LIP–FEF) show weak FC; (2) functional changes were pathway-specific (e.g., robust FC increases detected in the most anterior aspect of the object pathway (TE–AMY), but FC remained weak in the other pathways (e.g., AST–AMY)); (3) FC matures similarly in both right and left hemispheres. Our findings suggest that visual pathways in infant macaques undergo selective remodeling during the first 3 months of life, likely regulated by early social interactions and supporting the transition to independence from the mother.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Previous studies have found common genetic factors that influence educational achievement, cognitive performance and total brain volume (i.e., brain size). Here, in a large sample of participants from the UK Biobank, we investigate the shared genetic basis between educational attainment and fine-grained cerebral cortical morphological features, and associate this genetic variation with a related aspect of cognitive ability. Importantly, we execute novel statistical methods that enable high-dimensional genetic correlation analysis, and compute high-resolution surface maps for the genetic correlations between educational attainment and vertex-wise morphological measurements. We conduct secondary analyses, using the UK Biobank verbal–numerical reasoning score, to confirm that variation in educational attainment that is genetically correlated with cortical morphology is related to differences in cognitive performance. Our analyses relate the genetic overlap between cognitive ability and cortical thickness measurements to bilateral primary motor cortex as well as predominantly left superior temporal cortex and proximal regions. These findings extend our understanding of the neurobiology that connects genetic variation to individual differences in educational attainment and cognitive performance.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy209/5112935?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Change in hippocampal function is a major factor in life span development and decline of episodic memory. Evidence indicates a long-axis specialization where anterior hippocampus is more engaged during encoding than during retrieval, and posterior more engaged during retrieval than during encoding. We tested the life span trajectory of hippocampal long-axis episodic memory-related activity and functional connectivity (FC) in 496 participants (6.8–80.8 years) encoding and retrieving associative memories. We found evidence for a long-axis encoding–retrieval specialization that declined linearly during development and aging, eventually vanishing in the older adults. This was mainly driven by age effects on retrieval, which was associated with gradually lower activity from childhood to adulthood, followed by positive age relationships until 70 years. This pattern of age effects characterized task engagement regardless of memory success or failure. Especially for retrieval, children engaged posterior hippocampus more than anterior, while anterior was relatively more activated already in teenagers. Significant intrahippocampal connectivity was found during task, which declined with age. The results suggest that hippocampal long-axis differentiation and communication during episodic memory tasks develop rapidly during childhood, are different in older compared with younger adults, and that the age effects are related to task engagement, not the successful retrieval of episodic memories specifically.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Individuals from different social groups interpret the world in different ways. This study explores the neural basis of these group differences using a paradigm that simulates natural viewing conditions. Our aim was to determine if group differences could be found in sensory regions involved in the perception of the world or were evident in higher-level regions that are important for the interpretation of sensory information. We measured brain responses from 2 groups of football supporters, while they watched a video of matches between their teams. The time-course of response was then compared between individuals supporting the same (within-group) or the different (between-group) team. We found high intersubject correlations in low-level and high-level regions of the visual brain. However, these regions of the brain did not show any group differences. Regions that showed higher correlations for individuals from the same group were found in a network of frontal and subcortical brain regions. The interplay between these regions suggests a range of cognitive processes from motor control to social cognition and reward are important in the establishment of social groups. These results suggest that group differences are primarily reflected in regions involved in the evaluation and interpretation of the sensory input.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Recent advances in Ca2+ imaging have given neuroscientists a tool to follow the activity of large numbers of individual neurons simultaneously in vivo in the brains of animals as they are presented with sensory stimulation, respond to environmental challenges, and engage in behaviors. The Ca2+ sensors used to transduce changes in cellular Ca2+ into changes in fluorescence must bind Ca2+ to produce a signal. By binding Ca2+, these sensors can act as buffers, often reducing the magnitude of a Ca2+ change severalfold, and producing a proportional slowing of the rates of change.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Millisecond variations in spiking patterns can radically alter motor behavior, suggesting that traditional rate-based theories of motor control require revision. The importance of spike timing in sensorimotor control arises from dynamic interactions between the nervous system, muscles, and the body.

	<content:encoded>The auditory modality is fundamentally a temporal sense that requires analysis of changes in sound signals on timescales ranging from microseconds to minutes. To generate a faithful representation of changes in sound intensity and frequency over time, sound offsets (disappearances) as well as sound onsets (appearances) must be encoded by the auditory system. We review here the computational significance, perceptual roles, anatomical locations, and cellular and network origins of sound-offset responses in the mammalian auditory brain.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Sensorimotor predictions are essential for adaptive behavior. In natural environments, events that demand sensorimotor predictions unfold across many timescales, and corresponding temporal predictions (either explicit or implicit) should therefore emerge in brain dynamics. Neuronal oscillations are scale-specific processes found in several frequency bands. They underlie periodicity in sensorimotor processing and can represent temporal predictions via their phase dynamics. These processes build upon endogenous neural rhythmicity and adapt in response to exogenous timing demands.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The ability to detect time intervals and temporal patterns is critical to some of the most fundamental computations the brain performs, including the ability to communicate and appraise a dynamically changing environment.

Because the time constants of many time-varying neural and synaptic properties, including short-term synaptic plasticity (STP), are also in the range of tens to hundreds of milliseconds, they are strong candidates to underlie the formation of temporally selective neurons.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Emergence of spontaneous assembly activity in developing neural networks without afferent input</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/-ItVQC45_AI/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Marcus A. Triplett, Lilach Avitan, Geoffrey J. Goodhill&lt;/p&gt;

Spontaneous activity is a fundamental characteristic of the developing nervous system. Intriguingly, it often takes the form of multiple structured assemblies of neurons. Such assemblies can form even in the absence of afferent input, for instance in the zebrafish optic tectum after bilateral enucleation early in life. While the development of neural assemblies based on structured afferent input has been theoretically well-studied, it is less clear how they could arise in systems without afferent input. Here we show that a recurrent network of binary threshold neurons with initially random weights can form neural assemblies based on a simple Hebbian learning rule. Over development the network becomes increasingly modular while being driven by initially unstructured spontaneous activity, leading to the emergence of neural assemblies. Surprisingly, the set of neurons making up each assembly then continues to evolve, despite the number of assemblies remaining roughly constant. In the mature network assembly activity builds over several timesteps before the activation of the full assembly, as recently observed in calcium-imaging experiments. Our results show that Hebbian learning is sufficient to explain the emergence of highly structured patterns of neural activity in the absence of structured input.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-ItVQC45_AI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Dynamic and Sex-Specific Changes in Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neuron Activity and Excitability in a Mouse Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0273-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Reproductive endocrine disorders are prominent comorbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in both men and women. The neural mechanisms underlying these comorbidities remain unclear, but hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons may be involved. Here, we report the first direct demonstrations of aberrant GnRH neuron function in an animal model of epilepsy. Recordings of GnRH neuron firing and excitability were made in acute mouse brain slices prepared two months after intrahippocampal injection of kainate (KA) or control saline, a well-established TLE model in which most females develop comorbid estrous cycle disruption. GnRH neurons from control females showed elevated firing and excitability on estrus compared with diestrus. By contrast, cells from KA-injected females that developed prolonged, disrupted estrous cycles (KA-long) showed the reverse pattern. Firing rates of cells from KA-injected females that maintained regular cycles (KA-regular) were not different from controls on diestrus, but were reduced on estrus. In KA-injected males, only GnRH neurons in the medial septum displayed elevated firing. In contrast to the diestrus versus estrus and sex-specific changes in firing, GnRH neuron intrinsic excitability was elevated in all KA-injected groups, indicating a role for afferent synaptic and neuromodulatory inputs in shaping overall changes in firing activity. Furthermore, KA-injected females showed cycle-stage-specific changes in circulating sex steroids on diestrus and estrus that also differed between KA-long and KA-regular groups. Together, these findings reveal that the effects of epilepsy on the neural control of reproduction are dynamic across the estrous cycle, distinct in association with comorbid estrous cycle disruption severity, and sex-specific.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0239-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes have prominent roles in central nervous system (CNS) function and disease, with subpopulations defined primarily by morphologies and molecular markers often determined in cell culture. Here, we identify an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; astrocyte subpopulation termed immediate-early astrocytes (&lt;i&gt;ieAstrocytes&lt;/i&gt;) that is defined by functional c-Fos activation during CNS disease development. An unbiased screen for CNS cells showing c-Fos activation during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), was developed by using inducible, TetTag c-Fos reporter mice that label activated cells with a temporally stable, nuclear green fluorescent protein (GFP). Four-dimensional (3D over time) c-Fos activation maps in the spinal cord were produced by combining tissue clearing (iDISCO) and confocal microscopy that identified onset and expansion of GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell populations during EAE. More than 95% of the GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells showed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity—in contrast to absent or rare labeling of neurons, microglia, and infiltrating immune cells—which constituted &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocytes&lt;/i&gt; that linearly increased in number with progression of EAE. &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt; formation was reduced by either astrocyte-specific genetic removal of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) or pharmacological inhibition by fingolimod (FTY720), an FDA-approved MS medicine that can functionally antagonize S1P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt;s thus represent a functionally defined subset of disease-linked astrocytes that are the first and predominant CNS cell population activated during EAE, and that track with disease severity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Their reduction by a disease-modifying agent supports their therapeutic relevance to MS and potentially other neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Cell cryopreservation improves reproducibility and enables flexibility in experimental design. Although conventional freezing methodologies have been used to preserve primary neurons, poor cell viability and reduced survival severely limited their utility. We screened several high-performance freezing media and found that CryoStor10 (CS10) provided superior cryoprotection to primary mouse embryonic cortical neurons compared to other commercially-available or traditional reagents, permitting the recovery of 68.8% of cells relative to a fresh dissection. We characterized developmental, morphometric, and functional indicators of neuron maturation and found that, without exception, neurons recovered from cryostorage in CS10 media faithfully recapitulate &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; neurodevelopment in-step with neurons obtained by fresh dissection. Our method establishes cryopreserved neurons as a reliable, efficient, and equivalent model to fresh neuron cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0086-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT) is caused in most cases by loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (&lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt;). Understanding the pathological processes impacting sensory-motor control represents a major challenge for clinical management of individuals affected by RTT, but the underlying molecular and neuronal modifications remain unclear. We find that symptomatic male &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; knockout (KO) mice show atypically elevated parvalbumin (PV) expression in both somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices together with excessive excitatory inputs converging onto PV-expressing interneurons (INs). In accordance, high-speed voltage-sensitive dye imaging shows reduced amplitude and spatial spread of synaptically induced neuronal depolarizations in S1 of &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Moreover, motor learning-dependent changes of PV expression and structural synaptic plasticity typically occurring on PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; INs in M1 are impaired in symptomatic &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Finally, we find similar abnormalities of PV networks plasticity in symptomatic female &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice. These results indicate that in &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice the configuration of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; INs network is shifted toward an atypical plasticity state in relevant cortical areas compatible with the sensory-motor dysfunctions characteristics of RTT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Biological data sets are typically characterized by high dimensionality and low effect sizes. A powerful method for detecting systematic differences between experimental conditions in such multivariate data sets is multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), particularly pattern classification. However, in virtually all applications, data from the classes that correspond to the conditions of interest are not homogeneous but contain subclasses. Such subclasses can for example arise from individual subjects that contribute multiple data points, or from correlations of items within classes. We show here that in multivariate data that have subclasses nested within its class structure, these subclasses introduce systematic information that improves classifiability beyond what is expected by the size of the class difference. We analytically prove that this subclass bias systematically inflates correct classification rates (CCRs) of linear classifiers depending on the number of subclasses as well as on the portion of variance induced by the subclasses. In simulations, we demonstrate that subclass bias is highest when between-class effect size is low and subclass variance high. This bias can be reduced by increasing the total number of subclasses. However, we can account for the subclass bias by using permutation tests that explicitly consider the subclass structure of the data. We illustrate our result in several experiments that recorded human EEG activity, demonstrating that parametric statistical tests as well as typical trial-wise permutation fail to determine significance of classification outcomes correctly.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tMGb6u-BxMQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Multiscale analysis of autotroph-heterotroph interactions in a high-temperature microbial community</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/9cziYmlDKfI/article</link>

Interactions among microbial community members can lead to emergent properties, such as enhanced productivity, stability, and robustness. Iron-oxide mats in acidic (pH 2–4), high-temperature (&amp;gt; 65 °C) springs of Yellowstone National Park contain relatively simple microbial communities and are well-characterized geochemically. Consequently, these communities are excellent model systems for studying the metabolic activity of individual populations and key microbial interactions. The primary goals of the current study were to integrate data collected &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; calculations across process-scales encompassing enzymatic activity, cellular metabolism, community interactions, and ecosystem biogeochemistry, as well as to predict and quantify the functional limits of autotroph-heterotroph interactions. Metagenomic and transcriptomic data were used to reconstruct carbon and energy metabolisms of an important autotroph (&lt;i&gt;Metallosphaera yellowstonensis&lt;/i&gt;) and heterotroph (&lt;i&gt;Geoarchaeum&lt;/i&gt; sp. OSPB) from the studied Fe(III)-oxide mat communities. Standard and hybrid elementary flux mode and flux balance analyses of metabolic models predicted cellular- and community-level metabolic acclimations to simulated environmental stresses, respectively. &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; geochemical analyses, including oxygen depth-profiles, Fe(III)-oxide deposition rates, stable carbon isotopes and mat biomass concentrations, were combined with cellular models to explore autotroph-heterotroph interactions important to community structure-function. Integration of metabolic modeling with &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; measurements, including the relative population abundance of autotrophs to heterotrophs, demonstrated that Fe(III)-oxide mat communities operate at their maximum total community growth rate (i.e. sum of autotroph and heterotroph growth rates), as opposed to net community growth rate (i.e. total community growth rate subtracting autotroph consumed by heterotroph), as predicted from the maximum power principle. Integration of multiscale data with ecological theory provides a basis for predicting autotroph-heterotroph interactions and community-level cellular organization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9cziYmlDKfI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Distal dendritic enrichment of HCN1 channels in hippocampal CA1 is promoted by estrogen, but does not require Reelin</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0258-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;HCN1 compartmentalization in CA1 pyramidal cells, essential for hippocampal information processing, is believed to be controlled by the extracellular matrix protein Reelin (Kupferman et al., 2014). Expression of Reelin, in turn, is stimulated by 17β-estradiol (E2). In this study, we therefore tested whether E2 regulates the compartmentalization of HCN1 in CA1 via Reelin. In organotypic entorhino-hippocampal cultures, we found that E2 promotes the HCN1 distal dendritic enrichment via the G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPER1, but apparently independent of Reelin, because GST-RAP, known to reduce reelin signaling, did not prevent E2-induced HCN1 enrichment in distal CA1. We therefore re-examined the role of Reelin for the regulation of HCN1 compartmentalization and could not detect effects of reduced Reelin signaling on HCN1 distribution in CA1, neither in the (developmental) slice culture model, nor in tamoxifen-inducible conditional &lt;i&gt;reelin&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice during adulthood. We conclude that for HCN1 channel compartmentalization in CA1 pyramidal cells, Reelin is not as essential as previously proposed and E2-effects on HCN1 distribution in CA1 are mediated by mechanisms that do not involve Reelin. Because HCN1 localization was not altered at different phases of the estrous cycle, gonadally-derived estradiol is unlikely to regulate HCN1 channel compartmentalization, while the pattern of immunoreactivity of aromatase, the final enzyme of estradiol synthesis, argues for a role of local hippocampal E2 synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Mechanisms of learning and memory require a fine-tuned interplay between ion channels on hippocampal neurons. Among these, CA1 pyramidal cells have a crucial position, as they integrate information from various hippocampal and extra-hippocampal sources. Identifying factors that influence the function of ion channels, such as the HCN1 channels, which filter entorhinal synaptic input, may therefore help to better understand processes that underlie learning and memory. Here we show that the dendritic localization of HCN1 channels, a critical determinant of their function, is influenced by estrogen (E2), thus bringing attention to the modulatory roles of sex hormones on hippocampal information processing, which are yet poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: The role of interleukin-10 in mediating the effect of immune challenge on mouse gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons in vivo</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0211-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Immune challenge alters neural functioning via cytokine production. Inflammation has profound impact on the central regulation of fertility, but the mechanisms involved are not clearly defined. The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 is responsible for balancing the immune response in the brain. To examine whether IL-10 has an effect on the function of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, we first examined the effect of immune responses with distinct cytokine profiles, such as the T-cell-dependent (TD) and T-cell-independent (TI) B-cell response. We investigated the effect of the TD and TI immune responses on ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons by administering fluorescein-isothiocyanate/keyhole-limpet-hemocyanin (KLH-FITC) or dextran-FITC to female mice. Although dextran-FITC had no effect, KLH-FITC induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons after 6 days. KLH-FITC treatment increased the levels of IL-10 in the hypothalamus, but this treatment did not cause lymphocyte infiltration or an increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In IL-10 KO mice, KLH-FITC-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the GnRH neurons was absent. We also showed that in IL-10 KO mice, the estrous cycle was disrupted. Perforated patch-clamp recordings from GnRH-GFP neurons, IL-10 immunohistochemistry and in vitro experiments on acute brain slices revealed that IL-10 can directly alter GnRH neuron firing and induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These observations demonstrate that IL-10 plays a role in influencing signaling of GnRH neurons in the TD immune response. These results also provide the first evidence that IL-10 can directly alter the function of GnRH neurons and may help the maintenance of the integrity of the estrous cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 plays a role in maintaining a balanced immune response in the brain. Although clinical studies have demonstrated that IL-10 influences fertility, the impact of IL-10 on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons is unknown. Our results demonstrate that T cell-dependent (TD) immune challenge induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons via IL-10. We provide the first evidence that IL-10 directly regulates the firing and signaling of GnRH neurons. Our results indicate that IL-10-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons might be associated with the maintenance of the estrous cycle in bacterial/viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Studying a gene’s regulatory mechanisms is a tedious process that involves identification of candidate regulators by transcription factor (TF) knockout or over-expression experiments, delineation of enhancers by reporter assays, and demonstration of direct TF influence by site mutagenesis, among other approaches. Such experiments are often chosen based on the biologist’s intuition, from several testable hypotheses. We pursue the goal of making this process systematic by using ideas from information theory to reason about experiments in gene regulation, in the hope of ultimately enabling rigorous experiment design strategies. For this, we make use of a state-of-the-art mathematical model of gene expression, which provides a way to formalize our current knowledge of cis- as well as trans- regulatory mechanisms of a gene. Ambiguities in such knowledge can be expressed as uncertainties in the model, which we capture formally by building an ensemble of plausible models that fit the existing data and defining a probability distribution over the ensemble. We then characterize the impact of a new experiment on our understanding of the gene’s regulation based on how the ensemble of plausible models and its probability distribution changes when challenged with results from that experiment. This allows us to assess the ‘value’ of the experiment retroactively as the reduction in entropy of the distribution (information gain) resulting from the experiment’s results. We fully formalize this novel approach to reasoning about gene regulation experiments and use it to evaluate a variety of perturbation experiments on two developmental genes of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. We also provide objective and ‘biologist-friendly’ descriptions of the information gained from each such experiment. The rigorously defined information theoretic approaches presented here can be used in the future to formulate systematic strategies for experiment design pertaining to studies of gene regulatory mechanisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z4Q0168x58A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

CD95/Fas/APO-1 is a member of the death receptor family that triggers apoptotic and anti-apoptotic responses in particular, NF-κB. These responses are characterized by a strong heterogeneity within a population of cells. To determine how the cell decides between life and death we developed a computational model supported by imaging flow cytometry analysis of CD95 signaling. Here we show that CD95 stimulation leads to the induction of caspase and NF-κB pathways simultaneously in one cell. The related life/death decision strictly depends on cell-to-cell variability in the formation of the death-inducing complex (DISC) on one side (extrinsic noise) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. stochastic gene expression of the NF-κB pathway on the other side (intrinsic noise). Moreover, our analysis has uncovered that the stochasticity in apoptosis and NF-kB pathways leads not only to survival or death of a cell, but also causes a third type of response to CD95 stimulation that we termed ambivalent response. Cells in the ambivalent state can undergo cell death or survive which was subsequently validated by experiments. Taken together, we have uncovered how these two competing pathways control the fate of a cell, which in turn plays an important role for development of anti-cancer therapies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fCqyOiqzsjo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Maternal Immune Activation Alters Adult Behavior, Gut Microbiome and Juvenile Brain Oscillations in Ferrets</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0313-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Maternal immune activation (MIA) has been identified as a causal factor in psychiatric disorders by epidemiological studies in humans and mechanistic studies in rodent models. Addressing this gap in species between mice and human will accelerate the understanding of the role of MIA in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Here we provide the first study of MIA in the ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;), an animal model with a rich history of developmental investigations due to the similarities in developmental programs and cortical organization with primates. We found that after MIA by injection of PolyIC in the pregnant mother animal, the adult offspring exhibited reduced social behavior, less eye-contact with humans, decreased recognition memory, a sex-specific increase in amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, and altered gut microbiome. We also studied the neurophysiological properties of the MIA ferrets in development by &lt;i&gt;in-vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings of the local field potential (LFP) from visual cortex in 5-6 weeks old animals, and found that the spontaneous and sensory-evoked LFP had decreased power, especially in the gamma frequency band. Overall, our results provide the first evidence for the detrimental effect of MIA in ferrets support the use of the ferret as an intermediate model species for the study of disorders with neurodevelopmental origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Maternal immune activation (MIA) has been adopted in the rodent model to study neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia. Yet, neurodevelopmental programs differ quite substantially between mice and humans. The ferret has a rich history for the study of neurodevelopment due to its unique advantages that combine short gestation time with the emergence of sophisticated cortical organization during development. The present study found that MIA leads to a range of behavioral abnormalities as well as altered gut microbiome in adult ferrets. Notably, we observed impaired brain oscillations in these animals in early development. Our results lay the foundation for the translational study of neurodevelopmental disorders in ferrets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Comparison of fluctuations in global network topology of modeled and empirical brain functional connectivity</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/sr-8OBw5Vvo/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Makoto Fukushima, Olaf Sporns&lt;/p&gt;

Dynamic models of large-scale brain activity have been used for reproducing many empirical findings on human brain functional connectivity. Features that have been shown to be reproducible by comparing modeled to empirical data include functional connectivity measured over several minutes of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, as well as its time-resolved fluctuations on a time scale of tens of seconds. However, comparison of modeled and empirical data has not been conducted yet for fluctuations in global network topology of functional connectivity, such as fluctuations between segregated and integrated topology or between high and low modularity topology. Since these global network-level fluctuations have been shown to be related to human cognition and behavior, there is an emerging need for clarifying their reproducibility with computational models. To address this problem, we directly compared fluctuations in global network topology of functional connectivity between modeled and empirical data, and clarified the degree to which a stationary model of spontaneous brain dynamics can reproduce the empirically observed fluctuations. Modeled fluctuations were simulated using a system of coupled phase oscillators wired according to brain structural connectivity. By performing model parameter search, we found that modeled fluctuations in global metrics quantifying network integration and modularity had more than 80% of magnitudes of those observed in the empirical data. Temporal properties of network states determined based on fluctuations in these metrics were also found to be reproducible, although their spatial patterns in functional connectivity did not perfectly matched. These results suggest that stationary models simulating resting-state activity can reproduce the magnitude of empirical fluctuations in segregation and integration, whereas additional factors, such as active mechanisms controlling non-stationary dynamics and/or greater accuracy of mapping brain structural connectivity, would be necessary for fully reproducing the spatial patterning associated with these fluctuations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sr-8OBw5Vvo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Electrophysiological Signature Reveals Laminar Structure of the Porcine Hippocampus</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0102-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is integral to working and episodic memory and is a central region of interest in diseases affecting these processes. Pig models are widely used in translational research and may provide an excellent bridge between rodents and nonhuman primates for CNS disease models because of their gyrencephalic neuroanatomy and significant white matter composition. However, the laminar structure of the pig hippocampus has not been well characterized. Therefore, we histologically characterized the dorsal hippocampus of Yucatan miniature pigs and quantified the cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal layers. We then utilized stereotaxis combined with single-unit electrophysiological mapping to precisely place multichannel laminar silicon probes into the dorsal hippocampus without the need for image guidance. We used &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological recordings of simultaneous laminar field potentials and single-unit activity in multiple layers of the dorsal hippocampus to physiologically identify and quantify these layers under anesthesia. Consistent with previous reports, we found the porcine hippocampus to have the expected archicortical laminar structure, with some anatomical and histological features comparable to the rodent and others to the primate hippocampus. Importantly, we found these distinct features to be reflected in the laminar electrophysiology. This characterization, as well as our electrophysiology-based methodology targeting the porcine hippocampal lamina combined with high-channel-count silicon probes, will allow for analysis of spike-field interactions during normal and disease states in both anesthetized and future awake behaving neurophysiology in this large animal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A seminal 2003 Nature Neuroscience paper showed that ubiquitin-dependent degradation of synaptic proteins is engaged during activity-regulated synaptic remodeling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/wH7fDQMgXTM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>
