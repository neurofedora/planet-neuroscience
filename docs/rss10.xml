	<content:encoded>How can blood rapidly and precisely reach active neurons at a given time and location has remained enigmatic for a long time. A 2003 paper by Zonta et al. suggested key roles for astrocytes in the signaling between neurons and blood vessels. While a consensus on the specific intermediary roles of astrocytes in this process is still evolving, research in the past 15 years has led to a deeper and more refined understanding of the neuro-glio-vascular unit.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30112-7?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>In 1983 Libet et al. demonstrated that brain activity associated with a voluntary act precedes conscious experience of the intention to act by several hundred milliseconds. The implication that it is the brain, rather than ‘free will’, that initiates voluntary acts has been discussed ever since by philosophers and lawyers, as well as by scientists. We show here how Libet’s original study gave rise to an entire research field of experimental investigations of volition.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The past decade has yielded substantial evidence that the gut microbiome modulates brain function, including for instance behaviors relevant to anxiety and depression, pointing to a need to identify the biological pathways involved. In 2013 Clarke and colleagues reported that the early-life microbiome regulates the hippocampal serotonergic system in a sex-dependent manner, findings that opened up numerous lines of inquiry on the effects of the microbiome on neurodevelopment and behavior.</content:encoded>

Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

The entorhinal–hippocampal system is central to such representations, which are severely compromised in some neurological diseases. In spite of much progress, a comprehensive, integrated view of spatial, temporal and other aspects of episodic representation remains elusive. Here, we review recent data on the role of cell-type specific entorhinal inputs which excite deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells by direct and indirect pathways. We discuss how an entorhinal dialogue with deep-superficial CA1 cells can multiplex neuronal activity along theta phases and how their reactivation may be segregated during sharp-wave ripples. Thus, deep and superficial CA1 sublayers provide substrate for general hippocampal function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;159&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302994-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

However, recent studies have revealed that some non-primate animal species have higher levels of dexterity than previously supposed, and in higher primates, various indirect non-CM descending pathways have been shown to participate in the control of dexterous movements. More recently, the CM pathway was shown to exist in rodents during early development, suggesting that rodents and primates diverged in their reliance on the CM pathway at some point in evolution, thus challenging the traditional view of the sequential development of hand control from rodents to primates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

How an animal efficiently switches between distinct behaviors is a fundamental question whose inquiry will provide insights into the mechanisms that are necessary for an organism's survival. Previous work aimed at identifying the neural systems responsible for defensive behaviors, such as freezing, has demonstrated critical interactions between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Indeed, this foundational research has provided an indispensable anatomical framework that investigators are now using to understand the physiological mechanisms of defined neural circuits within the prefrontal cortex that code for the rapid and flexible expression of defensive behaviors. Here we review recent findings demonstrating temporal and rate coding mechanisms of freezing behavior in the prefrontal cortex. We hypothesize that anatomical features, such as target structure and cortical layer, as well as the nature of the information to be coded, may be critical factors determining the coding scheme. Furthermore, detailed behavioral analyses may reveal subtypes of defensive behaviors that represent the principle factor governing coding selection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Tau, while primarily localized in the axons of healthy neurons, accumulates in the soma and dendrites of neurons under pathogenic conditions. Tau is found in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. New research supports that soluble forms of tau trigger pathophysiology in the brain by altering properties of synaptic and neuronal function at the early stages of disease progression, before neurons die. Here we review the current understanding of how tau-mediated synaptic and neuronal dysfunction contributes to cognitive decline. Delineating the mechanisms by which pathogenic tau alters synapses, dendrites and axons will help lay the foundation for new strategies that can restore neuronal function in tauopathy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

This locomotor network generates the rhythmic output, coordinate left/right alternation, and permit communication across segments. Through evolution, more complex movement patterns have emerged, made possible by sub-specialization of neural populations within the spinal cord. Walking tetrapods use a similar basic circuitry, but have added layers of complexity for the coordination of intralimbic flexor and extensor muscles as well as interlimbic coordination between the body halves and fore/hindlimbs. Although the basics of these circuits are known there is a gap in our knowledge regarding how different speeds and gaits are coordinated. Analysing subpopulations among described neuronal populations may bring insight into how changes in locomotor output are orchestrated by a hard-wired network. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

The mechanisms that drive this functional diversification are of great interest because they enable adaptive behaviors and are targets of pathology. Considerable effort has focused on elucidating mechanisms of plasticity that involve changes to presynaptic release probability and the number of postsynaptic receptors. However, recent work is clarifying that nanoscale organization of the proteins within glutamatergic synapses impacts synapse function. Specifically, active zone scaffold proteins form nanoclusters that define sites of neurotransmitter release, and these sites align transsynaptically with clustered postsynaptic receptors. These nanostructural characteristics raise numerous possibilities for how synaptic plasticity could be expressed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

What we perceive strongly depends on our actions, intentions and expectations. During visual processing, these internal signals therefore need to be integrated with the visual information from the retina. The mechanisms of how this is achieved by the visual system are still poorly understood. Advances in recording and manipulating neuronal activity in specific cell types and axonal projections together with tools for circuit tracing are beginning to shed light on the neuronal circuit mechanisms of how internal, contextual signals shape sensory representations. Here we review recent work, primarily in mice, that has advanced our understanding of these processes, focusing on contextual signals related to locomotion, behavioural relevance and predictions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment. Inhibition of a protein phosphatase terminating the unfolded protein response will be discussed as a strategy to protect from diseases associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we review the recent increase in our understanding of how synapse type-specific molecules differentially regulate the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Moreover, several synapse subtype-specific molecules have been shown to control the targeting, formation or maturation of particular subtypes of excitatory synapses. Because inhibitory neurons are extremely diverse, a similar molecular diversity is likely to underlie the development of different inhibitory synapses making it a promising topic for future investigation in the field of the synapse development. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

The development of in vivo two-photon microscopy has enabled the monitoring of the same dendritic spines over time during different developmental periods. In this review we focus on recent in vivo imaging studies in rodents that have revealed cell type-specific and region-specific structural dynamics of dendritic spines. We also discuss how the contributions of local inhibitory neurons and long-distance excitatory and neuromodulatory inputs to the cortex influence dendritic spine development and dynamics.

Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we discuss recent work using personalized brain network models to study structure–function relationships in human brains. We describe the steps necessary to build such models and show how this computational approach can provide previously unobtainable information through the ability to perform virtual experiments. Finally, we present examples of how personalized brain network models can be used to gain insight into the effects of local stimulation and improve surgical outcomes in epilepsy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;93&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818300059-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Erzurumlu&lt;br /&gt; Molecular identification of neuronal types and genetic and imaging approaches to characterize their properties reveal morphological, physiological and dynamic aspects of sensory circuit development. Here we focus on the mouse tactile sensory circuitry, with particular emphasis on the main trigeminal pathway that connects the whiskers, the major tactile organ in rodents, to the neocortex. At each level of this pathway, neurogenesis, axonal elongation, pathfinding, target recognition and circuit reorganization including dendritic refinement of cortical layer 4 neurons occur contemporaneously and a multitude of molecular signals are used in differing combinations. We highlight recent advances in development of tactile circuitry and note gaps in our understanding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent discoveries have revealed surprising and complex roles of the small area CA2 in hippocampal function. Lesion studies have revealed that this region is required for social memory formation. Area CA2 is targeted by extra-hippocampal paraventricular inputs that release vasopressin and can act to enhance social memory performance. In vivo recordings have revealed nonconventional activity by neurons in this region that act to both initiate hippocampal sharp-wave ripple events as well as encode spatial information during immobility. Silencing of CA2 pyramidal neurons has revealed that this area also acts to control hippocampal network excitability during encoding, and this balance of excitation and inhibition is disrupted in disease. This review summarizes recent findings and attempts to integrate these results into pre-existing models. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

However, bulk of evidence demonstrates the requirement of the reciprocal interactions between cortical and thalamic neurons as key for the correct development of functional thalamocortical circuits. This reciprocal loop of connections is essential for sensory processing as well as for the execution of complex sensory-motor tasks. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how mutual collaborations between both brain regions define area patterning and cell differentiation in the thalamus and cortex. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

They are among the most genetically-diverse neurologic disorders, with &amp;amp;gt;80 distinct genetic loci and over 60 identified genes. Studies investigating the molecular pathogenesis underlying HSPs have emphasized the importance of converging cellular pathogenic themes in the most common forms of HSP, providing compelling targets for therapy. Most notably, these include organelle shaping and biogenesis as well as membrane and cargo trafficking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

(ECoG) recordings from an epileptic subject over speech processing brain

dynamical systems terms, to these productions. Here we show that TWs do not
occur continuously, but tend to appear before the initiation of CVSs and tend
to disappear before their termination. During moments of silence, between
productions of CVSs, TWs tend to reverse direction. To our knowledge, this is
the first study showing TWs related to the production of speech and, more
generally, the first report of behavioral correlates of mesoscale TWs in
behaving humans.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09532</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the classification of brain signals in real-life
applications, the training and the prediction data are often described by
different distributions. Furthermore, diverse data sets, e.g., recorded from
various subjects or tasks, can even exhibit distinct feature spaces. The fact
that data that have to be classified are often only available in small amounts
reinforces the need for techniques to generalize learned information, as
performances of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are enhanced by increasing
quantity of disposable data. In this paper, we apply transfer learning to a
framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) to prove
the transferability of learned patterns in error-related brain signals across
different tasks. The experiments described in this paper demonstrate the
usefulness of transfer learning, especially improving performances when only
little data can be used to distinguish between erroneous and correct
realization of a task. This effect could be delimited from a transfer of merely
general brain signal characteristics, underlining the transfer of
error-specific information. Furthermore, we could extract similar patterns in
time-frequency analyses in identical channels, leading to selective high signal
correlations between the two different paradigms. Decoding on the intracranial
data without pre-transfer reaches median accuracies of $(76.94 \pm 2.17)\,\%$
and $(81.50 \pm 9.49)\,\%$, respectively.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09373</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is a prominent theory of consciousness
that has at its centre measures that quantify the extent to which a system
generates more information than the sum of its parts. While several candidate
measures of integrated information (`$\Phi$') now exist, little is known about
how they compare, especially in terms of their behaviour on non-trivial network
models. In this article we provide clear and intuitive descriptions of six
distinct candidate measures. We then explore the properties of each of these
measures in simulation on networks consisting of eight interacting nodes,
animated with Gaussian linear autoregressive dynamics. We find a striking
diversity in the behaviour of these measures -- no two measures show consistent
agreement across all analyses. Further, only a subset of the measures appear to
genuinely reflect some form of dynamical complexity, in the sense of
simultaneous segregation and integration between system components. Our results
help guide the operationalisation of IIT and advance the development of
measures of integrated information that may have more general applicability.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A temporal neural network model for object recognition using a biologically plausible decision making layer. (arXiv:1806.09334v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09334</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain can recognize different objects as ones that it has experienced before.
The recognition accuracy and it's processing time depends on task properties
such as viewing condition, level of noise and etc. Recognition accuracy can be
well explained by different models. However, less attention has been paid to
the processing time and the ones that do, are not biologically plausible. By
extracting features temporally as well as utilizing an accumulation to bound
decision making model, an object recognition model accounting for both
recognition time and accuracy is proposed. To temporally extract informative
features in support of possible classes of stimuli, a hierarchical spiking
neural network, called spiking HMAX is modified. In the decision making part of
the model the extracted information accumulates over time using accumulator
units. The input category is determined as soon as any of the accumulators
reaches a threshold, called decision bound. Results show that not only does the
model follow human accuracy in a psychophysics task better than the classic
spiking HMAX model, but also it predicts human response time in each choice.
Results also provide enough evidence that temporal representation of features
are informative since they can improve the accuracy over time which is in line
with the well-known idea of speed accuracy trade-off in decision making
studies.

	<content:encoded>Antibodies acquired naturally through repeated exposure to &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; are essential in the control of blood-stage malaria. Antibody-dependent functions may include neutralization of parasite–host interactions, complement activation, and activation of Fc receptor functions. A role of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by natural killer (NK) cells in protection from malaria has not been established. Here we show that IgG isolated from adults living in a malaria-endemic region activated ADCC by primary human NK cells, which lysed infected red blood cells (RBCs) and inhibited parasite growth in an in vitro assay for ADCC-dependent growth inhibition. RBC lysis by NK cells was highly selective for infected RBCs in a mixed culture with uninfected RBCs. Human antibodies to &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; antigens PfEMP1 and RIFIN were sufficient to promote NK-dependent growth inhibition. As these results implicate acquired immunity through NK-mediated ADCC, antibody-based vaccines that target bloodstream parasites should consider this new mechanism of action.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>A quantitative understanding of how sensory signals are transformed into motor outputs places useful constraints on brain function and helps reveal the brain's underlying computations. We investigate how the nematode &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; responds to time-varying mechanosensory signals using a high-throughput optogenetic assay and automated behavior quantification. We find that the behavioral response is tuned to temporal properties of mechanosensory signals, like its integral and derivative, that extend over many seconds. Mechanosensory signals, even in the same neurons, can be tailored to elicit different behavioral responses. Moreover, we find that the animal's response also depends on its behavioral context. Most dramatically, the animal ignores all tested mechanosensory stimuli during turns. Finally, we present a linear-nonlinear model that predicts the animal's behavioral response to stimulus.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36312</link>
	<content:encoded>Polarised mRNA transport is a prevalent mechanism for spatial control of protein synthesis. However, the composition of transported ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) and the regulation of their movement are poorly understood. We have reconstituted microtubule minus end-directed transport of mRNAs using purified components. A Bicaudal-D (BicD) adaptor protein and the RNA-binding protein Egalitarian (Egl) are sufficient for long-distance mRNA transport by the dynein motor and its accessory complex dynactin, thus defining a minimal transport-competent RNP. Unexpectedly, the RNA is required for robust activation of dynein motility. We show that a &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-acting RNA localisation signal promotes the interaction of Egl with BicD, which licenses the latter protein to recruit dynein and dynactin. Our data support a model for BicD activation based on RNA-induced occupancy of two Egl-binding sites on the BicD dimer. Scaffolding of adaptor protein assemblies by cargoes is an attractive mechanism for regulating intracellular transport.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We investigated the role of full-length &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Bicaudal D (BicD) binding partners in dynein-dynactin activation for mRNA transport on microtubules. Full-length BicD robustly activated dynein-dynactin motility only when both the mRNA binding protein Egalitarian (Egl) and &lt;i&gt;K10&lt;/i&gt; mRNA cargo were present, and electron microscopy showed that both Egl and mRNA were needed to disrupt a looped, auto-inhibited BicD conformation. BicD can recruit two dimeric dyneins, resulting in faster speeds and longer runs than with one dynein. Moving complexes predominantly contained two Egl molecules and one &lt;i&gt;K10&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. This mRNA-bound configuration makes Egl bivalent, likely enhancing its avidity for BicD and thus its ability to disrupt BicD auto-inhibition. Consistent with this idea, artificially dimerized Egl activates dynein-dynactin-BicD in the absence of mRNA. The ability of mRNA cargo to orchestrate the activation of the mRNP (messenger ribonucleotide protein) complex is an elegant way to ensure that only cargo-bound motors are motile.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Chromatin looping controls gene expression by regulating promoter-enhancer contacts, the spread of epigenetic modifications, and the segregation of the genome into transcriptionally active and inactive compartments. We studied the impact on the structure and expression of host chromatin by the human retrovirus HTLV-1. We show that HTLV-1 disrupts host chromatin structure by forming loops between the provirus and the host genome; certain loops depend on the critical chromatin architectural protein CTCF, which we recently discovered binds to the HTLV-1 provirus. We show that the provirus causes two distinct patterns of abnormal transcription of the host genome in cis: bidirectional transcription in the host genome immediately flanking the provirus, and clone-specific transcription in cis at non-contiguous loci up to &amp;gt;300 kb from the integration site. We conclude that HTLV-1 causes insertional mutagenesis up to the megabase range in the host genome in &amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; persistently-maintained HTLV-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell clones in vivo.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In most animals, the brain makes behavioral decisions that are transmitted by descending neurons to the nerve cord circuitry that produces behaviors. In insects, only a few descending neurons have been associated with specific behaviors. To explore how descending neurons control an insect's movements, we developed a novel method to systematically assay the behavioral effects of activating individual neurons on freely behaving terrestrial &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. We calculated a two-dimensional representation of the entire behavior space explored by these flies and we associated descending neurons with specific behaviors by identifying regions of this space that were visited with increased frequency during optogenetic activation. Applying this approach across a large collection of descending neurons, we found that (1) activation of most of the descending neurons drove stereotyped behaviors, (2) in many cases multiple descending neurons activated similar behaviors, and (3) optogenetically-activated behaviors were often dependent on the behavioral state prior to activation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In most animals, the brain controls the body via a set of descending neurons (DNs) that traverse the neck. DN activity activates, maintains or modulates locomotion and other behaviors. Individual DNs have been well-studied in species from insects to primates, but little is known about overall connectivity patterns across the DN population. We systematically investigated DN anatomy in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and created over 100 transgenic lines targeting individual cell types. We identified roughly half of all &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; DNs and comprehensively map connectivity between sensory and motor neuropils in the brain and nerve cord, respectively. We find the nerve cord is a layered system of neuropils reflecting the fly’s capability for two largely independent means of locomotion -- walking and flight -- using distinct sets of appendages. Our results reveal the basic functional map of descending pathways in flies and provide tools for systematic interrogation of neural circuits.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34135</link>
	<content:encoded>Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is crucial for signaling mediated by stress-induced high levels of glucocorticoids. The lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) is a key structure underlying auditory-cued fear conditioning. Here, we demonstrate that genetic disruption of GR in the LA (LAGRKO) resulted in an auditory-cued fear memory deficit for strengthened conditioning. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of a single restraint stress (RS) prior to conditioning on auditory-cued fear memory in floxed GR (control) mice was abolished in LAGRKO mice. Optogenetic induction of long-term depression (LTD) at auditory inputs to the LA reduced auditory-cued fear memory in RS-exposed LAGRKO mice, and in contrast, optogenetic induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) increased auditory-cued fear memory in RS-exposed floxed GR mice. These findings suggest that prior stress suppresses fear conditioning-induced LTP at auditory inputs to the LA in a GR-dependent manner, thereby protecting animals from encoding excessive cued fear memory under stress conditions.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Temporal ordering of input modulates connectivity formation in a developmental neuronal network model of the cortex</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/355800v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Preterm infant brain activity is discontinuous; bursts of activity recorded using EEG (electroencephalography), thought to be driven by subcortical regions, display scale free properties and exhibit a complex temporal ordering known as long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). During brain development, activity-dependent mechanisms are essential for synaptic connectivity formation, and abolishing burst activity in animal models leads to weak disorganised synaptic connectivity. Moreover, synaptic pruning shares similar mechanisms to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), suggesting that the timing of activity may play a critical role in connectivity formation. We investigated, in a computational model of leaky integrate-and-fire neurones, whether the temporal ordering of burst activity within an external driving input could modulate connectivity formation in the network. Connectivity evolved across the course of simulations using an approach analagous to STDP, from networks with initial random connectivity. Small-world connectivity and hub neurones emerged - characteristic properties of mature brain networks. Notably, driving the network with an external input which exhibited LRTCs in the temporal ordering of burst activity facilitated the emergence of these network properties, increasing the speed with which they emerged compared with when the network was driven by the same input with the bursts randomly ordered in time. Moreover, the emergence of small-world properties was dependent on the strength of the LRTCs. These results suggest that the temporal ordering of burst activity could play an important role in synaptic connectivity formation and the emergence of small-world topology in the developing brain.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Antioxidant Gene Expression in Vocal Hindbrain of a Teleost Fish</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/354977v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) have a remarkable capacity to generate long duration advertisement calls known as hums, each of which may last for close to two hours and be repeated throughout a night of courtship activity during the breeding season. The midshipman's striking sound production capabilities provide a unique opportunity to investigate the mechanisms that motor neurons require for withstanding high-endurance activity. The temporal properties of midshipman vocal behaviors are largely controlled by a hindbrain central pattern generator that includes vocal motor neurons (VMN) that directly determine the activity pattern of target sonic muscles and, in turn, a sound's pulse repetition rate, duration and pattern of amplitude modulation. Of the two adult midshipman male reproductive phenotypes -- types I and II -- only type I males acoustically court females with hums from nests that they build and guard, while type II males do not produce courtship hums but instead sneak or satellite spawn to steal fertilizations from type I males. A prior study using next generation RNA sequencing showed increased expression of a number of cellular respiration and antioxidant genes in the VMN of type I males during the breeding season, suggesting they help to combat potentially high levels of oxidative stress linked to this extreme behavior. This led to the question of whether the expression of these genes in the VMN would vary between actively humming versus non-humming states as well as between male morphs. Here, we tested the hypothesis that to combat oxidative stress, the VMN of reproductively active type I males would exhibit higher mRNA transcript levels for two superoxide dismutases (sod1, sod2) compared to the VMN of type II males and females that do not hum and in general both of which have a more limited vocal repertoire than type I males. The results showed no significant difference in sod1 transcript expression across reproductive morphs in the VMN and the surrounding hindbrain, and no difference of sod2 across the two male morphs and females in the SH. However, we observed a surprising, significantly lower expression of sod2 transcripts in the VMN of type I males as compared to type II males. We also found no significant difference in sod1 and sod2 expression between actively humming and non-humming type I males in both the VMN and surrounding hindbrain. These findings overall lead us to conclude that increased transcription of sod1 and sod2 is not necessary for combatting oxidative stress from the demands of the midshipman high-endurance vocalizations, but warrant future studies to assess protein levels, enzyme activity levels, as well as the expression of other antioxidant genes. These results also eliminate one of the proposed mechanisms that male midshipman use to combat potentially high levels of oxidative stress incurred by motor neurons driving long duration vocalization and provide more insight into how motor neurons are adapted to the performance of extreme behaviors.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Removing contaminants from databases of draft genomes</title>

Metagenomic sequencing of patient samples is a very promising method for the diagnosis of human infections. Sequencing has the ability to capture all the DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms in a human sample. However, complete and accurate characterization of the sequence, including identification of any pathogens, depends on the availability and quality of genomes for comparison. Thousands of genomes are now available, and as these numbers grow, the power of metagenomic sequencing for diagnosis should increase. However, recent studies have exposed the presence of contamination in published genomes, which when used for diagnosis increases the risk of falsely identifying the wrong pathogen. To address this problem, we have developed a bioinformatics system for eliminating contamination as well as low-complexity genomic sequences in the draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. We applied this software to identify and remove human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences present in a comprehensive database of all sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes. We also removed low-complexity genomic sequences, another source of false positives. Using this pipeline, we have produced a database of “clean” eukaryotic pathogen genomes for use with bioinformatics classification and analysis tools. We demonstrate that when attempting to find eukaryotic pathogens in metagenomic samples, the new database provides better sensitivity than one using the original genomes while offering a dramatic reduction in false positives.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a0K1XU9oCec&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

As single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets have become more widespread the number of tools designed to analyse these data has dramatically increased. Navigating the vast sea of tools now available is becoming increasingly challenging for researchers. In order to better facilitate selection of appropriate analysis tools we have created the scRNA-tools database (www.scRNA-tools.org) to catalogue and curate analysis tools as they become available. Our database collects a range of information on each scRNA-seq analysis tool and categorises them according to the analysis tasks they perform. Exploration of this database gives insights into the areas of rapid development of analysis methods for scRNA-seq data. We see that many tools perform tasks specific to scRNA-seq analysis, particularly clustering and ordering of cells. We also find that the scRNA-seq community embraces an open-source and open-science approach, with most tools available under open-source licenses and preprints being extensively used as a means to describe methods. The scRNA-tools database provides a valuable resource for researchers embarking on scRNA-seq analysis and records the growth of the field over time.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k_dQmqkjXl0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The impact of temporal sampling resolution on parameter inference for biological transport models</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/bJ09RqwTbkw/article</link>

Imaging data has become an essential tool to explore key biological questions at various scales, for example the motile behaviour of bacteria or the transport of mRNA, and it has the potential to transform our understanding of important transport mechanisms. Often these imaging studies require us to compare biological species or mutants, and to do this we need to quantitatively characterise their behaviour. Mathematical models offer a quantitative description of a system that enables us to perform this comparison, but to relate mechanistic mathematical models to imaging data, we need to estimate their parameters. In this work we study how collecting data at different temporal resolutions impacts our ability to infer parameters of biological transport models; performing exact inference for simple velocity jump process models in a Bayesian framework. The question of how best to choose the frequency with which data is collected is prominent in a host of studies because the majority of imaging technologies place constraints on the frequency with which images can be taken, and the discrete nature of observations can introduce errors into parameter estimates. In this work, we mitigate such errors by formulating the velocity jump process model within a hidden states framework. This allows us to obtain estimates of the reorientation rate and noise amplitude for noisy observations of a simple velocity jump process. We demonstrate the sensitivity of these estimates to temporal variations in the sampling resolution and extent of measurement noise. We use our methodology to provide experimental guidelines for researchers aiming to characterise motile behaviour that can be described by a velocity jump process. In particular, we consider how experimental constraints resulting in a trade-off between temporal sampling resolution and observation noise may affect parameter estimates. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our methodology to model misspecification, and then apply our inference framework to a dataset that was generated with the aim of understanding the localization of RNA-protein complexes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bJ09RqwTbkw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Systemic and Intra-Habenular Activation of the Orphan G Protein-Coupled Receptor GPR139 Decreases Compulsive-like Alcohol Drinking and Hyperalgesia in Alcohol-Dependent Rats</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0153-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;GPR139 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is expressed mainly in the brain, with the highest expression in the habenula. The modulation of GPR139 receptor function has been hypothesized to be beneficial in the treatment of some mental disorders, but behavioral studies have not yet provided causal evidence of the role of GPR139 in brain dysfunction. Because of the high expression of GPR139 in the habenula, a critical brain region in addiction, we hypothesized that GPR139 may play role in alcohol dependence. Thus, we tested the effect of GPR139 receptor activation using the selective, brain-penetrant receptor agonist JNJ-63533054 on addiction-like behaviors in alcohol-dependent male rats. Systemic administration of JNJ-63533054 (30 mg/kg but not 10 mg/kg, p.o.) reversed the escalation of alcohol self-administration in alcohol-dependent rats, without affecting water or saccharin intake in dependent rats or alcohol intake in nondependent rats. Moreover, systemic JNJ-63533054 administration decreased withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia, without affecting somatic signs of alcohol withdrawal. Further analysis demonstrated that JNJ-63533054 was effective only in a subgroup of dependent rats that exhibited compulsive-like alcohol drinking. Finally, site-specific microinjection of JNJ-63533054 in the habenula but not interpeduncular nucleus reduced both alcohol self-administration and withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia in dependent rats. These results provide robust preclinical evidence that GPR139 receptor activation reverses key addiction-like behaviors in dependent animals, suggest that GPR139 may be a novel target for the treatment of alcohol use disorder, and demonstrate that GPR139 is functionally relevant in regulating mammalian behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; GPR139 has been identified as a receptor with high expression in a key brain region for addiction, the habenula. However, no studies have yet provided causal evidence of the role of GPR139 in brain dysfunction. This study found that GPR139 receptor activation reduced alcohol self-administration in alcohol-dependent rats with compulsive-like drinking and decreased withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia. Importantly, we found that the habenula but not interpeduncular nucleus was a mediator of the observed effects. These results represent an important advance in the field because they are the first to demonstrate a role for GPR139 in addiction-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Facilitated Event-Related Power-Modulations during Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) Revealed by Concurrent tACS-MEG</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0069-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive approaches to modulate oscillatory activity in the brain are increasingly popular in the scientific community. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been shown to modulate neural oscillations in a frequency specific manner. However, due to a massive stimulation artifact at the targeted frequency, little is known about effects of tACS during stimulation. It remains unclear how the continuous application of tACS affects event-related oscillations during cognitive tasks. Depending on whether tACS influences pre- or post-stimulus oscillations, or both, the endogenous, event-related oscillatory dynamics could be pushed in various directions or not at all. A better understanding of these effects is crucial to plan, predict and understand outcomes of solely behavioral tACS experiments. In the present study, a recently proposed procedure to suppress tACS artifacts by projecting MEG data into source-space using spatial filtering was utilized to recover event-related power modulations in the alpha-band during a mental rotation task. MEG data of twenty-five human subjects was continuously recorded. After 10 a minute baseline measurement, participants received either 20 minutes of tACS at their individual alpha frequency, or sham stimulation. Another 40 minutes of MEG data were acquired thereafter. Data were projected into source-space and carefully examined for residual artifacts. Results revealed strong facilitation of event-related power modulations in the alpha-band during tACS application. These results provide first direct evidence, that tACS does not counteract top-down suppression of intrinsic oscillations, but rather enhances pre-existent power modulations within the range of the individual alpha (=stimulation) frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is increasingly used in cognitive neuroscience to study the causal role of brain oscillations for cognition. However, online effects of tACS largely remain a ‘black box’ due to an intense electromagnetic artifact encountered during stimulation. The current study is the first to employ a spatial filtering approach to recover, and systematically study, event-related oscillatory dynamics during tACS, which could potentially be altered in various directions. TACS facilitated pre-existing patterns of oscillatory dynamics during the employed mental rotation task, but did not counteract or overwrite them. In addition, control analyses and a measure to quantify tACS artifact suppression are provided that can enrich future studies investigating tACS online effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A probabilistic atlas of the human thalamic nuclei combining ex vivo MRI and histology. (arXiv:1806.08634v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08634</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human thalamus is a brain structure that comprises numerous, highly
specific nuclei. Since these nuclei are known to have different functions and
to be connected to different areas of the cerebral cortex, it is of great
interest for the neuroimaging community to study their volume, shape and
connectivity in vivo with MRI. In this study, we present a probabilistic atlas
of the thalamic nuclei built using ex vivo brain MRI scans and histological
data, as well as the application of the atlas to in vivo MRI segmentation. The
atlas was built using manual delineation of 26 thalamic nuclei on the serial
histology of 12 whole thalami from six autopsy samples, combined with manual
segmentations of the whole thalamus and surrounding structures (caudate,
putamen, hippocampus, etc.) made on in vivo brain MR data from 39 subjects. The
3D structure of the histological data and corresponding manual segmentations
was recovered using the ex vivo MRI as reference frame, and stacks of blockface
photographs acquired during the sectioning as intermediate target. The atlas,
which was encoded as an adaptive tetrahedral mesh, shows a good agreement with
with previous histological studies of the thalamus in terms of volumes of
representative nuclei. When applied to segmentation of in vivo scans using
Bayesian inference, the atlas shows excellent test-retest reliability,
robustness to changes in input MRI contrast, and ability to detect differential
thalamic effects in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The probabilistic atlas
and companion segmentation tool are publicly available as part of the
neuroimaging package FreeSurfer.

Recently, it was reported that YcgC represents a new prokaryotic deacetylase family with no apparent homologies to existing deacetylases (Tu et al., 2015). Here we report the results of experiments which demonstrate that YcgC is not a deacetylase.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Upon nutritional stress, the metabolic status of cells is changed by nutrient signaling pathways to ensure survival. Altered metabolism by nutrient signaling pathways has been suggested to influence cellular lifespan. However, it remains unclear how chromatin regulation is involved in this process. Here, we found that histone H3 threonine 11 phosphorylation (H3pT11) functions as a marker for nutritional stress and aging. Sch9 and CK2 kinases cooperatively regulate H3pT11 under stress conditions. Importantly, H3pT11 defective mutants prolonged chronological lifespan (CLS) by altering nutritional stress responses. Thus, the phosphorylation of H3T11 by Sch9 and CK2 links a nutritional stress response to chromatin in the regulation of CLS.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Maintenance of transcription programs is challenged during mitosis when chromatin becomes condensed and transcription is silenced. How do the daughter cells re-establish the original transcription program? Here, we report that the TATA-binding protein (TBP), a key component of the core transcriptional machinery, remains bound globally to active promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells during mitosis. Using live-cell single-molecule imaging, we observed that TBP mitotic binding is highly stable, with an average residence time of minutes, in stark contrast to typical TFs with residence times of seconds. To test the functional effect of mitotic TBP binding, we used a drug-inducible degron system and found that TBP promotes the association of RNA Polymerase II with mitotic chromosomes, and facilitates transcriptional reactivation following mitosis. These results suggest that the core transcriptional machinery promotes efficient transcription maintenance globally.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/355651v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The Large Cell (LC) motor neurons of the crab (C. borealis) cardiac ganglion have variable membrane conductance magnitudes even within the same individual, yet produce identical synchronized activity in the intact network. In a previous study (Lane et al. 2016) we blocked a subset of K+ conductances across LCs, resulting in loss of synchronous activity. In this study, we hypothesized that variability of conductances could make LCs vulnerable to desynchronization during neuromodulation. We exposed LCs to serotonin (5HT) and dopamine (DA) while recording simultaneously from multiple LCs. Both amines had distinct excitatory effects on LC output, but only 5HT caused desynchronized output. We further determined that DA rapidly increased gap junctional conductance. Co-application of both amines induced 5HT-like output, but waveforms remained synchronized. Furthermore, DA prevented desynchronization induced by the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA), suggesting that dopaminergic modulation of electrical coupling plays a protective role in maintaining network synchrony.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/355503v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Previous research in rodents and humans points to an evolutionarily conserved profile of blunted fear extinction during adolescence, underpinned by brain structures such as the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In this study, we examine age-related effects on the function and structural connectivity of this system in fear extinction in adolescence and young adulthood. Younger age was associated with greater amygdala activity and delayed mPFC engagement to learned threat cues as compared to safety cues. Furthermore, greater structural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus, a white matter tract that connects the amygdala and mPFC, mediated the relationship between age and acceleration of mPFC engagement during extinction. These findings suggest that age-related changes in the structure and function of amygdala-mPFC circuitry may underlie the protracted maturation of fear regulatory processes, rendering younger individuals more vulnerable to anxiety disorders, which emerge during development.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/355446v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>TDP-43 proteinopathy is a common feature in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders including ALS, FTLD, and AD. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying TDP-43-induced neurotoxicity are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that TDP-43 proteinopathy induces impairment in UPS evidenced by an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and reduction of proteasome activity in neuronal cells. Through kinase inhibitor screening, we identified PTK2 as a suppressor of neurotoxicity induced by UPS impairment. Importantly, PTK2 inhibition significantly reduces ubiquitin aggregates and attenuated TDP-43-induced cytotoxicity in Drosophila model of TDP-43 proteinopathy. We further identified that phosphorylation of p62 at serine 403 is increased upon TDP-43 overexpression and dependent on activation of PTK2 in neuronal cells. Moreover, expressing a non-phosphorylated form of p62 significantly represses accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins and neurotoxicity induced by TDP-43 overexpression in neuronal cells. In addition, inhibition of TBK1, a kinase which phosphorylates S403 of p62, ameliorates neurotoxicity upon UPS impairment in neuronal cells. Taken together, targeting PTK2-TBK1-p62 axis may represent a novel therapeutic intervention for neurodegenerative diseases with TDP-43 proteinopathy.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/355438v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The Mammalian phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL) family is primarily recognized for its oncogenic properties. Here we found that in Drosophila, loss of prl-1 resulted in CO2-induced brain disorder presented as irreversible wing hold up with enhancement of Ca2+ responses at the neuron synaptic terminals. Overexpression of Prl-1 in the nervous system could rescue the mutant phenotype. We show that Prl-1 is particularly expressed in CO2-responsive neural circuit and the higher brain centers. Ablation of the CO2 olfactory receptor, Gr21a, suppressed the mutant phenotype, suggesting that CO2 acts as a neuropathological substrate in absence of Prl-1. Further studies found that the wing hold up is an obvious consequence upon knockdown of Uex, a magnesium transporter, which directly interacts with Prl-1. Conditional expression of Uex in the nervous system could rescue the phenotype of prl-1 mutants. We demonstrate that Uex acts genetically downstream of Prl-1. Our findings provide important insights into mechanisms of Prl-1 protection against olfactory CO2 stimulation induced brain disorder at the level of detailed neural circuits and functional molecular connections.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Capturing remote activation of epilepsy source?</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/355255v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Spontaneous focal synchronization of collective spiking followed by induced traveling waves can occur in the cortical sheet and in cultured planar neuronal networks. In the first case, it is well-known focal epilepsy leading to a seizure and, in the second, this synchronization originates from one of a few steady nucleation sites resulting in a so-called population spike. Assuming functional similarity between the nucleation sites and non-lesional epileptic foci, the major unsolved problem in both cases is that it is unclear whether activation of the focus originates internally (i.e., autonomously relative to interaction with surrounding neuronal tissue) or externally. The 'internal' scenario implies that the focus spatially contains some pacemakers. In turn, several experimental findings indicate a complex spatially non-local activation of epileptic focus. Here, we suggest a generative mechanistic model of planar neuronal network, where the spatial configuration of pacemaker neurons is artificially engineered in order to resolve the above mentioned problem: all pacemakers are placed within a circular central spot. Leaving the global dynamic regime unaffected, this crucially helps to clarify the activation process, visualizing of which is hindered in the natural spatially-uniform configuration. We show in simulations that the nucleation sites (i) can emerge in spatial regions, where pacemakers are completely absent and (ii) can be activated even without direct links from pacemakers. These results demonstrate the principle possibility of external, or remote, activation of a focal source of epileptic activity in the brain. The suggested deterministic model provides the means to study this network phenomenon systematically and reproducibly.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Several studies highlight the relevance of prior personal information during social interactions. Such knowledge aids in the prediction of others, and it affects choices even when it is unrelated to their actual behaviour. In this investigation we aimed to study the neural representation of positive and negative personal social expectations, how these impact on subsequent choices, and the effect of mismatches between expectations and encountered behaviour. We employed functional Magnetic Resonance in combination with a version of the Ultimatum Game where, previous to fair and unfair offers, participants were provided with information about their partners' moral traits. Univariate and multivariate analyses evidenced a set of regions underlying expectations about the partners in the game, involving the supplementary motor area (SMA) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Further, we were able to decode the valence of expectations in these regions, and also in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Additionally, performance of the classifier in these clusters correlated with a behavioural choice bias, manifesting the impact of the valence of the expectations on participants' decisions. These results suggest that expectations based on social information guide future interpersonal decisions, and that the neural representation of such expectations is related to their influence on behaviour.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/355016v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain networks exhibit community structure that reconfigures during cognitively demanding tasks. Extant work has emphasized a single class of communities: those that are assortative, or internally dense and externally sparse. Other classes that may play key functional roles in brain function have largely been ignored, leading to an impoverished view in the best case and a mischaracterization in the worst case. Here, we leverage weighted stochastic blockmodeling, a community detection method capable of detecting diverse classes of communities, to study the community structure of functional brain networks while subjects either rest or perform cognitively demanding tasks. We find evidence that the resting brain is largely assortative, although higher order association areas exhibit non-assortative organization, forming cores and peripheries. Surprisingly, this assortative structure breaks down during tasks and is supplanted by core, periphery, and disassortative communities. Using measures derived from the community structure, we show that it is possible to classify an individual's task state with an accuracy that is well above average. Finally, we show that inter-individual differences in the composition of assortative and non-assortative communities is correlated with subject performance on in-scanner cognitive tasks. These findings offer a new perspective on the community organization of functional brain networks and its relation to cognition.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/354555v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is a fatal disease caused by the systemic aggregation and deposition of transthyretin (TTR), a blood transporter that is mainly produced in the liver. TTR deposits are made of elongated amyloid fibrils that interfere with normal tissue function leading to organ failure. The current standard care for hereditary neuropathic ATTR is liver transplantation or stabilization of the native form of TTR by tafamidis. In our previous work, we explored an additional strategy to halt protein aggregation by capping pre-existing TTR fibrils with structure-based designed peptide inhibitors. Our best peptide inhibitor TabFH2 has shown to be effective at inhibiting not only TTR aggregation but also amyloid seeding driven by fibrils extracted from ATTR patients. Here we evaluate the effects of peptide inhibitors in two Drosophila models of neuropathic ATTR and compared their efficacy with diflunisal, a protein stabilizer currently used off-label for the treatment of ATTR. Our peptide inhibitor TabFH2 was found the most effective treatment, which resulted in motor improvement and the reduction of TTR deposition. Our in vivo study shows that inhibiting TTR deposition by peptide inhibitors may represent a therapeutic strategy for halting the progression of ATTR.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Alex D. Bird, Magnus J. E. Richardson&lt;/p&gt;

Short-term synaptic depression, caused by depletion of releasable neurotransmitter, modulates the strength of neuronal connections in a history-dependent manner. Quantifying the statistics of synaptic transmission requires stochastic models that link probabilistic neurotransmitter release with presynaptic spike-train statistics. Common approaches are to model the presynaptic spike train as either regular or a memory-less Poisson process: few analytical results are available that describe depressing synapses when the afferent spike train has more complex, temporally correlated statistics such as bursts. Here we present a series of analytical results—from vesicle release-site occupancy statistics, via neurotransmitter release, to the post-synaptic voltage mean and variance—for depressing synapses driven by correlated presynaptic spike trains. The class of presynaptic drive considered is that fully characterised by the inter-spike-interval distribution and encompasses a broad range of models used for neuronal circuit and network analyses, such as integrate-and-fire models with a complete post-spike reset and receiving sufficiently short-time correlated drive. We further demonstrate that the derived post-synaptic voltage mean and variance allow for a simple and accurate approximation of the firing rate of the post-synaptic neuron, using the exponential integrate-and-fire model as an example. These results extend the level of biological detail included in models of synaptic transmission and will allow for the incorporation of more complex and physiologically relevant firing patterns into future studies of neuronal networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ErLjrQIgZpU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a forefront actor in the transport of lipids and the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis, and is also strongly implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. Upon lipid-binding apoE adopts a conformational state that mediates the receptor-induced internalization of lipoproteins. Due to its inherent structural dynamics and the presence of lipids, the structure of the biologically active apoE remains so far poorly described. To address this issue, we developed an innovative hybrid method combining experimental data with molecular modeling and dynamics to generate comprehensive models of the lipidated apoE4 isoform. Chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry provided distance restraints, characterizing the three-dimensional organization of apoE4 molecules at the surface of lipidic nanoparticles. The ensemble of spatial restraints was then rationalized in an original molecular modeling approach to generate monomeric models of apoE4 that advocated the existence of two alternative conformations. These two models point towards an activation mechanism of apoE4 relying on a regulation of the accessibility of its receptor binding region. Further, molecular dynamics simulations of the dimerized and lipidated apoE4 monomeric conformations revealed an elongation of the apoE N-terminal domain, whereby helix 4 is rearranged, together with Arg172, into a proper orientation essential for lipoprotein receptor association. Overall, our results show how apoE4 adapts its conformation for the recognition of the low density lipoprotein receptor and we propose a novel mechanism of activation for apoE4 that is based on accessibility and remodeling of the receptor binding region.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dL-J_TXfeus&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08167</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The principles of neural encoding and computations are inherently collective
and usually involve large populations of interacting neurons with highly
correlated activities. While theories of neural function have long recognized
the importance of collective effects in populations of neurons, only in the
past two decades has it become possible to record from many cells
simulatenously using advanced experimental techniques with single-spike
resolution, and to relate these correlations to function and behaviour. This
review focuses on the modeling and inference approaches that have been recently
developed to describe the correlated spiking activity of populations of
neurons. We cover a variety of models describing correlations between pairs of
neurons as well as between larger groups, synchronous or delayed in time, with
or without the explicit influence of the stimulus, and including or not latent
variables. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks or each method, as well as
the computational challenges related to their application to recordings of ever
larger populations.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The artificial axon is a recently introduced synthetic assembly of supported
lipid bilayers and voltage gated ion channels, displaying the basic
electrophysiology of nerve cells. Here we demonstrate the use of two artificial
axons as control elements to achieve a simple task. Namely, we steer a remote
control car towards a light source, using the sensory input dependent firing
rate of the axons as the control signal for turning left or right. We present
the result in the form of the analysis of a movie of the car approaching the
light source. In general terms, with this work we pursue a constructivist
approach to exploring the nexus between machine language at the nerve cell
level and behavior.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07998</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral fluid dynamics require a reverse energy mechanism to transport water
and metabolites from tissue into veins. Recent findings in active flow of
bacteria have shown that such a mechanism involving backward energy cascades,
so-called inverse cascades may exist only during spontaneously broken
mirror-symmetries. Here, we wanted to investigate whether and, if so when
symmetries break during a heart cycle. We used multiple spin echos (MSE)s in
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which can detect broken spherical symmetries.
We found MSEs in brain tissue which appeared during arterial pulsation in a
highly synchronized fashion in most parts of the brain. The timing suggests
that the reverse energy flow is initiated during the energy injection of the
heartbeat and ends with the isovolumetric vessel contraction. This interleaved
process may explain how the illusive pulse wave traveling through the brain
emerges as well as underlying principles of cerebral autoregulation and
neurovascular coupling.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07990</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Storing knowledge of an agent's environment in the form of a probabilistic
generative model has been established as a crucial ingredient in a multitude of
cognitive tasks. Perception has been formalised as probabilistic inference over
the state of latent variables, whereas in decision making the model of the
environment is used to predict likely consequences of actions. Such generative
models have earlier been proposed to underlie semantic memory but it remained
unclear if this model also underlies the efficient storage of experiences in
episodic memory. We formalise the compression of episodes in the normative
framework of information theory and argue that semantic memory provides the
distortion function for compression of experiences. Recent advances and
insights from machine learning allow us to approximate semantic compression in
naturalistic domains and contrast the resulting deviations in compressed
episodes with memory errors observed in the experimental literature on human
memory.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07903</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Global integration of information in the brain results from complex
interactions of segregated brain networks. Identifying the most influential
neuronal populations that efficiently bind these networks is a fundamental
problem of systems neuroscience. Here we apply optimal percolation theory and
pharmacogenetic interventions in-vivo to predict and subsequently target nodes
that are essential for global integration of a memory network in rodents. The
theory predicts that integration in the memory network is mediated by a set of
low-degree nodes located in the nucleus accumbens. This result is confirmed
with pharmacogenetic inactivation of the nucleus accumbens, which eliminates
the formation of the memory network, while inactivations of other brain areas
leave the network intact. Thus, optimal percolation theory predicts essential
nodes in brain networks. This could be used to identify targets of
interventions to modulate brain function.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Integrated information in the thermodynamic limit. (arXiv:1806.07879v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07879</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to integrate information into a unified coherent whole is a
fundamental capacity of many biological and cognitive systems. Integrated
Information Theory (IIT) provides a mathematical approach to quantify the level
of integration in a system. Nevertheless, it is not yet well understood how
integration scales up with the size of a system or with different temporal
scales of activity, nor how a system maintains its integration as its interacts
with its environment. We argue that modelling and understanding how measures of
information integration operate in these scenarios is fundamental to adequately
capture integration in systems such as the brain. We propose a simplified and
modified version of integrated information {\phi} in order to explore these
questions. Using mean field approximations, we measure {\phi} in a kinetic
Ising models of infinite size. We find that information integration diverges in
some cases when the system is near critical points in continuous phase
transitions. Moreover, we find that we can delimit the boundary of a system
with respect to its environment by comparing the divergent integrative
tendencies of system and system-environment processes respectively. Finally, we
model a system that maintains integrated information when interacting with a
range of different environments by generating a critical surface spanning a
parametric region of the environment. We conclude by discussing how thinking
about integrated information in the thermodynamic limit opens fruitful research
avenues for studying the organization of biological and cognitive systems.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37751</link>
	<content:encoded>Most human genes contain multiple introns, necessitating mechanisms to effectively define exons and ensure their proper connection by spliceosomes. Human spliceosome assembly involves both cross-intron and cross-exon interactions, but how these work together is unclear. We examined in human nuclear extracts dynamic interactions of single pre-mRNA molecules with individual fluorescently tagged spliceosomal subcomplexes to investigate how cross-intron and cross-exon processes jointly promote pre-spliceosome assembly. U1 subcomplex bound to the 5' splice site of an intron acts jointly with U1 bound to the 5' splice site of the next intron to dramatically increase the rate and efficiency by which U2 subcomplex is recruited to the branch site/3' splice site of the upstream intron. The flanking 5' splice sites have greater than additive effects implying distinct mechanisms facilitating U2 recruitment. This synergy of 5' splice sites across introns and exons is likely important in promoting correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37476</link>
	<content:encoded>During plant cell invasion, the oomycete &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora infestans&lt;/i&gt; remains enveloped by host-derived membranes whose functional properties are poorly understood. &lt;i&gt;P. infestans&lt;/i&gt; secretes a myriad of effector proteins through these interfaces for plant colonization. Recently we showed that the effector protein PexRD54 reprograms host-selective autophagy by antagonising antimicrobial-autophagy receptor Joka2/NBR1 for ATG8CL binding (Dagdas, 2016). Here, we show that during infection, ATG8CL/Joka2 labelled defense-related autophagosomes are diverted toward the perimicrobial host membrane to restrict pathogen growth. PexRD54 also localizes to autophagosomes across the perimicrobial membrane, consistent with the view that the pathogen remodels host-microbe interface by co-opting the host autophagy machinery. Furthermore, we show that the host-pathogen interface is a hotspot for autophagosome biogenesis. Notably, overexpression of the early autophagosome biogenesis protein ATG9 enhances plant immunity. Our results implicate selective autophagy in polarized immune responses of plants and point to more complex functions for autophagy than the widely known degradative roles.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Expression of histone H3.3K27M mutant proteins in human diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) results in a global reduction of tri-methylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3), and paradoxically, H3K27me3 peaks remain at hundreds of genomic loci, a dichotomous change that lacks mechanistic insights. Here we show that the PRC2 complex is sequestered at poised enhancers, but not at active promoters with high levels of H3.3K27M proteins, thereby contributing to the global reduction of H3K27me3. Moreover, the levels of H3.3K27M proteins are low at the retained H3K27me3 peaks and consequently having minimal effects on the PRC2 activity at these loci. H3K27me3-mediated silencing at specific tumor suppressor genes, including Wilms Tumor 1, promotes proliferation of DIPG cells. These results support a model in which the PRC2 complex is redistributed to poised enhancers in H3.3K27M mutant cells and contributes to tumorigenesis in part by locally enhancing H3K27 trimethylation, and hence silencing of tumor suppressor genes.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Mechano-redox control of integrin de-adhesion</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34843</link>
	<content:encoded>How proteins harness mechanical force to control function is a significant biological question. Here we describe a human cell surface receptor that couples ligand binding and force to trigger a chemical event which controls the adhesive properties of the receptor. Our studies of the secreted platelet oxidoreductase, ERp5, have revealed that it mediates release of fibrinogen from activated platelet αIIbβ3 integrin. Protein chemical studies show that ligand binding to extended αIIbβ3 integrin renders the βI-domain Cys177-Cys184 disulfide bond cleavable by ERp5. Fluid shear and force spectroscopy assays indicate that disulfide cleavage is enhanced by mechanical force. Cell adhesion assays and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that cleavage of the disulfide induces long-range allosteric effects within the βI-domain, mainly affecting the metal-binding sites, that results in release of fibrinogen. This coupling of ligand binding, force and redox events to control cell adhesion may be employed to regulate other protein-protein interactions.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Chronic 2P-STED imaging reveals high turnover of dendritic spines in the hippocampus in vivo</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34700</link>
	<content:encoded>Rewiring neural circuits by the formation and elimination of synapses is thought to be a key cellular mechanism of learning and memory in the mammalian brain. Dendritic spines are the postsynaptic structural component of excitatory synapses, and their experience-dependent plasticity has been extensively studied in mouse superficial cortex using two-photon microscopy in vivo. By contrast, very little is known about spine plasticity in the hippocampus, which is the archetypical memory center of the brain, mostly because it is difficult to visualize dendritic spines in this deeply embedded structure with sufficient spatial resolution. We developed chronic 2P-STED microscopy in mouse hippocampus, using a ‘hippocampal window’ based on resection of cortical tissue and a long working distance objective for optical access. We observed a two-fold higher spine density than previous studies and measured a spine turnover of ~40% within 4 days, which depended on spine size. We thus provide direct evidence for a high level of structural rewiring of synaptic circuits and new insights into the structure-dynamics relationship of hippocampal spines. Having established chronic super-resolution microscopy in the hippocampus in vivo, our study enables longitudinal and correlative analyses of nanoscale neuroanatomical structures with genetic, molecular and behavioral experiments.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: TASEP modelling provides a parsimonious explanation for the ability of a single uORF to derepress translation during the Integrated Stress Response</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32563</link>
	<content:encoded>Translation initiation is the rate-limiting step of protein synthesis that is downregulated during the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). Previously we demonstrated that most human mRNAs resistant to this inhibition possess translated uORFs, and that in some cases a single uORF is sufficient for the resistance (Andreev et al., 2015). Here we developed a computational model of Initiation Complexes Interference with Elongating Ribosomes (ICIER) to gain insight into the mechanism. We explored the relationship between the flux of scanning ribosomes upstream and downstream of a single uORF depending on uORF features. Paradoxically our analysis predicts that reducing ribosome flux upstream of certain uORFs increases initiation downstream. The model supports the derepression of downstream translation as a general mechanism of uORF-mediated stress resistance. It predicts that stress resistance can be achieved with long slowly decoded uORFs that do not favor translation reinitiation and start with initiators of low leakiness.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Phase-tuned neuronal firing encodes human contextual representations for navigational goals</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32554</link>
	<content:encoded>We previously demonstrated that the phase of oscillations modulates neural activity representing categorical information using human intracranial recordings and high-frequency activity from local field potentials (Watrous et al., 2015b). We extend these findings here using human single-neuron recordings during a navigation task. We identify neurons in the medial temporal lobe with firing-rate modulations for specific navigational goals, as well as for navigational planning and goal arrival. Going beyond this work, using a novel oscillation detection algorithm, we identify phase-locked neural firing that encodes information about a person's prospective navigational goal in the absence of firing rate changes. These results provide evidence for navigational planning and contextual accounts of human MTL function at the single-neuron level. More generally, our findings identify phase-coded neuronal firing as a component of the human neural code.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Electrocorticographic responses to time-compressed speech vary across the cortical auditory hierarchy</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/354464v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Human listeners understand spoken language across a variety of rates, but when speech is presented three times or more faster than its usual rate, it becomes unintelligible. How the brain achieves such tolerance and why speech becomes unintelligible above certain rates is still unclear. We addressed these questions using electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings in 7 epileptic patients (two female). Patients rated the intelligibility of sentences presented at the original rate (100%), speeded rates (33% or 66% of the original sentence duration) and a slowed rate (150%). We then examined which parameters of the neural response covary with the transition from intelligible to unintelligible speech. Specifically, we asked whether neural responses: 1) track the acoustic envelope of the incoming speech; 2) scale with speech rate, i.e. whether neural responses elicited by slowed and speeded sentences can be linearly scaled to match the responses to the original sentence. Behaviorally, intelligibility was at ceiling for speech rates of 66% and above, but dropped significantly for the 33% rate. At the neural level, Superior Temporal Gyrus regions (STG) in close proximity to A1 (low-level) tracked the acoustic envelope and linearly scaled with the input across all speech rates, irrespective of intelligibility. In contrast, secondary auditory areas in the STG as well as the inferior frontal gyrus and angular gyrus (high-level) tracked the acoustic envelope and linearly scaled with input only for intelligible speech. These results help reconcile seemingly contradictory previous findings and provide better understanding of how information processing unfolds along the cortical auditory hierarchy.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/354381v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>How do humans learn to adapt their motor actions to achieve task success? Recent behavioral and patient studies have challenged the classic notion that motor learning arises solely from the errors produced during a task, suggesting instead that explicit cognitive strategies can act in concert with the implicit, error-based, motor learning component. Here, we show that the earliest wave of directionally-tuned neuromuscular activity that occurs within ~100 ms of peripheral visual stimulus onset is selectively influenced by the implicit component of motor learning. In contrast, the voluntary neuromuscular activity associated with reach initiation, which evolves ~100 to 200 ms later is influenced by both the implicit and explicit components of motor learning. The selective influence of the implicit, but not explicit, component of motor learning on the earliest cascade of neuromuscular activity supports the notion that these components of motor learning can differentially influence descending motor pathways.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Decisions are driven by the coordinated activity of diverse neural populations. Inhibitory neurons play a critical role in decision-making models, but technical challenges have left untested their role in vivo, both in novice and expert decision-makers. To understand the contribution of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to decision-making, we simultaneously measured their activity in mice judging the repetition rate of multisensory pulses. Individual inhibitory neurons were slightly more selective and more strongly correlated than excitatory neurons. Further, inhibitory ensemble activity could be decoded to predict trial-by-trial choice with similar accuracy as excitatory ensembles. Finally, population activity in both cell types changed in parallel as mice transitioned from novice to expert decision-makers: population activity gradually became more choice-selective and prompt. The observations advocate for models in which excitatory and inhibitory connectivity (1) preserves choice selectivity in both populations and (2) is fine-tuned with experience to support expert decision-making.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/354290v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The urea cycle plays a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). Arginase-I accumulation at sites of amyloid-beta deposition is associated with L-arginine deprivation and neurodegeneration. Moreover, a positive interaction between the arginase-II and mTOR-S6K1 pathways promote inflammation and oxidative stress. In this study, we treated 3xTg-AD mice exhibiting increased ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) activity and wild-type (WT) mice with L-norvaline. The substance combines unique properties of arginase and S6K1 inhibition. The treated 3xTg-AD mice demonstrated significantly improved acquisition of spatial memory, associated with a substantial reduction of microgliosis and shift from activated to resting phenotype. Moreover, an increase of dendritic spines density and escalation of the expression rates of neuroplasticity related proteins were followed by a decline in the levels of amyloid-beta toxic oligomeric and fibrillar species in the hippocampus. Our findings associate local amyloid-beta-driven and immune-mediated response with altered L-arginine metabolism and suggest that arginase and S6K1 inhibition by L-norvaline can delay progression of AD.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Chronic Electrical Stimulation Promotes the Excitability and Plasticity of ESC-derived Neurons following Glutamate-induced Inhibition In vitro</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/354191v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is rapidly gaining traction as a therapeutic tool for mediating the repair and recovery of the injured central nervous system (CNS). However, the underlying mechanisms and impact of these stimulation paradigms at a molecular, cellular and network level remain largely unknown. In this study, we used embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived neuron and glial co-cultures to investigate network maturation following acute administration of L-glutamate, which is a known mediator of excitotoxicity following CNS injury. We then modulated network maturation using chronic low frequency stimulation (LFS) and direct current stimulation (DCS) protocols. We demonstrated that L-glutamate impaired the rate of maturation of ESC-derived neurons and glia immediately and over a week following acute treatment. The administration of chronic LFS and DCS protocols individually following L-glutamate infusion significantly promoted the excitability of neurons as well as network synchrony, while the combination of LFS/DCS did not. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that LFS and DCS alone significantly up-regulated the expression of excitability and plasticity-related transcripts encoding N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit (NR2A), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Ras-related protein (RAB3A). In contrast, the simultaneous administration of LFS/DCS down-regulated BDNF and RAB3A expression. Our results demonstrate that LFS and DCS stimulation can modulate network maturation excitability and synchrony following the acute administration of an inhibitory dose of L-glutamate, as well as an upregulation of NR2A, BDNF and RAB3A gene expression. Our study also provides a novel framework for investigating the effects of electrical stimulation on neuronal responses and network formation/repair after traumatic brain injury.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The primary visual cortex of higher mammals is organized into diverse functional maps of correlated topography, implying an efficient tiling of functional domains. However, no fundamental principle is available on how systematic organization of the maps could develop initially in various species. Here, we propose that diverse functional maps are seeded from a common framework of retinal afferents, and that this universality of development explains the observed topographical correlations among the maps. From the simulation of retinal ganglion cell mosaics, we successfully developed all four cortical maps observed so far. We validated our model prediction of inter-map relationships from analysis of map data in evolutionarily divergent mammalian species. Our key prediction, the hexagonal periodicity of every functional map, was validated from analysis of the map data in diverse mammalian species. Our results provide new insight into a universal mechanism for the development and evolution of the visual cortex.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Motor learning decline with age is related to differences in the explicit memory system</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/353870v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The ability to adapt one's movements to changes in the environment is fundamental in everyday life, but this ability changes across the lifespan. Although often regarded as an 'implicit' process, recent research has also linked motor adaptation with 'explicit' learning processes. To understand how these processes contribute to differences in motor adaptation with age, we combined a visuomotor learning paradigm with cognitive tasks that measure implicit and explicit processes, and structural brain imaging. In a large population-based cohort from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (n=322, aged 18-89 years) we first confirmed that the degree of adaptation to an angular perturbation of visual feedback declined with age. There were no associations between adaptation and sensory attenuation, which has been previously hypothesised to contribute to implicit motor learning. However, interactions between age and scores on two independent memory tasks showed that explicit memory performance was a progressively stronger determinant of motor learning with age. Similarly, interactions between age and grey matter volume in the medial temporal lobe, amygdala and hippocampus showed that grey matter volume in these regions became a stronger determinant of adaptation in older adults. The convergent behavioural and structural imaging results suggest that age-related differences in the explicit memory system is a contributor to the decline in motor adaptation in older age. These results may reflect the more general compensatory reliance on cognitive strategies to maintain motor performance with age.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/353854v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Aims: This study was aimed to investigate whether the aldehyde dehydrogenase activator (Alda-1(R)) reduces neuronal damage in a rat model of binge ethanol exposure. Methods: Thirty-six adolescent male rats (130-150 g) were randomly assigned into three groups; sham, ethanol-only group (25% ethanol intragastrically thrice daily for four days, approximately 10 g/kg/day) and ethanol with Alda-1(R) group (10 mg/kg thrice daily for four days). The ALDH activity of baseline and 90 min after last infusion of each group was measured. Brain damages were investigated by using Luxol fast blue-Cresyl violet stain in the hippocampus, CA1 and CA2/3. The activation of astrocytes and microglia were examined using immunohistochemistry for antiglial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1). Results: After four day binge, the ALDH activity level was doubled in ethanol with alda-1(R) group (mean: 7.87, SD: 0.67), whereas, the levels of sham group (mean: 4.07, SD: 0.53) and ethanol only group (mean: 3.77, SD: 0.36) were slightly decreased. The more significant neuronal shrinkage, fewer neurons, loss of Nissl substance of the hippocampus were observed in the ethanol only group in comparison to the ethanol with Alda-1(R) group. The astrocytosis and microgliosis of the hippocampus were also more activated in the ethanol only group than those in the ethanol with Alda-1(R) group. Conclusion: The administration of Alda-1(R) reduces the cytotoxic damage of the hippocampus in adolescent rats with binge ethanol exposure.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Clinical studies have suggested that cerebellar dysfunction is involved in various psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, dyslexia, and depressive disorders. However, the physiological aspect is less-advanced. Here, we comprehensively investigated the immune-triggered excitability plasticity in the cerebellum. Activated microglia (MG) via exposure to bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide or heat-killed Gram-negative bacteria induced a potentiation of the excitability of Purkinje neurons, which was suppressed by MG-activity inhibitor and MG-depletion. An inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) released from MG triggered this plasticity. While our new two-photon FRET ATP-imaging showed an increase in ATP concentration following endotoxin exposure, both TNF- and ATP secretion facilitated synaptic transmission. Inflammation in the cerebellar anterior vermis in vivo immobilized animals, and reduced sociability. Such abulia-like behavioral impairments were reverted by TNF--inhibition and MG-depletion. Resting-state functional MRI revealed overconnectivity between the inflamed cerebellum and prefrontal neocortical regions, which may underlie the psychomotor depressiveness in animals.</content:encoded>

The development of a functional nervous system requires tight control of neurite growth and guidance by extracellular chemical cues. Neurite growth is astonishingly sensitive to shallow concentration gradients, but a widely observed feature of both growth and guidance regulation, with important consequences for development and regeneration, is that both are only elicited over the same relatively narrow range of concentrations. Here we show that all these phenomena can be explained within one theoretical framework. We first test long-standing explanations for the suppression of the trophic effects of nerve growth factor at high concentrations, and find they are contradicted by experiment. Instead we propose a new hypothesis involving inhibitory signalling among the cell bodies, and then extend this hypothesis to show how both growth and guidance can be understood in terms of a common underlying signalling mechanism. This new model for the first time unifies several key features of neurite growth regulation, quantitatively explains many aspects of experimental data, and makes new predictions about unknown details of developmental signalling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_iAROQSe6Po&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Polymicrobial interactions play an important role in shaping the outcome of antibiotic treatment, yet how multispecies communities respond to antibiotic assault is still little understood. Here we use an individual-based simulation model of microbial biofilms to investigate how competitive and mutualistic interactions between an antibiotic-resistant and a susceptible strain (or species) influence the two-lineage community response to antibiotic exposure. Our model predicts that while increasing competition and antibiotics leads to increasing competitive release of the antibiotic-resistant strain, hitting a mutualistic community of cross-feeding species with antibiotics leads to a mutualistic suppression effect where both susceptible and resistant species are harmed. We next show that the impact of antibiotics is further governed by emergent spatial feedbacks within communities. Mutualistic cross-feeding communities can rescue susceptible members by subsidizing their growth inside the biofilm despite lack of access to the nutrient-rich and high-antibiotic growing front. Moreover, we show that antibiotic detoxification by resistant cells can protect nearby susceptible cells, but such cross-protection is more effective in mutualistic communities because mutualism drives mixing of resistant and susceptible cells. In contrast, competition leads to segregation, which ultimately prevents susceptible cells to profit from detoxification. Understanding how the interplay between microbial metabolic interactions and community spatial structuring shapes the outcome of antibiotic treatment can be key to effectively leverage the power of antibiotics and promote microbiome health.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LJhLUT2wYlg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We use reinforcement learning to train an agent for computational RNA design: given a target secondary structure, design a sequence that folds to that structure &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;. Our agent uses a novel graph convolutional architecture allowing a single model to be applied to arbitrary target structures of any length. After training it on randomly generated targets, we test it on the Eterna100 benchmark and find it outperforms all previous algorithms. Analysis of its solutions shows it has successfully learned some advanced strategies identified by players of the game Eterna, allowing it to solve some very difficult structures. On the other hand, it has failed to learn other strategies, possibly because they were not required for the targets in the training set. This suggests the possibility that future improvements to the training protocol may yield further gains in performance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNWGqeRtEb8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A framework for large-scale evaluation of deep learning for EEG. (arXiv:1806.07741v1 [eess.SP])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07741</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;EEG is the most common signal source for noninvasive BCI applications. For
such applications, the EEG signal needs to be decoded and translated into
appropriate actions. A recently emerging EEG decoding approach is deep learning
with Convolutional or Recurrent Neural Networks (CNNs, RNNs) with many
different architectures already published. Here we present a novel framework
for the large-scale evaluation of different deep-learning architectures on
different EEG datasets. This framework comprises (i) a collection of EEG
datasets currently comprising 100 examples (recording sessions) from six
different classification problems, (ii) a collection of different EEG decoding
algorithms, and (iii) a wrapper linking the decoders to the data as well as
handling structured documentation of all settings and (hyper-) parameters and
statistics, designed to ensure transparency and reproducibility. As an
applications example we used our framework by comparing three publicly
available CNN architectures: the Braindecode Deep4 ConvNet, Braindecode Shallow
ConvNet, and EEGNet. We also show how our framework can be used to study
similarities and differences in the performance of different decoding methods
across tasks. We argue that the deep learning EEG framework as described here
could help to tap the full potential of deep learning for BCI applications.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Contrastive Hebbian Learning with Random Feedback Weights. (arXiv:1806.07406v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07406</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural networks are commonly trained to make predictions through learning
algorithms. Contrastive Hebbian learning, which is a powerful rule inspired by
gradient backpropagation, is based on Hebb's rule and the contrastive
divergence algorithm. It operates in two phases, the forward (or free) phase,
where the data are fed to the network, and a backward (or clamped) phase, where
the target signals are clamped to the output layer of the network and the
feedback signals are transformed through the transpose synaptic weight
matrices. This implies symmetries at the synaptic level, for which there is no
evidence in the brain. In this work, we propose a new variant of the algorithm,
called random contrastive Hebbian learning, which does not rely on any synaptic
weights symmetries. Instead, it uses random matrices to transform the feedback
signals during the clamped phase, and the neural dynamics are described by
first order non-linear differential equations. The algorithm is experimentally
verified by solving a Boolean logic task, classification tasks (handwritten
digits and letters), and an autoencoding task. This article also shows how the
parameters affect learning, especially the random matrices. We use the
pseudospectra analysis to investigate further how random matrices impact the
learning process. Finally, we discuss the biological plausibility of the
proposed algorithm, and how it can give rise to better computational models for
learning.

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy149/5041999?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Attention can be attracted reflexively by sensory signals, biased by learning or reward, or focused voluntarily based on momentary goals. When voluntary attention is focused by purely internal decision processes (will), rather than instructions via external cues, we call this “willed attention.” In prior work, we reported ERP and fMRI correlates of willed spatial attention in trial-by-trial cuing tasks. Here we further investigated the oscillatory mechanisms of willed attention by contrasting the event-related EEG spectrogram between instructional and choice cues. Two experiments were conducted at 2 different sites using the same visuospatial attention paradigm. Consistent between the 2 experiments, we found increases in frontal theta power (starting at ~500 ms post cue) for willed attention relative to instructed attention. This frontal theta increase was accompanied by increased frontal–parietal theta-band coherence and bidirectional Granger causality. Additionally, the onset of attention-related posterior alpha power lateralization was delayed in willed attention relative to instructed attention, and the amount of delay was related to the timing of frontal theta increase. These results, replicated across 2 experiments, suggest that theta oscillations are the neuronal signals indexing decision-making in the frontal cortex, and mediating reciprocal communications between the frontal executive and parietal attentional control regions during willed attention.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Studies of synapses are available for different brain regions of several animal species including non-human primates, but comparatively little is known about their quantitative morphology in humans. Here, synaptic boutons in Layer 5 (L5) of the human temporal lobe (TL) neocortex were investigated in biopsy tissue, using fine-scale electron microscopy, and quantitative three-dimensional reconstructions. The size and organization of the presynaptic active zones (PreAZs), postsynaptic densities (PSDs), and that of the 3 distinct pools of synaptic vesicles (SVs) were particularly analyzed. L5 synaptic boutons were medium-sized (~6 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) with a single but relatively large PreAZ (~0.3 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). They contained a total of ~1500 SVs/bouton, ~20 constituting the putative readily releasable pool (RRP), ~180 the recycling pool (RP), and the remainder, the resting pool. The PreAZs, PSDs, and vesicle pools are ~3-fold larger than those of CNS synapses in other species. Astrocytic processes reached the synaptic cleft and may regulate the glutamate concentration. Profound differences exist between synapses in human TL neocortex and those described in various species, particularly in the size and geometry of PreAZs and PSDs, the large RRP/RP, and the astrocytic ensheathment suggesting high synaptic efficacy, strength, and modulation of synaptic transmission at human synapses.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Human brain anatomical and resting-state functional connectivity have been comprehensively portrayed using MRI, which are termed anatomical and functional connectomes. A systematic examination of tasks modulated whole brain functional connectivity, which we term as task connectome, is still lacking. We analyzed 6 block-designed and 1 event-related designed functional MRI data, and examined whole-brain task modulated connectivity in various task domains, including emotion, reward, language, relation, social cognition, working memory, and inhibition. By using psychophysiological interaction between pairs of regions from the whole brain, we identified statistically significant task modulated connectivity in 4 tasks between their experimental and respective control conditions. Task modulated connectivity was found not only between regions that were activated during the task but also regions that were not activated or deactivated, suggesting a broader involvement of brain regions in a task than indicated by simple regional activations. Decreased functional connectivity was observed in all the 4 tasks and sometimes reduced connectivity was even between regions that were both activated during the task. This suggests that brain regions that are activated together do not necessarily work together. The current study demonstrates the comprehensive task connectomes of 4 tasks, and suggested complex relationships between regional activations and connectivity changes.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Age Differentiation within Gray Matter, White Matter, and between Memory and White Matter in an Adult Life Span Cohort</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/25/5826?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is well established that brain structures and cognitive functions change across the life span. A long-standing hypothesis called &quot;age differentiation&quot; additionally posits that the relations between cognitive functions also change with age. To date, however, evidence for age-related differentiation is mixed, and no study has examined differentiation of the relationship between brain and cognition. Here we use multigroup structural equation models (SEMs) and SEM trees to study differences within and between brain and cognition across the adult life span (18–88 years) in a large (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 646, closely matched across sexes), population-derived sample of healthy human adults from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cam-can.org&quot;&gt;www.cam-can.org&lt;/a&gt;). After factor analyses of gray matter volume (from T1- and T2-weighted MRI) and white matter organization (fractional anisotropy from diffusion-weighted MRI), we found evidence for the differentiation of gray and white matter, such that the covariance between brain factors decreased with age. However, we found no evidence for age differentiation among fluid intelligence, language, and memory, suggesting a relatively stable covariance pattern among cognitive factors. Finally, we observed a specific pattern of age differentiation between brain and cognitive factors, such that a white matter factor, which loaded most strongly on the hippocampal cingulum, became less correlated with memory performance in later life. These patterns are compatible with the reorganization of cognitive functions in the face of neural decline, and/or with the emergence of specific subpopulations in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The theory of age differentiation posits age-related changes in the relationships among cognitive domains, either weakening (differentiation) or strengthening (dedifferentiation), but evidence for this hypothesis is mixed. Using age-varying covariance models in a large cross-sectional adult life span sample, we found age-related reductions in the covariance among both brain measures (neural differentiation), but no covariance change among cognitive factors of fluid intelligence, language, and memory. We also observed evidence of uncoupling (differentiation) between a white matter factor and cognitive factors in older age, most strongly for memory. Together, our findings support age-related differentiation as a complex, multifaceted pattern that differs for brain and cognition, and discuss several mechanisms that might explain the changing relationship between brain and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Optogenetic Inhibition of CGRP{alpha} Sensory Neurons Reveals Their Distinct Roles in Neuropathic and Incisional Pain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/25/5807?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cutaneous somatosensory neurons convey innocuous and noxious mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli from peripheral tissues to the CNS. Among these are nociceptive neurons that express calcitonin gene-related peptide-α (CGRPα). The role of peripheral CGRPα neurons (CANs) in acute and injury-induced pain has been studied using diphtheria toxin ablation, but their functional roles remain controversial. Because ablation permanently deletes a neuronal population, compensatory changes may ensue that mask the physiological or pathophysiological roles of CANs, particularly for injuries that occur after ablation. Therefore, we sought to define the role of intact CANs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; under baseline and injury conditions by using noninvasive transient optogenetic inhibition. We assessed pain behavior longitudinally from acute to chronic time points. We generated adult male and female mice that selectively express the outward rectifying proton pump archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) in CANs, and inhibited their peripheral cutaneous terminals in models of neuropathic (spared nerve injury) and inflammatory (skin-muscle incision) pain using transdermal light activation of Arch. After nerve injury, brief activation of Arch reversed the chronic mechanical, cold, and heat hypersensitivity, alleviated the spontaneous pain, and reversed the sensitized mechanical currents in primary afferent somata. In contrast, Arch inhibition of CANs did not alter incision-induced hypersensitivity. Instead, incision-induced mechanical and heat hypersensitivity was alleviated by peripheral blockade of CGRPα peptide-receptor signaling. These results reveal that CANs have distinct roles in the time course of pain during neuropathic and incisional injuries and suggest that targeting peripheral CANs or CGRPα peptide-receptor signaling could selectively treat neuropathic or postoperative pain, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The contribution of sensory afferent CGRPα neurons (CANs) to neuropathic and inflammatory pain is controversial. Here, we left CANs intact during neuropathic and perioperative incision injury by using transient transdermal optogenetic inhibition of CANs. We found that peripheral CANs are required for neuropathic mechanical, cold, and heat hypersensitivity, spontaneous pain, and sensitization of mechanical currents in afferent somata. However, they are dispensable for incisional pain transmission. In contrast, peripheral pharmacological inhibition of CGRPα peptide-receptor signaling alleviated the incisional mechanical and heat hypersensitivity, but had no effect on neuropathic pain. These results show that CANs have distinct roles in neuropathic and incisional pain and suggest that their targeting via novel peripheral treatments may selectively alleviate neuropathic versus incisional pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neuroanatomy of the vmPFC and dlPFC Predicts Individual Differences in Cognitive Regulation During Dietary Self-Control Across Regulation Strategies</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/25/5799?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Making healthy food choices is challenging for many people. Individuals differ greatly in their ability to follow health goals in the face of temptation, but it is unclear what underlies such differences. Using voxel-based morphometry, we investigated in healthy humans (i.e., men and women) the links between structural variation in gray matter volume and individuals' level of success in shifting toward healthier food choices. We combined MRI and choice data into a joint dataset by pooling across three independent studies that used a task prompting participants to explicitly focus on the healthiness of food items before making their food choices. Within this dataset, we found that individual differences in gray matter volume in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) predicted regulatory success. We extended and confirmed these initial findings by predicting regulatory success out of sample and across tasks in a second dataset requiring participants to apply a different regulation strategy that entailed distancing from cravings for unhealthy, appetitive foods. Our findings suggest that neuroanatomical markers in the vmPFC and dlPFC generalized to different forms of dietary regulation strategies across participant groups. They provide novel evidence that structural differences in neuroanatomy of two key regions for valuation and its control, the vmPFC and dlPFC, predict an individual's ability to exert control in dietary choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dieting involves regulating food choices to eat healthier foods and fewer unhealthy foods. People differ dramatically in their ability to achieve or maintain this regulation, but it is unclear why. Here, we show that individuals with more gray matter volume in the dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex are better at exercising dietary self-control. This relationship was observed across four different studies examining two different forms of dietary self-regulation, suggesting that neuroanatomical differences in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may represent a general marker for self-control abilities. These results identify candidate neuroanatomical markers for dieting success and failure, and suggest potential targets for therapies aimed at preventing or treating obesity and related eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Optogenetic Activation of Colon Epithelium of the Mouse Produces High-Frequency Bursting in Extrinsic Colon Afferents and Engages Visceromotor Responses</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/25/5788?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epithelial cells of the colon provide a vital interface between the internal environment (lumen of the colon) and colon parenchyma. To examine epithelial–neuronal signaling at this interface, we analyzed mice in which channelrhodopsin (ChR2) was targeted to either TRPV1-positive afferents or to villin-expressing colon epithelial cells. Expression of a ChR2-EYFP fusion protein was directed to either primary sensory neurons or to colon epithelial cells by crossing Ai32 mice with TRPV1-Cre or villin-Cre mice, respectively. An &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; preparation of the colon was used for single-fiber analysis of colon sensory afferents of the pelvic nerve. Afferents were characterized using previously described criteria as mucosal, muscular, muscular-mucosal, or serosal and then tested for blue light-induced activation. Light activation of colon epithelial cells produced robust firing of action potentials, similar to that elicited by physiologic stimulation (e.g., circumferential stretch), in 50.5% of colon afferents of mice homozygous for ChR2 expression. Light-induced activity could be reduced or abolished in most fibers using a cocktail of purinergic receptor blockers suggesting ATP release by the epithelium contributed to generation of sensory neuron action potentials. Using electromyographic recording of visceromotor responses we found that light stimulation of the colon epithelium evoked behavioral responses in Vil-ChR2 mice that was similar to that seen with balloon distension of the colon. These &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data indicate that light stimulation of colon epithelial cells alone, without added mechanical or chemical stimuli, can directly activate colon afferents and elicit behavioral responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Abdominal pain that accompanies inflammatory diseases of the bowel is particularly vexing because it can occur without obvious changes in the structure or inflammatory condition of the colon. Pain reflects abnormal sensory neuron activity that may be controlled in part by release of substances from lining epithelial cells. In support of this mechanism we determined that blue-light stimulation of channelrhodopsin-expressing colon epithelial cells could evoke action potential firing in sensory neurons and produce changes in measures of behavioral sensitivity. Thus, activity of colon epithelial cells alone, without added mechanical or chemical stimuli, is sufficient to activate pain-sensing neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Correlated Gene Expression and Anatomical Communication Support Synchronized Brain Activity in the Mouse Functional Connectome</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/25/5774?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognition and behavior depend on synchronized intrinsic brain activity that is organized into functional networks across the brain. Research has investigated how anatomical connectivity both shapes and is shaped by these networks, but not how anatomical connectivity interacts with intra-areal molecular properties to drive functional connectivity. Here, we present a novel linear model to explain functional connectivity by integrating systematically obtained measurements of axonal connectivity, gene expression, and resting-state functional connectivity MRI in the mouse brain. The model suggests that functional connectivity arises from both anatomical links and inter-areal similarities in gene expression. By estimating these effects, we identify anatomical modules in which correlated gene expression and anatomical connectivity support functional connectivity. Along with providing evidence that not all genes equally contribute to functional connectivity, this research establishes new insights regarding the biological underpinnings of coordinated brain activity measured by BOLD fMRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Efforts at characterizing the functional connectome with fMRI have risen exponentially over the last decade. Yet despite this rise, the biological underpinnings of these functional measurements are still primarily unknown. The current report begins to fill this void by investigating the molecular underpinnings of the functional connectome through an integration of systematically obtained structural information and gene expression data throughout the rodent brain. We find that both white matter connectivity and similarity in regional gene expression relate to resting-state functional connectivity. The current report furthers our understanding of the biological underpinnings of the functional connectome and provides a linear model that can be used to streamline preclinical animal studies of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Dynamics of Variable Grasp-Movement Preparation in the Macaque Frontoparietal Network</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/25/5759?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our voluntary grasping actions lie on a continuum between immediate action and waiting for the right moment, depending on the context. Therefore, studying grasping requires an investigation into how preparation time affects this process. Two macaque monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;; one male, one female) performed a grasping task with a short instruction followed by an immediate or delayed go cue (0–1300 ms) while we recorded in parallel from neurons in the grasp preparation relevant area F5 that is part of the ventral premotor cortex, and the anterior intraparietal area (AIP). Initial population dynamics followed a fixed trajectory in the neural state space unique to each grip type, reflecting unavoidable movement selection, then diverged depending on the delay, reaching unique states not achieved for immediately cued movements. Population activity in the AIP was less dynamic, whereas F5 activity continued to evolve throughout the delay. Interestingly, neuronal populations from both areas allowed for a readout tracking subjective anticipation of the go cue that predicted single-trial reaction time. However, the prediction of reaction time was better from F5 activity. Intriguingly, activity during movement initiation clustered into two trajectory groups, corresponding to movements that were either &quot;as fast as possible&quot; or withheld movements, demonstrating a widespread state shift in the frontoparietal grasping network when movements must be withheld. Our results reveal how dissociation between immediate and delay-specific preparatory activity, as well as differentiation between cortical areas, is possible through population-level analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sometimes when we move, we consciously plan our movements. At other times, we move instantly, seemingly with no planning at all. Yet, it's unclear how preparation for movements along this spectrum of planned and seemingly unplanned movement differs in the brain. Two macaque monkeys made reach-to-grasp movements after varying amounts of preparation time while we recorded from the premotor and parietal cortex. We found that the initial response to a grasp instruction was specific to the required movement, but not to the preparation time, reflecting required movement selection. However, when more preparation time was given, neural activity achieved unique states that likely related to withholding movements and anticipation of movement, shedding light on the roles of the premotor and parietal cortex in grasp planning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Persistent but Labile Synaptic Plasticity at Excitatory Synapses</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/25/5750?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Short-term synaptic plasticity contributes to many computations in the brain and allows synapses to keep a finite record of recent activity. Here we have investigated the mechanisms underlying an intriguing form of short-term plasticity termed labile LTP, at hippocampal and PFC synapses in male rats and male and female mice. In the hippocampus, labile LTP is triggered by high-frequency activation of presynaptic axons and is rapidly discharged with further activation of those axons. However, if the synapses are quiescent, they remain potentiated until further presynaptic activation. To distinguish labile LTP from NMDAR-dependent forms of potentiation, we blocked NMDARs in all experiments. Labile LTP was synapse-specific and was accompanied by a decreased paired pulse ratio, consistent with an increased release probability. Presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and protein kinase activation during the tetanus appeared to be required for its initiation. Labile LTP was not reversed by a PKC inhibitor and did not require either RIM1α or synaptotagmin-7, proteins implicated in other forms of presynaptic short-term plasticity. Similar NMDAR-independent potentiation could be elicited at synapses in mPFC. Labile LTP allows for rapid information storage that is erased under controlled circumstances and could have a role in a variety of hippocampal and prefrontal cortical computations related to short-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Changes in synaptic strength are thought to represent information storage relevant to particular nervous system tasks. A single synapse can exhibit multiple overlapping forms of plasticity that shape information transfer from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons. Here we investigate the mechanisms underlying labile LTP, an NMDAR-independent form of plasticity induced at hippocampal synapses. The potentiation is maintained for long periods as long as the synapses are infrequently active, but with regular activation, the synapses are depotentiated. Similar NMDAR-independent potentiation can also be induced at L2/3-to-L5 synapses in mPFC. Labile LTP requires a rise in presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and protein kinase activation but is unaffected in RIM1α or synaptotagmin-7 mutant mice. Labile LTP may contribute to short-term or working memory in hippocampus and mPFC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cortical Oscillatory Mechanisms Supporting the Control of Human Social-Emotional Actions</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/25/5739?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) is involved in regulating social–emotional behavior, presumably by modulating effective connectivity with downstream parietal, limbic, and motor cortices. Regulating that connectivity might rely on theta-band oscillations (4–8 Hz), a brain rhythm known to create overlapping periods of excitability between distant regions by temporally releasing neurons from inhibition. Here, we used MEG to understand how aPFC theta-band oscillations implement control over prepotent social–emotional behaviors; that is, the control over automatically elicited approach and avoidance actions. Forty human male participants performed a social approach–avoidance task in which they approached or avoided visually displayed emotional faces (happy or angry) by pulling or pushing a joystick. Approaching angry and avoiding happy faces (incongruent condition) requires rapid application of cognitive control to override prepotent habitual action tendencies to approach appetitive and to avoid aversive situations. In the time window before response delivery, trial-by-trial variations in aPFC theta-band power (6 Hz) predicted reaction time increases during emotional control and were inversely related to beta-band power (14–22 Hz) over parietofrontal cortex. In sensorimotor areas contralateral to the moving hand, premovement gamma-band rhythms (60–90 Hz) were stronger during incongruent than congruent trials, with power increases phase locked to peaks of the aPFC theta-band oscillations. These findings define a mechanistic relation between cortical areas involved in implementing rapid control over human social–emotional behavior. The aPFC may bias neural processing toward rule-driven actions and away from automatic emotional tendencies by coordinating tonic disinhibition and phasic enhancement of parietofrontal circuits involved in action selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Being able to control social–emotional behavior is crucial for successful participation in society, as is illustrated by the severe social and occupational difficulties experienced by people suffering from social motivational disorders such as social anxiety. In this study, we show that theta-band oscillations in the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC), which are thought to provide temporal organization for neural firing during communication between distant brain areas, facilitate this control by linking aPFC to parietofrontal beta-band and sensorimotor gamma-band oscillations involved in action selection. These results contribute to a mechanistic understanding of cognitive control over automatic social–emotional action and point to frontal theta-band oscillations as a possible target of rhythmic neurostimulation techniques during treatment for social anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Interplay Between Spike-Time and Spike-Rate Modes in the Auditory Nerve Encodes Tone-In-Noise Threshold</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/25/5727?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) encode pure tones through two modes of coding, spike time and spike rate, depending on the tone frequency. In response to a low-frequency tone, ANF firing is phase locked to the sinusoidal waveform. Because time coding vanishes with an increase in the tone frequency, high-frequency tone coding relies on the spike rate of the ANFs. Adding a continuous broadband noise to a tone compresses the rate intensity function of ANFs and shifts its dynamic range toward higher intensities. Therefore, the ANFs with high-threshold/low-spontaneous rate (SR) are thought to contribute to behavioral tone detection in noise. However, this theory relies on the discharge rate of the ANFs. The direct comparison with the masking threshold through spike timing, irrespective of the spontaneous rate, has not so far been investigated. Taking advantage of a unique proxy to quantify the spike synchrony (i.e., the shuffle autocorrelogram), we show in female gerbils that high-SR ANFs are more adapted to encode low-frequency thresholds through temporal code, giving them a strong robustness in noise. By comparing behavioral thresholds measured using prepulse inhibition of the acoustical startle reflex with population thresholds calculated from ANFs pooled per octave band, we show that threshold-based spike timing provides a better estimate of behavioral thresholds in the low-frequency range, whereas the high-frequency behavioral thresholds rely on the spiking rate, particularly in noise. This emphasizes the complementarity of temporal and rate modes to code tone-in-noise thresholds over a large range of frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; There is a general agreement that high-threshold/low-spontaneous rate (SR) auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) are of prime importance for tone detection in noise. However, this theory is based on the discharge rate of the fibers. Comparing the behavioral thresholds and single ANF thresholds shows that this is only true in the high-frequency range of tone stimulations. In the low-frequency range of tones (up to 2.7 kHz in the gerbil), the most sensitive ANFs (high-SR fibers) carry neural information through a spike-timing mode, even for noise in which tones do not induce a noticeable increment in the spike rate. This emphasizes the interplay between spike-time and spike-rate modes in the auditory nerve to encode tone-in-noise threshold over a large range of tone frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abnormal astrocyte-neuronal interactions are also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases associated with impaired learning and memory. However, little is known about astrocyte-mediated mechanisms that regulate learning and memory. Here, we propose astrocytic ephrin-B1 as a regulator of synaptogenesis in adult hippocampus and mouse learning behaviors. We found that astrocyte-specific ablation of ephrin-B1 in male mice triggers an increase in the density of immature dendritic spines and excitatory synaptic sites in the adult CA1 hippocampus. However, the prevalence of immature dendritic spines is associated with decreased evoked postsynaptic firing responses in CA1 pyramidal neurons, suggesting impaired maturation of these newly formed and potentially silent synapses or increased excitatory drive on the inhibitory neurons resulting in the overall decreased postsynaptic firing. Nevertheless, astrocyte-specific ephrin-B1 knock-out male mice exhibit normal acquisition of fear memory but enhanced contextual fear memory recall. In contrast, overexpression of astrocytic ephrin-B1 in the adult CA1 hippocampus leads to the loss of dendritic spines, reduced excitatory input, and impaired contextual memory retention. Our results suggest that astrocytic ephrin-B1 may compete with neuronal ephrin-B1 and mediate excitatory synapse elimination through its interactions with neuronal EphB receptors. Indeed, a deletion of neuronal EphB receptors impairs the ability of astrocytes expressing functional ephrin-B1 to engulf synaptosomes &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Our findings demonstrate that astrocytic ephrin-B1 regulates long-term contextual memory by restricting new synapse formation in the adult hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; These studies address a gap in our knowledge of astrocyte-mediated regulation of learning and memory by unveiling a new role for ephrin-B1 in astrocytes and elucidating new mechanisms by which astrocytes regulate learning. Our studies explore the mechanisms underlying astrocyte regulation of hippocampal circuit remodeling during learning using new genetic tools that target ephrin-B signaling in astrocytes &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. On a subcellular level, astrocytic ephrin-B1 may compete with neuronal ephrin-B1 and trigger astrocyte-mediated elimination of EphB receptor-containing synapses. Given the role EphB receptors play in neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, these findings establish a foundation for future studies of astrocyte-mediated synaptogenesis in clinically relevant conditions that can help to guide the development of clinical applications for a variety of neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ischemic Brain Injury Leads to Brain Edema via Hyperthermia-Induced TRPV4 Activation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/25/5700?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain edema is characterized by an increase in net brain water content, which results in an increase in brain volume. Although brain edema is associated with a high fatality rate, the cellular and molecular processes of edema remain largely unclear. Here, we developed an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model of ischemic stroke-induced edema in which male mouse brain slices were treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to mimic ischemia. We continuously measured the cross-sectional area of the brain slice for 150 min under macroscopic microscopy, finding that OGD induces swelling of brain slices. OGD-induced swelling was prevented by pharmacologically blocking or genetically knocking out the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), a member of the thermosensitive TRP channel family. Because TRPV4 is activated at around body temperature and its activation is enhanced by heating, we next elevated the temperature of the perfusate in the recording chamber, finding that hyperthermia induces swelling via TRPV4 activation. Furthermore, using the temperature-dependent fluorescence lifetime of a fluorescent-thermosensitive probe, we confirmed that OGD treatment increases the temperature of brain slices through the activation of glutamate receptors. Finally, we found that brain edema following traumatic brain injury was suppressed in TRPV4-deficient male mice &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, our study proposes a novel mechanism: hyperthermia activates TRPV4 and induces brain edema after ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Brain edema is characterized by an increase in net brain water content, which results in an increase in brain volume. Although brain edema is associated with a high fatality rate, the cellular and molecular processes of edema remain unclear. Here, we developed an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model of ischemic stroke-induced edema in which mouse brain slices were treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation. Using this system, we showed that the increase in brain temperature and the following activation of the thermosensitive cation channel TRPV4 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 4) are involved in the pathology of edema. Finally, we confirmed that TRPV4 is involved in brain edema &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; using TRPV4-deficient mice, concluding that hyperthermia activates TRPV4 and induces brain edema after ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Identification and Characterization of a Novel Spontaneously Active Bursty GABAergic Interneuron in the Mouse Striatum</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/25/5688?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The recent availability of different transgenic mouse lines coupled with other modern molecular techniques has led to the discovery of an unexpectedly large cellular diversity and synaptic specificity in striatal interneuronal circuitry. Prior research has described three spontaneously active interneuron types in mouse striatal slices: the cholinergic interneuron, the neuropeptide Y-low threshold spike interneuron, and the tyrosine hydroxylase interneurons (THINs). Using transgenic Htr3a-Cre mice, we now characterize a fourth population of spontaneously active striatal GABAergic interneurons termed spontaneously active bursty interneurons (SABIs) because of their unique burst-firing pattern in cell-attached recordings. Although they bear some qualitative similarity in intrinsic electrophysiological properties to THINs in whole-cell recordings, detailed analysis revealed significant differences in many intrinsic properties and in their morphology. Furthermore, all previously identified striatal GABAergic interneurons have been shown to innervate striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs), contributing to the suggestion that the principal function of striatal GABAergic interneurons is to provide feedforward inhibition to SPNs. Here, very surprisingly, paired recordings show that SABIs do not innervate SPNs significantly. Further, optogenetic inhibition of striatal Htr3a-Cre interneurons triggers barrages of IPSCs in SPNs. We hypothesize that these IPSCs result from disinhibition of a population of GABAergic interneurons with activity that is constitutively suppressed by the SABIs. We suggest that the SABIs represent the first example of a striatal interneuron-selective interneuron and, further, that their existence, along with previously defined interneuronal networks, may participate in the formation of SPN ensembles observed by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Before ~2010, the main function of the three known subtypes of striatal GABAergic interneurons was assumed to mediate feedforward inhibition of the spiny neurons (SPNs). During the past decade, we and others have described several novel populations of striatal GABAergic interneurons and their synaptic connections and have shown that striatal interneurons and SPNs interact through extensive and highly cell-type-specific connections that form specialized networks. Here, we describe a novel population of striatal GABAergic interneuron and provide several lines of evidence suggesting that it represents the first interneuron-selective interneuron in striatum. Striatal interneurons and their synaptic connections are suggested to play an important role in the formation of ensembles of striatal SPNs interconnected by inhibitory axon collaterals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Voltage-Gated Calcium Influx Modifies Cholinergic Inhibition of Inner Hair Cells in the Immature Rat Cochlea</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/25/5677?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Until postnatal day (P) 12, inner hair cells of the rat cochlea are invested with both afferent and efferent synaptic connections. With the onset of hearing at P12, the efferent synapses disappear, and afferent (ribbon) synapses operate with greater efficiency. This change coincides with increased expression of voltage-gated potassium channels, the loss of calcium-dependent electrogenesis, and the onset of graded receptor potentials driven by sound. The transient efferent synapses include near-membrane postsynaptic cisterns thought to regulate calcium influx through the hair cell's α9-containing and α10-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This influx activates small-conductance Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (SK) channels. Serial-section electron microscopy of inner hair cells from two 9-d-old (male) rat pups revealed many postsynaptic efferent cisterns and presynaptic afferent ribbons whose average minimal separation in five cells ranged from 1.1 to 1.7 μm. Efferent synaptic function was studied in rat pups (age, 7–9 d) of either sex. The duration of these SK channel-mediated IPSCs was increased by enhanced calcium influx through L-type voltage-gated channels, combined with ryanodine-sensitive release from internal stores—presumably the near-membrane postsynaptic cistern. These data support the possibility that inner hair cell calcium electrogenesis modulates the efficacy of efferent inhibition during the maturation of inner hair cell synapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Strict calcium buffering is essential for cellular function. This problem is especially acute for compact hair cells where increasing cytoplasmic calcium promotes the opposing functions of closely adjoining afferent and efferent synapses. The near-membrane postsynaptic cistern at efferent synapses segregates synaptic calcium signals by acting as a dynamic calcium store. The hair cell serves as an informative model for synapses with postsynaptic cisterns (C synapses) found in central neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: WT1-Expressing Interneurons Regulate Left-Right Alternation during Mammalian Locomotor Activity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/25/5666?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The basic pattern of activity underlying stepping in mammals is generated by a neural network located in the caudal spinal cord. Within this network, the specific circuitry coordinating left–right alternation has been shown to involve several groups of molecularly defined interneurons. Here we characterize a population of spinal neurons that express the Wilms' tumor 1 (&lt;i&gt;WT1&lt;/i&gt;) gene and investigate their role during locomotor activity in mice of both sexes. We demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;WT1&lt;/i&gt;-expressing cells are located in the ventromedial region of the spinal cord of mice and are also present in the human spinal cord. In the mouse, these cells are inhibitory, project axons to the contralateral spinal cord, terminate in close proximity to other commissural interneuron subtypes, and are essential for appropriate left–right alternation during locomotion. In addition to identifying &lt;i&gt;WT1&lt;/i&gt;-expressing interneurons as a key component of the locomotor circuitry, this study provides insight into the manner in which several populations of molecularly defined interneurons are interconnected to generate coordinated motor activity on either side of the body during stepping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we characterize &lt;i&gt;WT1&lt;/i&gt;-expressing spinal interneurons in mice and demonstrate that they are commissurally projecting and inhibitory. Silencing of this neuronal population during a locomotor task results in a complete breakdown of left–right alternation, whereas flexor-extensor alternation was not significantly affected. Axons of &lt;i&gt;WT1&lt;/i&gt; neurons are shown to terminate nearby commissural interneurons, which coordinate motoneuron activity during locomotion, and presumably regulate their activity. Finally, the &lt;i&gt;WT1&lt;/i&gt; gene is shown to be present in the spinal cord of humans, raising the possibility of functional homology between these species. This study not only identifies a key component of the locomotor circuitry but also begins to unravel the connectivity among the growing number of molecularly defined interneurons that comprise this neural network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Metaplasticity in the Visual Cortex: Crosstalk Between Visual Experience and Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/25/5649?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metaplasticity is the regulation of synaptic plasticity based on the history of previous synaptic activation. This concept was formulated after observing that synaptic changes in the visual cortex are not fixed, but dynamic and dependent on the history of visual information flux. In visual cortical neurons, sustained synaptic stimulation activate the enzymatic complex NOX2, resulting in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). NOX2 is the main molecular structure responsible for translating neural activity into redox modulation of intracellular signaling pathways involved in plastic changes. Here, we studied the interaction between NOX2 and visual experience as metaplastic factors regulating synaptic plasticity at the supergranular layers of the mouse visual cortex. We found that genetic inhibition of NOX2 reverses the polarizing effects of dark rearing from LTP to LTD. In addition, we demonstrate that this process relies on changes in the NMDA receptor functioning. Altogether, this work indicates a role of ROS in the activity-dependent regulation of cortical synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Synaptic plasticity in the visual cortex is modulated by the history of sensory experience and this modulation has been defined as metaplasticity. Dark rearing facilitates synaptic potentiation as a mechanism optimizing the range of synaptic modification. This process requires the production of reactive oxygen species mediated by the enzymatic complex NOX2. If the activity of NOX2 is inhibited, then visual deprivation results in synaptic depression. These findings increase our knowledge about metaplasticity and help in our understanding of how neural activity modulates cellular mechanisms of synaptic change.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Neurons Specifically Activated by Fear Learning in Lateral Amygdala Display Increased Synaptic Strength</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0114-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The lateral amygdala (LA) plays a critical role in the formation of fear conditioned associative memories. Previous studies have used c-&lt;i&gt;fos&lt;/i&gt; regulated expression to identify a spatially restricted population of neurons within the LA that is specifically activated by fear learning. These neurons are likely to be a part of a memory engram but, to date, functional evidence for this has been lacking. We show that neurons within a spatially restricted region of the LA had an increase in both the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSC) when compared to neurons recorded from home-cage control mice. We then more specifically addressed if this increased synaptic activity was limited to learning-activated neurons. Using a &lt;i&gt;fos&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;tau-LacZ&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;/i&gt;) transgenic mouse line, we developed a fluorescence-based method of identifying and recording from neurons activated by fear learning (&lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) in acute brain slices. An increase in frequency and amplitude of sPSCs was observed in &lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neurons when compared to non-activated &lt;i&gt;FTL&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neurons in fear conditioned mice. No learning-induced changes were observed in the action potential input-output relationships. These findings support the idea that a discrete LA neuron population forms part of a memory engram through changes in synaptic connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The lateral amygdala (LA) is critical for the formation of associative fear memories, such as those formed by fear conditioning. A subset of neurons in LA are activated by fear conditioning suggesting that they may be part of a memory engram. However, there is no functional evidence to support this view. Electrophysiological characterisation of LA neurons shows that the frequency and amplitude of synaptic events increase following fear conditioning. A method based on β-galactosidase as a reporter was developed to locate activated neurons in acute slice. An increase in frequency and amplitude of synaptic events was observed in activated compared to non-activated neurons supporting the idea that a discrete LA neuron population forms part of a memory engram.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07365</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural electromagnetic (EM) signals recorded non-invasively from individual
human subjects vary in complexity and magnitude. Nonetheless, variation in
neural activity has been difficult to quantify and interpret, due to complex,
broad-band features in the frequency domain. Studying signals recorded with
magnetoencephalography (MEG) from healthy young adult subjects while in resting
and active states, a systematic framework inspired by thermodynamics is applied
to neural EM signals. Despite considerable inter-subject variation in terms of
spectral entropy and energy across time epochs, data support the existence of a
robust and linear relationship defining an effective state equation, with
higher energy and lower entropy in the resting state compared to active,
consistently across subjects. Mechanisms underlying the emergence of
relationships between empirically measured effective state functions are
further investigated using a model network of coupled oscillators, suggesting
an interplay between noise and coupling strength can account for coherent
variation of empirically observed quantities.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of the big restrictions in brain computer interface field is the very

with such limited data. Inspired by generative adversarial networks, we propose
a conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial (cDCGAN) Networks
method to generate more artificial EEG signal automatically for data
augmentation to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks in
brain computer interface field and overcome the small training dataset
problems. We evaluate the proposed cDCGAN method on BCI competition dataset of
motor imagery. The results show that the generated artificial EEG data from
Gaussian noise can learn the features from raw EEG data and has no less than
the classification accuracy of raw EEG data in the testing dataset. Also by
using generated artificial data can effectively improve classification accuracy
at the same model with limited training data.

We focus particularly on neural coding in the context of topographic maps and spontaneous activity, as well as receptive field and circuit development, drawing on examples from both mammalian visual cortex and fish optic tectum.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Systems modelling of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met interaction network predicts and prioritizes synergistic drug combinations for triple-negative breast cancer</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/lYpC_ByFRf0/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Sung-Young Shin, Anna-Katharina Müller, Nandini Verma, Sima Lev, Lan K. Nguyen&lt;/p&gt;

Prediction of drug combinations that effectively target cancer cells is a critical challenge for cancer therapy, in particular for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype with no effective targeted treatment. As signalling pathway networks critically control cancer cell behaviour, analysis of signalling network activity and crosstalk can help predict potent drug combinations and rational stratification of patients, thus bringing therapeutic and prognostic values. We have previously showed that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 is a downstream effector of EGFR and c-Met and demonstrated their crosstalk signalling in basal-like TNBC. Here we applied a systems modelling approach and developed a mechanistic model of the integrated EGFR-PYK2-c-Met signalling network to identify and prioritize potent drug combinations for TNBC. Model predictions validated by experimental data revealed that among six potential combinations of drug pairs targeting the central nodes of the network, including EGFR, c-Met, PYK2 and STAT3, co-targeting of EGFR and PYK2 and to a lesser extent of EGFR and c-Met yielded strongest synergistic effect. Importantly, the synergy in co-targeting EGFR and PYK2 was linked to switch-like cell proliferation-associated responses. Moreover, simulations of patient-specific models using public gene expression data of TNBC patients led to predictive stratification of patients into subgroups displaying distinct susceptibility to specific drug combinations. These results suggest that mechanistic systems modelling is a powerful approach for the rational design, prediction and prioritization of potent combination therapies for individual patients, thus providing a concrete step towards personalized treatment for TNBC and other tumour types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lYpC_ByFRf0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: dSTIM- and Ral/Exocyst-Mediated Synaptic Release from Pupal Dopaminergic Neurons Sustains Drosophila Flight</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0455-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Manifestation of appropriate behavior in adult animals requires developmental mechanisms that help in the formation of correctly wired neural circuits. Flight circuit development in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; requires store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) through the STIM/Orai pathway. SOCE-associated flight deficits in adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; derive extensively from regulation of gene expression in pupal neurons, and one such SOCE-regulated gene encodes the small GTPase &lt;i&gt;Ral&lt;/i&gt;. The cellular mechanism by which Ral helps in maturation of the flight circuit was not understood. Here, we show that knockdown of components of a Ral effector, the exocyst complex, in pupal neurons also leads to reduced flight bout durations, and this phenotype derives primarily from dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, synaptic release from pupal dopaminergic neurons is abrogated upon knockdown of dSTIM, Ral, or exocyst components. &lt;i&gt;Ral&lt;/i&gt; overexpression restores the diminished synaptic release of &lt;i&gt;dStim&lt;/i&gt; knockdown neurons as well as flight deficits associated with &lt;i&gt;dSTIM&lt;/i&gt; knockdown in dopaminergic neurons. These results identify Ral-mediated vesicular release as an effector mechanism of neuronal SOCE in pupal dopaminergic neurons with functional consequences on flight behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0128-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The mushroom body (MB) in insects is known as a major center for associative learning and memory, although exact locations for the correlating memory traces remain to be elucidated. Here, we asked whether presynaptic boutons of olfactory projection neurons (PNs) in the main input site of the MB undergo neuronal plasticity during classical odor-reward conditioning and correlate with the conditioned behavior. We simultaneously measured Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses in the boutons and conditioned behavioral responses to learned odors in honeybees. We found that the absolute amount of the neural change for the rewarded but not for the unrewarded odor was correlated with the behavioral learning rate across individuals. The temporal profile of the induced changes matched with odor response dynamics of the MB-associated inhibitory neurons, suggestive of activity modulation of boutons by this neural class. We hypothesize the circuit-specific neural plasticity relates to the learned value of the stimulus and underlies the conditioned behavior of the bees.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Increasing Motor Noise Impairs Reinforcement Learning in Healthy Individuals</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0050-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Motor variability from exploration is crucial for reinforcement learning as it allows the nervous system to find new task solutions. However, motor variability from noise can be detrimental to learning and may underlie slowed reinforcement learning performance observed in individuals with cerebellar damage. Here we examine whether artificially increasing noise in healthy individuals slows reinforcement learning in a similar manner to that seen in cerebellar patients. Participants used binary reinforcement to learn to rotate their reach angle in a series of directions. By comparing task performance between conditions with different levels of added noise, we show that adding a high level of noise – matched to a group of cerebellar patients – slows learning. In additional experiments we show that the detrimental effect of noise may lie in reinforcing incorrect behavior, rather than not reinforcing correct behavior. By comparing performance between healthy participants with added noise and a group of cerebellar patients, we found that added noise does not slow the control group’s learning to the same degree observed in the patient group. Using a mechanistic model, we show that added noise in the present study matched patients’ motor noise and total learning. However, increased exploration in the control group relative to the cerebellar group supports faster learning. Our results suggest that motor noise slows reinforcement learning by impairing the mapping of reward to the correct action and this may underlie deficits induced by cerebellar damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the contribution of reinforcement mechanisms to human motor learning has been the subject of renewed interest. Exploration (i.e. varying one’s movement) is crucial to reinforcement learning. Yet, motor variability can arise from multiple sources and the manner in which these influence learning remains poorly understood. Here, we show that artificially increasing motor noise variability slows reinforcement learning in a similar manner to that observed in people with cerebellar damage. Importantly, we show that the detrimental effect of noise may be the attribution of reinforcement to incorrect behavior, rather than not reinforcing correct behavior. These findings indicate that variability from noise may not be accessible to reinforcement learning mechanisms, which sheds light on the mechanism of deficit following cerebellar damage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fast and Accurate Multiclass Inference for MI-BCIs Using Large Multiscale Temporal and Spectral Features. (arXiv:1806.06823v2 [eess.SP] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06823</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurate, fast, and reliable multiclass classification of
electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a challenging task towards the
development of motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) systems. We
propose enhancements to different feature extractors, along with a support
vector machine (SVM) classifier, to simultaneously improve classification
accuracy and execution time during training and testing. We focus on the
well-known common spatial pattern (CSP) and Riemannian covariance methods, and
significantly extend these two feature extractors to multiscale temporal and
spectral cases. The multiscale CSP features achieve 73.70$\pm$15.90% (mean$\pm$
standard deviation across 9 subjects) classification accuracy that surpasses
the state-of-the-art method [1], 70.6$\pm$14.70%, on the 4-class BCI
competition IV-2a dataset. The Riemannian covariance features outperform the
CSP by achieving 74.27$\pm$15.5% accuracy and executing 9x faster in training
and 4x faster in testing. Using more temporal windows for Riemannian features
results in 75.47$\pm$12.8% accuracy with 1.6x faster testing than CSP.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans can experience fake body parts as theirs just by simple visuo-tactile
synchronous stimulation. This body-illusion is accompanied by a drift in the
perception of the real limb towards the fake limb, suggesting an update of body
estimation resulting from stimulation. This work compares body limb drifting
patterns of human participants, in a rubber hand illusion experiment, with the
end-effector estimation displacement of a multisensory robotic arm enabled with
predictive processing perception. Results show similar drifting patterns in
both human and robot experiments, and they also suggest that the perceptual
drift is due to prediction error fusion, rather than hypothesis selection. We
present body inference through prediction error minimization as one single
process that unites predictive coding and causal inference and that it is
responsible for the effects in perception when we are subjected to intermodal
sensory perturbations.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06765</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We focus on two supervised visual reasoning tasks whose labels encode a
semantic relational rule between two or more objects in an image: the MNIST
Parity task and the colorized Pentomino task. The objects in the images undergo
random translation, scaling, rotation and coloring transformations. Thus these
tasks involve invariant relational reasoning. We report uneven performance of
various deep CNN models on these two tasks. For the MNIST Parity task, we
report that the VGG19 model soundly outperforms a family of ResNet models.
Moreover, the family of ResNet models exhibits a general sensitivity to random
initialization for the MNIST Parity task. For the colorized Pentomino task, now
both the VGG19 and ResNet models exhibit sluggish optimization and very poor
test generalization, hovering around 30% test error. The CNN we tested all
learn hierarchies of fully distributed features and thus encode the distributed
representation prior. We are motivated by a hypothesis from cognitive
neuroscience which posits that the human visual cortex is modularized, and this
allows the visual cortex to learn higher order invariances. To this end, we
consider a modularized variant of the ResNet model, referred to as a Residual
Mixture Network (ResMixNet) which employs a mixture-of-experts architecture to
interleave distributed representations with more specialized, modular
representations. We show that very shallow ResMixNets are capable of learning
each of the two tasks well, attaining less than 2% and 1% test error on the
MNIST Parity and the colorized Pentomino tasks respectively. Most importantly,
the ResMixNet models are extremely parameter efficient: generalizing better
than various non-modular CNNs that have over 10x the number of parameters.
These experimental results support the hypothesis that modularity is a robust
prior for learning invariant relational reasoning.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal activity in the brain generates synchronous oscillations of the
Local Field Potential (LFP). The traditional analyses of the LFPs are based on
decomposing the signal into simpler components, such as sinusoidal harmonics.
However, a common drawback of such methods is that the decomposition primitives
are usually presumed from the onset, which may bias our understanding of the
signal's structure. Here, we introduce an alternative approach that allows an
impartial, high resolution, hands-off decomposition of the brain waves into a
small number of discrete, frequency-modulated oscillatory processes, which we
call oscillons. In particular, we demonstrate that mouse hippocampal LFP
contain a single oscillon that occupies the $\theta$-frequency band and a
couple of $\gamma$-oscillons that correspond, respectively, to slow and fast
$\gamma$-waves. Since the oscillons were identified empirically, they may
represent the actual, physical structure of synchronous oscillations in
neuronal ensembles, whereas Fourier-defined &quot;brain waves&quot; are nothing but
poorly resolved oscillons.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Wei-Ven Tee, Enrico Guarnera, Igor N. Berezovsky&lt;/p&gt;

The omnipresence of allosteric regulation together with the fundamental role of structural dynamics in this phenomenon have initiated a great interest to the detection of regulatory exosites and design of corresponding effectors. However, despite a general consensus on the key role of dynamics most of the earlier efforts on the prediction of allosteric sites are heavily crippled by the static nature of the underlying methods, which are either structure-based approaches seeking for deep surface pockets typical for “traditional” orthosteric drugs or sequence-based techniques exploiting the conservation of protein sequences. Because of the critical role of global protein dynamics in allosteric signaling, we investigate the hypothesis of reversibility in allosteric communication, according to which allosteric sites can be detected via the perturbation of the functional sites. The reversibility hypothesis is tested here using our structure-based perturbation model of allostery, which allows one to analyze the causality and energetics of allosteric communication. We validate the “reverse perturbation” hypothesis and its predictive power on a set of classical allosteric proteins, then, on the independent extended benchmark set. We also show that, in addition to known allosteric sites, the perturbation of the functional sites unravels rather extended protein regions, which can host latent regulatory exosites. These protein parts that are dynamically coupled with functional sites can also be used for inducing and tuning allosteric communication, and an exhaustive exploration of the per-residue contributions to allosteric effects can eventually lead to the optimal modulation of protein activity. The site-effector interactions necessary for a specific mode and level of allosteric communication can be fine-tuned by adjusting the site’s structure to an available effector molecule and by the design or selection of an appropriate ligand.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/13RpS-9zFXo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Chemokines and their receptors (members of the GPCR super-family) are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes and diseases; thus, understanding the specificity of the chemokine receptor family could help develop new receptor specific drugs. Here, we explore the evolutionary mechanisms that led to the emergence of the chemokine receptors. Based on GPCR hierarchical classification, we analyzed nested GPCR sets with an eigen decomposition approach of the sequence covariation matrix and determined three key residues whose mutation was crucial for the emergence of the chemokine receptors and their subsequent divergence into homeostatic and inflammatory receptors. These residues are part of the allosteric sodium binding site. Their structural and functional roles were investigated by molecular dynamics simulations of CXCR4 and CCR5 as prototypes of homeostatic and inflammatory chemokine receptors, respectively. This study indicates that the three mutations crucial for the evolution of the chemokine receptors dramatically altered the sodium binding mode. In CXCR4, the sodium ion is tightly bound by four protein atoms and one water molecule. In CCR5, the sodium ion is mobile within the binding pocket and moves between different sites involving from one to three protein atoms and two to five water molecules. Analysis of chemokine receptor evolution reveals that a highly constrained sodium binding site characterized most ancient receptors, and that the constraints were subsequently loosened during the divergence of this receptor family. We discuss the implications of these findings for the evolution of the chemokine receptor functions and mechanisms of action.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sHjAbuefwKk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Deena R. Schmidt, Roberto F. Galán, Peter J. Thomas&lt;/p&gt;

Nerve cells produce electrical impulses (“spikes”) through the coordinated opening and closing of ion channels. Markov processes with voltage-dependent transition rates capture the stochasticity of spike generation at the cost of complex, time-consuming simulations. Schmandt and Galán introduced a novel method, based on the stochastic shielding approximation, as a fast, accurate method for generating approximate sample paths with excellent first and second moment agreement to exact stochastic simulations. We previously analyzed the mathematical basis for the method’s remarkable accuracy, and showed that for models with a Gaussian noise approximation, the stationary variance of the occupancy at each vertex in the ion channel state graph could be written as a sum of distinct contributions from each edge in the graph. We extend this analysis to arbitrary discrete population models with first-order kinetics. The resulting decomposition allows us to rank the “importance” of each edge’s contribution to the variance of the current under stationary conditions. In most cases, transitions between open (conducting) and closed (non-conducting) states make the greatest contributions to the variance, but there are exceptions. In a 5-state model of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, at low agonist concentration, a pair of “hidden” transitions (between two closed states) makes a greater contribution to the variance than any of the open-closed transitions. We exhaustively investigate this “edge importance reversal” phenomenon in simplified 3-state models, and obtain an exact formula for the contribution of each edge to the variance of the open state. Two conditions contribute to reversals: the opening rate should be faster than all other rates in the system, and the closed state leading to the opening rate should be sparsely occupied. When edge importance reversal occurs, current fluctuations are dominated by a slow noise component arising from the hidden transitions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o95TRa66Blg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The mechanistic details underlying the assembly of rod-shaped chromosomes during mitosis and how they segregate from each other to act as individually mobile units remain largely unknown. Here, we construct a coarse-grained physical model of chromosomal DNA and condensins, a class of large protein complexes that plays key roles in these processes. We assume that condensins have two molecular activities: consecutive loop formation in DNA and inter-condensin attractions. Our simulation demonstrates that both of these activities and their balancing acts are essential for the efficient shaping and segregation of mitotic chromosomes. Our results also demonstrate that the shaping and segregation processes are strongly correlated, implying their mechanistic coupling during mitotic chromosome assembly. Our results highlight the functional importance of inter-condensin attractions in chromosome shaping and segregation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P3LOaFhEytc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Nathaniel Mon Père, Tom Lenaerts, Jorge M. Pacheco, David Dingli&lt;/p&gt;

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal blood disorder characterized by hemolysis and a high risk of thrombosis, that is due to a deficiency in several cell surface proteins that prevent complement activation. Its origin has been traced to a somatic mutation in the PIG-A gene within hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). However, to date the question of how this mutant clone expands in size to contribute significantly to hematopoiesis remains under debate. One hypothesis posits the existence of a selective advantage of PIG-A mutated cells due to an immune mediated attack on normal HSC, but the evidence supporting this hypothesis is inconclusive. An alternative (and simpler) explanation attributes clonal expansion to neutral drift, in which case selection neither favours nor inhibits expansion of PIG-A mutated HSC. Here we examine the implications of the neutral drift model by numerically evolving a Markov chain for the probabilities of all possible outcomes, and investigated the possible occurrence and evolution, within this framework, of multiple independently arising clones within the HSC pool. Predictions of the model agree well with the known incidence of the disease and average age at diagnosis. Notwithstanding the slight difference in clonal expansion rates between our results and those reported in the literature, our model results lead to a relative stability of clone size when averaging multiple cases, in accord with what has been observed in human trials. The probability of a patient harbouring a second clone in the HSC pool was found to be extremely low (~10-8). Thus our results suggest that in clinical cases of PNH where two independent clones of mutant cells are observed, only one of those is likely to have originated in the HSC pool.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xkz6PT1hV1o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Increased Axonal Bouton Stability during Learning in the Mouse Model of MECP2 Duplication Syndrome</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0056-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt;-duplication syndrome is an X-linked form of syndromic autism caused by genomic duplication of the region encoding Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2. Mice overexpressing &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt; demonstrate social impairment, behavioral inflexibility, and altered patterns of learning and memory. Previous work showed abnormally increased stability of dendritic spines formed during motor training in the apical tuft of primary motor cortex (area M1) corticospinal neurons in the MECP2-duplication mouse model. In the current study, we measure the structural plasticity of axonal boutons in Layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neuron projections to layer 1 of area M1 during motor training. In wild-type littermate control mice we find that during rotarod training, bouton formation rate changes minimally, if at all, while bouton elimination rate more than doubles. Notably, the observed upregulation in bouton elimination with training is absent in &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt;-duplication mice. This result provides further evidence of an imbalance between structural stability and plasticity in this form of syndromic autism. Furthermore, the observation that axonal bouton elimination more than doubles with motor training in wild-type animals contrasts with the increase of dendritic spine consolidation observed in corticospinal neurons at the same layer. This dissociation suggests that different area M1 microcircuits may manifest different patterns of structural synaptic plasticity during motor training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Abnormal balance between synaptic stability and plasticity is a feature of several autism spectrum disorders, often corroborated by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies of dendritic spine turnover. Here we provide the first evidence that abnormally increased stability of axonal boutons, the presynaptic component of excitatory synapses, occurs during motor training in the &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt; duplication syndrome mouse model of autism. In contrast, in normal controls, axonal bouton elimination in L5 pyramidal neuron projections to layer 1 of area M1 more than doubles with motor training. The fact that axonal projection boutons get eliminated, while corticospinal dendritic spines get consolidated with motor training in layer 1 of area M1, suggests that structural plasticity manifestations differ across different M1 microcircuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Human neurons expressing mutations associated with neurodegenerative disease are becoming more widely available. Hence, developing assays capable of accurately detecting changes that occur early in the disease process and identifying therapeutics able to slow these changes should become ever more important. Using automated live cell imaging, we studied human motor neurons in the process of dying following neurotrophic factor withdrawal. We tracked different neuronal features, including cell body size, neurite length and number of nodes. In particular, measuring the number of nodes in individual neurons proved to be an accurate predictor of relative health. Importantly, intermediate phenotypes were defined and could be used to distinguish between agents that could fully restore neurons and neurites and those only capable of maintaining neuronal cell bodies. Application of live cell imaging to disease modeling has the potential to uncover new classes of therapeutic molecules that intervene early in disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This study establishes a new automated live cell imaging method that was used to analyze human motor neurons in the process of dying after trophic factor withdrawal. Our aim was to provide an alternative to traditional endpoint survival assays by determining morphologic changes that predate death. This was accomplished by tracking large numbers of individual motor neurons over long periods of time. We identified features of motor neurons that distinguish between those neurons that can fully recover from the early stages of degeneration and those that are committed to death. Our research is of clear interest to neuroscientists interested in disease and improved methods for discovering effective therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Current findings suggest that accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain disrupt synaptic function in hippocampal–cortical neuronal networks leading to impairment in cognitive and affective functions in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Development of new disease-modifying AD drugs are challenging due to the lack of predictive animal models and efficacy assays. In the present study we recorded neural activity in TgF344-AD rats, a transgenic model with a full array of AD pathological features, including age-dependent Aβ accumulation, tauopathy, neuronal loss, and cognitive impairments. Under urethane anesthesia, TgF344-AD rats showed significant age-dependent decline in brainstem-elicited hippocampal theta oscillation and decreased theta-phase gamma-amplitude coupling comparing to their age-matched wild-type counterparts. In freely-behaving condition, the power of hippocampal theta oscillation and gamma power during sharp-wave ripples were significantly lower in TgF344-AD rats. Additionally, these rats showed impaired coherence in both intercortical and hippocampal–cortical network dynamics, and increased incidence of paroxysmal high-voltage spindles, which occur during awake, behaviorally quiescent state. TgF344-AD rats demonstrated impairments in sensory processing, having diminished auditory gating and 40-Hz auditory evoked steady-state response. The observed differences in neurophysiological activities in TgF344-AD rats, which mirror several abnormalities described in AD patients, may be used as promising markers to monitor disease-modifying therapies.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in many high-level cognitive processes. It is densely innervated by serotonergic neurons originating from the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, which profoundly influence PFC activity. Among the 5-HT receptors abundantly expressed in PFC, 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors located in dendrites of layer V pyramidal neurons control neuronal excitability and mediate the psychotropic effects of psychedelic hallucinogens, but their impact on glutamatergic transmission and synaptic plasticity remains poorly characterized. Here, we show that a 20-min exposure of mouse PFC slices to serotonin or the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) produces a long-lasting depression of evoked AMPA excitatory postsynaptic currents in layer V pyramidal neurons. DOI-elicited long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission is absent in slices from 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-deficient mice, is rescued by viral expression of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor in pyramidal neurons and occludes electrically induced long-term depression. Furthermore, 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation promotes phosphorylation of GluA2 AMPA receptor subunit at Ser&lt;sup&gt;880&lt;/sup&gt; and AMPA receptor internalization, indicating common mechanisms with electrically induced LTD. These findings provide one of the first examples of LTD gating under the control of a G protein-coupled receptor that might lead to imbalanced synaptic plasticity and memory impairment following a nonphysiological elevation of extracellular serotonin.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

The manual evaluation, classification and counting of biological objects demands for an enormous expenditure of time and subjective human input may be a source of error. Investigating the shape of red blood cells (RBCs) in microcapillary Poiseuille flow, we overcome this drawback by introducing a convolutional neural regression network for an automatic, outlier tolerant shape classification. From our experiments we expect two stable geometries: the so-called ‘slipper’ and ‘croissant’ shapes depending on the prevailing flow conditions and the cell-intrinsic parameters. Whereas croissants mostly occur at low shear rates, slippers evolve at higher flow velocities. With our method, we are able to find the transition point between both ‘phases’ of stable shapes which is of high interest to ensuing theoretical studies and numerical simulations. Using statistically based thresholds, from our data, we obtain so-called phase diagrams which are compared to manual evaluations. Prospectively, our concept allows us to perform objective analyses of measurements for a variety of flow conditions and to receive comparable results. Moreover, the proposed procedure enables unbiased studies on the influence of drugs on flow properties of single RBCs and the resulting macroscopic change of the flow behavior of whole blood.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MySkoXXfdsE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The considerable difficulty encountered in reproducing the results of published dynamical models limits validation, exploration and reuse of this increasingly large biomedical research resource. To address this problem, we have developed Tellurium Notebook, a software system for model authoring, simulation, and teaching that facilitates building reproducible dynamical models and reusing models by 1) providing a notebook environment which allows models, Python code, and narrative to be intermixed, 2) supporting the COMBINE archive format during model development for capturing model information in an exchangeable format and 3) enabling users to easily simulate and edit public COMBINE-compliant models from public repositories to facilitate studying model dynamics, variants and test cases. Tellurium Notebook, a Python–based Jupyter–like environment, is designed to seamlessly inter-operate with these community standards by automating conversion between COMBINE standards formulations and corresponding in–line, human–readable representations. Thus, Tellurium brings to systems biology the strategy used by other literate notebook systems such as Mathematica. These capabilities allow users to edit every aspect of the standards–compliant models and simulations, run the simulations in–line, and re–export to standard formats. We provide several use cases illustrating the advantages of our approach and how it allows development and reuse of models without requiring technical knowledge of standards. Adoption of Tellurium should accelerate model development, reproducibility and reuse.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZuHaIPVjBo4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Accurate and reliable forecasts of seasonal epidemics of infectious disease can assist in the design of countermeasures and increase public awareness and preparedness. This article describes two main contributions we made recently toward this goal: a novel approach to probabilistic modeling of surveillance time series based on “delta densities”, and an optimization scheme for combining output from multiple forecasting methods into an adaptively weighted ensemble. Delta densities describe the probability distribution of the change between one observation and the next, conditioned on available data; chaining together nonparametric estimates of these distributions yields a model for an entire trajectory. Corresponding distributional forecasts cover more observed events than alternatives that treat the whole season as a unit, and improve upon multiple evaluation metrics when extracting key targets of interest to public health officials. Adaptively weighted ensembles integrate the results of multiple forecasting methods, such as delta density, using weights that can change from situation to situation. We treat selection of optimal weightings across forecasting methods as a separate estimation task, and describe an estimation procedure based on optimizing cross-validation performance. We consider some details of the data generation process, including data revisions and holiday effects, both in the construction of these forecasting methods and when performing retrospective evaluation. The delta density method and an adaptively weighted ensemble of other forecasting methods each improve significantly on the next best ensemble component when applied separately, and achieve even better cross-validated performance when used in conjunction.
We submitted real-time forecasts based on these contributions as part of CDC’s 2015/2016 FluSight Collaborative Comparison. Among the fourteen submissions that season, this system was ranked by CDC as the most accurate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Vgnec48BpkY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Mammalian TRIM67 Functions in Brain Development and Behavior</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0186-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Class I members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases evolutionarily appeared just prior to the advent of neuronal like cells and have been implicated in neuronal development from invertebrates to mammals. The single Class I TRIM in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; and the mammalian Class I TRIM9 regulate axon branching and guidance in response to the guidance cue netrin, whereas mammalian TRIM46 establishes the axon initial segment. In humans, mutations in TRIM1 and TRIM18 are implicated in Opitz Syndrome, characterized by midline defects and often intellectual disability. We find that although TRIM67 is the least studied vertebrate Class I TRIM, it is the most evolutionarily conserved. Here we show that mammalian TRIM67 interacts with both its closest paralog TRIM9 and the netrin receptor DCC and is differentially enriched in specific brain regions during development and adulthood. We describe the anatomical and behavioral consequences of deletion of murine &lt;i&gt;Trim67&lt;/i&gt;. While viable, mice lacking &lt;i&gt;Trim67&lt;/i&gt; exhibit abnormal anatomy of specific brain regions, including hypotrophy of the hippocampus, striatum, amygdala, and thalamus, and thinning of forebrain commissures. Additionally, &lt;i&gt;Trim67&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice display impairments in spatial memory, cognitive flexibility, social novelty preference, muscle function, and sensorimotor gating, whereas several other behaviors remain intact. This study demonstrates the necessity for TRIM67 in appropriate brain development and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Pharmacological Dopamine Manipulation Does Not Alter Reward-Based Improvements in Memory Retention during a Visuomotor Adaptation Task</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0453-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Motor adaptation tasks investigate our ability to adjust motor behaviours to an ever-changing and unpredictable world. Previous work has shown that punishment-based feedback delivered during a visuomotor adaptation task enhances error-reduction, whereas reward increases memory retention. While the neural underpinnings of the influence of punishment on the adaptation phase remain unclear, reward has been hypothesized to increase retention through dopaminergic mechanisms. We directly tested this hypothesis through pharmacological manipulation of the dopaminergic system. 96 young healthy human participants were tested in a placebo-controlled double-blind between-subjects design in which they adapted to a 40-degree visuomotor rotation under reward or punishment conditions. We confirmed previous evidence that reward enhances retention, but the dopamine precursor levodopa or the dopamine antagonist haloperidol failed to influence performance. We reason that such a negative result could be due to experimental limitations or it may suggest that the effect of reward on motor memory retention is not driven by dopaminergic processes. This provides further insight regarding the role of motivational feedback in optimizing motor learning, and the basis for further decomposing the effect of reward on the subprocesses known to underlie motor adaptation paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Motor adaptation tasks investigate our ability to rapidly adjust motor behaviours. However, these adjustments are transient and the learnt behavior is quickly forgotten. Previous work has found that reward-based feedback can enhance the retention of a newly acquired motor behavior and hypothesised that this effect was dependent on dopamine. Here, we confirmed that reward increases the retention of motor memories, but found that this was not influenced by drugs that altered dopamine availability in the brain. Therefore, these findings fail to confirm a role for dopamine during reward-based improvements in motor retention, and highlight possible limitations of using dopaminergic stimulation to optimize motor memory retention in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Optogenetic Study of Anterior Bnst and Basomedial Amygdala Projections to the Ventromedial Hypothalamus</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0204-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The basomedial amygdala (BM) influences the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) through direct glutamatergic projections as well as indirectly, through the anterior part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTa). However, BM and BNSTa axons end in a segregated fashion in VMH. BM projects to the core of VMH, where VMH’s projection cells are located, whereas BNSTa projects to the shell of VMH, where GABAergic cells that inhibit core neurons are concentrated. However, the consequences of this dual regulation of VMH by BM and BNSTa are unknown. To study this question, we recorded the responses of VMH’s shell and core neurons to the optogenetic activation of BM or BNSTa inputs in transgenic mice that selectively express cre-recombinase in glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. Glutamatergic BM inputs fired most core neurons but elicited no response in GABAergic shell neurons. Following BM infusions of AAV-EF1α-DIO-hChR2-mCherry in Vgat-ires-Cre-Ai6 mice, no anterograde labeling was observed in the VMH, suggesting that GABAergic BM neurons do not project to the VMH. In contrast, BNSTa sent mostly GABAergic projections that inhibited both, shell and core neurons. However, BNSTa-evoked IPSPs had a higher amplitude in shell neurons. Since we also found that activation of GABAergic shell neurons causes an inhibition of core neurons, these results suggest that depending on the firing rate of shell neurons, BNSTa inputs could elicit a net inhibition or disinhibition of core neurons. Thus, the dual regulation of VMH by BM and BNSTa imparts flexibility to this regulator of defensive and social behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), a critical component of the innate defense network, is regulated by the basomedial amygdala (BM), which supplies non-olfactory information to the VMH, and BNST, another structure mediating defensive behaviors and a recipient of BM inputs. BM projects to the core of VMH, where its projection cells are located, whereas BNST projects to the shell of VMH, where GABAergic cells that inhibit core neurons are concentrated. However, the consequences of this dual regulation of VMH by BM and BNST are unknown. Our results indicate that depending on the firing rate of shell neurons, the influence of BNST can shift from an inhibition to a disinhibition of core neurons, thus imparting flexibility to this innate defensive network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Age-Related Declines in Prefrontal Cortical Expression of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors That Support Working Memory</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0164-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Glutamate signaling is essential for the persistent neural activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) that enables working memory. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are a diverse class of proteins that modulate excitatory neurotransmission via both presynaptic regulation of extracellular glutamate levels and postsynaptic modulation of ion channels on dendritic spines. This receptor class is of significant therapeutic interest for treatment of cognitive disorders associated with glutamate dysregulation. Working memory impairment and cortical hypoexcitability are both associated with advanced aging. Whether aging modifies PFC mGluR expression, and the extent to which any such alterations are regionally or subtype specific, however, is unknown. Moreover, it is unclear whether specific mGluRs in PFC are critical for working memory, and thus, whether altered mGluR expression in aging or disease is sufficient to play a &lt;i&gt;causative&lt;/i&gt; role in working memory decline. Experiments in the current study first evaluated the effects of age on medial PFC (mPFC) mGluR expression using biochemical and molecular approaches in rats. Of the eight mGluRs examined, only mGluR5, mGluR3, and mGluR4 were significantly reduced in the aged PFC. The reductions in mGluR3 and mGluR5 (but not mGluR4) were observed in both mRNA and protein, and were selectively localized to the prelimbic (PrL), but not infralimbic (IL), subregion of PFC. Finally, pharmacological blockade of mGluR5 or mGluR2/3 using selective antagonists directed to PrL significantly impaired working memory without influencing non-mnemonic aspects of task performance. Together, these data implicate attenuated expression of PFC mGluR5 and mGluR3 in the impaired working memory associated with advanced ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Working memory is impaired in several neuropsychiatric disorders and advanced aging. Glutamate is essential for persistent cellular activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) theorized to maintain working memory. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are well-positioned to coordinate glutamate signaling at PFC synapses; however, studies to date have not yet systematically investigated the contributions of mGluR subtypes to normal working memory and PFC aging. This study shows that aging is accompanied by loss of PFC mGluR2/3 and mGluR5 mRNA and protein, and that pharmacological inhibition of these mGluR subtypes is sufficient to impair working memory. These findings suggest that mGluRs have a normal role in working memory and could serve as a target for treatment of cognitive disorders characterized by PFC dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: A Large Endoplasmic Reticulum-Resident Pool of TRPM1 in Retinal on Bipolar Cells</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0143-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The chemical signal of light onset, a decrease in glutamate release from rod and cone photoreceptors, is processed by a post-synaptic G-protein signaling cascade in ON-bipolar cells. The metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6, along with other cascade elements, is localized synaptically at the bipolar cell dendritic tips. The effector ion channel protein TRPM1, in contrast, is located not only at the dendritic tips but also in bipolar cell bodies and axons. Little is known about the intracellular localization of TRPM1, or its trafficking route to the dendritic tip plasma membrane. Recombinant TRPM1 expressed in mammalian cells colocalized with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers, with little or none detected at the plasma membrane. In mouse retina, somatic TRPM1 was similarly intracellular, and not at the plasma membrane. Labeling of ER membranes by expression of a fluorescent marker showed that in bipolar cells the ER extends into axons and dendrites, but not dendritic tips. In cell bodies, TRPM1 colocalized with the ER, and not with the Golgi apparatus. Fluorescence protease protection assays with TRPM1-GFP fusions in heterologous cells revealed that the N- and C-termini are both accessible to the cytoplasm, consistent with the transmembrane domain topology of related TRP channels. These results indicate that the majority of TRPM1 is present in the ER, from which it can potentially be transported to the dendritic tips as needed for ON light responses. The excess of ER-resident TRPM1 relative to the amount needed at the dendritic tips suggests a potential new function for TRPM1 in the ER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Retinal bipolar cells of the ON subtype detect signals from both rod and cone photoreceptors, and are required for dim light vision. Little is known about the secretory pathway in these cells, or the trafficking of synaptic signal cascade proteins to their destination at the dendritic tip plasma membrane. The ion channel protein TRPM1 is required for the depolarizing light response of ON bipolar cells. However, in addition to its post-synaptic location at the bipolar cell dendritic tips, TRPM1 is also present in cell bodies and axons. Our results show that somatic TRPM1 is intracellular and located in the ER, and not at the plasma membrane, suggesting that plasma membrane insertion occurs specifically at the dendrites or dendritic tips.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Double strand breaks (DSB) in the DNA backbone are the most lethal type of defect induced in the cell nucleus by chemical and radiation treatments of cancer. However, little is known about the outcomes of damage in nucleosomal DNA, and on its effects on damage repair. We performed microsecond-long molecular dynamics computer simulations of nucleosomes including a DSB at various sites, to characterize the early stages of the evolution of this DNA lesion. The damaged structures are studied by the essential dynamics of DNA and histones, and compared to the intact nucleosome, thus exposing key features of the interactions. All DSB configurations tend to remain compact, with only the terminal bases interacting with histone proteins. Umbrella sampling calculations show that broken DNA ends at the DSB must overcome a free-energy barrier to detach from the nucleosome core. Finally, by calculating the covariant mechanical stress, we demonstrate that the coupled bending and torsional stress can force the DSB free ends to open up straight, thus making it accessible to damage signalling proteins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TrSQAWSy52w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Hybrid stochastic framework predicts efficacy of prophylaxis against HIV: An example with different dolutegravir prophylaxis schemes</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/v-VbLFXyYXc/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Sulav Duwal, Laura Dickinson, Saye Khoo, Max von Kleist&lt;/p&gt;

To achieve the 90-90-90 goals set by UNAIDS, the number of new HIV infections needs to decrease to approximately 500,000 by 2020. One of the ‘five pillars’ to achieve this goal is pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Truvada (emtricitabine-tenofovir) is currently the only medication approved for PrEP. Despite its advantages, Truvada is costly and requires individuals to adhere to the once-daily regimen. To improve PrEP, many next-generation regimen, including long-acting formulations, are currently investigated. However, pre-clinical testing may not guide candidate selection, since it often fails to translate into clinical efficacy. On the other hand, quantifying prophylactic efficacy in the clinic is ethically problematic and requires to conduct long (years) and large (N&amp;gt;1000 individuals) trials, precluding systematic evaluation of candidates and deployment strategies. To prioritize- and help design PrEP regimen, tools are urgently needed that integrate pharmacological-, viral- and host factors determining prophylactic efficacy. Integrating the aforementioned factors, we developed an efficient and exact stochastic simulation approach to predict prophylactic efficacy, as an example for dolutegravir (DTG). Combining the population pharmacokinetics of DTG with the stochastic framework, we predicted that plasma concentrations of 145.18 and 722.23nM prevent 50- and 90% sexual transmissions respectively. We then predicted the reduction in HIV infection when DTG was used in PrEP, PrEP ‘on demand’ and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) before/after virus exposure. Once daily PrEP with 50mg oral DTG prevented 99–100% infections, and 85% of infections when 50% of dosing events were missed. PrEP ‘on demand’ prevented 79–84% infections and PEP &amp;gt;80% when initiated within 6 hours after virus exposure and continued for as long as possible. While the simulation framework can easily be adapted to other PrEP candidates, our simulations indicated that oral 50mg DTG is non-inferior to Truvada. Moreover, the predicted 90% preventive concentrations can guide release kinetics of currently developed DTG nano-formulations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v-VbLFXyYXc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Biomedical research has become a digital data–intensive endeavor, relying on secure and scalable computing, storage, and network infrastructure, which has traditionally been purchased, supported, and maintained locally. For certain types of biomedical applications, cloud computing has emerged as an alternative to locally maintained traditional computing approaches. Cloud computing offers users pay-as-you-go access to services such as hardware infrastructure, platforms, and software for solving common biomedical computational problems. Cloud computing services offer secure on-demand storage and analysis and are differentiated from traditional high-performance computing by their rapid availability and scalability of services. As such, cloud services are engineered to address big data problems and enhance the likelihood of data and analytics sharing, reproducibility, and reuse. Here, we provide an introductory perspective on cloud computing to help the reader determine its value to their own research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LKfBBSl42Rc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Combinatorial Expression of Grp and Neurod6 Defines Dopamine Neuron Populations with Distinct Projection Patterns and Disease Vulnerability</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0152-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Midbrain dopamine neurons project to numerous targets throughout the brain to modulate various behaviors and brain states. Within this small population of neurons exists significant heterogeneity based on physiology, circuitry, and disease susceptibility. Recent studies have shown that dopamine neurons can be subdivided based on gene expression; however, the extent to which genetic markers represent functionally relevant dopaminergic subpopulations has not been fully explored. Here we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of mouse dopamine neurons and validated studies showing that &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; are selective markers for dopaminergic subpopulations. Using a combination of multiplex fluorescent &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, retrograde labeling, and electrophysiology in mice of both sexes, we defined the anatomy, projection targets, physiological properties, and disease vulnerability of dopamine neurons based on &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; expression. We found that the combinatorial expression of &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; defines dopaminergic subpopulations with unique features. &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Neurod6&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dopamine neurons reside in the ventromedial VTA, send projections to the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens, and have noncanonical physiological properties. &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Neurod6-&lt;/i&gt; dopamine neurons are found in the VTA as well as in the ventromedial portion of the SNc, where they project selectively to the dorsomedial striatum. &lt;i&gt;Grp-/Neurod6&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dopamine neurons represent a smaller VTA subpopulation, which is preferentially spared in a 6-OHDA model of Parkinson’s disease. Together, our work provides detailed characterization of &lt;i&gt;Neurod6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Grp&lt;/i&gt; expression in the midbrain and generates new insights into how these markers define functionally relevant dopaminergic subpopulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Emotional distraction may come from the external world and from our mind, as internal distraction. Although external emotional distraction has been extensively investigated, less is known about the mechanisms associated with the impact of internal emotional distraction on cognitive performance, and those involved in coping with such distraction. These issues were investigated using a working memory task with emotional distraction, where recollected unpleasant autobiographical memories served as internal emotional distraction. Emotion regulation was manipulated by instructing participants to focus their attention either on or away from the emotional aspects of their memories. Behaviorally, focusing away from emotion was associated with better working memory performance than focusing on the recollected emotions. Functional MRI data showed reduced response in brain regions associated with the salience network, coupled with greater recruitment of executive prefrontal and memory-related temporoparietal regions, and with increased frontoparietal connectivity, when subjects focused on nonemotional contextual details of their memories. Finally, temporal dissociations were also identified between regions involved in self-referential (showing faster responses) versus context-related processing (showing delayed responses). These findings demonstrate that focused attention is an effective regulation strategy in coping with internal distraction, and are relevant for understanding clinical conditions where coping with distressing memories is dysfunctional.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Expectations Do Not Alter Early Sensory Processing during Perceptual Decision-Making</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5632?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two factors play important roles in shaping perception: the allocation of selective attention to behaviorally relevant sensory features, and prior expectations about regularities in the environment. Signal detection theory proposes distinct roles of attention and expectation on decision-making such that attention modulates early sensory processing, whereas expectation influences the selection and execution of motor responses. Challenging this classic framework, recent studies suggest that expectations about sensory regularities enhance the encoding and accumulation of sensory evidence during decision-making. However, it is possible, that these findings reflect well documented attentional modulations in visual cortex. Here, we tested this framework in a group of male and female human participants by examining how expectations about stimulus features (orientation and color) and expectations about motor responses impacted electroencephalography (EEG) markers of early sensory processing and the accumulation of sensory evidence during decision-making (the early visual negative potential and the centro-parietal positive potential, respectively). We first demonstrate that these markers are sensitive to changes in the amount of sensory evidence in the display. Then we show, counter to recent findings, that neither marker is modulated by either feature or motor expectations, despite a robust effect of expectations on behavior. Instead, violating expectations about likely sensory features and motor responses impacts posterior alpha and frontal theta oscillations, signals thought to index overall processing time and cognitive conflict. These findings are inconsistent with recent theoretical accounts and suggest instead that expectations primarily influence decisions by modulating post-perceptual stages of information processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Expectations about likely features or motor responses play an important role in shaping behavior. Classic theoretical frameworks posit that expectations modulate decision-making by biasing late stages of decision-making including the selection and execution of motor responses. In contrast, recent accounts suggest that expectations also modulate decisions by improving the quality of early sensory processing. However, these effects could instead reflect the influence of selective attention. Here we examine the effect of expectations about sensory features and motor responses on a set of electroencephalography (EEG) markers that index early sensory processing and later post-perceptual processing. Counter to recent empirical results, expectations have little effect on early sensory processing but instead modulate EEG markers of time-on-task and cognitive conflict.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Subthalamic Nucleus Neurons Differentially Encode Early and Late Aspects of Speech Production</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5620?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops mediate all motor behavior, yet little detail is known about the role of basal ganglia nuclei in speech production. Using intracranial recording during deep brain stimulation surgery in humans with Parkinson's disease, we tested the hypothesis that the firing rate of subthalamic nucleus neurons is modulated in sync with motor execution aspects of speech. Nearly half of 79 unit recordings exhibited firing-rate modulation during a syllable reading task across 12 subjects (male and female). Trial-to-trial timing of changes in subthalamic neuronal activity, relative to cue onset versus production onset, revealed that locking to cue presentation was associated more with units that decreased firing rate, whereas locking to speech onset was associated more with units that increased firing rate. These unique data indicate that subthalamic activity is dynamic during the production of speech, reflecting temporally-dependent inhibition and excitation of separate populations of subthalamic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The basal ganglia are widely assumed to participate in speech production, yet no prior studies have reported detailed examination of speech-related activity in basal ganglia nuclei. Using microelectrode recordings from the subthalamic nucleus during a single-syllable reading task, in awake humans undergoing deep brain stimulation implantation surgery, we show that the firing rate of subthalamic nucleus neurons is modulated in response to motor execution aspects of speech. These results are the first to establish a role for subthalamic nucleus neurons in encoding of aspects of speech production, and they lay the groundwork for launching a modern subfield to explore basal ganglia function in human speech.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neurotrophin Responsiveness of Sympathetic Neurons Is Regulated by Rapid Mobilization of the p75 Receptor to the Cell Surface through TrkA Activation of Arf6</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/24/5606?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) plays an integral role in patterning the sympathetic nervous system during development. Initially, p75NTR is expressed at low levels as sympathetic axons project toward their targets, which enables neurotrophin-3 (NT3) to activate TrkA receptors and promote growth. Upon reaching nerve growth factor (NGF) producing tissues, p75NTR is upregulated, resulting in formation of TrkA-p75 complexes, which are high-affinity binding sites selective for NGF, thereby blunting NT3 signaling. The level of p75NTR expressed on the neuron surface is instrumental in regulating trophic factor response; however, the mechanisms by which p75NTR expression is regulated are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a rapid, translation independent increase in surface expression of p75NTR in response to NGF in rat sympathetic neurons. p75NTR was mobilized to the neuron surface from GGA3-postitive vesicles through activation of the GTPase Arf6, which was stimulated by NGF, but not NT3 binding to TrkA. Arf6 activation required PI3 kinase activity and was prevented by an inhibitor of the cytohesin family of Arf6 guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Overexpression of a constitutively active Arf6 mutant (Q67L) was sufficient to significantly increase surface expression of p75NTR even in the absence of NGF. Functionally, expression of active Arf6 markedly attenuated the ability of NT3 to promote neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth, whereas the NGF response was unaltered. These data suggest that NGF activation of Arf6 through TrkA is critical for the increase in p75NTR surface expression that enables the switch in neurotrophin responsiveness during development in the sympathetic nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; p75NTR is instrumental in the regulation of neuronal survival and apoptosis during development and is also implicated as a contributor to aberrant neurodegeneration in numerous conditions. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms that mediate p75NTR surface availability may provide insight into how and why neurodegenerative processes manifest and reveal new therapeutic targets. Results from this study indicate a novel mechanism by which p75NTR can be rapidly shuttled to the cell surface from existing intracellular pools and explores a unique pathway by which NGF regulates the sympathetic innervation of target tissues, which has profound consequences for the function of these organs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Human Motor Thalamus Reconstructed in 3D from Continuous Sagittal Sections with Identified Subcortical Afferent Territories</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0060-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Classification and delineation of the motor-related nuclei in the human thalamus have been the focus of numerous discussions for a long time. Difficulties in finding consensus have for the most part been caused by paucity of direct experimental data on connections of individual nuclear entities. Kultas-Ilinsky et al. (2011, J Comp Neurol, 519:2811-2837) showed that distribution of the isoform 65 of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), the enzyme that synthesizes inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid, is a reliable marker that allows to delineate connectionally distinct nuclei in the human motor thalamus, namely the territories innervated by nigral, pallidal, and cerebellar afferents. We compared those immunocytochemical staining patterns with underlying cytoarchitecture and used the latter to outline the three afferent territories in a continuous series of sagittal Nissl-stained sections of the human thalamus. The 3D volume reconstructed from the outlines was placed in the Talairach stereotactic coordinate system relative to the intercommissural line and sectioned in three stereotactic planes to produce color-coded nuclear maps. This 3D coordinate-based atlas was co-registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI-152) space. The current report proposes a simplified nomenclature of the motor-related thalamic nuclei, presents images of selected histological sections and stereotactic maps illustrating topographic relationships of these nuclei as well as their relationship with adjacent somatosensory afferent region. The data are useful in different applications such as functional MRI and diffusion tractography. The three-dimensional dataset is publicly available under an open license and can also be applicable in clinical interventions in the thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This is the first demonstration of revised maps of human motor thalamic nuclei that clearly identify subterritories based on their afferents in three stereotactic planes derived from a continuous series of histologic sections from a single brain. Consistent inter-slice distance and high resolution ensure a high reliability of target coordinates because the dataset is applicable in all planes. Nuclear outlines based on a specific marker and straightforward modified nomenclature reflect the functional and connectional properties of motor-related regions. 3D coordinate-based atlas space is co-registered with the most modern version of the widely used MNI space (multispectral MNI-152 2009b NLIN Asym template). The report introduces a unique tool for researchers and clinicians studying the human thalamus with experimental and imaging techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Simultaneous Ablation of Neuronal Neurofascin and Ankyrin G in Young and Adult Mice Reveals Age-Dependent Increase in Nodal Stability in Myelinated Axons and Differential Effects on the Lifespan</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0138-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Nodes of Ranvier are unique regions where voltage-gated sodium channels are highly enriched to drive saltatory conduction. Genetic ablations in adult mice with loss of specific nodal proteins causes slow but progressive nodal deterioration associated with decreased nerve conduction and axonopathy. What has remained unaddressed is whether loss of nodal proteins at different time points in postnatal life follows similar timelines of nodal disorganization. Here we utilized simultaneous ablation of Neurofascin (NF186) and Ankyrin G (AnkG) in mice of both sexes at three specific time points. We report that concurrent ablation of these core nodal components at postnatal day (P) 13 leads to accelerated nodal destabilization than at P23, and this disorganization is even slower when ablated at P93. Ablation of NF186 with AnkG at P13 reduced the half-life of NF186 to 15 days compared to 1 month at P23 which increased to 2 months at P93, indicating increasing nodal stability. The half-life of AnkG at the nodes also increased with age but showed enhanced disappearance from the node in the absence of NF186 with a half-life of 3 days at P13 ablation. The nodal disorganization occurred in a sequential manner with AnkG disappearing first from the nodal areas irrespective of the timing of ablation and led to decreased nerve conduction and affected axonal health. Together, our studies reveal that nodes of Ranvier in myelinated axons continue to become more stable with age and suggest that nodal disorganization in adult human demyelinating disorders occurs slowly until neurological symptoms become evident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The initial clustering, maturation, and life-long maintenance of nodes of Ranvier along myelinated axons are vital to the saltatory propagation of action potentials, allowing for rapid movements. to investigate if the kinetics for nodal destabilization are variable with age, we have used a novel mouse model where two essential nodal proteins, Neurofascin 186 (NF186) and Ankyrin G (AnkG), were simultaneous ablated from neurons at different time points. Our studies show that nodal stability after maturation is not only dependent on the synergistic functions of these core nodal components but also that nodes become more stable as animals age, which is relevant to human demyelination disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Fast Compensatory Functional Network Changes Caused by Reversible Inactivation of Monkey Parietal Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy128/5036733?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The brain has a remarkable capacity to recover after lesions. However, little is known about compensatory neural adaptations at the systems level. We addressed this question by investigating behavioral and (correlated) functional changes throughout the cortex that are induced by focal, reversible inactivations. Specifically, monkeys performed a demanding covert spatial attention task while the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) was inactivated with muscimol and whole-brain fMRI activity was recorded. The inactivation caused LIP-specific decreases in task-related fMRI activity. In addition, these local effects triggered large-scale network changes. Unlike most studies in which animals were mainly passive relative to the stimuli, we observed heterogeneous effects with more profound muscimol-induced increases of task-related fMRI activity in areas connected to LIP, especially FEF. Furthermore, in areas such as FEF and V4, muscimol-induced changes in fMRI activity correlated with changes in behavioral performance. Notably, the activity changes in remote areas did not correlate with the decreased activity at the site of the inactivation, suggesting that such changes arise via neuronal mechanisms lying in the intact portion of the functional task network, with FEF a likely key player. The excitationâ€“inhibition dynamics unmasking existing excitatory connections across the functional network might initiate these rapid adaptive changes.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: PICK1-Deficient Mice Exhibit Impaired Response to Cocaine and Dysregulated Dopamine Homeostasis</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0422-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1) is a widely expressed scaffold protein known to interact via its PSD-95/discs-large/ZO-1 (PDZ)-domain with several membrane proteins including the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT), the primary target for cocaine’s reinforcing actions. Here, we establish the importance of PICK1 for behavioral effects observed after both acute and repeated administration of cocaine. In PICK1 knock-out (KO) mice, the acute locomotor response to a single injection of cocaine was markedly attenuated. Moreover, in support of a role for PICK1 in neuroadaptive changes induced by cocaine, we observed diminished cocaine intake in a self-administration paradigm. Reduced behavioral effects of cocaine were not associated with decreased striatal DAT distribution and most likely not caused by the ~30% reduction in synaptosomal DA uptake observed in PICK1 KO mice. The PICK1 KO mice demonstrated preserved behavioral responses to DA receptor agonists supporting intact downstream DA receptor signaling. Unexpectedly, we found a prominent increase in striatal DA content and levels of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in PICK1 KO mice. Chronoamperometric recordings showed enhanced DA release in PICK1 KO mice, consistent with increased striatal DA pools. Viral-mediated knock-down (KD) of PICK1 in cultured dopaminergic neurons increased TH expression, supporting a direct cellular effect of PICK1. In summary, in addition to demonstrating a key role of PICK1 in mediating behavioral effects of cocaine, our data reveal a so far unappreciated role of PICK1 in DA homeostasis that possibly involves negative regulation of striatal TH levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Amygdala Corticofugal Input Shapes Mitral Cell Responses in the Accessory Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0175-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Interconnections between the olfactory bulb and the amygdala are a major pathway for triggering strong behavioral responses to a variety of odorants. However, while this broad mapping has been established, the patterns of amygdala feedback connectivity and the influence on olfactory circuitry remain unknown. Here, using a combination of neuronal tracing approaches, we dissect the connectivity of a cortical amygdala [posteromedial cortical nucleus (PmCo)] feedback circuit innervating the mouse accessory olfactory bulb. Optogenetic activation of PmCo feedback mainly results in feedforward mitral cell (MC) inhibition through direct excitation of GABAergic granule cells. In addition, LED-driven activity of corticofugal afferents increases the gain of MC responses to olfactory nerve stimulation. Thus, through corticofugal pathways, the PmCo likely regulates primary olfactory and social odor processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Transducin {beta}-Subunit Can Interact with Multiple G-Protein {gamma}-Subunits to Enable Light Detection by Rod Photoreceptors</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0144-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The heterotrimeric G-protein transducin mediates visual signaling in vertebrate photoreceptor cells. Many aspects of the function of transducin were learned from knock-out mice lacking its individual subunits. Of particular interest is the knockout of its rod-specific -subunit (G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). Two studies using independently generated mice documented that this knockout results in a considerable &amp;gt;60-fold reduction in the light sensitivity of affected rods, but provided different interpretations of how the remaining α-subunit (Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) mediates phototransduction without its cognate Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-subunit partner. One study found that the light sensitivity reduction matched a corresponding reduction in Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; content in the light-sensing rod outer segments and proposed that Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; activation is supported by remaining Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; associating with other G subunits naturally expressed in photoreceptors. In contrast, the second study reported the same light sensitivity loss but a much lower, only approximately sixfold, reduction of Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; and proposed that the light responses of these rods do not require Gβ at all. To resolve this controversy and elucidate the mechanism driving visual signaling in G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knock-out rods, we analyzed both mouse lines side by side. We first determined that the outer segments of both mice have identical Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; content, which is reduced ~65-fold from the wild-type (WT) level. We further demonstrated that the remaining Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is present in a complex with endogenous G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; subunits and that these complexes exist in wild-type rods as well. Together, these results argue against the idea that Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; alone supports light responses of G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knock-out rods and suggest that Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is not unique in its ability to mediate vertebrate phototransduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Overlap in Item Representations Across Episodes Impairs Context Memory</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy137/5036074?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We frequently encounter the same item in different contexts, and when that happens, memories of earlier encounters can get reactivated. We examined how existing memories are changed as a result of such reactivation. We hypothesized that when an item’s initial and subsequent neural representations overlap, this allows the initial item to become associated with novel contextual information, interfering with later retrieval of the initial context. Specifically, we predicted a negative relationship between representational similarity across repeated experiences of an item and subsequent source memory for the initial context. We tested this hypothesis in an fMRI study, in which objects were presented multiple times during different tasks. We measured the similarity of the neural patterns in lateral occipital cortex that were elicited by the first and second presentations of objects, and related this neural overlap score to subsequent source memory. Consistent with our hypothesis, greater item-specific pattern similarity was linked to worse source memory for the initial task. In contrast, greater reactivation of the initial context was associated with better source memory. Our findings suggest that the influence of novel experiences on an existing context memory depends on how reliably a shared component (i.e., item) is represented across these episodes.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Relationships Between Neuronal Oscillatory Amplitude and Dynamic Functional Connectivity</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy136/5036075?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Event-related fluctuations of neural oscillatory amplitude are reported widely in the context of cognitive processing and are typically interpreted as a marker of brain “activity”. However, the precise nature of these effects remains unclear; in particular, whether such fluctuations reflect local dynamics, integration between regions, or both, is unknown. Here, using magnetoencephalography, we show that movement induced oscillatory modulation is associated with transient connectivity between sensorimotor regions. Further, in resting-state data, we demonstrate a significant association between oscillatory modulation and dynamic connectivity. A confound with such empirical measurements is that increased amplitude necessarily means increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): this means that the question of whether amplitude and connectivity are genuinely coupled, or whether increased connectivity is observed purely due to increased SNR is unanswered. Here, we counter this problem by analogy with computational models which show that, in the presence of global network coupling and local multistability, the link between oscillatory modulation and long-range connectivity is a natural consequence of neural networks. Our results provide evidence for the notion that connectivity is mediated by neural oscillations, and suggest that time–frequency spectrograms are not merely a description of local synchrony but also reflect fluctuations in long-range connectivity.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prefrontal D1 Dopamine-Receptor Neurons and Delta Resonance in Interval Timing</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy083/5036073?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Considerable evidence has shown that prefrontal neurons expressing D1-type dopamine receptors (D1DRs) are critical for working memory, flexibility, and timing. This line of work predicts that frontal neurons expressing D1DRs mediate cognitive processing. During timing tasks, one form this cognitive processing might take is time-dependent ramping activity—monotonic changes in firing rate over time. Thus, we hypothesized the prefrontal D1DR+ neurons would strongly exhibit time-dependent ramping during interval timing. We tested this idea using an interval-timing task in which we used optogenetics to tag D1DR+ neurons in the mouse medial frontal cortex (MFC). While 23% of MFC D1DR+ neurons exhibited ramping, this was significantly less than untagged MFC neurons. By contrast, MFC D1DR+ neurons had strong delta-frequency (1–4 Hz) coherence with other MFC ramping neurons. This coherence was phase-locked to cue onset and was strongest early in the interval. To test the significance of these interactions, we optogenetically stimulated MFC D1DR+ neurons early versus late in the interval. We found that 2-Hz stimulation early in the interval was particularly effective in rescuing timing-related behavioral performance deficits in dopamine-depleted animals. These findings provide insight into MFC networks and have relevance for disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Ethanol Regulates Presynaptic Activity and Sedation through Presynaptic Unc13 Proteins in Drosophila</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/3/ENEURO.0125-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Ethanol has robust effects on presynaptic activity in many neurons, however, it is not yet clear how this drug acts within this compartment to change neural activity, nor the significance of this change on behavior and physiology &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. One possible presynaptic effector for ethanol is the Munc13-1 protein. Herein, we show that ethanol binding to the rat Munc13-1 C1 domain, at concentrations consistent with binge exposure, reduces diacylglycerol (DAG) binding. The inhibition of DAG binding is predicted to reduce the activity of Munc13-1 and presynaptic release. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, we show that sedating concentrations of ethanol significantly reduce synaptic vesicle release in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), while having no significant impact on membrane depolarization and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx into the presynaptic compartment. These data indicate that ethanol targets the active zone in reducing synaptic vesicle exocytosis. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, haploinsufficent for the Munc13-1 ortholog &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt;, are more resistant to the effect of ethanol on presynaptic inhibition. Genetically reducing the activity of &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt; through mutation or expression of RNAi transgenes also leads to a significant resistance to the sedative effects of ethanol. The neuronal expression of &lt;i&gt;Munc13-1&lt;/i&gt; in heterozygotes for a &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt; loss-of-function mutation can largely rescue the ethanol sedation resistance phenotype, indicating a conservation of function between &lt;i&gt;Munc13-1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt; in ethanol sedation. Hence, reducing &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt; activity leads to naïve physiological and behavioral resistance to sedating concentrations of ethanol. We propose that reducing &lt;i&gt;Dunc13&lt;/i&gt; activity, genetically or pharmacologically by ethanol binding to the C1 domain of Munc13-1/Dunc13, promotes a homeostatic response that leads to ethanol tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Selective Changes in Noise Correlations Contribute to an Enhanced Representation of Saccadic Targets in Prefrontal Neuronal Ensembles</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy141/5035458?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstarct&lt;/div&gt;An ensemble of neurons can provide a dynamic representation of external stimuli, ongoing processes, or upcoming actions. This dynamic representation could be achieved by changes in the activity of individual neurons and/or their interactions. To investigate these possibilities, we simultaneously recorded from ensembles of prefrontal neurons in non-human primates during a memory-guided saccade task. Using both decoding and encoding methods, we examined changes in the information content of individual neurons and that of ensembles between visual encoding and saccadic target selection. We found that individual neurons maintained their limited spatial sensitivity between these cognitive states, whereas the ensemble selectively improved its encoding of spatial locations far from the neurons’ preferred locations. This population-level “encoding expansion” was not due to the ceiling effect at the preferred locations and was accompanied by selective changes in noise correlations for non-preferred locations. Moreover, the encoding expansion was observed for ensembles of different types of neurons and could not be explained by shifts in the preferred location of individual neurons. Our results demonstrate that the representation of space by neuronal ensembles is dynamically enhanced prior to saccades, and this enhancement occurs alongside changes in noise correlations more than changes in the activity of individual neurons.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Letter and Category Fluency Performance Correlates with Distinct Patterns of Cortical Thickness in Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy138/5035452?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Verbal fluency tasks are generally thought to be mediated by frontal brain regions for letter fluency and temporal regions for category fluency. This idea, however, is primarily based on lesion studies and adapted versions of the fluency tasks in functional neuroimaging, without fundamental evidence from structural neuroimaging in healthy individuals. We investigated the cortical structural correlates of letter and category fluency, including overlapping and different regions, in 505 individuals who participated in a community-based study of healthy aging. The correlation between cortical thickness and verbal fluency in whole-brain analyses revealed distinct cortical signatures for letter fluency, primarily in frontal regions, and category fluency, in frontal and temporal-parietal regions. There was a dissociation in the left inferior frontal gyrus between letter and category fluency, with increased thickness in the posterior-dorsal versus anterior-ventral parts, respectively. These results distinguish the detailed anatomical correlates for verbal fluency within the coarse frontal-temporal distinction inferred from lesion studies and among the mixture of regions identified in functional neuroimaging. The evidence for the anatomical substrates of letter and category fluency, each recruiting slightly different language and cognitive processes, can serve both clinical applications as well as a deeper theoretical understanding of the organization of the cerebral cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: To Move or Not to Move? Functional Role of Ventral Premotor Cortex in Motor Monitoring During Limb Immobilization</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy134/5035448?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Anatomo-clinical evidence from motor-awareness disorders after brain-damages suggests that the premotor cortex (PMC) is involved in motor-monitoring of voluntary actions. Indeed, PMC lesions prevent patients from detecting the mismatch between intended, but not executed, movements with the paralyzed limb. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study compared, in healthy subjects, free movements against blocked movements, precluded by a cast. Cast-related corticospinal excitability changes were investigated by using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Immediately after the immobilization, when the cast prevented the execution of left-hand movements, the contralateral right (ventral) vPMC showed both increased hemodynamic activity and increased functional connectivity with the hand area in the right somatosensory cortex, suggesting a vPMC involvement in detecting the mismatch between planned and executed movements. Crucially, after 1 week of immobilization, when the motor system had likely learned that no movement could be executed and, therefore, predictions about motor consequences were changed, vPMC did not show the enhanced activity as if no incongruence has to be detected. This can be interpreted as a consequence of the plastic changes induced by long-lasting immobilization, as also proved by the cast-related corticospinal excitability modulation in our subjects. The present findings highlight the crucial role of vPMC in the anatomo-functional network generating the human motor-awareness.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Differential Contributions of Glutamatergic Hippocampal→Retrosplenial Cortical Projections to the Formation and Persistence of Context Memories</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy142/5033560?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Learning to associate stressful events with specific environmental contexts depends on excitatory transmission in the hippocampus, but how this information is transmitted to the neocortex for lasting memory storage is unclear. We identified dorsal hippocampal (DH) projections to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), which arise mainly from the subiculum and contain either the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) or vGlut2. Both vGlut1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and vGlut2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; axons strongly excite and disynaptically inhibit RSC pyramidal neurons in superficial layers, but vGlut2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; axons trigger greater inhibition that spreads to deep layers, indicating that these pathways engage RSC circuits via partially redundant, partially differentiated cellular mechanisms. Using contextual fear conditioning in mice to model contextual associative memories, together with chemogenetic axonal silencing, we found that vGlut1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; projections are principally involved in processing recent context memories whereas vGlut2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; projections contribute to their long-lasting storage. Thus, within the DH→RSC pathway, engagement of vGlut1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and vGlut2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; circuits differentially contribute to the formation and persistence of fear-inducing context memories.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>
