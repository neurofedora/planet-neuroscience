	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Role of Redox Dysregulation in the Effects of Prenatal Stress on Embryonic Interneuron Migration</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz052/5382211?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Maternal stress during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of psychiatric disorders in offspring, but embryonic brain mechanisms disrupted by prenatal stress are not fully understood. Our lab has shown that prenatal stress delays inhibitory neural progenitor migration. Here, we investigated redox dysregulation as a mechanism for embryonic cortical interneuron migration delay, utilizing direct manipulation of pro- and antioxidants and a mouse model of maternal repetitive restraint stress starting on embryonic day 12. Time-lapse, live-imaging of migrating GAD67GFP+ interneurons showed that normal tangential migration of inhibitory progenitor cells was disrupted by the pro-oxidant, hydrogen peroxide. Interneuron migration was also delayed by in utero intracerebroventricular rotenone. Prenatal stress altered glutathione levels and induced changes in activity of antioxidant enzymes and expression of redox-related genes in the embryonic forebrain. Assessment of dihydroethidium (DHE) fluorescence after prenatal stress in ganglionic eminence (GE), the source of migrating interneurons, showed increased levels of DHE oxidation. Maternal antioxidants (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;-acetylcysteine and astaxanthin) normalized DHE oxidation levels in GE and ameliorated the migration delay caused by prenatal stress. Through convergent redox manipula-tions, delayed interneuron migration after prenatal stress was found to critically involve redox dysregulation. Redox biology during prenatal periods may be a target for protecting brain development.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Hyperpolarization-Activated HCN4 Channel is Important for Proper Maintenance of Oscillatory Activity in the Thalamocortical System</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz047/5382209?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Hyperpolarization-activated cation channels are involved, among other functions, in learning and memory, control of synaptic transmission and epileptogenesis. The importance of the HCN1 and HCN2 isoforms for brain function has been demonstrated, while the role of HCN4, the third major neuronal HCN subunit, is not known. Here we show that HCN4 is essential for oscillatory activity in the thalamocortical (TC) network. HCN4 is selectively expressed in various thalamic nuclei, excluding the thalamic reticular nucleus. HCN4-deficient TC neurons revealed a massive reduction of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ih&lt;/span&gt; and strongly reduced intrinsic burst firing, whereas the current was normal in cortical pyramidal neurons. In addition, evoked bursting in a thalamic slice preparation was strongly reduced in the mutant mice probes. HCN4-deficiency also significantly slowed down thalamic and cortical oscillations during active wakefulness. Taken together, these results establish that thalamic HCN4 channels are essential for the production of rhythmic intrathalamic oscillations and determine regular TC oscillatory activity during alert states.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prefrontal Cortical and Behavioral Adaptations to Surgical Delivery Mediated by Metabolic Principles</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz046/5382210?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We previously observed an association between mode of delivery and brain mitochondrial mechanisms in pups. We also showed that mitochondrial processes impact adult behavior. However, no experimental data is available to causally connect mode of delivery with cellular processes of neurons in the cerebral cortex and adult behavior. Here we show that surgical delivery of pups alters mitochondrial dynamics and spine synapses of layer 3 pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex compared to the values of mice delivered vaginally. These alterations in ultrastructure seen in adult mice delivered surgically were associated with the development of behavioral phenotypes resembling those characteristic of animal models of psychiatric illness. This included impaired performance in prepulse inhibition as well as hyperlocomotion in the open field and elevated plus maze tests. Knocking out a mitochondria-related gene, UCP-2, blocked cellular and behavioral adaptations induced by surgical delivery. These results highlight a crucial role for brain mitochondrial adaptations in the process of birth to affect neuronal circuitry in support of normal and altered adult behaviors. Further, these findings were supported with neuroimaging data from human neonates delivered vaginally and surgically, suggesting that the murine findings have human clinical relevance.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Corticostriatal Circuits Encode the Subjective Value of Perceived Control</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz045/5382206?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The ability to perceive and exercise control over an outcome is both desirable and beneficial to our well-being. It has been shown that animals and humans alike exhibit behavioral bias towards seeking control and that such bias recruits the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatum. Yet, this bias remains to be quantitatively captured and studied neurally. Here, we employed a behavioral task to measure the preference for control and characterize its neural underpinnings. Participants made a series of binary choices between having control and no-control over a game for monetary reward. The mere presence of the control option evoked activity in the ventral striatum. Importantly, we manipulated the expected value (EV) of each choice pair to extract the pairing where participants were equally likely to choose either option. The difference in EV between the options at this point of equivalence was inferred as the subjective value of control. Strikingly, perceiving control inflated the reward value of the associated option by 30% and this value inflation was tracked by the vmPFC. Altogether, these results capture the subjective value of perceived control inherent in decision making and highlight the role of corticostriatal circuitry in the perception of control.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Dynamic Causal Modeling of the Relationship between Cognition and Theta–alpha Oscillations in Adults with Down Syndrome</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz043/5382204?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) show high inter-subject variability in cognitive ability and have an ultra-high risk of developing dementia (90% lifetime prevalence). Elucidating factors underlying variability in cognitive function can inform us about intellectual disability (ID) and may improve our understanding of factors associated with later cognitive decline. Increased neuronal inhibition has been posited to contribute to ID in DS. Combining electroencephalography (EEG) with dynamic causal modeling (DCM) provides a non-invasive method for investigating excitatory/inhibitory mechanisms. Resting-state EEG recordings were obtained from 36 adults with DS with no evidence of cognitive decline. Theta–alpha activity (4–13 Hz) was characterized in relation to general cognitive ability (raw Kaufmann’s Brief Intelligence Test second Edition (KBIT-2) score). Higher KBIT-2 was associated with higher frontal alpha peak amplitude and higher theta–alpha band power across distributed regions. Modeling this association with DCM revealed intrinsic self-inhibition was the key network parameter underlying observed differences in 4–13 Hz power in relation to KBIT-2 and age. In particular, intrinsic self-inhibition in right V1 was negatively correlated with KBIT-2. Results suggest intrinsic self-inhibition within the alpha network is associated with individual differences in cognitive ability in adults with DS, and may provide a potential therapeutic target for cognitive enhancement.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: When Conflict Cannot be Avoided: Relative Contributions of Early Selection and Frontal Executive Control in Mitigating Stroop Conflict</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz042/5382203?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;When viewing familiar stimuli (e.g., common words), processing is highly automatized such that it can interfere with the processing of incompatible sensory information. At least two mechanisms may help mitigate this interference. Early selection accounts posit that attentional processes filter out distracting sensory information to avoid conflict. Alternatively, late selection accounts hold that all sensory inputs receive full semantic analysis and that frontal executive mechanisms are recruited to resolve conflict. To test how these mechanisms operate to overcome conflict induced by highly automatized processing, we developed a novel version of the color-word Stroop task, where targets and distractors were simultaneously flickered at different frequencies. We measured the quality of early sensory processing by assessing the amplitude of steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by targets and distractors. We also indexed frontal executive processes by assessing changes in frontal theta oscillations induced by color-word incongruency. We found that target- and distractor-related SSVEPs were not modulated by changes in the level of conflict whereas frontal theta activity increased on high compared to low conflict trials. These results suggest that frontal executive processes play a more dominant role in mitigating cognitive interference driven by the automatic tendency to process highly familiar stimuli.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Phosphodiesterase 1 Bridges Glutamate Inputs with NO- and Dopamine-Induced Cyclic Nucleotide Signals in the Striatum</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz041/5382205?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The calcium-regulated phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1) family is highly expressed in the brain, but its functional role in neurones is poorly understood. Using the selective PDE1 inhibitor Lu AF64196 and biosensors for cyclic nucleotides including a novel biosensor for cGMP, we analyzed the effect of PDE1 on cAMP and cGMP in individual neurones in brain slices from male newborn mice. Release of caged NMDA triggered a transient increase of intracellular calcium, which was associated with a decrease in cAMP and cGMP in medium spiny neurones in the striatum. Lu AF64196 alone did not increase neuronal cyclic nucleotide levels, but blocked the NMDA-induced reduction in cyclic nucleotides indicating that this was mediated by calcium-activated PDE1. Similar effects were observed in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Upon corelease of dopamine and NMDA, PDE1 was shown to down-regulate the D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-receptor mediated increase in cAMP. PDE1 inhibition increased long-term potentiation in rat ventral striatum, showing that PDE1 is implicated in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Overall, our results show that PDE1 reduces cyclic nucleotide signaling in the context of glutamate and dopamine coincidence. This effect could have a therapeutic value for treating brain disorders related to dysfunctions in dopamine neuromodulation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Premotor Cortex Provides a Substrate for the Temporal Transformation of Information During the Planning of Gait Modifications</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We tested the hypothesis that the premotor cortex (PMC) in the cat contributes to the planning and execution of visually guided gait modifications. We analyzed single unit activity from 136 cells localized within layer V of cytoarchitectonic areas 6iffu and that part of 4δ within the ventral bank of the cruciate sulcus while cats walked on a treadmill and stepped over an obstacle that advanced toward them. We found a rich variety of discharge patterns, ranging from limb-independent cells that discharged several steps in front of the obstacle to step-related cells that discharged either during steps over the obstacle or in the steps leading up to that step. We propose that this population of task-related cells within this region of the PMC contributes to the temporal evolution of a planning process that transforms global information of the presence of an obstacle into the precise spatio-temporal limb adjustment required to negotiate that obstacle.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: No Evidence that Predictions and Attention Modulate the First Feedforward Sweep of Cortical Information Processing</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz038/5382202?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Predictive coding models propose that predictions (stimulus likelihood) reduce sensory signals as early as primary visual cortex (V1), and that attention (stimulus relevance) can modulate these effects. Indeed, both prediction and attention have been shown to modulate V1 activity, albeit with fMRI, which has low temporal resolution. This leaves it unclear whether these effects reflect a modulation of the first feedforward sweep of visual information processing and/or later, feedback-related activity. In two experiments, we used electroencephalography and orthogonally manipulated spatial predictions and attention to address this issue. Although clear top-down biases were found, as reflected in pre-stimulus alpha-band activity, we found no evidence for top-down effects on the earliest visual cortical processing stage (&amp;lt;80 ms post-stimulus), as indexed by the amplitude of the C1 event-related potential component and multivariate pattern analyses. These findings indicate that initial visual afferent activity may be impenetrable to top-down influences by spatial prediction and attention.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Acute Inescapable Stress Rapidly Increases Synaptic Energy Metabolism in Prefrontal Cortex and Alters Working Memory Performance</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz034/5382201?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain energy metabolism actively regulates synaptic transmission and activity. We have previously shown that acute footshock (FS)-stress induces fast and long-lasting functional and morphological changes at excitatory synapses in prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here, we asked whether FS-stress increased energy metabolism in PFC, and modified related cognitive functions. Using positron emission tomography (PET), we found that FS-stress induced a redistribution of glucose metabolism in the brain, with relative decrease of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake in ventro-caudal regions and increase in dorso-rostral ones. Absolute [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake was inversely correlated with serum corticosterone. Increased specific hexokinase activity was also measured in purified PFC synaptosomes (but not in total extract) of FS-stressed rats, which positively correlated with 2-Deoxy [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H] glucose uptake by synaptosomes. In line with increased synaptic energy demand, using an electron microscopy-based stereological approach, we found that acute stress induced a redistribution of mitochondria at excitatory synapses, together with an increase in their volume. The fast functional and metabolic activation of PFC induced by acute stress, was accompanied by rapid and sustained alterations of working memory performance in delayed response to T-maze test. Taken together, the present data suggest that acute stress increases energy consumption at PFC synaptic terminals and alters working memory.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Reduced Hippocampal Dendrite Branching, Spine Density and Neurocognitive Function in Premature Rabbits, and Reversal with Estrogen or TrkB Agonist Treatment</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz033/5382207?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Preterm-born children suffer from neurological and behavioral disorders. Herein, we hypothesized that premature birth and non-maternal care of preterm newborns might disrupt neurobehavioral function, hippocampal dendritic arborization, and dendritic spine density. Additionally, we assessed whether 17β-estradiol (E2) replacement or the TrkB receptor agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), would reverse compromised dendritic development and cognitive function in preterm newborns. These hypotheses were tested by comparing preterm (E28.5) rabbit kits cared and gavage-fed by laboratory personnel and term-kits reared and breast-fed by their mother doe at an equivalent postconceptional age. Neurobehavioral tests showed that both premature-birth and formula-feeding with non-maternal care led to increased anxiety behavior, poor social interaction, and lack of novelty preference compared with term-kits. Dendritic branching and number of total or mushroom dendritic spines were reduced in the CA1 field of preterm-kits compared with term controls. While CDC42 and Rac1/2/3 expression levels were lower, RhoA-activity was higher in preterm-kits compared with term controls. Both E2 and DHF treatment reversed prematurity-induced reduction in spine density, reduced total RhoA-GTPase levels, and enhanced cognitive function. Hence, prematurity and non-maternal care result in cognitive deficits, and reduced dendritic arbors and spines in CA1. E2 replacement or DHF treatment might reverse changes in dendritic spines and improve neurodevelopment in premature infants.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Deletion of the KH1 Domain of Fmr1 Leads to Transcriptional Alterations and Attentional Deficits in Rats</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz029/5382208?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;FMR1&lt;/span&gt; gene. It is a leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder and inherited intellectual disability and is often comorbid with attention deficits. Most FXS cases are due to an expansion of CGG repeats leading to suppressed expression of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein involved in mRNA metabolism. We found that the previously published &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1&lt;/span&gt; knockout rat model of FXS expresses an &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1&lt;/span&gt; transcript with an in-frame deletion of exon 8, which encodes for the K-homology (KH) RNA-binding domain, KH1. Notably, 3 pathogenic missense mutations associated with FXS lie in the KH domains. We observed that the deletion of exon 8 in rats leads to attention deficits and to alterations in transcriptional profiles within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which map to 2 weighted gene coexpression network modules. These modules are conserved in human frontal cortex and enriched for known FMRP targets. Hub genes in these modules represent potential therapeutic targets for FXS. Taken together, these findings indicate that attentional testing might be a reliable cross-species tool for investigating FXS and identify dysregulated conserved gene networks in a relevant brain region.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Association Between Earliest Amyloid Uptake and Functional Connectivity in Cognitively Unimpaired Elderly</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Alterations in cognitive performance have been noted in nondemented subjects with elevated accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrils. However, it is not yet understood whether brain function is already influenced by Aβ deposition during the very earliest stages of the disease. We therefore investigated associations between [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]Flutemetamol PET, resting-state functional connectivity, gray and white matter structure and cognitive performance in 133 cognitively normal elderly that exhibited normal global Aβ PET levels. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]Flutemetamol uptake in regions known to accumulate Aβ fibrils early in preclinical AD (i.e., mainly certain parts of the default-mode network) was positively associated with dynamic but not static functional connectivity (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; = 0.77). Dynamic functional connectivity was further related to better cognitive performance (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; = 0.21–0.72). No significant associations were found for Aβ uptake with gray matter volume or white matter diffusivity. The findings demonstrate that the earliest accumulation of Aβ fibrils is associated with increased functional connectivity, which occurs before any structural alterations. The enhanced functional connectivity may reflect a compensatory mechanism to maintain high cognitive performance in the presence of increasing amyloid accumulation during the earliest phases of AD.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Social interactions are fundamental to survival and overall health. The mechanisms underlying social behavior are complex, but we now know that immune signaling plays a fundamental role in the regulation of social interactions. Prolonged or exaggerated alterations in social behavior often accompany altered immune signaling and function in pathological states. Thus, unraveling the link between social behavior and immune signaling is a fundamental challenge, not only to advance our understanding of human health and development, but for the design of comprehensive therapeutic approaches for neural disorders.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/580050v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Pyridox(am)ine 5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) is a rate-limiting enzyme in converting dietary vitamin B6 (VB6) to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the biologically active form of VB6 and involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters including GABA, dopamine, and serotonin. In humans, PNPO mutations have been increasingly identified in neonatal epileptic encephalopathy and more recently also in early-onset epilepsy. Till now, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying PNPO-deficiency-induced seizures due to the lack of animal models. Previously we identified a c.95 C&amp;gt;A missense mutation in sgll - the Drosophila homolog of human PNPO (hPNPO) - and found mutant (sgll95) flies exhibiting a lethal phenotype on a diet devoid of VB6. Here we report the establishment of both sgll95 and ubiquitous sgll knockdown (KD) flies as valid animal models of PNPO-deficiency-induced epilepsy. Both sgll95 and sgll KD flies exhibit spontaneous seizures before they die. Electrophysiological recordings reveal that seizures caused by PNPO deficiency have characteristics similar to that in flies treated with the GABA antagonist picrotoxin. Both seizures and lethality are associated with low PLP levels and can be rescued by ubiquitous expression of wild-type sgll or hPNPO, suggesting the functional conservation of the PNPO enzyme between humans and flies. Results from cell type-specific sgll KD further demonstrate that PNPO in the brain is necessary for seizure prevention and survival. Our establishment of the first animal model of PNPO deficiency will lead to better understanding of VB6 biology, the PNPO gene and its mutations discovered in patients, and can be a cost-effective system to test therapeutic strategies.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/579938v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Complex behavior requires fast changes of functional connectivity in large-scale cortical networks. Here, we report on the dynamics of functional coupling across visual, auditory and parietal areas during a lateralized detection task in the ferret. We hypothesized that fluctuations in coupling, indicative of dynamic variations in the network state, should be predictive of the animals performance. Analysis of power for hit and miss trials revealed significant differences around stimulus- and response-onset. In contrast, phase coupling already differed between hits and misses before stimulus onset, indicating fluctuations in large-scale network connectivity. In particular, higher phase coupling of visual and auditory regions to parietal cortex was predictive of task performance. Furthermore, we observed that long-range coupling became more predominant during the task period compared to the pre-stimulus baseline. Taken together, these results suggest that fluctuations in the network state, particular with respect to long-range connectivity, are critical determinants of the animals behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/579813v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Virtual reality combined with spherical treadmills is used across species for studying neural circuits underlying navigation. New Method: We developed an optical flow-based method for tracking treadmil ball motion in real-time using a single high-resolution camera. Results: Tracking accuracy and timing were determined using calibration data. Ball tracking was performed at 500 Hz and integrated with an open source game engine for virtual reality projection. The projection was updated at 120 Hz with a latency with respect to ball motion of 30 {+/-} 8 ms. Comparison with Existing Method(s): Optical flow based tracking of treadmill motion is typically achieved using optical mice. The camera-based optical flow tracking system developed here is based on off-the-shelf components and offers control over the image acquisition and processing parameters. This results in flexibility with respect to tracking conditions - such as ball surface texture, lighting conditions, or ball size - as well as camera alignment and calibration. Conclusions: A fast system for rotational ball motion tracking suitable for virtual reality animal behavior across different scales was developed and characterized.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/579763v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain iron plays key roles in catecholaminergic neurotransmitter synthesis and early life brain development. It is also central to cellular energetics and neurotransmitter metabolism throughout the lifespan. Disturbances in brain iron have been implicated in a growing number of psychiatric and late-life neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, brain iron accumulations are thought to play a deleterious role in neuroinflammatory processes in later life. Despite its importance, the role of brain iron in development, aging, and psychiatric disorders remains comparatively understudied. This is partly due to technical challenges inherent in implementation and analysis of formal iron imaging protocols and practical constraints on scan session durations. Here, we introduce a method to estimate relative brain iron concentrations that is 1) computationally simple, 2) shows excellent correspondence with formal iron imaging in-vivo, 3) replicates clinically-relevant findings from formal iron imaging, 4) yields novel insights into brain iron and cognition across the lifespan, and 5) leverages a widely available and frequently shared brain imaging modality: functional MRI. The computationally simple nature of the measure, coupled with the availability of fMRI datasets across the lifespan and disorders, has the potential to transform our understanding of the complex and critical relationship between iron and brain health.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>A major challenge in neuroscience is convenient whole-brain delivery of transgenes, especially early in postnatal development. Recent advances demonstrate whole-brain gene delivery by retro-orbital injection of virus, but slow and sparse expression, and the large injection volumes required, precludes early developmental studies. We developed a novel method for simple, fast and efficient gene delivery across the central nervous system in neonates as early as P4 and persisting into adulthood. The method employs transverse sinus injections of 2-4L of AAV9 at P0. Here, we describe how to use this method to label and/or genetically manipulate cells in the neonatal rat and mouse brain. This protocol is fast, easy, can be readily adopted by any laboratory, and utilizes the widely available AAV9 capsid. The procedure outlined here is adaptable for diverse experimental applications ranging from biochemistry, anatomical and functional mapping, to gene expression, silencing, and editing.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: LSO:Ce Inorganic Scintillators are Biocompatible with Neuronal and Circuit Function</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/579722v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Optogenetics is widely used in neuroscience to control neural circuits. However, non-invasive methods for light delivery in brain are needed to avoid physical damage caused by current methods. One potential strategy could employ x-ray activation of radioluminescent particles (RPLs), enabling localized light generation within the brain. RPLs composed of inorganic scintillators can emit light at various wavelengths depending upon composition. Cerium doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO:Ce), an inorganic scintillator that emits blue light in response to x-ray or UV stimulation, could potentially be used to control neural circuits through activation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a light-gated cation channel. Whether inorganic scintillators themselves negatively impact neuronal processes and synaptic function is unknown, and was investigated here using cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological approaches. As proof of principle, we applied UV stimulation to 4 m LSO:Ce particles during whole-cell recording of CA1 pyramidal cells in acutely prepared hippocampal slices from mice that expressed ChR2 in glutamatergic neurons. We observed an increase in frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), indicating UV activation of ChR2 and excitation of neurons. Importantly, we found that LSO:Ce particles have no effect on survival of primary mouse cortical neurons, even after 24 hours of exposure. In extracellular dendritic field potential recordings, we observed no change in strength of basal glutamatergic transmission up to 3 hours of exposure to LSO:Ce microparticles. However, there was a slight decrease in the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs in whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells, with no change in current amplitudes. No changes in the amplitude or frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were observed. Finally, long term potentiation (LTP), a synaptic modification believed to underlie learning and memory and a robust measure of synaptic integrity, was successfully induced, although the magnitude was slightly reduced. Together, these results show LSO:Ce particles are biocompatible even though there are modest effects on baseline synaptic function and long-term synaptic plasticity. Importantly, we show that light emitted from LSO:Ce particles is able to activate ChR2 and modify synaptic function. Therefore, LSO:Ce inorganic scintillators are potentially viable for use as a new light delivery system for optogenetics.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Manipulation of Oscillatory Phase by Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/579631v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Oscillatory phase has been proposed as key parameter defining the spatiotemporal structure of neural activity. Phase alignment of oscillations by transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) may offer a unique opportunity to enhance our understanding of brain rhythms and to alter brain function. However, the precise mechanism and effectiveness of tACS are still critically debated. Here, we investigated the phase-specificity of tACS effects on visually evoked steady state responses (SSR) measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Using an intermittent electrical stimulation protocol, we assessed the influence of tACS on SSR amplitude as a function of phase shift between rhythmic sensory and electrical stimulation in the interval immediately following tACS. Visual flicker was delivered at six different phase angles relative to the tACS cycle. Participants were presented with flicker and high-definition tACS over the occipital cortex at 10 Hz in two sessions using active or sham stimulation. We observed that the phase shift between flicker and tACS modulates evoked SSR amplitudes. The amplitude change over phase shift conditions was significant for both general and sinusoidal modulation measures. Neural sources of phase-specific effects were localized in the parieto-occipital cortex within flicker-aligned regions. Importantly, tACS effects were stronger in subjects with lower phase locking between EEG and flicker. Overall, our data provide evidence for phase alignment of brain activity by tACS, since the change in SSR amplitude can only result from phase-specific interactions with the applied electric fields. This finding corroborates the physiological efficacy of tACS and highlights its potential for controlled modulation of brain signals.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/579540v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The ability to sustain attention on a task-relevant sound-source whilst avoiding distraction from other concurrent sounds is fundamental to listening in crowded environments. To isolate this aspect of hearing we designed a paradigm that continuously measured behavioural and pupillometry responses during 25-second-long trials in young (18-35 yo) and older (63-79 yo) participants. The auditory stimuli consisted of a number (1, 2 or 3) of concurrent, spectrally distinct tone streams. On each trial, participants detected brief silent gaps in one of the streams whilst resisting distraction from the others. Behavioural performance demonstrated increasing difficulty with time-on-task and with number/proximity of distractor streams. In young listeners (N=20), pupillometry revealed that pupil diameter (on the group and individual level) was dynamically modulated by instantaneous task difficulty such that periods where behavioural performance revealed a strain on sustained attention, were also accompanied by increased pupil diameter. Only trials on which participants performed successfully were included in the pupillometry analysis. Therefore, the observed effects reflect consequences of task demands as opposed to failure to attend. In line with existing reports, we observed global changes to pupil dynamics in the older group, including decreased pupil diameter, a limited dilation range, and reduced temporal variability. However, despite these changes, the older group showed similar effects of attentive tracking to those observed in the younger listeners. Overall, our results demonstrate that pupillometry can be a reliable and time-sensitive measure of the effort associated with attentive tracking over long durations in both young and (with some caveats) older listeners.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The speed of human social interaction perception</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/579375v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The ability to detect and understand other people's social interactions is a fundamental part of the human visual experience that develops early in infancy and is shared with other primates. However, the neural computations underlying this ability remain largely unknown. Is the detection of social interactions a rapid perceptual process, or a slower post-perceptual inference? Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) decoding and computational modeling to ask whether social interactions can be detected via fast, feedforward processing. Subjects in the MEG viewed snapshots of visually matched real-world scenes containing a pair of people who were either engaged in a social interaction or acting independently. The presence versus absence of a social interaction could be read out from subjects' MEG data spontaneously, even while subjects performed an orthogonal task. This readout generalized across different scenes, revealing abstract representations of social interactions in the human brain. These representations, however, did not come online until quite late, at 300 ms after image onset, well after the time period of feedforward visual processes. In a second experiment, we found that social interaction readout occurred at this same latency even when subjects performed an explicit task detecting social interactions. Consistent with these latency results, a standard feedforward deep neural network did not contain an abstract representation of social interactions at any model layer. We further showed that MEG responses distinguished between different types of social interactions (mutual gaze vs joint attention) even later, around 500 ms after image onset. Taken together, these results suggest that the human brain spontaneously extracts the presence and type of others' social interactions, but does so slowly, likely relying on iterative top-down computations.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/579235v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cranial radiotherapy in children has detrimental effects on cognition, mood, and social competence in young cancer survivors. Treatments harnessing hippocampal neurogenesis are currently of great relevance in this context, and we previously showed that voluntary running introduced long after irradiation rescued hippocampal neurogenesis in young mice (Naylor et al. 2008a). Lithium, a well-known mood stabilizer, has both neuroprotective, proneurogenic as well as anti-tumor effects, and in the current study we introduced lithium treatment 4 weeks after irradiation, analogous to the voluntary running study. Female mice received a single 4 Gy whole-brain irradiation dose at postnatal day (PND) 21 and were randomized to 0.24% Li2CO3 chow or normal chow from PND 49 to 77. Hippocampal neurogenesis was assessed at PND 77, 91 and 105. We found that lithium treatment had a pro-proliferative effect on neural progenitors and promoted neuronal integration upon its discontinuation. Gene expression profiling and DNA methylation analysis identified two novel factors related to the observed effects, Tppp, associated with proliferation, and GAD2/65, associated with neuronal signaling. Our results show that lithium treatment reverses irradiation-induced impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis even when introduced long after the injury. We propose that lithium treatment should be intermittent in order to first make neural progenitors proliferate and then, upon discontinuation, allow them to differentiate. Our findings suggest that pharmacological treatment of cognitive so-called late effects in childhood cancer survivors is possible.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/578831v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disorder that confers a high risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), with behavioral predictors of ASD emerging early in life. Deviations in structural and functional neuronal connectivity are highly implicated in both TSC and ASD. For the first time, we explore whether electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of network function precede or predict the emergence of ASD in TSC. We determine whether altered brain function (1) is present in infancy in TSC, (2) differentiates infants with TSC based on ASD diagnostic status, and (3) is associated with later cognitive function. We studied 35 infants with TSC (N=35), and a group of typically developing infants (n=20) at 12 and 24 months of age. Infants with TSC were later subdivided into ASD and non-ASD groups based on clinical evaluation. We measured features of spontaneous alpha oscillations (6-12Hz) that are closely associated with neural network development: alpha power, alpha phase coherence (APC) and peak alpha frequency (PAF). Infants with TSC demonstrated reduced interhemispheric APC compared to controls at 12 months of age, and these differences were found to be most pronounced at 24 months in the infants who later developed ASD. Across all infants, PAF at 24 months was associated with verbal and non-verbal cognition at 36 months.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/578807v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Glial dysfunction is a major feature in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. While altered astrocyte (AS) and oligodendrocyte-lineage (OL) cell functions have been associated with depression, the crosstalk between these two major glial cell types has never been assessed in that context. AS are potent regulators of OL cells and myelination, in part through gap junction-mediated intercellular communication made possible by the heterotypic coupling of AS-specific (Cx30 and Cx43) and OL-specific (Cx32 and Cx47) connexins, allowing cytosolic transport and metabolic support to OL cells. Because changes in the expression of AS-specific connexins have been previously reported in the brain of depressed individuals, this study aimed at addressing the integrity of AS-OL coupling in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of depressed suicides. Using immunofluorescence and confocal imaging, we characterized the distribution of the AS-specific Cx30 in the ACC, and mapped its expression onto oligodendrocyte somas and myelinated axons as well as brain vasculature in post-mortem brain samples from depressed suicides (N=48) and matched controls (N=23). The differential gene expression of key components of the gap junction nexus was also screened through RNA-sequencing dataset previously generated by our group, and validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Our results indicate that Cx30 expression mapping to OL cells is selectively decreased in depressed suicides, an effect that was associated with decreased expression of OL-specific connexins Cx32 and Cx47, as well as the downregulation of major connexin-interacting proteins essential for the scaffolding, trafficking and function of gap junction channels. These results provide a first evidence of impaired gap junction mediated communication between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the ACC of individuals with mood disorders. These changes in glial coupling are likely to have significant impact on brain function, and may contribute to the altered OL function previously reported in this brain region.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/578682v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) for severe stroke motor rehabilitation aim to 'close the loop' between attempted motor commands and sensory feedback by providing supplemental sensory information when individuals successfully establish specific brain patterns. However, previous stroke BCIs have typically employed feedback techniques with minimal biological relevance, making them difficult and unintuitive to control. To address this, we created a novel BCI that provides biologically-relevant neurofeedback in virtual reality using a head-mounted display (HMD-VR). The purpose of this experiment was to examine whether neurofeedback in HMD-VR improves BCI performance compared to the same neurofeedback presented on a normal computer screen. Twelve healthy adults were asked to control a virtual arm by imagining right hand movements, which was measured via electroencephalography (EEG) as desynchronized sensorimotor rhythms (8-30 Hz) in the left motor cortex. Participants performed two blocks of 30 trials, one for each condition (Screen, HMD-VR), counterbalanced across participants. The neurofeedback consisted of a virtual arm that moved towards or away from different targets based on the real-time EEG activity (e.g., sensorimotor desynchronization moved the arm towards the target). After completing each block, participants were asked questions relating to their sense of presence and embodiment in each environment. We found that, while participants showed similar performance on the BCI when performing the task in either environment, there was a positive correlation between performance and reported levels of embodiment, only in HMD-VR. Specifically, participants had more control over the virtual arm in HMD-VR when they reported higher levels of spatial embodiment. Furthermore, participants reported higher levels of spatial embodiment in HMD-VR compared to the computer screen. These results suggest that HMD-VR is capable of increasing levels of embodiment compared to a normal screen environment, and that increased levels of embodiment may improve performance uniquely in the HMD-VR environment. Future work will examine the effects of HMD-VR BCI on motor rehabilitation in a stroke population.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/578641v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Grid cell representations are simultaneously flexible and powerful yet rigid and constrained: On one hand, they can encode spatial or a variety of non-spatial cognitive variables (Constantinescu et al., 2016; Killian et al., 2012), with remarkable capacity, integration, and error correction properties (Fiete et al., 2008; Sreenivasan and Fiete, 2011; Mathis et al., 2012). On the other, states within each grid module are confined to a fixed two-dimensional (2D) set across time, environment, encoded variable (Yoon et al., 2013, 2016), behavioral states including sleep (Gardner et al., 2017; Trettel et al., 2017), with the inherent low- dimensionality etched directly into the physical topography of the circuit (Heys et al., 2014; Gu et al., 2018). The restriction to 2D states seemingly imposes a severe limit on the representation of general cognitive variables of dimension greater than two by grid cells. We show here that a set of grid cell modules, each with only 2D responses, can generate unambiguous and high-capacity representations of variables in much higher-dimensional spaces. Specifically, M grid modules can represent variables of arbitrary dimension up to 2M, with a capacity exponential in M. The idea generalizes our understanding of the 2D grid code as capable of flexible reconfiguration to generate unique high-capacity metric codes and memory states for representation and algebra in higher-dimensional vector spaces, without costly higher-dimensional grid-like responses in individual cells.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Simple, biologically informed models, but not convolutional neural networks describe target detection in naturalistic images</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/578633v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The first steps of visual processing are often described as a bank of oriented filters followed by divisive normalization. This approach has been tremendously successful at predicting contrast thresholds in simple visual displays. However, it is unclear to what extent this kind of architecture also supports processing in more complex visual tasks being performed in naturally looking images. Here, we use a deep generative model for natural images to embed arc segments with different curvatures in naturalistic images. Specifically, these images contain the target as part of the image scene, resulting in considerable appearance variation of target as well as background. Three observers localized arc targets in these images, achieving an accuracy of 74.7% correct responses on average. Data were then fit by a number of biologically inspired models and also by a 5-layer convolutional neural network. Four models were particularly good a predicting observer responses, (i) a bank of oriented filters, similar to complex cells in primate area V1, (ii) a bank of oriented filters followed by tuned gain control, incorporating knowledge about cortical surround interactions, (iii) a bank of oriented filters followed by local normalization, (iv) the 5-layer convolutional neural network. A control experiment with optimized stimuli based on these four models showed that the observers' data were best explained by model (ii) with tuned gain control. These data suggest that standard models of early vision provide good descriptions of performance in much more complex tasks than what they were designed for, while general purpose non-linear models such as convolutional neural networks do not.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/578617v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In oscillatory systems, neuronal activity phase is often independent of network frequency. Such phase maintenance requires adjustment of synaptic input with network frequency, a relationship that we explored using the crab, Cancer borealis, pyloric network. The burst phase of pyloric neurons is relatively constant despite a &amp;gt;2-fold variation in network frequency. We used noise input to characterize how input shape influences burst delay of a pyloric neuron, and then used dynamic clamp to examine how burst phase depends on the period, amplitude, duration, and shape of rhythmic synaptic input. Phase constancy across a range of periods required a proportional increase of synaptic duration with period. However, phase maintenance was also promoted by an increase of amplitude and peak phase of synaptic input with period. Mathematical analysis shows how short-term synaptic plasticity can coordinately change amplitude and peak phase to maximize the range of periods over which phase constancy is achieved.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/578534v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Measuring brain activity outside the laboratory is of great importance for investigating human behavior under naturalistic conditions (e.g., in cognition and movement research, application of brain-computer interfaces). To measure neuronal activity in moving subjects, only modified NIRS and EEG systems are applicable. Because conventional EEG systems are too sensitive to movement artifacts, artifact sources should be eliminated beforehand to improve signal quality. Four different approaches for EEG/ERP measures with moving subjects were tested in case studies: (i) a purpose-built head-mounted preamplifier, (ii) a laboratory system with active electrodes, (iii)+(iv) a wireless headset combined with (iii) passive or (iv) active electrodes. A standard visual oddball task was applied during rest (without movement) and during ergometer rowing. All 14 measures revealed very similiar (within subjects) visual evoked potentials for rowing and rest. The small intraindividual differences between rowing and rest, in comparison to the typically larger interindividual differences in the ERP waveforms revealed that ERPs can be measured reliably even in an athletic movement like rowing. The expected modulation of the motor-related activity by force output, on the other hand, was largely affected by movement artifacts. Therefore, for a successful application of ERP measures in movement research, further developments to differentiate between movement-related neuronal activity and movement-related artifacts are required. However, it cannot be excluded that activities with small magnitudes related to motor learning and motor control cannot be detected because they are superimposed by the very large motor potential which increases with force output.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/578492v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Human memory for recent events is believed to undergo reactivation during sleep. This process is thought to be relevant for the consolidation of both individual episodic memories and gist extraction, the formation of generalized memory representations from multiple, related memories. Which kinds of gist are actually enhanced, however, is the subject of less consensus. To address this question, we focused our design on four types of gist: inferential gist (relations extracted across non-contiguous events), statistical learning (regularities extracted from a series), summary gist (a theme abstracted from a temporally contiguous series of items), and category gist (characterization of a stimulus at a higher level in the semantic hierarchy) described in recent reviews. Sixty-nine participants completed memory encoding tasks addressing these types of gist and completed corresponding retrieval tasks the same evening, the morning after, and one week later. Inferential gist in a transitive inference task improved over the course of a week, whereas all other forms of memory were associated with decay. Higher proportions of REM and more spindles were associated with worse performance in a statistical learning task collapsed across time and after one week, respectively. We conclude that memory overlap is an insufficient condition for long-term generalization. Only structured relational memories, rather than associative memories (category and summary gist) or repeated co-occurrence (statistical learning) were enhanced over the course of a week. Furthermore, REM sleep may be involved in schema disintegration, which inhibits participants' ability to separate a stream of shapes into discrete units.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/578468v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cognitive flexibility is critical for intelligent behaviour. However, its execution is effortful and often suboptimal. Recent work indicates that flexible behaviour can be improved by the prospect of reward, suggesting that rewards optimise flexible control processes. Here we investigated how different reward prospects influence neural encoding of task rule information to optimise cognitive flexibility. We applied representational similarity analysis (RSA) to human electroencephalograms, recorded while participants performed a rule-guided decision-making task. During the task, the prospect of reward varied from trial to trial. Participants made faster, more accurate judgements on high reward trials. Critically, high reward boosted neural coding of the active task rule and the extent of this increase was associated with improvements in task performance. These results suggest that reward motivation can improve cognitive performance by strengthening neural coding of task rule information, improving cognitive flexibility during complex behaviour.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The purpose of this paper is to describe a framework for the understanding of rules that govern how neural system dynamics are coordinated to produce behavior. The framework, structured flows on manifolds (SFM), posits that neural processes are flows depicting system interactions that occur on relatively low-dimension manifolds, which constrain possible functional configurations. Although this is a general framework, we focus on the application to brain disorders. We first explain the Epileptor, a phenomenological computational model showing fast and slow dynamics, but also a hidden repertoire whose expression is similar to refractory status epilepticus. We suggest that epilepsy represents an innate brain state whose potential may be realized only under certain circumstances. Conversely, deficits from damage or disease processes, such as stroke or dementia, may reflect both the disease process per se and the adaptation of the brain. SFM uniquely captures both scenarios.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Boolean model of growth signaling, cell cycle and apoptosis predicts the molecular mechanism of aberrant cell cycle progression driven by hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Herbert Sizek, Andrew Hamel, Dávid Deritei, Sarah Campbell, Erzsébet Ravasz Regan&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;AKT&lt;/i&gt; signaling pathway plays a role in most cellular functions linked to cancer progression, including cell growth, proliferation, cell survival, tissue invasion and angiogenesis. It is generally recognized that hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;AKT&lt;/i&gt; are oncogenic due to their boost to cell survival, cell cycle entry and growth-promoting metabolism. That said, the dynamics of &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;AKT1&lt;/i&gt; during cell cycle progression are highly nonlinear. In addition to negative feedback that curtails their activity, protein expression of &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; subunits has been shown to oscillate in dividing cells. The low-&lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;/low-&lt;i&gt;AKT1&lt;/i&gt; phase of these oscillations is required for cytokinesis, indicating that oncogenic &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; may directly contribute to genome duplication. To explore this, we construct a Boolean model of growth factor signaling that can reproduce &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; oscillations and link them to cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The resulting modular model reproduces hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;-driven cytokinesis failure and genome duplication and predicts the molecular drivers responsible for these failures by linking hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; to mis-regulation of Polo-like kinase 1 (&lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt;) expression late in G2. To do this, our model captures the role of &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt; in cell cycle progression and accurately reproduces multiple effects of its loss: G2 arrest, mitotic catastrophe, chromosome mis-segregation / aneuploidy due to premature anaphase, and cytokinesis failure leading to genome duplication, depending on the timing of &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt; inhibition along the cell cycle. Finally, we offer testable predictions on the molecular drivers of &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; oscillations, the timing of these oscillations with respect to division, and the role of altered &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FoxO&lt;/i&gt; activity in genome-level defects caused by hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;. Our model is an important starting point for the predictive modeling of cell fate decisions that include &lt;i&gt;AKT1&lt;/i&gt;-driven senescence, as well as the non-intuitive effects of drugs that interfere with mitosis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WyFcUBh-Z_Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Inverted encoding models reconstruct an arbitrary model response, not the stimulus</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0363-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Probing how large populations of neurons represent stimuli is key to understanding sensory representations as many stimulus characteristics can only be discerned from population activity and not from individual single-units. Recently, inverted encoding models have been used to produce channel response functions from large spatial-scale measurements of human brain activity that are reminiscent of single-unit tuning functions and have been proposed to assay &quot;population-level stimulus representations&quot; (Sprague et al., 2018a). However, these channel response functions do not assay population tuning. We show by derivation that the channel response function is only determined up to an invertible linear transform. Thus these channel response functions are arbitrary, one of an infinite family and therefore not a unique description of population representation. Indeed, simulations demonstrate that bimodal, even random, channel basis functions can account perfectly well for population responses without any underlying neural response units that are so tuned. However, the approach can be salvaged by extending it to reconstruct the stimulus, not the assumed model. We show that when this is done, even using bimodal and random channel basis functions, a unimodal function peaking at the appropriate value of the stimulus is recovered which can be interpreted as a measure of population selectivity. More precisely, the recovered function signifies how likely any value of the stimulus is, given the observed population response. Whether an analysis is recovering the hypothetical responses of an arbitrary model rather than assessing the selectivity of population representations is not an issue unique to the inverted encoding model and human neuroscience, but a general problem that must be confronted as more complex analyses intervene between measurement of population activity and presentation of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We recently showed that inverted encoding models conflate signal to noise ratio with neural tuning width. Sprague and colleagues argued that despite this short falling, inverted encoding models &quot;assay population-level stimulus representations&quot;. However, we show that inverted encoding models reconstruct the model responses, not the stimulus. This is problematic because the model, as we derive here, is only determined up to a linear transform and thus the recovered model responses are only one of an infinite family of equivalent solutions. The approach thus fails to provide a unique assay of population representation. This problem can be circumvented by extending the approach to estimate the probability of different values of the stimulus, thus resulting in an interpretable assay of population representation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Sign Tracking and Goal Tracking Are Characterized by Distinct Patterns of Nucleus Accumbens Activity</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0414-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;During Pavlovian conditioning, if a cue (e.g., lever extension) predicts reward delivery in a different location (e.g., a food magazine), some individuals will come to approach and interact with the cue, a behavior known as sign tracking (ST), and others will approach the site of reward, a behavior known as goal tracking (GT). In rats, the acquisition of ST versus GT behavior is associated with distinct profiles of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but it is unknown whether it is associated with different patterns of accumbens neural activity. Therefore, we recorded from individual neurons in the NAc core during the acquisition, maintenance, and extinction of ST and GT behavior. Even though NAc dopamine is specifically important for the acquisition and expression of ST, we found that cue-evoked excitatory responses encode the vigor of both ST and GT behavior. In contrast, among sign trackers only, there was a prominent decrease in reward-related activity over the course of training, which may reflect the decreasing reward prediction error encoded by phasic dopamine. Finally, both behavior and cue-evoked activity were relatively resistant to extinction in sign trackers, as compared with goal trackers, although a subset of neurons in both groups retained their cue-evoked responses. Overall, the results point to the convergence of multiple forms of reward learning in the NAc.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

However, the first histone demethylase (HDM) was identified in 2004, challenging this notion. Since that time, more than 20 HDMs have been identified and characterized, and many have been shown to have critical roles in organismal development, cell fate, and disease. Here, we highlight some of the recent advances in our understanding of the function of HDMs in the context of neuronal development, plasticity, and disease. We focus, in particular, on molecular genetic studies of LSD1, Kdm6b, and Kdm5c that have elucidated both enzymatic and non-enzymatic gene regulatory functions of these HDMs in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05979</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While it is still not possible to describe the neural-level connections of
the human brain, we can map the human connectome with several hundred vertices,
by the application of diffusion-MRI based techniques. In these graphs, the
nodes correspond to anatomically identified gray matter areas of the brain,
while the edges correspond to the axonal fibers, connecting these areas. In our
previous contributions, we have described numerous graph-theoretical phenomena
of the human connectomes. Here we map the frequent complete subgraphs of the
human brain networks: in these subgraphs, every pair of vertices is connected
by an edge. We also examine sex differences in the results. The mapping of the
frequent subgraphs gives robust substructures in the graph: if a subgraph is
present in the 80\% of the graphs, then, most probably, it could not be an
artifact of the measurement or the data processing workflow. We list here the
frequent complete subgraphs of the female and the male braingraphs of 414
subjects, each with 463 nodes, with a frequency threshold of 80\%, and identify
complete subgraphs, which are more frequent in male and female connectomes,
respectively.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05946</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The visual system is an intricate network of brain regions that enables us to
recognize the world around us. Despite its abundant lateral and feedback
connections, human object processing is commonly viewed and studied as a
feedforward process. Here, we measure and model the rapid representational
dynamics across multiple stages of the human ventral stream using time-resolved
brain imaging and deep learning. We observe substantial representational
transformations during the first 300 ms of processing within and across
ventral-stream regions. Categorical divisions emerge in sequence, cascading
forward and in reverse across regions, and Granger causality analysis suggests
bidirectional information flow between regions. Finally, recurrent deep neural
network models clearly outperform feedforward models in terms of their ability
to jointly capture the multi-region cortical dynamics. These results establish
that recurrent models are required to understand information processing in the
human ventral stream.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Neural Basis and Evolution of Divergent and Convergent Thought. (arXiv:1611.03609v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03609</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This chapter takes as its departure point a neural level theory of insight
that arose from studies of the sparse, distributed, content-addressable
architecture of associative memory. It is argued that convergent thought is
most fruitfully characterized in terms of, not the generation of a single
correct solution (as it is conventionally construed), but using concepts in
their most compact form by activating neural cell assemblies that respond to
their most typical properties. This allows them to be deployed in a
conventional manner such that effort is reserved for exploring causal
relationships. Conversely, it is argued that divergent thought is most
fruitfully characterized in terms of, not the generation of multiple solutions
(as it is conventionally construed), but using concepts in a form that is,
albeit expanded, constrained by the situation, by activating neural cell
assemblies that respond to context-specific atypical properties. This allows
them to be deployed in a manner that is conducive to exploring unconventional
yet potentially relevant associations, and unearthing potentially useful
relationships of correlation. Thus, divergent thought can involve as few as one
idea. This proposal is compatible with widespread beliefs that (1) most
creative tasks require not many solutions but one, yet entail both divergent
and convergent thinking, and (2) not all problems with multiple solutions
require creative thinking, and conversely, some problems with single solution
do require creative thought. The chapter discusses how the ability to shift
between convergent and divergent modes of thought may have evolved, and it
concludes with educational and vocational implications.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42262</link>
	<content:encoded>In the unfolded protein response (UPR), stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates a large transcriptional program to increase ER folding capacity. During the budding yeast UPR, Ire1 excises an intron from the &lt;i&gt;HAC1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA and the exon products of cleavage are ligated, and the translated protein induces hundreds of stress-response genes. Using cells with mutations in RNA repair and decay enzymes, we show that phosphorylation of two different &lt;i&gt;HAC1&lt;/i&gt; splicing intermediates is required for their degradation by the 5′→3′ exonuclease Xrn1 to enact opposing effects on the UPR. We also found that ligated but 2′-phosphorylated &lt;i&gt;HAC1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA is cleaved, yielding a decay intermediate with both 5′- and 2′-phosphates at its 5′-end that inhibit 5′→3′ decay and suggesting that Ire1 degrades incompletely processed &lt;i&gt;HAC1&lt;/i&gt;. These decay events expand the scope of RNA-based regulation in the budding yeast UPR and have implications for the control of the metazoan UPR.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41626</link>
	<content:encoded>Pitch perception is critical for recognizing speech, music and animal vocalizations, but its neurobiological basis remains unsettled, in part because of divergent results across species. We investigated whether species-specific differences exist in the cues used to perceive pitch and whether these can be accounted for by differences in the auditory periphery. Ferrets accurately generalized pitch discriminations to untrained stimuli whenever temporal envelope cues were robust in the probe sounds, but not when resolved harmonics were the main available cue. By contrast, human listeners exhibited the opposite pattern of results on an analogous task, consistent with previous studies. Simulated cochlear responses in the two species suggest that differences in the relative salience of the two pitch cues can be attributed to differences in cochlear filter bandwidths. The results support the view that cross-species variation in pitch perception reflects the constraints of estimating a sound’s fundamental frequency given species-specific cochlear tuning.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39842</link>
	<content:encoded>Transposable element (TE) activity is repressed in animal gonads by PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) produced by piRNA clusters. Current models in flies propose that germinal piRNA clusters are functionally defined by the maternal inheritance of piRNAs produced during the previous generation. Taking advantage of an inactive, but ready to go, cluster of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-element derived transgene insertions in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, we show here that raising flies at high temperature (29°C) instead of 25°C triggers the stable conversion of this locus from inactive into actively producing functional piRNAs. The increase of antisense transcripts from the cluster at 29°C combined with the requirement of transcription of euchromatic homologous sequences, suggests a role of double stranded RNA in the production of &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; piRNAs. This report describes the first case of the establishment of an active piRNA cluster by environmental changes in the absence of maternal inheritance of homologous piRNAs.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Andrey V. Dmitriev, Alexander A. Dmitriev, Robert A. Linsenmeier&lt;/p&gt;

Neuronal activity is associated with transmembrane ionic redistribution, which can lead to an osmotic imbalance. Accordingly, activity-dependent changes of the membrane potential are sometimes accompanied by changes in intracellular or extracellular volume. Experimental data that include distributions of ions and volume during neuronal activity are rare and rather inconsistent partly due to the technical difficulty of performing such measurements. However, progress in understanding the interrelations among ions, voltage and volume has been achieved recently by computational modelling, particularly “charge-difference” modelling. In this work a charge-difference computational model was used for further understanding of the specific roles for cations and anions. Our simulations show that without anion conductances the transmembrane movements of cations are always osmotically balanced, regardless of the stoichiometry of the pump or the ratio of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductances. Yet any changes in cation conductance or pump activity are associated with changes of the membrane potential, even when a hypothetically electroneutral pump is used in calculations and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductances are equal. On the other hand, when a Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; conductance is present, the only way to keep the Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;equilibrium potential in accordance with the changed membrane potential is to adjust cell volume. Importantly, this voltage-evoked Cl&lt;sup&gt;—&lt;/sup&gt;dependent volume change does not affect intracellular cation concentrations or the amount of energy that is necessary to support the system. Taking other factors into consideration (i.e. the presence of internal impermeant poly-anions, the activity of cation-Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; cotransporters, and the buildup of intra- and extracellular osmolytes, both charged and electroneutral) adds complexity, but does not change the main principles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VHCTEZgTAC4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Diving behaviour of narwhals is still largely unknown. We use Hidden Markov models (HMMs) to describe the diving behaviour of a narwhal and fit the models to a three-dimensional response vector of maximum dive depth, duration of dives and post-dive surface time of 8,609 dives measured in East Greenland over 83 days, an extraordinarily long and rich data set. Narwhal diving patterns have not been analysed like this before, but in studies of other whale species, response variables have been assumed independent. We extend the existing models to allow for dependence between state distributions, and show that the dependence has an impact on the conclusions drawn about the diving behaviour. We try several HMMs with 2, 3 or 4 states, and with independent and dependent log-normal and gamma distributions, respectively, and different covariates to characterize dive patterns. In particular, diurnal patterns in diving behaviour is inferred, by using periodic B-splines with boundary knots in 0 and 24 hours.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8xzQ9ROcIkY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Plasticity of NMDA Receptors at Ventral Hippocampal Synapses in the Infralimbic Cortex Regulates Cued Fear</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0354-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) processes contextual information from the hippocampus to generate appropriate fear responses. In rodents, one path for sending contextual information to the mPFC is via the direct projections from the ventral hippocampus (vHC) to the infralimbic cortex (IL). Plasticity in the synaptic communication from the vHC to the IL could contribute to the behavioral changes produced by the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear. To examine this possibility, we used optogenetic stimulation of vHC synapses in brain slices from trained rats. We found that fear acquisition reduced NMDA receptor (NMDAR) currents at vHC synapses onto IL pyramidal neurons. The depression of NMDAR currents reversed more efficiently after extinction in the conditioning context than extinction in a novel context. Moreover, a cohort of animals that exhibited poor extinction retrieval failed to reverse the plasticity induced by fear conditioning. In addition, ex vivo application of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is known to simulate extinction in IL, reversed this conditioning-induced plasticity mimicking extinction. Therefore, we have identified a novel mechanism that modulates conditioned fear via changes in NMDAR current at vHC synapses onto IL pyramidal neurons. Disruption of this mechanism could contribute to the abnormal contextual modulation of fear seen in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Contextual information processing by the medial prefrontal cortex is critical for appropriate behavioral responses. Using optogenetics in brain slices, we found that acquisition of conditioned fear depressed NMDA receptor currents at ventral hippocampal synapses in the infralimbic cortex (IL) and extinction reversed the depression. BDNF could also reverse the conditioning-induced depression mimicking extinction. In contrast, animals with impaired fear extinction recall, a PTSD-like phenotype, failed to reverse the conditioning-induced changes. Our findings suggest that conditioned fear responses are modulated by changes in NMDAR current at ventral hippocampal synapses in IL and suggest a novel mechanism that could contribute to impaired contextual modulation of fear seen in patients with PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25457?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphomannomutase deficiency (PMM2‐CDG) causes cerebellar syndrome and stroke‐like episodes (SLEs). SLEs are also described in patients with gain‐of‐function mutations in the CaV2.1 channel, for which acetazolamide therapy is suggested. Impairment in N‐glycosylation of CaV2.1 promotes gain‐of‐function effects and may participate in cerebellar syndrome in PMM2‐CDG. AZATAX was designed to establish whether acetazolamide is safe and improves cerebellar syndrome in PMM2‐CDG.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clinical trial included PMM2‐CDG patients with a 6‐month first‐phase single acetazolamide therapy group, followed by a randomized 5‐week withdrawal phase. Safety was assessed. The primary outcome measure was improvement in the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). Other measures were the Nijmegen Pediatric CDG Rating Scale (NPCRS), a syllable repetition test (PATA test), and cognitive scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐four patients (mean age 12.3±4.5 years) were included, showing no serious adverse events. Thirteen patients required dose adjustment due to low bicarbonate or asthenia. There were improvements in ICARS (34.9±23.2 vs 40.7±24.8, effect size 1.48, [95%CI 4.0‐7.6]; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), detected at 6 weeks in 18 patients among the 20 responders, in NPCRS ([95%CI 0.3‐1.6]; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.013) and in PATA test ([95%CI 0.5‐3.0]; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.006). Acetazolamide improved prothrombin time, factor X, and antithrombin. Clinical severity, epilepsy, and lipodystrophy predicted greater response. The randomized withdrawal phase showed an ICARS worsening in the withdrawal group (effect size 1.46, [95%CI 2.65‐7.52]; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AZATAX is the first clinical trial of PMM2‐CDG. Acetazolamide is well tolerated and effective for motor cerebellar syndrome. Its ability to prevent SLEs and its long‐term effects on kidney function should be addressed in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The Disease-Associated Chaperone FKBP51 Impairs Cognitive Function by Accelerating AMPA Receptor Recycling</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0242-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Increased expression of the FK506-binding protein 5 (&lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt;) gene has been associated with a number of diseases, but most prominently in connection to psychiatric illnesses. Many of these psychiatric disorders present with dementia and other cognitive deficits, but a direct connection between these issues and alterations in &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; remains unclear. We generated a novel transgenic mouse to selectively overexpress &lt;i&gt;FKBP5,&lt;/i&gt; which encodes the FKBP51 protein, in the corticolimbic system, which had no overt effects on gross body weight, motor ability, or general anxiety. Instead, we found that overexpression of FKBP51 impaired long-term depression (LTD) as well as spatial reversal learning and memory, suggesting a role in glutamate receptor regulation. Indeed, FKBP51 altered the association of heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) with AMPA receptors, which was accompanied by an accelerated rate of AMPA recycling. In this way, the chaperone system is critical in triage decisions for AMPA receptor trafficking. Imbalance in the chaperone system may manifest in impairments in both inhibitory learning and cognitive function. These findings uncover an unexpected and essential mechanism for learning and memory that is controlled by the psychiatric risk factor &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Network Properties Revealed during Multi-Scale Calcium Imaging of Seizure Activity in Zebrafish</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0041-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Seizures are characterized by hypersynchronization of neuronal networks. Understanding these networks could provide a critical window for therapeutic control of recurrent seizure activity, i.e., epilepsy. However, imaging seizure networks has largely been limited to microcircuits &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; or small &quot;windows&quot; &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we combine fast confocal imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP)-expressing larval zebrafish with local field potential (LFP) recordings to study epileptiform events at whole-brain and single-neuron levels &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Using an acute seizure model (pentylenetetrazole, PTZ), we reliably observed recurrent electrographic ictal-like events associated with generalized activation of all major brain regions and uncovered a well-preserved anterior-to-posterior seizure propagation pattern. We also examined brain-wide network synchronization and spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal activity in the optic tectum microcircuit. Brain-wide and single-neuronal level analysis of PTZ-exposed and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-exposed zebrafish revealed distinct network dynamics associated with seizure and non-seizure hyperexcitable states, respectively. Neuronal ensembles, comprised of coactive neurons, were also uncovered during interictal-like periods. Taken together, these results demonstrate that macro- and micro-network calcium motifs in zebrafish may provide a greater understanding of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05610</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With memory encoding reliant on persistent changes in the properties of
synapses, a key question is how can memories be maintained from days to months
or a lifetime given molecular turnover? It is likely that positive feedback
loops are necessary to persistently maintain the strength of synapses that
participate in encoding. Such feedback may occur within signal-transduction
cascades and/or the regulation of translation, and it may occur within specific
subcellular compartments or within neuronal networks. Not surprisingly,
numerous positive feedback loops have been proposed. Some posited loops operate
at the level of biochemical signal transduction cascades, such as persistent
activation of Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II or protein kinase M zeta. Another level
consists of feedback loops involving transcriptional, epigenetic and
translational pathways, and autocrine actions of growth factors such as BDNF.
Finally, at the neuronal network level, recurrent reactivation of cell
assemblies encoding memories is likely to be essential for late maintenance of
memory. These levels are not isolated, but linked by shared components of
feedback loops. Here, we review characteristics of some commonly discussed
feedback loops proposed to underlie the maintenance of memory and long-term
synaptic plasticity, assess evidence for and against their necessity, and
suggest experiments that could further delineate the dynamics of these feedback
loops. We also discuss crosstalk between proposed loops, and ways in which such
interaction can facilitate the rapidity and robustness of memory formation and
storage.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Noisy network attractor models for transitions between EEG microstates. (arXiv:1903.05590v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05590</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain is intrinsically organized into large-scale networks that
constantly re-organize on multiple timescales, even when the brain is at rest.
The timing of these dynamics is crucial for sensation, perception, cognition
and ultimately consciousness, but the underlying dynamics governing the
constant reorganization and switching between networks are not yet well
understood. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
electroencephalography (EEG) provide anatomical and temporal information about
the resting-state networks (RSNs), respectively. EEG microstates are brief
periods of stable scalp topography, and four distinct configurations with
characteristic switching patterns between them are reliably identified at rest.
Microstates have been identified as the electrophysiological correlate of
fMRI-defined RSNs, this link could be established because EEG microstate
sequences are scale-free and have long-range temporal correlations. This
property is crucial for any approach to model EEG microstates. This paper
proposes a novel modeling approach for microstates: we consider nonlinear
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that exhibit a noisy network attractor
between nodes that represent the microstates. Using a single layer network
between four states, we can reproduce the transition probabilities between
microstates but not the heavy tailed residence time distributions. Introducing
a two layer network with a hidden layer gives the flexibility to capture these
heavy tails and their long-range temporal correlations. We fit these models to
capture the statistical properties of microstate sequences from EEG data
recorded inside and outside the MRI scanner and show that the processing
required to separate the EEG signal from the fMRI machine noise results in a
loss of information which is reflected in differences in the long tail of the
dwell-time distributions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Effect of Interpopulation Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity on Synchronized Rhythms in Neuronal Networks with Inhibitory and Excitatory Populations. (arXiv:1903.05288v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05288</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We consider clustered small-world networks (SWNs) with two inhibitory (I) and
excitatory (E) populations. This I-E neuronal network has adaptive dynamic I to
E and E to I interpopulation synaptic strengths, governed by interpopulation
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In previous works without STDPs, fast
sparsely synchronized rhythms were found to appear in a range of noise
intensity $D$. Here, by varying $D$, we investigate the effect of
interpopulation STDPs on population states in the I- and the E-populations.
Depending on values of $D$, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term
depression (LTD) for population-averaged values of saturated interpopulation
synaptic strengths are found to occur, and they make effects on the degree of
population synchronization. In a broad region of intermediate $D$, the degree
of good synchronization (with higher spiking measure) becomes decreased, while
in a region of large $D$, the degree of bad synchronization (with lower spiking
measure) gets increased. Consequently, in each I- or E-population, the
synchronization degree becomes nearly the same in a wide range of $D$. This
kind of &quot;equalization effect&quot; is found to occur via cooperative interplay
between the average occupation and pacing degrees of synchronized rhythms. Such
equalization effect is much more enhanced in the presence of combined I to E
and E to I STDPs when compared with the case of individual I to E or E to I
STDP. We note that the equalization effect in interpopulation synaptic
plasticity is in contrast to the Matthew (bipolarization) effect in
intrapopulation (I to I and E to E) synaptic plasticity where good (bad)
synchronization gets better (worse). Moreover, emergences of LTP and LTD of
interpopulation synaptic strengths are intensively investigated via a
microscopic method based on the distributions of time delays between the pre-
and the post-synaptic spike times.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five years ago, Dunkelmann and Radons (1994) proposed that neural
networks should self-organize to a critical state. In models, criticality
offers a number of computational advantages. Thus this hypothesis, and in

avalanche of research, with thousands of studies referring to it. Nonetheless,
experimental results are still contradictory. How is it possible, that a
hypothesis has attracted active research for decades, but nonetheless remains
controversial? We discuss the experimental and conceptual controversy, and then
present a parsimonious solution that (i) unifies the contradictory experimental
results, (ii) avoids disadvantages of a critical state, and (iii) enables
rapid, adaptive tuning of network properties to task requirements.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42413</link>
	<content:encoded>Principles of regulation of actin network dimensions are fundamentally important for cell functions, yet remain unclear. Using both in vitro and in silico approaches, we studied the effect of key parameters, such as actin density, ADF/Cofilin concentration and network width on the network length. In the presence of ADF/Cofilin, networks reached equilibrium and became treadmilling. At the trailing edge, the network disintegrated into large fragments. A mathematical model predicts the network length as a function of width, actin and ADF/Cofilin concentrations. Local depletion of ADF/Cofilin by binding to actin is significant, leading to wider networks growing longer. A single rate of breaking network nodes, proportional to ADF/Cofilin density and inversely proportional to the square of the actin density, can account for the disassembly dynamics. Selective disassembly of heterogeneous networks by ADF/Cofilin controls steering during motility. Our results establish general principles on how the dynamic steady state of actin network emerges from biochemical and structural feedbacks.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Inadequate BiP availability defines endoplasmic reticulum stress</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41168</link>
	<content:encoded>How endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leads to cytotoxicity is ill-defined. Previously we showed that HeLa cells readjust homeostasis upon proteostatically driven ER stress, triggered by inducible bulk expression of secretory immunoglobulin M heavy chain (μ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) thanks to the unfolded protein response (UPR; Bakunts et al., 2017). Here we show that conditions that prevent that an excess of the ER resident chaperone (and UPR target gene) BiP over µ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is restored lead to µ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-driven proteotoxicity, i.e. abrogation of HRD1-mediated ER-associated degradation (ERAD), or of the UPR, in particular the ATF6α branch. Such conditions are tolerated instead upon removal of the BiP-sequestering first constant domain (C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1) from µ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, our data define proteostatic ER stress to be a specific consequence of inadequate BiP availability, which both the UPR and ERAD redeem.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: H3K9me3 is required for inheritance of small RNAs that target a unique subset of newly evolved genes</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40448</link>
	<content:encoded>In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, RNA interference (RNAi) responses can transmit across generations via small RNAs. RNAi inheritance is associated with Histone-3-Lysine-9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) of the targeted genes. In other organisms, maintenance of silencing requires a feed-forward loop between H3K9me3 and small RNAs. Here, we show that in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; not only is H3K9me3 unnecessary for inheritance, the modification’s function depends on the identity of the RNAi-targeted gene. We found an asymmetry in the requirement for H3K9me3 and the main worm H3K9me3 methyltransferases, SET-25 and SET-32. Both methyltransferases promote heritable silencing of the foreign gene &lt;i&gt;gfp&lt;/i&gt;, but are dispensable for silencing of the endogenous gene &lt;i&gt;oma-1&lt;/i&gt;. Genome-wide examination of heritable endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) revealed that endo-siRNAs that depend on SET-25 and SET-32 target newly acquired and highly H3K9me3 marked genes. Thus, ‘repressive’ chromatin marks could be important specifically for heritable silencing of genes which are flagged as ‘foreign’, such as &lt;i&gt;gfp&lt;/i&gt;.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A spatio-temporal individual-based network framework for West Nile virus in the USA: Spreading pattern of West Nile virus</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/9rfZ0tOoEtc/article</link>

West Nile virus (WNV)—a mosquito-borne arbovirus—entered the USA through New York City in 1999 and spread to the contiguous USA within three years while transitioning from epidemic outbreaks to endemic transmission. The virus is transmitted by vector competent mosquitoes and maintained in the avian populations. WNV spatial distribution is mainly determined by the movement of residential and migratory avian populations. We developed an individual-level heterogeneous network framework across the USA with the goal of understanding the long-range spatial distribution of WNV. To this end, we proposed three distance dispersal kernels model: 1) exponential—short-range dispersal, 2) power-law—long-range dispersal in all directions, and 3) power-law biased by flyway direction —long-range dispersal only along established migratory routes. To select the appropriate dispersal kernel we used the human case data and adopted a model selection framework based on approximate Bayesian computation with sequential Monte Carlo sampling (ABC-SMC). From estimated parameters, we find that the power-law biased by flyway direction kernel is the best kernel to fit WNV human case data, supporting the hypothesis of long-range WNV transmission is mainly along the migratory bird flyways. Through extensive simulation from 2014 to 2016, we proposed and tested hypothetical mitigation strategies and found that mosquito population reduction in the infected states and neighboring states is potentially cost-effective.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9rfZ0tOoEtc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Cholinergic system changes of falls and freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25430?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postural instability and gait difficulties (PIGDs) represent debilitating disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD). Past acetylcholinesterase positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies implicate cholinergic changes as significant contributors to PIGD features. These studies were limited in quantification of striatal cholinergic synapse integrity. Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) PET ligands are better suited for evaluation of high binding areas. We examined associations between regional VAChT expression and freezing of gait (FoG) and falls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ninety‐four PD subjects underwent clinical assessment and VAChT ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FEOBV) PET.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐five subjects (37.2%) reported a history of falls, and 15 (16%) had observed FoG. Univariate volume‐of‐interest analyses demonstrated significantly reduced thalamic (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0016) VAChT expression in fallers compared to nonfallers. VAChT expression was significantly reduced in the striatum (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0012) and limbic archicortex (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004) in freezers compared to nonfreezers. Whole‐brain voxel‐based analyses of FEOBV PET complemented these findings and showed more granular changes associated with falling history, including the right visual thalamus (especially the right lateral geniculate nucleus [LGN]), right caudate nucleus, and bilateral prefrontal regions. Freezers had prominent VAChT expression reductions in the bilateral striatum, temporal, and mesiofrontal limbic regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings confirm and extend on previous PET findings of thalamic cholinergic deficits associated with falling history and now emphasize right visual thalamus complex changes, including the right LGN. FoG status is associated with reduced VAChT expression in striatal cholinergic interneurons and the limbic archicortex. These observations suggest different cholinergic systems changes underlying falls and FoG in PD. Ann Neurol, 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Perceived target range shapes human sound-localization behavior</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0111-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The auditory system relies on binaural differences and spectral pinna cues to localize sounds in azimuth and elevation. However, the acoustic input can be unreliable, due to uncertainty about the environment, and neural noise. A possible strategy to reduce sound-location uncertainty is to integrate the sensory observations with sensorimotor information from previous experience, to infer where sounds are more likely to occur. We investigated whether and how human sound localization performance is affected by the spatial distribution of target sounds, and changes thereof. We tested three different open-loop paradigms, in which we varied the spatial range of sounds in different ways. For the narrowest ranges, target-response gains were highly idiosyncratic and deviated from an optimal gain predicted by error-minimization; in the horizontal plane the deviation typically consisted of a response overshoot. Moreover, participants adjusted their behavior by rapidly adapting their gain to the target range, both in elevation and in azimuth, yielding behavior closer to optimal for larger target ranges. Notably, gain changes occurred without any exogenous feedback about performance. We discuss how the findings can be explained by a sub-optimal model in which the motor-control system reduces its response error across trials to within an acceptable range – rather than strictly minimizing the error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Sensory observations can be noisy, leading to uncertainty in perceptual inferences and variable estimation errors. Theoretically, to reduce uncertainty, sensory information could be integrated with knowledge from prior experience, and with feedback about one’s own response behavior. Here we show, that for a basic and accurate sensorimotor task such as sound localization, humans indeed rely on perceived experience in the absence of exogenous feedback, as they rapidly changed their response sensitivity to experimental variations in the spatial distribution of targets. We argue that the auditory system reduces its estimated localization error close to its expected minimum across trials, allowing for idiosyncratic sub-optimal target response gains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: LDB1 Is Required for the Early Development of the Dorsal Telencephalon and the Thalamus</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0356-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;LIM domain binding protein 1 (LDB1) is a protein cofactor that participates in several multiprotein complexes with transcription factors that regulate mouse forebrain development. Since &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; null mutants display early embryonic lethality, we used a conditional knockout strategy to examine the role of LDB1 in early forebrain development using multiple Cre lines. Loss of &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; from E8.75 using Foxg1Cre caused a disruption of midline boundary structures in the dorsal telencephalon. While this Cre line gave the expected pattern of recombination of the floxed &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; locus, unexpectedly, standard Cre lines that act from embryonic day (E)10.5 (Emx1Cre) and E11.5 (NesCre) did not show efficient or complete recombination in the dorsal telencephalon by E12.5. Intriguingly, this effect was specific to the &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; floxed allele, since three other lines including floxed Ai9 and mTmG reporters, and a floxed &lt;i&gt;Lhx2&lt;/i&gt; line, each displayed the expected spatial patterns of recombination. Furthermore, the incomplete recombination of the floxed &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; locus using NesCre was limited to the dorsal telencephalon, while the ventral telencephalon and the diencephalon displayed the expected loss of &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt;. This permitted us to examine the requirement for LDB1 in the development of the thalamus in a context wherein the cortex continued to express &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt;. We report that the somatosensory VB nucleus is profoundly shrunken upon loss of LDB1. Our findings highlight the unusual nature of the &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; locus in terms of recombination efficiency, and also report a novel role for LDB1 during the development of the thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Long-Term, Targeted Delivery of GDNF from Encapsulated Cells Is Neuroprotective and Reduces Seizures in the Pilocarpine Model of Epilepsy</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2144?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurotrophic factors are candidates for treating epilepsy, but their development has been hampered by difficulties in achieving stable and targeted delivery of efficacious concentrations within the desired brain region. We have developed an encapsulated cell technology that overcomes these obstacles by providing a targeted, continuous, &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; synthesized source of high levels of neurotrophic molecules from human clonal ARPE-19 cells encapsulated into hollow fiber membranes. Here we illustrate the potential of this approach for delivering glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) directly to the hippocampus of epileptic rats. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies demonstrated that bilateral intrahippocampal implants continued to secrete GDNF that produced high hippocampal GDNF tissue levels in a long-term manner. Identical implants robustly reduced seizure frequency in the pilocarpine model. Seizures were reduced rapidly, and this effect increased in magnitude over 3 months, ultimately leading to a reduction of seizures by 93%. This effect persisted even after device removal, suggesting potential disease-modifying benefits. Importantly, seizure reduction was associated with normalized changes in anxiety and improved cognitive performance. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the neurological benefits of GDNF were associated with the normalization of anatomical alterations accompanying chronic epilepsy, including hippocampal atrophy, cell degeneration, loss of parvalbumin-positive interneurons, and abnormal neurogenesis. These effects were associated with the activation of GDNF receptors. All in all, these results support the concept that the implantation of encapsulated GDNF-secreting cells can deliver GDNF in a sustained, targeted, and efficacious manner, paving the way for continuing preclinical evaluation and eventual clinical translation of this approach for epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological conditions, affecting millions of individuals of all ages. These patients experience debilitating seizures that frequently increase over time and can associate with significant cognitive decline and psychiatric disorders that are generally poorly controlled by pharmacotherapy. We have developed a clinically validated, implantable cell encapsulation system that delivers high and consistent levels of GDNF directly to the brain. In epileptic animals, this system produced a progressive and permanent reduction (&amp;gt;90%) in seizure frequency. These benefits were accompanied by improvements in cognitive and anxiolytic behavior and the normalization of changes in CNS anatomy that underlie chronic epilepsy. Together, these data suggest a novel means of tackling the frequently intractable neurological consequences of this devastating disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: MicroRNA-1224 Splicing CircularRNA-Filip1l in an Ago2-Dependent Manner Regulates Chronic Inflammatory Pain via Targeting Ubr5</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2125?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dysfunctions of gene transcription and translation in the nociceptive pathways play the critical role in development and maintenance of chronic pain. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as new players in regulation of gene expression, but whether and how circRNAs are involved in chronic pain remain elusive. We showed here that complete Freund's adjuvant-induced chronic inflammation pain significantly increased circRNA-Filip1l (filamin A interacting protein 1-like) expression in spinal neurons of mice. Blockage of this increase attenuated complete Freund's adjuvant-induced nociceptive behaviors, and overexpression of spinal circRNA-Filip1l in naive mice mimicked the nociceptive behaviors as evidenced by decreased thermal and mechanical nociceptive threshold. Furthermore, we found that mature circRNA-Filip1l expression was negatively regulated by miRNA-1224 via binding and splicing of precursor of circRNA-Filip1l (pre-circRNA-Filip1l) in the Argonaute-2 (&lt;i&gt;Ago2&lt;/i&gt;)-dependent manner. Increase of spinal circRNA-Filip1l expression resulted from the decrease of miRNA-1224 expression under chronic inflammation pain state. miRNA-1224 knockdown or &lt;i&gt;Ago2&lt;/i&gt; overexpression induced nociceptive behaviors in naive mice, which was prevented by the knockdown of spinal circRNA-Filip1l. Finally, we demonstrated that a ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-recognin 5 (&lt;i&gt;Ubr5&lt;/i&gt;), validated as a target of circRNA-Filip1l, plays a pivotal role in regulation of nociception by spinal circRNA-Filip1l. These data suggest that miRNA-1224-mediated and Ago2-dependent modulation of spinal circRNA-Filip1l expression regulates nociception via targeting &lt;i&gt;Ubr5&lt;/i&gt;, revealing a novel epigenetic mechanism of interaction between miRNA and circRNA in chronic inflammation pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; circRNAs are emerging as new players in regulation of gene expression. Here, we found that the increase of circRNA-Filip1l mediated by miRNA-1224 in an Ago2-dependent way in the spinal cord is involved in regulation of nociception via targeting &lt;i&gt;Ubr5&lt;/i&gt;. Our study reveals a novel epigenetic mechanism of interaction between miRNA and circRNA in chronic inflammation pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neurons in FEF Keep Track of Items That Have Been Previously Fixated in Free Viewing Visual Search</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2114?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When searching a visual scene for a target, we tend not to look at items or locations we have already searched. It is thought that this behavior is driven by an inhibitory tagging mechanism that inhibits responses on priority maps to the relevant items. We hypothesized that this inhibitory tagging signal should be represented as an elevated response in neurons that keep track of stimuli that have been fixated. We recorded from 231 neurons in the frontal eye field (FEF) of 2 male animals performing a visual foraging task, in which they had to find a reward linked to one of five identical targets (Ts) among five distractors. We identified 38 neurons with activity that was significantly greater when the stimulus in the receptive field had been fixated previously in the trial than when it had not been fixated. The response to a fixated object began before the saccade ended, suggesting that this information is remapped. Unlike most FEF neurons, the activity in these cells was not suppressed during active fixation, had minimal motor responses, and did not change through the trial. Yet using traditional classifications from a memory-guided saccade, they were indistinguishable from the rest of the FEF population. We propose that these neurons keep track of any items that have been fixated within the trial and this signal is propagated by remapping. These neurons could be the source of the inhibitory tagging signal to parietal cortex, where a neuronal instantiation of inhibitory tagging is seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When we search a scene for an item, we rarely examine the same location twice. It is thought that this is due to a neural mechanism that keeps track of the items at which we have looked. Here we identified a subset of neurons in the frontal eye field that preferentially responded to items that had been fixated earlier in the trial. These responses were remapped, appearing before the saccade even ended, and were not suppressed during maintained fixation. We propose that these neurons keep track of which items have been examined in search and could be the source of feedback that creates the inhibitory tagging seen in parietal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2102?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;By predicting sensory consequences of actions, humans can distinguish self-generated sensory inputs from those that are elicited externally. This is one mechanism by which we achieve a subjective sense of agency over our actions. Corollary discharge (CD) signals—&quot;copies&quot; of motor signals sent to sensory areas—permit such predictions, and CD abnormalities are a hypothesized mechanism for the agency disruptions in schizophrenia that characterize a subset of symptoms. Indeed, behavioral evidence of altered CD, including in the oculomotor system, has been observed in schizophrenia patients. A pathway projecting from the superior colliculus to the frontal eye fields (FEFs) via the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) conveys oculomotor CD associated with saccadic eye movements in nonhuman primates. This animal work provides a promising translational framework in which to investigate CD abnormalities in clinical populations. In the current study, we examined whether structural connectivity of this MD–FEF pathway relates to oculomotor CD functioning in schizophrenia. Twenty-two schizophrenia patients and 24 healthy control participants of both sexes underwent diffusion tensor imaging, and a large subset performed a trans-saccadic perceptual task that yields measures of CD. Using probabilistic tractography, we identified anatomical connections between FEF and MD and extracted indices of microstructural integrity. Patients exhibited compromised microstructural integrity in the MD–FEF pathway, which was correlated with greater oculomotor CD abnormalities and more severe psychotic symptoms. These data reinforce the role of the MD–FEF pathway in transmitting oculomotor CD signals and suggest that disturbances in this pathway may relate to psychotic symptom manifestation in patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; People with schizophrenia sometimes experience abnormalities in a sense of agency, which may stem from abnormal sensory predictions about their own actions. Consistent with this notion, the current study found reduced structural connectivity in patients with schizophrenia in a specific brain pathway found to transmit such sensorimotor prediction signals in nonhuman primates. Reduced structural connectivity was correlated with behavioral evidence for impaired sensorimotor predictions and psychotic symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Changes in Both Neuron Intrinsic Properties and Neurotransmission Are Needed to Drive the Increase in GnRH Neuron Firing Rate during Estradiol-Positive Feedback</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2091?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Central output of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons controls fertility and is sculpted by sex-steroid feedback. A switch of estradiol action from negative to positive feedback initiates a surge of GnRH release, culminating in ovulation. In ovariectomized mice bearing constant-release estradiol implants (OVX+E), GnRH neuron firing is suppressed in the morning (AM) by negative feedback and activated in the afternoon (PM) by positive feedback; no time-of-day-dependent changes occur in OVX mice. In this daily surge model, GnRH neuron intrinsic properties are shifted to favor increased firing during positive feedback. It is unclear whether this shift and the observed concomitant increase in GABAergic transmission, which typically excites GnRH neurons, are independently sufficient for increasing GnRH neuron firing rate during positive feedback or whether both are needed. To test this, we used dynamic clamp to inject selected previously recorded trains of GABAergic postsynaptic conductances (PSgs) collected during the different feedback states of the daily surge model into GnRH neurons from OVX, OVX+E AM, and OVX+E PM mice. PSg trains mimicking positive feedback initiated more action potentials in cells from OVX+E PM mice than negative feedback or OVX (open feedback loop) trains in all three animal models, but the positive-feedback train was most effective when applied to cells during positive feedback. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; studies of model GnRH neurons in which &amp;gt;1000 PSg trains were tested exhibited the same results. These observations support the hypothesis that GnRH neurons integrate fast-synaptic and intrinsic changes to increase firing rates during positive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Infertility affects 15%–20% of couples; failure to ovulate is a common cause. Understanding how the brain controls ovulation is critical for new developments in both infertility treatment and contraception. Ovarian estradiol alters both the intrinsic properties of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons and synaptic inputs to these cells coincident with production of sustained GnRH release that ultimately triggers ovulation. We demonstrate here using dynamic clamp and mathematical modeling that estradiol-induced shifts in synaptic transmission alone can increase firing output, but that the intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons during positive feedback further poise these cells for increased response to higher frequency synaptic transmission. These data suggest that GnRH neurons integrate fast-synaptic and intrinsic changes to increase firing rates during the preovulatory GnRH surge.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Prefrontal Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF) Neurons Act Locally to Modulate Frontostriatal Cognition and Circuit Function</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2080?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The PFC and extended frontostriatal circuitry support higher cognitive processes that guide goal-directed behavior. PFC-dependent cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of multiple psychiatric disorders. Unfortunately, a major limiting factor in the development of treatments for PFC cognitive dysfunction is our limited understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying PFC-dependent cognition. We recently demonstrated that activation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors in the caudal dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) impairs higher cognitive function, as measured in a working memory task. Currently, there remains much unknown about CRF-dependent regulation of cognition, including the source of CRF for cognition-modulating receptors and the output pathways modulated by these receptors. To address these issues, the current studies used a viral vector-based approach to chemogenetically activate or inhibit PFC CRF neurons in working memory-tested male rats. Chemogenetic activation of caudal, but not rostral, dmPFC CRF neurons potently impaired working memory, whereas inhibition of these neurons improved working memory. Importantly, the cognition-impairing actions of PFC CRF neurons were dependent on local CRF receptors coupled to protein kinase A. Additional electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that chemogenetic activation of caudal dmPFC CRF neurons elicits a robust degradation of task-related coding properties of dmPFC pyramidal neurons and, to a lesser extent, medium spiny neurons in the dorsomedial striatum. Collectively, these results demonstrate that local CRF release within the caudal dmPFC impairs frontostriatal cognitive and circuit function and suggest that CRF may represent a potential target for treating frontostriatal cognitive dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The dorsomedial PFC and its striatal targets play a critical role in higher cognitive function. PFC-dependent cognitive dysfunction is associated with many psychiatric disorders. Although it has long-been known that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons are prominent within the PFC, their role in cognition has remained unclear. Using a novel chemogenetic viral vector system, the present studies demonstrate that PFC CRF neurons impair working memory via activation of local PKA-coupled CRF receptors, an action associated with robust degradation in task-related frontostriatal neuronal coding. Conversely, suppression of constitutive PFC CRF activity improved working memory. Collectively, these studies provide novel insight into the neurobiology of cognition and suggest that CRF may represent a novel target for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Plasticity in the Link between Pain-Transmitting and Pain-Modulating Systems in Acute and Persistent Inflammation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2065?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is strong evidence that spinoparabrachial neurons in the superficial dorsal horn contribute to persistent pain states, and that the lateral parabrachial complex (PB) conveys relevant nociceptive information to higher structures. The role of PB itself in hyperalgesia and how it recruits descending facilitation has nevertheless received significantly less attention. The current study is a first step toward delineating the functional dynamics of PB and its link to descending control in acute and persistent inflammatory pain. In lightly anesthetized rats, we recorded behavioral withdrawal evoked by mechanical stimulation of the hindpaw and, simultaneously, the activity of identified pain-modulating neurons, &quot;ON-cells&quot; and &quot;OFF-cells,&quot; in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). This was done before and after the inactivation of PB, contralateral or ipsilateral to an inflamed paw [1 h, 1 d, or 5–6 d after intraplantar injection of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)]. The inactivation of contralateral, but not ipsilateral, PB interfered with nociceptive input to RVM under basal conditions, as well as in acute inflammation. By contrast, blocking ipsilateral, but not contralateral, PB in established inflammation interfered with behavioral hyperalgesia and ON-cell and OFF-cell responses. The lesioning of contralateral PB before CFA injection prevented this recruitment of ipsilateral PB in persistent inflammation. These experiments show that contralateral PB is required to initiate hyperalgesia, which is then maintained by ipsilateral PB, most likely in both cases via the engagement of pain-modulating neurons of the RVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The lateral parabrachial complex (PB) relays nociceptive information to brain circuits that are important for the transmission and modulation of pain, but its specific role in persistent pain and engagement of descending control mechanisms has received relatively little attention. We show here that PB contralateral and ipsilateral to an inflammatory insult demonstrate different functions as inflammation persists, likely by engaging pain-facilitating neurons of the rostral ventromedial medulla. While the contralateral PB, the target of the major spinoparabrachial pathway, relays acute nociceptive information, the ipsilateral PB is recruited or unmasked in persistent inflammation to maintain hyperalgesia. These data point to plasticity in the PB itself or its direct and indirect connections with pain-modulating systems as central to the development and maintenance of persistent pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Superficial Layers Suppress the Deep Layers to Fine-tune Cortical Coding</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2052?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The descending microcircuit from layer 2/3 (L2/3) to layer 5 (L5) is one of the strongest excitatory pathways in the cortex, presumably forming a core component of its feedforward hierarchy. To date, however, no experiments have selectively tested the impact of L2/3 activity on L5 during active sensation. We used optogenetic, cell-type-specific manipulation of L2/3 neurons in the barrel cortex of actively sensing mice (of either sex) to elucidate the significance of this pathway to sensory coding in L5. Contrary to standard models, activating L2/3 predominantly suppressed spontaneous activity in L5, whereas deactivating L2/3 mainly facilitated touch responses in L5. Somatostatin interneurons are likely important to this suppression because their optogenetic deactivation significantly altered the functional impact of L2/3 onto L5. The net effect of L2/3 was to enhance the stimulus selectivity and expand the range of L5 output. These data imply that the core cortical pathway increases the selectivity and expands the range of cortical output through feedforward inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The primary sensory cortex contains six distinct layers that interact to form the basis of our perception. While rudimentary patterns of connectivity between the layers have been outlined quite extensively &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, functional relationships &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, particularly during active sensation, remain poorly understood. We used cell-type-specific optogenetics to test the functional relationship between layer 2/3 and layer 5. Surprisingly, we discovered that L2/3 primarily suppresses cortical output from L5. The recruitment of somatostatin-positive interneurons is likely fundamental to this relationship. The net effect of this translaminar suppression is to enhance the selectivity and expand the range of receptive fields, therefore potentially sharpening the perception of space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ventral Pallidum Is the Primary Target for Accumbens D1 Projections Driving Cocaine Seeking</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2041?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Outputs from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) include projections to the ventral pallidum and the ventral tegmental area and subtantia nigra in the ventral mesencephalon. The medium spiny neurons (MSN) that give rise to these pathways are GABAergic and consist of two populations of equal number that are segregated by differentially expressed proteins, including D1- and D2-dopamine receptors. Afferents to the ventral pallidum arise from both D1- and D2-MSNs, whereas the ventral mesencephalon is selectively innervated by D1-MSN. To determine the extent of collateralization of D1-MSN to these axon terminal fields we used retrograde labeling in transgenic mice expressing tdTomato selectively in D1-MSN, and found that a large majority of D1-MSN in either the shell or core subcompartments of the accumbens collateralized to both output structures. Approximately 70% of D1-MSNs projecting to the ventral pallidum collateralized to the ventral mesencephalon, whereas &amp;gt;90% of mesencephalic D1-MSN afferents collateralized to the ventral pallidum. In contrast, &amp;lt;10% of dorsal striatal D1-MSNs collateralized to both the globus pallidus and ventral mesencephalon. D1-MSN activation is required for conditioned cues to induce cocaine seeking. To determine which D1-MSN projection mediates cued cocaine seeking, we selectively transfected D1-MSNs in transgenic rats with an inhibitory Gi-coupled DREADD. Activation of the transfected Gi-DREADD with clozapine-N-oxide administered into the ventral pallidum, but not into the ventral mesencephalon, blocked cue-induced cocaine seeking. These data show that, although accumbens D1-MSNs largely collateralize to both the ventral pallidum and ventral mesencephalon, only D1-MSN innervation of the ventral pallidum is necessary for cue-induced cocaine seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Activity in D1 dopamine receptor-expressing neurons in the NAc is required for rodents to respond to cocaine-conditioned cues and relapse to drug seeking behaviors. The D1-expressing neurons project to both the ventral pallidum and ventral mesencephalon, and we found that a majority of the neurons that innervate the ventral pallidum also collateralize to the ventral mesencephalon. However, despite innervating both structures, only D1 innervation of the ventral pallidum mediates cue-induced cocaine seeking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Complement Targets Newborn Retinal Ganglion Cells for Phagocytic Elimination by Microglia</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2025?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia play important roles in shaping the developing CNS, and at early stages they have been proposed to regulate progenitor proliferation, differentiation, and neuronal survival. However, these studies reveal contradictory outcomes, highlighting the complexity of these cell–cell interactions. Here, we investigate microglia function during embryonic mouse retina development, where only microglia, progenitors, and neurons are present. In both sexes, we determine that microglia primarily interact with retinal neurons and find that depletion of microglia via conditional KO of the &lt;i&gt;Csf1&lt;/i&gt; receptor results in increased density of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Pharmacological inhibition of microglia also results in an increase in RGCs, with no effect on retinal progenitor proliferation, RGC genesis, or apoptosis. We show that microglia in the embryonic retina are enriched for phagocytic markers and observe engulfment of nonapoptotic Brn3-labeled RGCs. We investigate the molecular pathways that can mediate cell engulfment by microglia and find selective downregulation of complement pathway components with microglia inhibition, and further show that C1q protein marks a subset of RGCs in the embryonic retina. KO of complement receptor 3 (&lt;i&gt;CR3; Itgam&lt;/i&gt;), which is only expressed by microglia, results in increased RGC density, similar to what we observed after depletion or inhibition of microglia. Thus, our data suggest that microglia regulate neuron elimination in the embryonic mouse retina by complement-mediated phagocytosis of non-apoptotic newborn RGCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Microglia are emerging as active and important participants in regulating neuron number in development, during adult neurogenesis, and following stem cell therapies. However, their role in these contexts and the mechanisms involved are not fully defined. Using a well-characterized &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; system, we provide evidence that microglia regulate neuronal elimination by complement-mediated engulfment of nonapoptotic neurons. This work provides a significant advancement of the field by defining &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; molecular mechanisms for microglia-mediated cell elimination. Our data add to a growing body of evidence that microglia are essential for proper nervous system development. In addition, we elucidate microglia function in the developing retina, which may shed light on microglia involvement in the context of retinal injury and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Knockdown of Fidgetin Improves Regeneration of Injured Axons by a Microtubule-Based Mechanism</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2011?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fidgetin is a microtubule-severing protein that pares back the labile domains of microtubules in the axon. Experimental depletion of fidgetin results in elongation of the labile domains of microtubules and faster axonal growth. To test whether &lt;i&gt;fidgetin&lt;/i&gt; knockdown assists axonal regeneration, we plated dissociated adult rat DRGs transduced using AAV5-shRNA-&lt;i&gt;fidgetin&lt;/i&gt; on a laminin substrate with spots of aggrecan, a growth-inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. This cell culture assay mimics the glial scar formed after CNS injury. Aggrecan is more concentrated at the edge of the spot, such that axons growing from within the spot toward the edge encounter a concentration gradient that causes growth cones to become dystrophic and axons to retract or curve back on themselves. &lt;i&gt;Fidgetin&lt;/i&gt; knockdown resulted in faster-growing axons on both laminin and aggrecan and enhanced crossing of axons from laminin onto aggrecan. Strikingly, axons from within the spot grew more avidly against the inhibitory aggrecan concentration gradient to cross onto laminin, without retracting or curving back. We also tested whether depleting fidgetin improves axonal regeneration &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; after a dorsal root crush in adult female rats. Whereas control DRG neurons failed to extend axons across the dorsal root entry zone after injury, DRG neurons in which &lt;i&gt;fidgetin&lt;/i&gt; was knocked down displayed enhanced regeneration of axons across the dorsal root entry zone into the spinal cord. Collectively, these results establish fidgetin as a novel therapeutic target to augment nerve regeneration and provide a workflow template by which microtubule-related targets can be compared in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we establish a workflow template from cell culture to animals in which microtubule-based treatments can be tested and compared with one another for their effectiveness in augmenting regeneration of injured axons relevant to spinal cord injury. The present work uses a viral transduction approach to knock down &lt;i&gt;fidgetin&lt;/i&gt; from rat neurons, which coaxes nerve regeneration by elevating microtubule mass in their axons. Unlike previous strategies using microtubule-stabilizing drugs, &lt;i&gt;fidgetin&lt;/i&gt; knockdown adds microtubule mass that is labile (rather than stable), thereby better recapitulating the growth status of a developing axon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cenpj Regulates Cilia Disassembly and Neurogenesis in the Developing Mouse Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/1994?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Primary cilia are microtubule-based protuberances that project from the eukaryotic cell body to sense the extracellular environment. Ciliogenesis is closely correlated to the cell cycle and defects of cilia are related to human systemic diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia. However, the role of ciliogenesis in cortical development remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Cenpj, a protein that is required for centriole biogenesis, plays a role in regulating cilium disassembly &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Depletion of Cenpj in neural progenitor cells results in long cilia and abnormal cilia disassembly. Radial glial cells Cenpj depletion exhibit uncompleted cell division, reduced cell proliferation, and increased cell apoptosis in the developing mouse cerebrum cortex, leading to microcephaly. In addition, Cenpj depletion causes long and thin primary cilia and motile cilia in adult neural stem cells and reduced cell proliferation in the subventricular zone. Furthermore, we show that Cenpj regulates cilia disassembly and neurogenesis through Kif2a, a plus-end-directed motor protein. These data collected from mice of both sexes provide insights into how ciliogenesis plays roles in cortical development and how primary microcephaly is induced by &lt;i&gt;Cenpj&lt;/i&gt; mutations in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly is a neurodevelopmental disorder with the major symptoms of reduction of circumference of the head, brain volume, and cortex thickness with normal brain architecture in birth. We used conditional Cenpj deletion mice and found that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) exhibited long primary cilia and abnormal cilium appendages. The defective cilium disassembly caused by Cenpj depletion might correlate to reduced cell proliferation, uncompleted cell division, cell apoptosis, and microcephaly in mice. Cenpj also regulates the cilium structure of adult neural stem cells and adult neurogenesis in mice. Additionally, our results illustrate that Cenpj regulates cilia disassembly and neurogenesis through Kif2a, indicating that primary cilia dynamics play a crucial role in NPC mitosis and adult neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activation of Dopamine Receptor 2 Prompts Transcriptomic and Metabolic Plasticity in Glioblastoma</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/1982?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and lethal tumor types. Evidence continues to accrue indicating that the complex relationship between GBM and the brain microenvironment contributes to this malignant phenotype. However, the interaction between GBM and neurotransmitters, signaling molecules involved in neuronal communication, remains incompletely understood. Here we examined, using human patient-derived xenograft lines, how the monoamine dopamine influences GBM cells. We demonstrate that GBM cells express dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2), with elevated expression in the glioma-initiating cell (GIC) population. Stimulation of DRD2 caused a neuron-like hyperpolarization exclusively in GICs. In addition, long-term activation of DRD2 heightened the sphere-forming capacity of GBM cells, as well as tumor engraftment efficiency in both male and female mice. Mechanistic investigation revealed that DRD2 signaling activates the hypoxia response and functionally alters metabolism. Finally, we found that GBM cells synthesize and secrete dopamine themselves, suggesting a potential autocrine mechanism. These results identify dopamine signaling as a potential therapeutic target in GBM and further highlight neurotransmitters as a key feature of the pro-tumor microenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work offers critical insight into the role of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the progression of GBM. We show that dopamine induces specific changes in the state of tumor cells, augmenting their growth and shifting them to a more stem-cell like state. Further, our data illustrate that dopamine can alter the metabolic behavior of GBM cells, increasing glycolysis. Finally, this work demonstrates that GBM cells, including tumor samples from patients, can synthesize and secrete dopamine, suggesting an autocrine signaling process underlying these results. These results describe a novel connection between neurotransmitters and brain cancer, further highlighting the critical influence of the brain milieu on GBM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Two Distinct Sets of Ca2+ and K+ Channels Are Activated at Different Membrane Potentials by the Climbing Fiber Synaptic Potential in Purkinje Neuron Dendrites</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/1969?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In cerebellar Purkinje neuron dendrites, the transient depolarization associated with a climbing fiber (CF) EPSP activates voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (VGCCs), voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (VGKCs), and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated SK and BK K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. The resulting membrane potential (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients play a fundamental role in dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity of parallel fiber inputs. Here we report a detailed investigation of the kinetics of dendritic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels activated by CF-EPSPs, based on optical measurements of &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients and on a single-compartment NEURON model reproducing experimental data. We first measured &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients associated with CF-EPSPs at different initial &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, and we analyzed the changes in the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients produced by the block of each individual VGCCs, of A-type VGKCs and of SK and BK channels. Then, we constructed a model that includes six active ion channels to accurately match experimental signals and extract the physiological kinetics of each channel. We found that two different sets of channels are selectively activated. When the dendrite is hyperpolarized, CF-EPSPs mainly activate T-type VGCCs, SK channels, and A-type VGKCs that limit the transient &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; ~ &amp;lt;0 mV. In contrast, when the dendrite is depolarized, T-type VGCCs and A-type VGKCs are inactivated and CF-EPSPs activate P/Q-type VGCCs, high-voltage activated VGKCs, and BK channels, leading to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes. Thus, the potentially activity-dependent regulation of A-type VGKCs, controlling the activation of this second set of channels, is likely to play a crucial role in signal integration and plasticity in Purkinje neuron dendrites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The climbing fiber synaptic input transiently depolarizes the dendrite of cerebellar Purkinje neurons generating a signal that plays a fundamental role in dendritic integration. This signal is mediated by two types of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and four types of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Thus, understanding the kinetics of all of these channels is crucial for understanding PN function. To obtain this information, we used an innovative strategy that merges ultrafast optical membrane potential and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; measurements, pharmacological analysis, and computational modeling. We found that, according to the initial membrane potential, the climbing fiber depolarizing transient activates two distinct sets of channels. Moreover, A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels limit the activation of P/Q-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and associated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, thus preventing the generation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In response to altered neuronal energy state, mitochondria adapt to enable energy homeostasis and nervous system function. This adaptation, also called mitochondrial plasticity, can be observed as alterations in the form, function and position. The primary site of energy consumption in neurons is localized at the synapse, where mitochondria are critical for both pre- and postsynaptic functions. In this review, we will discuss molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondrial plasticity at the synapse and how they contribute to information processing within neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Shared polygenic risk and causal inferences in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25431?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify shared polygenic risk and causal associations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian randomization were applied in a large‐scale, data‐driven manner to explore genetic correlations and causal relationships between &amp;gt;700 phenotypic traits and ALS. Exposures consisted of publicly available genome‐wide association studies (GWASes) summary statistics from &lt;i&gt;MR Base&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LD‐hub&lt;/i&gt;. The outcome data came from the recently published ALS GWAS involving 20,806 cases and 59,804 controls. Multivariate analyses, genetic risk profiling, and Bayesian colocalization analyses were also performed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have shown, by linkage disequilibrium score regression, that ALS shares polygenic risk genetic factors with a number of traits and conditions, including positive correlations with smoking status and moderate levels of physical activity, and negative correlations with higher cognitive performance, higher educational attainment, and light levels of physical activity. Using Mendelian randomization, we found evidence that hyperlipidemia is a causal risk factor for ALS and localized putative functional signals within loci of interest.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we have developed a public resource (&lt;a href=&quot;https://lng-nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;https://lng-nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny&lt;/a&gt;) which we hope will become a valuable tool for the ALS community, and that will be expanded and updated as new data become available. Shared polygenic risk exists between ALS and educational attainment, physical activity, smoking, and tenseness/restlessness. We also found evidence that elevated low‐desnity lipoprotein cholesterol is a causal risk factor for ALS. Future randomized controlled trials should be considered as a proof of causality.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we examined the potential causal effect of smoking on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using the Project MinE data involving 12,577 patients with ALS and 23,475 controls in a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework. The MR approach has the potential to investigate a causal relationship between a risk factor and a disease, avoiding confounding and information bias that often present in conventional epidemiological studies. We found that smokers had a higher risk of ALS compared to never smokers. Our study thus provides evidence for a causal relationship between smoking and ALS.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Emergence of Brain Rhythms: Model Interpretation of EEG Data. (arXiv:1903.04576v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04576</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) monitors ---by either intrusive or noninvasive
electrodes--- time and frequency variations and spectral content of voltage
fluctuations or waves, known as brain rhythms, which in some way uncover
activity during both rest periods and specific events in which the subject is
under stimulus. This is a useful tool to explore brain behavior, as it
complements imaging techniques that have a poorer temporal resolution. We here
approach the understanding of EEG data from first principles by studying a
networked model of excitatory and inhibitory neurons which generates a variety
of comparable waves. In fact, we thus reproduce $\alpha$, $\beta,$ $\gamma$ and
other rhythms as observed by EEG, and identify the details of the respectively
involved complex phenomena, including a precise relationship between an input
and the collective response to it. It ensues the potentiality of our model to
better understand actual mind mechanisms and its possible disorders, and we
also describe kind of stochastic resonance phenomena which locate main
qualitative changes of mental behavior in (e.g.) humans. We also discuss the
plausible use of these findings to design deep learning algorithms to detect
the occurence of phase transitions in the brain and to analyse its
consequences.

	<content:encoded>The characteristic properties of stem cells – notably their ability to self-renew and to differentiate – have meant that they have traditionally been viewed as distinct from most other types of cells. However, recent research has blurred the line between stem cells and other cells by showing that the former display a range of behaviors in different tissues and at different stages of development. Here, we use the tools of metaphysics to describe a classification scheme for stem cells, and to highlight what their inherent diversity means for cancer treatment.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/45100</link>
	<content:encoded>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive disease of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the retina leading to loss of central vision. Polymorphisms in genes involved in lipid metabolism, including the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (&lt;i&gt;ABCA1&lt;/i&gt;), have been associated with AMD risk. However, the significance of retinal lipid handling for AMD pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, we study the contribution of lipid efflux in the RPE by generating a mouse model lacking ABCA1 and its partner ABCG1 specifically in this layer. Mutant mice show lipid accumulation in the RPE, reduced RPE and retinal function, retinal inflammation and RPE/photoreceptor degeneration. Data from human cell lines indicate that the &lt;i&gt;ABCA1&lt;/i&gt; AMD risk-conferring allele decreases &lt;i&gt;ABCA1&lt;/i&gt; expression, identifying the potential molecular cause that underlies the genetic risk for AMD. Our results highlight the essential homeostatic role for lipid efflux in the RPE and suggest a pathogenic contribution of reduced ABCA1 function to AMD.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43464</link>
	<content:encoded>Linking interindividual differences in psychological phenotype to variations in brain structure is an old dream for psychology and a crucial question for cognitive neurosciences. Yet, replicability of the previously-reported 'structural brain behavior' (SBB)-associations has been questioned, recently. Here, we conducted an empirical investigation, assessing replicability of SBB among heathy adults. For a wide range of psychological measures, the replicability of associations with gray matter volume was assessed. Our results revealed that among healthy individuals 1) finding an association between performance at standard psychological tests and brain morphology is relatively unlikely 2) significant associations, found using an exploratory approach, have overestimated effect sizes and 3) can hardly be replicated in an independent sample. After considering factors such as sample size and comparing our findings with more replicable SBB-associations in a clinical cohort and replicable associations between brain structure and non-psychological phenotype, we discuss the potential causes and consequences of these findings.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The proteasome biogenesis regulator Rpn4 cooperates with the unfolded protein response to promote ER stress resistance</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43244</link>
	<content:encoded>Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activate the unfolded protein response (UPR), which enhances protein folding to restore homeostasis. Additional pathways respond to ER stress, but how they help counteract protein misfolding is incompletely understood. Here, we develop a titratable system for the induction of ER stress in yeast to enable a genetic screen for factors that augment stress resistance independently of the UPR. We identify the proteasome biogenesis regulator Rpn4 and show that it cooperates with the UPR. Rpn4 abundance increases during ER stress, first by a post-transcriptional, then by a transcriptional mechanism. Induction of &lt;i&gt;RPN4&lt;/i&gt; transcription is triggered by cytosolic mislocalization of secretory proteins, is mediated by multiple signaling pathways and accelerates clearance of misfolded proteins from the cytosol. Thus, Rpn4 and the UPR are complementary elements of a modular cross-compartment response to ER stress.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>PSD-95 MAGUK family scaffold proteins are multi-domain organisers of synaptic transmission that contain three PDZ domains followed by an SH3-GK domain tandem. This domain architecture allows coordinated assembly of protein complexes composed of neurotransmitter receptors, synaptic adhesion molecules and downstream signalling effectors. Here we show that binding of monomeric CRIPT-derived PDZ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ligands to the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 induces functional changes in the intramolecular SH3-GK domain assembly that influence subsequent homotypic and heterotypic complex formation. We identify PSD-95 interactors that differentially bind to the SH3-GK domain tandem depending on its conformational state. Among these interactors we further establish the heterotrimeric G protein subunit Gnb5 as a PSD-95 complex partner at dendritic spines of rat hippocampal neurons. The PSD-95 GK domain binds to Gnb5 and this interaction is triggered by CRIPT-derived PDZ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ligands binding to the third PDZ domain of PSD-95, unraveling a hierarchical binding mechanism of PSD-95 complex formation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Sleep-like states in diverse organisms can be separated into distinct stages, each with a characteristic arousal threshold. However, the molecular pathways underlying different sleep stages remain unclear. The fruit fly, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, exhibits consolidated sleep during both day and night, with night sleep associated with higher arousal thresholds compared to day sleep. Here we identify a role for the neuronal calcium sensor protein Neurocalcin (NCA) in promoting sleep during the night but not the day by suppressing nocturnal arousal and hyperactivity. We show that both circadian and light-sensing pathways define the temporal window in which NCA promotes sleep. Furthermore, we find that NCA promotes sleep by suppressing synaptic release from a dispersed wake-promoting neural network and demonstrate that the mushroom bodies, a sleep-regulatory center, are a module within this network. Our results advance the understanding of how sleep stages are genetically defined.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>To understand subjective evaluation of an option, various disciplines have quantified the interaction between reward and effort during decision making, producing an estimate of economic utility, namely the subjective ‘goodness’ of an option. However, variables that affect utility of an option also influence the vigor of movements toward that option. For example, expectation of reward increases speed of saccadic eye movements, whereas expectation of effort decreases this speed. These results imply that vigor may serve as a new, real-time metric with which to quantify subjective utility, and that the control of movements may be an implicit reflection of the brain’s economic evaluation of the expected outcome.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Synaptic plasticity onto inhibitory neurons as a mechanism for ocular dominance plasticity</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jacopo Bono, Claudia Clopath&lt;/p&gt;

Ocular dominance plasticity is a well-documented phenomenon allowing us to study properties of cortical maturation. Understanding this maturation might be an important step towards unravelling how cortical circuits function. However, it is still not fully understood which mechanisms are responsible for the opening and closing of the critical period for ocular dominance and how changes in cortical responsiveness arise after visual deprivation. In this article, we present a theory of ocular dominance plasticity. Following recent experimental work, we propose a framework where a reduction in inhibition is necessary for ocular dominance plasticity in both juvenile and adult animals. In this framework, two ingredients are crucial to observe ocular dominance shifts: a sufficient level of inhibition as well as excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic plasticity. In our model, the former is responsible for the opening of the critical period, while the latter limits the plasticity in adult animals. Finally, we also provide a possible explanation for the variability in ocular dominance shifts observed in individual neurons and for the counter-intuitive shifts towards the closed eye.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2HjERBCZGPc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Evaluating the future consequences of actions is achievable by simulating a mental search tree into the future. Expanding deep trees, however, is computationally taxing. Therefore, machines and humans use a plan-until-habit scheme that simulates the environment up to a limited depth and then exploits habitual values as proxies for consequences that may arise in the future. Two outstanding questions in this scheme are “in which directions the search tree should be expanded?”, and “when should the expansion stop?”. Here we propose a principled solution to these questions based on a speed/accuracy tradeoff: deeper expansion in the appropriate directions leads to more accurate planning, but at the cost of slower decision-making. Our simulation results show how this algorithm expands the search tree effectively and efficiently in a grid-world environment. We further show that our algorithm can explain several behavioral patterns in animals and humans, namely the effect of time-pressure on the depth of planning, the effect of reward magnitudes on the direction of planning, and the gradual shift from goal-directed to habitual behavior over the course of training. The algorithm also provides several predictions testable in animal/human experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CETQ5A5g_oA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cerebellar Purkinje cells mediate accurate eye movement coordination. However, it remains unclear how oculomotor adaptation depends on the interplay between the characteristic Purkinje cell response patterns, namely tonic, bursting, and spike pauses. Here, a spiking cerebellar model assesses the role of Purkinje cell firing patterns in vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) adaptation. The model captures the cerebellar microcircuit properties and it incorporates spike-based synaptic plasticity at multiple cerebellar sites. A detailed Purkinje cell model reproduces the three spike-firing patterns that are shown to regulate the cerebellar output. Our results suggest that pauses following Purkinje complex spikes (bursts) encode transient disinhibition of targeted medial vestibular nuclei, critically gating the vestibular signals conveyed by mossy fibres. This gating mechanism accounts for early and coarse VOR acquisition, prior to the late reflex consolidation. In addition, properly timed and sized Purkinje cell bursts allow the ratio between long-term depression and potentiation (LTD/LTP) to be finely shaped at mossy fibre-medial vestibular nuclei synapses, which optimises VOR consolidation. Tonic Purkinje cell firing maintains the consolidated VOR through time. Importantly, pauses are crucial to facilitate VOR phase-reversal learning, by reshaping previously learnt synaptic weight distributions. Altogether, these results predict that Purkinje spike burst-pause dynamics are instrumental to VOR learning and reversal adaptation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yPKm5tnZcuc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;While recent work has revealed how different inhibitory interneurons influence responses of cortical neurons to sensory stimuli, little is known about their distinct contributions to sensory perception. Here, we optogenetically activated different genetically defined interneurons [parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)] in visual cortex (V1) of mice working at threshold in a contrast increment detection task. The visual stimulus was paired with optogenetic stimulation to assess how enhancing V1 inhibitory neuron activity during visual processing altered task performance. PV or SST activation impaired, while VIP stimulation improved, contrast increment detection. The impairment produced by PV or SST activation persisted over several weeks of testing. In contrast, mice learned to reliably detect VIP activation in the absence of any natural visual stimulus. Thus, different inhibitory signals make distinct contributions to visual contrast perception.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) play crucial roles in higher cognitive functions. Despite the link between aberrant development of PFC interneurons and a number of psychiatric disorders, mechanisms underlying the development of these neurons are poorly understood. Here we show that the retinoic acid (RA)-degrading enzyme CYP26B1 (cytochrome P450 family 26, subfamily B, member 1) is transiently expressed in the mouse frontal cortex during postnatal development, and that medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived interneurons, particularly in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons, are the main cell type that has active RA signaling during this period. We found that frontal cortex-specific &lt;i&gt;Cyp26b1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice had an increased density of PV-expressing, but not somatostatin-expressing, interneurons in medial PFC, indicating a novel role of RA signaling in controlling PV neuron development. The initiation of &lt;i&gt;Cyp26b1&lt;/i&gt; expression in neonatal PFC coincides with the establishment of connections between the thalamus and the PFC. We found that these connections are required for the postnatal expression of &lt;i&gt;Cyp26b1&lt;/i&gt; in medial PFC. In addition to this region-specific role in postnatal PFC that regulates RA signaling and PV neuron development, the thalamocortical connectivity had an earlier role in controlling radial dispersion of MGE-derived interneurons throughout embryonic neocortex. In summary, our results suggest that the thalamus plays multiple, temporally separate roles in interneuron development in the PFC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children with aromatic &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;‐amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency suffer from severe motor dysfunction. Restoration of dopamine levels in the putamen by gene therapy has led to significant improvement in motor function. This study explored brain structure changes in patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed before and 12 months after gene therapy. Whole‐brain tract‐specific analysis was performed to assess white matter microstructural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the eight patients (1.67 to 8.42 years of age) enrolled in the study, gene therapy did not affect macroscopic structure. DTI prior to gene therapy revealed lower total mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the patients than in the age‐matched pretreatment controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.017, median difference = −0.0136, 95% confidence interval [CI] [−0.0319, −0.0126]). After gene therapy, total mean FA increased (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012, median difference = 0.0211, 95% CI [0.0094, 0.0456]) and the values in the patients were not different from the age‐matched posttreatment controls. The increase in total mean FA after gene therapy in the patients was correlated with their increase in motor score (R = 0.846; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008), but was inversely correlated with their ages at the time of gene therapy (R = −0.754; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.031). The corticospinal tracts, and the thalamic radiation and callosal fibers involving motor function, improved after gene therapy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improvement in the microstructural integrity of white matter tracts is associated with the improvement in motor function following gene therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether CT perfusion can identify intracerebral hemorrhage patients at high risk of hematoma growth (HG). A total of 155 subjects underwent CT perfusion on admission. Variables associated with log‐transformed absolute HG were explored with multivariable linear regression. Perihematomal cerebral blood volume (CBV) was inversely associated with HG (B=‐0.20,p&amp;lt;0.001), independently from blood pressure, ICH volume and other confounders. This association was not dose‐dependent and only very low CBV (&amp;lt;1.4 mL/100g) was significantly associated with HG (B=0.25,p&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, reduced perihematomal CBV is associated with HG, suggesting a potential role of the perihematomal region in the pathophysiology of hematoma enlargement.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04476</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We introduce Continual Learning via Neural Pruning (CLNP), a new method aimed
at lifelong learning in fixed capacity models based on neuronal model
sparsification. In this method, subsequent tasks are trained using the inactive
neurons and filters of the sparsified network and cause zero deterioration to
the performance of previous tasks. In order to deal with the possible
compromise between model sparsity and performance, we formalize and incorporate
the concept of graceful forgetting: the idea that it is preferable to suffer a
small amount of forgetting in a controlled manner if it helps regain network
capacity and prevents uncontrolled loss of performance during the training of
future tasks. CLNP also provides simple continual learning diagnostic tools in
terms of the number of free neurons left for the training of future tasks as
well as the number of neurons that are being reused. In particular, we see in
experiments that CLNP verifies and automatically takes advantage of the fact
that the features of earlier layers are more transferable. We show empirically
that CLNP leads to significantly improved results over current weight
elasticity based methods.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04337</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Preventing early progression of epilepsy and so the severity of seizures
requires effective diagnosis. Epileptic transients indicate the ability to
develop seizures but humans easily overlook such brief events in an
electroencephalogram (EEG) what compromises patient treatment. Traditionally,
training of the EEG event detection algorithms has relied on ground truth
labels, obtained from the consensus of the majority of labelers. In this work,
we go beyond labeler consensus on EEG data. Our event descriptor integrates EEG
signal features with one-hot encoded labeler category that is a key to improved
generalization performance. Notably, boosted decision trees take advantage of
singly-labeled but more varied training sets. Our quantitative experiments show
the proposed labeler-hot epileptic event detector consistently outperforms a
consensus-trained detector and maintains confidence bounds of the detection.
The results on our infant EEG recordings suggest datasets can gain higher event
variety faster and thus better performance by shifting available human effort
from consensus-oriented to separate labeling when labels include both, the
event and the labeler category.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04201</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite a rise in the use of &quot;learning by doing&quot; pedagogical methods in
praxis, little is known as to why these methods may improve learning outcomes.
This is surprising given that an increased mechanistic knowledge of learning by
doing-based improvements has the potential to speed up the development of
evidence-based teaching practices. Here we use neuroscience methods and a
gesture-enriched foreign language (L2) vocabulary learning paradigm to
adjudicate between opposing predictions of two neuroscientific learning
theories. We demonstrate that sensory brain regions associated with the
processing of gesture-related stimulus information causally contribute to
performance benefits following gesture-enriched L2 vocabulary learning. Sensory
brain responses benefitted both short- and long-term learning outcomes, as well
as the learning of both concrete and abstract words. These findings suggest
that responses within specialized visual sensory cortices precipitate
sensorimotor-based learning benefits. Such a mechanism could play a role in
comparatively effortless native language learning and may be key for
accelerating L2 proficiency in adults.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/45222</link>
	<content:encoded>Mammalian two-pore channels (TPCs) regulate the physiological functions of the endolysosome. Here we present cryo-EM structures of human TPC2 (HsTPC2), a phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-activated, Na&lt;sup&gt;+ &lt;/sup&gt;selective channel, in the ligand-bound and apo states. The apo structure captures the closed conformation, while the ligand-bound form features the channel in both open and closed conformations. Combined with functional analysis, these structures provide insights into the mechanism of PI(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-regulated gating of TPC2, which is distinct from that of TPC1. Specifically, the endolysosome-specific PI(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;binds at the first 6-TM and activates the channel - independently of the membrane potential - by inducing a structural change at the pore-lining inner helix (IS6), which forms a continuous helix in the open state but breaks into two segments at Gly317 in the closed state. Additionally, structural comparison to the voltage-dependent TPC1 structure allowed us to identify Ile551 as being responsible for the loss of voltage dependence in TPC2.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/44771</link>
	<content:encoded>Transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is a heterodecameric protein complex critical for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II and nucleotide excision DNA repair. The TFIIH core complex is sufficient for its repair functions and harbors the XPB and XPD DNA-dependent ATPase/helicase subunits, which are affected by human disease mutations. Transcription initiation additionally requires the CdK activating kinase subcomplex. Previous structural work has provided only partial insight into the architecture of TFIIH and its interactions within transcription pre-initiation complexes. Here, we present the complete structure of the human TFIIH core complex, determined by phase-plate cryo-electron microscopy at 3.7 Å resolution. The structure uncovers the molecular basis of TFIIH assembly, revealing how the recruitment of XPB by p52 depends on a pseudo-symmetric dimer of homologous domains in these two proteins. The structure also suggests a function for p62 in the regulation of XPD, and allows the mapping of previously unresolved human disease mutations.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/44161</link>
	<content:encoded>Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is a rare and deadly kidney cancer in patients of African descent with sickle cell trait. We have developed faithful patient-derived RMC models and using whole-genome sequencing, we identified loss-of-function intronic fusion events in one &lt;i&gt;SMARCB1&lt;/i&gt; allele with concurrent loss of the other allele. Biochemical and functional characterization of these models revealed that RMC requires the loss of &lt;i&gt;SMARCB1&lt;/i&gt; for survival. Through integration of RNAi and CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function genetic screens and a small-molecule screen, we found that the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) was essential in RMC. Inhibition of the UPS caused a G2/M arrest due to constitutive accumulation of cyclin B1. These observations extend across cancers that harbor &lt;i&gt;SMARCB1&lt;/i&gt; loss, which also require expression of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, &lt;i&gt;UBE2C&lt;/i&gt;. Our studies identify a synthetic lethal relationship between &lt;i&gt;SMARCB1&lt;/i&gt;-deficient cancers and reliance on the UPS which provides the foundation for a mechanism-informed clinical trial with proteasome inhibitors.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/44032</link>
	<content:encoded>Appropriate generalization of learned responses to new situations is vital for adaptive behavior. We provide a circuit-level account of generalization in the electrosensory lobe (ELL) of weakly electric mormyrid fish. Much is already known in this system about a form of learning in which motor corollary discharge signals cancel responses to the uninformative input evoked by the fish's own electric pulses. However, for this cancellation to be useful under natural circumstances, it must generalize accurately across behavioral regimes, specifically different electric pulse rates. We show that such generalization indeed occurs in ELL neurons, and develop a circuit-level model explaining how this may be achieved. The mechanism involves regularized synaptic plasticity and an approximate matching of the temporal dynamics of motor corollary discharge and electrosensory inputs. Recordings of motor corollary discharge signals in mossy fibers and granule cells provide direct evidence for such matching.</content:encoded>

Understanding the principles by which agents interact with both complex environments and each other is a key goal of decision neuroscience. However, most previous studies have used experimental paradigms in which choices are discrete (and few), play is static, and optimal solutions are known. Yet in natural environments, interactions between agents typically involve continuous action spaces, ongoing dynamics, and no known optimal solution. Here, we seek to bridge this divide by using a “penalty shot” task in which pairs of monkeys competed against each other in a competitive, real-time video game. We modeled monkeys’ strategies as driven by stochastically evolving goals, onscreen positions that served as set points for a control model that produced observed joystick movements. We fit this goal-based dynamical system model using approximate Bayesian inference methods, using neural networks to parameterize players’ goals as a dynamic mixture of Gaussian components. Our model is conceptually simple, constructed of interpretable components, and capable of generating synthetic data that capture the complexity of real player dynamics. We further characterized players’ strategies using the number of change points on each trial. We found that this complexity varied more across sessions than within sessions, and that more complex strategies benefited offensive players but not defensive players. Together, our experimental paradigm and model offer a powerful combination of tools for the study of realistic social dynamics in the laboratory setting.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8EQny46_S5o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The number of active metabolic pathways is bounded by the number of cellular constraints at maximal metabolic rates</title>

Growth rate is a near-universal selective pressure across microbial species. High growth rates require hundreds of metabolic enzymes, each with different nonlinear kinetics, to be precisely tuned within the bounds set by physicochemical constraints. Yet, the metabolic behaviour of many species is characterized by simple relations between growth rate, enzyme expression levels and metabolic rates. We asked if this simplicity could be the outcome of optimisation by evolution. Indeed, when the growth rate is maximized—in a static environment under mass-conservation and enzyme expression constraints—we prove mathematically that the resulting optimal metabolic flux distribution is described by a limited number of subnetworks, known as Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs). We show that, because EFMs are the minimal subnetworks leading to growth, a small active number automatically leads to the simple relations that are measured. We find that the maximal number of flux-carrying EFMs is determined only by the number of imposed constraints on enzyme expression, not by the size, kinetics or topology of the network. This minimal-EFM extremum principle is illustrated in a graphical framework, which explains qualitative changes in microbial behaviours, such as overflow metabolism and co-consumption, and provides a method for identification of the enzyme expression constraints that limit growth under the prevalent conditions. The extremum principle applies to all microorganisms that are selected for maximal growth rates under protein concentration constraints, for example the solvent capacities of cytosol, membrane or periplasmic space.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DEY-lhs5fHw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Manipulating the dynamics of neural systems through targeted stimulation is a frontier of research and clinical neuroscience; however, the control schemes considered for neural systems are mismatched for the unique needs of manipulating neural dynamics. An appropriate control method should respect the variability in neural systems, incorporating moment to moment “input” to the neural dynamics and behaving based on the current neural state, irrespective of the past trajectory. We propose such a controller under a nonlinear state-space feedback framework that steers one dynamical system to function as through it were another dynamical system entirely. This “myopic” controller is formulated through a novel variant of a model reference control cost that manipulates dynamics in a short-sighted manner that only sets a target trajectory of a single time step into the future (hence its myopic nature), which omits the need to pre-calculate a rigid and computationally costly neural feedback control solution. To demonstrate the breadth of this control’s utility, two examples with distinctly different applications in neuroscience are studied. First, we show the myopic control’s utility to probe the causal link between dynamics and behavior for cognitive processes by transforming a winner-take-all decision-making system to operate as a robust neural integrator of evidence. Second, an unhealthy motor-like system containing an unwanted beta-oscillation spiral attractor is controlled to function as a healthy motor system, a relevant clinical example for neurological disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6oinXWRforY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling differentiation-state transitions linked to therapeutic escape in triple-negative breast cancer</title>

Drug resistance in breast cancer cell populations has been shown to arise through phenotypic transition of cancer cells to a drug-tolerant state, for example through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition or transition to a cancer stem cell state. However, many breast tumors are a heterogeneous mixture of cell types with numerous epigenetic states in addition to stem-like and mesenchymal phenotypes, and the dynamic behavior of this heterogeneous mixture in response to drug treatment is not well-understood. Recently, we showed that plasticity between differentiation states, as identified with intracellular markers such as cytokeratins, is linked to resistance to specific targeted therapeutics. Understanding the dynamics of differentiation-state transitions in this context could facilitate the development of more effective treatments for cancers that exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity. In this work, we develop computational models of a drug-treated, phenotypically heterogeneous triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line to elucidate the feasibility of differentiation-state transition as a mechanism for therapeutic escape in this tumor subtype. Specifically, we use modeling to predict the changes in differentiation-state transitions that underlie specific therapy-induced changes in differentiation-state marker expression that we recently observed in the HCC1143 cell line. We report several statistically significant therapy-induced changes in transition rates between basal, luminal, mesenchymal, and non-basal/non-luminal/non-mesenchymal differentiation states in HCC1143 cell populations. Moreover, we validate model predictions on cell division and cell death empirically, and we test our models on an independent data set. Overall, we demonstrate that changes in differentiation-state transition rates induced by targeted therapy can provoke distinct differentiation-state aggregations of drug-resistant cells, which may be fundamental to the design of improved therapeutic regimens for cancers with phenotypic heterogeneity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DT3PsYmnYd0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Centrosome amplification (CA) is a common feature of human tumours and a promising target for cancer therapy. However, CA’s pan-cancer prevalence, molecular role in tumourigenesis and therapeutic value in the clinical setting are still largely unexplored. Here, we used a transcriptomic signature (CA20) to characterise the landscape of CA-associated gene expression in 9,721 tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). CA20 is upregulated in cancer and associated with distinct clinical and molecular features of breast cancer, consistently with our experimental CA quantification in patient samples. Moreover, we show that CA20 upregulation is positively associated with genomic instability, alteration of specific chromosomal arms and C&amp;gt;T mutations, and we propose novel molecular players associated with CA in cancer. Finally, high CA20 is associated with poor prognosis and, by integrating drug sensitivity with drug perturbation profiles in cell lines, we identify candidate compounds for selectively targeting cancer cells exhibiting transcriptomic evidence for CA.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-C_Yq4jH6sA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

A fundamental assumption, common to the vast majority of high-throughput transcriptome analyses, is that the expression of most genes is unchanged among samples and that total cellular RNA remains constant. As the number of analyzed experimental systems increases however, different independent studies demonstrate that this assumption is often violated. We present a calibration method using RNA spike-ins that allows for the measurement of absolute cellular abundance of RNA molecules. We apply the method to pooled RNA from cell populations of known sizes. For each transcript, we compute a nominal abundance that can be converted to absolute by dividing by a scale factor determined in separate experiments: the yield coefficient of the transcript relative to that of a reference spike-in measured with the same protocol. The method is derived by maximum likelihood theory in the context is a complete statistical model for sequencing counts contributed by cellular RNA and spike-ins. The counts are based on a sample from a fixed number of cells to which a fixed population of spike-in molecules has been added. We illustrate and evaluate the method with applications to two global expression data sets, one from the model eukaryote &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, proliferating at different growth rates, and differentiating cardiopharyngeal cell lineages in the chordate &lt;i&gt;Ciona robusta&lt;/i&gt;. We tested the method in a technical replicate dilution study, and in a &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-fold validation study.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tQHAuYv6IDY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Disease‐associated proteins are thought to propagate along neuronal processes in neurodegenerative diseases. To detect disease‐associated prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;) in the vagus nerve in different forms and molecular subtypes of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), we applied 3 different anti‐PrP antibodies. We screened the vagus nerve in 162 sporadic and 30 genetic CJD cases. Four of 31 VV‐2 type sporadic CJD and 7 of 30 genetic CJD cases showed vagal PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; immunodeposits with distinct morphology. Thus, PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; in CJD affects the vagus nerve analogously to α‐synuclein in Parkinson disease. The morphologically diverse deposition of PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; in genetic and sporadic CJD argues against uniform mechanisms of propagation of PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;During the 1990s, we estimated the genetic contribution to Parkinson's disease risk in a large, population‐based twin registry. Because many unaffected twins were still alive, previous concordance estimates were based on incomplete information. Ninety‐five percent of twins are now deceased. Here, we update concordance and heritability through 2015 using National Death Index data. In total, we identified 30 concordant and 193 discordant pairs. Proband‐wise concordance was 0.20 in monozygotic and 0.13 in dizygotic pairs. Heritability was 0.27 overall, 0.83 in pairs diagnosed ≤50, and 0.19 in pairs diagnosed &amp;gt;50. High concordance in dizygotic twins suggests shared effects of early childhood environment. Ann Neurol, 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Homocysteine and small vessel stroke: A mendelian randomization analysis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25440?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials of B vitamin therapy to lower blood total homocysteine (tHcy) levels for prevention of stroke are inconclusive. Secondary analyses of trial data and epidemiological studies suggest that tHcy levels may be particularly associated with small vessel stroke (SVS). We assessed whether circulating tHcy and B vitamin levels are selectively associated with SVS, but not other stroke subtypes, using Mendelian randomization.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used summary statistics data for single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with tHcy (n = 18), folate (n = 3), vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 1), and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 14) levels, and the corresponding data for stroke from the MEGASTROKE consortium (n = 16,952 subtyped ischemic stroke cases and 404,630 noncases).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetically predicted tHcy was associated with SVS, with an odds ratio of 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13–1.58; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 6.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;) per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted tHcy levels, but was not associated with large artery or cardioembolic stroke. The association was mainly driven by SNPs at or near the &lt;i&gt;MTHFR&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MUT&lt;/i&gt; genes. The odds ratios of SVS per 1 SD increase in genetically predicted folate and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; levels were 0.49 (95% CI, 0.34–0.71; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.52–0.94; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), respectively. Genetically higher vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; levels were not associated with any stroke subtype.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that any effect of homocysteine‐lowering treatment in preventing stroke will be confined to the SVS subtype. Whether genetic variants at or near the &lt;i&gt;MTHFR&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MUT&lt;/i&gt; genes influence SVS risk through pathways other than homocysteine levels and downstream effects require further investigation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03418</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This contribution examines two radically different explanations of our
phenomenal intuitions, one reductive and one strongly non-reductive, and
identifies two germane ideas that could benefit many other theories of
consciousness. Firstly, the ability of sophisticated agent architectures with a
purely physical implementation to support certain functional forms of qualia or
proto-qualia appears to entail the possibility of machine consciousness with
qualia, not only for reductive theories but also for the nonreductive ones that
regard consciousness as ubiquitous in Nature. Secondly, analysis of
introspective psychological material seems to hint that, under the threshold of
our ordinary waking awareness, there exist further 'submerged' or 'subliminal'
layers of consciousness which constitute a hidden foundation and support and
another source of our phenomenal intuitions. These 'submerged' layers might
help explain certain puzzling phenomena concerning subliminal perception, such
as the apparently 'unconscious' multisensory integration and learning of
subliminal stimuli.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: SeizureNet: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Accurate Seizure Type Classification and Seizure Detection. (arXiv:1903.03232v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03232</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Automatic epileptic seizure analysis is important because the differentiation
of neural patterns among different patients can be used to classify people with
specific types of epilepsy. This could enable more efficient management of the
disease. Automatic seizure type classification using clinical
electroencephalograms (EEGs) is challenging due to factors such as low signal
to noise ratios, signal artefacts, high variance in the seizure semiology among
individual epileptic patients, and limited clinical data constraints. To
overcome these challenges, in this paper, we present a deep learning based
framework which uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with dense
connections and learns highly robust features at different spatial and temporal
resolutions of the EEG data spectrum for accurate cross-patient seizure type
classification. We evaluate our framework for seizure type classification and
seizure detection on the recently released TUH EEG Seizure Corpus, where our
framework achieves overall weighted f 1 scores of up to 0.90 and 0.88, thereby
setting new benchmarks on the dataset.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Degenerative cerebellar ataxias (DCAs) affect up to 1 in 5,000 people worldwide, leading to incoordination, tremor, and falls. Loss of Purkinje cells, nearly universal across DCAs, dysregulates the dentatothalamocortical network. To address the paucity of treatment strategies, we developed an electrical stimulation‐based therapy for DCAs targeting the dorsal dentate nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested this therapeutic strategy in the Wistar Furth &lt;i&gt;shaker&lt;/i&gt; rat model of Purkinje cell loss resulting in tremor and ataxia. We implanted &lt;i&gt;shaker&lt;/i&gt; rats with stimulating electrodes targeted to the dorsal dentate nucleus and tested a spectrum of frequencies ranging from 4 to 180 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulation at 30 Hz most effectively reduced motor symptoms. Stimulation frequencies over 100 Hz, commonly used for Parkinsonism and essential tremor, worsened incoordination, while frequencies within the tremor physiologic range may worsen tremor.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low‐frequency deep cerebellar stimulation may provide a novel strategy for treating motor symptoms of degenerative cerebellar ataxias.&lt;/p&gt;

While much effort has been devoted to understanding the capacity and role for local protein synthesis in dendrites and spines, local mRNA translation in mature axons, projecting over distances up to a meter, has received much less attention. Also, little is known about the spatio-temporal dynamics of axonal and dendritic gene expression as function of mRNA abundance, protein synthesis and degradation. Here, we summarize key recent findings that have shaped our knowledge of the precise location of local protein production and discuss unique strategies used by neurons to shape presynaptic and postsynaptic proteomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Both proteins play critical roles during the development of the nervous system and may also regulate stimuli-driven transcription and plasticity in postmitotic neurons. The multiplicity of functions, substrates, and molecular partners, together with the redundancy and singularity of the two KAT3 paralogs, define a complex cat’s cradle of relationships.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25465?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure &lt;i&gt;postmortem&lt;/i&gt; burden of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP‐43 (FTLD‐TDP) or tau (FTLD‐Tau) proteinopathy across hemispheres in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) using digital histopathology, and identify clinicopathological correlates of these distinct proteinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an autopsy cohort of PPA (FTLD‐TDP=13, FTLD‐Tau=14), we analyzed laterality and regional distribution of &lt;i&gt;postmortem&lt;/i&gt; pathology, quantified using a validated digital histopathological approach, in available brain tissue from up to eight cortical regions bilaterally. We related digital pathology to &lt;i&gt;antemortem&lt;/i&gt; structural neuroimaging and specific clinical language features.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Postmortem&lt;/i&gt; cortical pathology was left‐lateralized in both FTLD‐TDP (beta=‐0.15,SE=0.05,p=0.007) and FTLD‐Tau (beta=‐0.09,SE=0.04,p=0.015), but the degree of lateralization decreased with greater overall dementia severity before death (beta=‐8.18,SE=3.22,p=0.015). Among five core pathology regions sampled, we found greatest pathology in left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in FTLD‐TDP, which was greater than in FTLD‐Tau (F=47.07,df=1,17,p&amp;lt;0.001), and in left mid‐frontal cortex (MFC) in FTLD‐Tau, which was greater than in FTLD‐TDP (F=19.34,df=1,16,p&amp;lt;0.001). &lt;i&gt;Postmortem&lt;/i&gt; pathology was inversely associated with &lt;i&gt;antemortem&lt;/i&gt; MRI cortical thickness (beta=‐0.04,SE=0.01,p=0.007) in regions matching autopsy sampling. Irrespective of PPA syndromic variant, single‐word comprehension impairment was associated with greater left OFC pathology (t=‐3.72,df=10.72,p=0.004), while nonfluent speech with greater left MFC pathology (t=‐3.62,df=12.00,p=0.004) among the five core pathology regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In PPA, FTLD‐TDP and FTLD‐Tau have divergent anatomic distributions of left‐lateralized &lt;i&gt;postmortem&lt;/i&gt; pathology that relate to &lt;i&gt;antemortem&lt;/i&gt; structural imaging and distinct language deficits. While other brain regions may be implicated in neural networks supporting these complex language measures, our observations may eventually help to improve &lt;i&gt;antemortem&lt;/i&gt; diagnosis of neuropathology in PPA.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rates of worsening and evolution to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) may be substantially lower in actively treated patients compared to natural history studies from the pre‐treatment era. Nonetheless, in our recently reported prospective cohort more than half of patients with relapsing MS accumulated significant new disability by the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; year of follow‐up. Notably, “no evidence of disease activity” at 2‐years did not predict long‐term stability. Here, we determined to what extent clinical relapses and radiographic evidence of disease activity contribute to long‐term disability accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disability progression was defined as an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 1.5, 1.0 or 0.5 (or greater) from baseline EDSS = 0; 1.0‐5.0; and 5.5 or higher, respectively, assessed from baseline to year 5 (± 1 year) and sustained to year 10 (± 1 year). Longitudinal analysis of relative brain volume loss used a linear mixed model with sex, age, disease duration, and &lt;i&gt;HLA‐DRB1*15:01&lt;/i&gt; as covariates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relapses were associated with a transient increase in disability over one‐year intervals (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012) but not with confirmed disability progression (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.551). Relative brain volume declined at a greater rate among individuals with disability progression compared to those who remained stable (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long term worsening is common in relapsing MS patients, is independent of relapse activity, and is associated with accelerated brain atrophy. We propose the term &lt;i&gt;silent progression&lt;/i&gt; to describe the insidious disability that accrues in many patients who satisfy traditional criteria for relapsing remitting MS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Optimal Inter‐Eye Difference Thresholds by OCT in MS: An International Study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25462?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the optimal thresholds for inter‐eye differences in retinal nerve fiber and ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer thicknesses for identifying unilateral optic nerve lesions in multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current international diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis do not include the optic nerve as a lesion site despite frequent involvement. Optical coherence tomography detects retinal thinning associated with optic nerve lesions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this multi‐center international study at 11 sites, optical coherence tomography was measured for patients and healthy controls as part of the International Multiple Sclerosis Visual System Consortium. High‐ and low‐contrast acuity were also collected in a subset of participants. Presence of an optic nerve lesion for this study was defined as history of acute unilateral optic neuritis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among patients (n=1,530), receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated an optimal peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer inter‐eye difference threshold of 5 microns and ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer threshold of 4 microns for identifying unilateral optic neuritis (n=477). Greater inter‐eye differences in acuities were associated with greater inter‐eye retinal layer thickness differences (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;≤0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inter‐eye differences of 5 microns for retinal nerve fiber layer and 4 microns for macular ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer are robust thresholds for identifying unilateral optic nerve lesions. These thresholds may be useful to establish the presence of asymptomatic and symptomatic optic nerve lesions in multiple sclerosis and could be useful in a new version of the diagnostic criteria. Our findings lend further validation for utilizing the visual system in a multiple sclerosis clinical trial setting.&lt;/p&gt;

Multi-scale computational modeling is a major branch of computational biology as evidenced by the US federal interagency Multi-Scale Modeling Consortium and major international projects. It invariably involves specific and detailed sequences of data analysis and simulation, often with multiple tools and datasets, and the community recognizes improved modularity, reuse, reproducibility, portability and scalability as critical unmet needs in this area. Scientific workflows are a well-recognized strategy for addressing these needs in scientific computing. While there are good examples if the use of scientific workflows in bioinformatics, medical informatics, biomedical imaging and data analysis, there are fewer examples in multi-scale computational modeling in general and cardiac electrophysiology in particular. Cardiac electrophysiology simulation is a mature area of multi-scale computational biology that serves as an excellent use case for developing and testing new scientific workflows. In this article, we develop, describe and test a computational workflow that serves as a proof of concept of a platform for the robust integration and implementation of a reusable and reproducible multi-scale cardiac cell and tissue model that is expandable, modular and portable. The workflow described leverages Python and Kepler-Python actor for plotting and pre/post-processing. During all stages of the workflow design, we rely on freely available open-source tools, to make our workflow freely usable by scientists.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iVBpJTia4EY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The ultimate goal of metabolic engineering is to produce desired compounds on an industrial scale in a cost effective manner. To address challenges in metabolic engineering, computational strain optimization algorithms based on genome-scale metabolic models have increasingly been used to aid in overproducing products of interest. However, most of these strain optimization algorithms utilize a metabolic network alone, with few approaches providing strategies that also include transcriptional regulation. Moreover previous integrated approaches generally require a pre-existing regulatory network. In this study, we developed a novel strain design algorithm, named OptRAM (Optimization of Regulatory And Metabolic Networks), which can identify combinatorial optimization strategies including overexpression, knockdown or knockout of both metabolic genes and transcription factors. OptRAM is based on our previous IDREAM integrated network framework, which makes it able to deduce a regulatory network from data. OptRAM uses simulated annealing with a novel objective function, which can ensure a favorable coupling between desired chemical and cell growth. The other advance we propose is a systematic evaluation metric of multiple solutions, by considering the essential genes, flux variation, and engineering manipulation cost. We applied OptRAM to generate strain designs for succinate, 2,3-butanediol, and ethanol overproduction in yeast, which predicted high minimum predicted target production rate compared with other methods and previous literature values. Moreover, most of the genes and TFs proposed to be altered by OptRAM in these scenarios have been validated by modification of the exact genes or the target genes regulated by the TFs, for overproduction of these desired compounds by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments cataloged in the LASER database. Particularly, we successfully validated the predicted strain optimization strategy for ethanol production by fermentation experiment. In conclusion, OptRAM can provide a useful approach that leverages an integrated transcriptional regulatory network and metabolic network to guide metabolic engineering applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qYemLAl00uo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A spectrum of routing strategies for brain networks</title>

Communication of signals among nodes in a complex network poses fundamental problems of efficiency and cost. Routing of messages along shortest paths requires global information about the topology, while spreading by diffusion, which operates according to local topological features, is informationally “cheap” but inefficient. We introduce a stochastic model for network communication that combines local and global information about the network topology to generate biased random walks on the network. The model generates a continuous spectrum of dynamics that converge onto shortest-path and random-walk (diffusion) communication processes at the limiting extremes. We implement the model on two cohorts of human connectome networks and investigate the effects of varying the global information bias on the network’s communication cost. We identify routing strategies that approach a (highly efficient) shortest-path communication process with a relatively small global information bias on the system’s dynamics. Moreover, we show that the cost of routing messages from and to hub nodes varies as a function of the global information bias driving the system’s dynamics. Finally, we implement the model to identify individual subject differences from a communication dynamics point of view. The present framework departs from the classical shortest paths vs. diffusion dichotomy, unifying both models under a single family of dynamical processes that differ by the extent to which global information about the network topology influences the routing patterns of neural signals traversing the network.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ow07hxgdlFY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Management of vector population is a commonly used method for mitigating transmission of mosquito-borne infections, but quantitative information on its practical public health impact is scarce. We study the effectiveness of Ultra-Low Volume (ULV) insecticide spraying in public spaces for preventing secondary dengue virus (DENV) cases in Porto Alegre, a non-endemic metropolitan area in Brazil. We developed a stochastic transmission model based on detailed entomological, epidemiological and population data, accounting for the geographical distribution of mosquitoes and humans in the study area and spatial transmission dynamics. The model was calibrated against the distribution of DENV cluster sizes previously estimated from the same geographical setting. We estimated a ULV-induced mortality of 40% for mosquitoes and found that the implemented control protocol avoided about 24% of symptomatic cases occurred in the area throughout the 2015–2016 epidemic season. Increasing the radius of treatment or the mortality of mosquitoes by treating gardens and/or indoor premises would greatly improve the result of control, but trade-offs with respect to increased efforts need to be carefully analyzed. We found a moderate effectiveness for ULV-spraying in public areas, mainly due to the limited ability of this strategy in effectively controlling the vector population. These results can be used to support the design of control strategies in low-incidence, non-endemic settings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CKNKwFuw4ko&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A dynamic power-law sexual network model of gonorrhoea outbreaks</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/GeqSrTgTJqU/article</link>

Human networks of sexual contacts are dynamic by nature, with partnerships forming and breaking continuously over time. Sexual behaviours are also highly heterogeneous, so that the number of partners reported by individuals over a given period of time is typically distributed as a power-law. Both the dynamism and heterogeneity of sexual partnerships are likely to have an effect in the patterns of spread of sexually transmitted diseases. To represent these two fundamental properties of sexual networks, we developed a stochastic process of dynamic partnership formation and dissolution, which results in power-law numbers of partners over time. Model parameters can be set to produce realistic conditions in terms of the exponent of the power-law distribution, of the number of individuals without relationships and of the average duration of relationships. Using an outbreak of antibiotic resistant gonorrhoea amongst men have sex with men as a case study, we show that our realistic dynamic network exhibits different properties compared to the frequently used static networks or homogeneous mixing models. We also consider an approximation to our dynamic network model in terms of a much simpler branching process. We estimate the parameters of the generation time distribution and offspring distribution which can be used for example in the context of outbreak reconstruction based on genomic data. Finally, we investigate the impact of a range of interventions against gonorrhoea, including increased condom use, more frequent screening and immunisation, concluding that the latter shows great promise to reduce the burden of gonorrhoea, even if the vaccine was only partially effective or applied to only a random subset of the population.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GeqSrTgTJqU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/EvcjzeEKdD4/article</link>

Computational neuroimaging methods aim to predict brain responses (measured e.g. with functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) on the basis of stimulus features obtained through computational models. The accuracy of such prediction is used as an indicator of how well the model describes the computations underlying the brain function that is being considered. However, the prediction accuracy is bounded by the proportion of the variance of the brain response which is related to the measurement noise and not to the stimuli (or cognitive functions). This bound to the performance of a computational model has been referred to as the noise ceiling. In previous fMRI applications two methods have been proposed to estimate the noise ceiling based on either a split-half procedure or Monte Carlo simulations. These methods make different assumptions over the nature of the effects underlying the data, and, importantly, their relation has not been clarified yet. Here, we derive an analytical form for the noise ceiling that does not require computationally expensive simulations or a splitting procedure that reduce the amount of data. The validity of this analytical definition is proved in simulations, we show that the analytical solution results in the same estimate of the noise ceiling as the Monte Carlo method. Considering different simulated noise structure, we evaluate different estimators of the variance of the responses and their impact on the estimation of the noise ceiling. We furthermore evaluate the effect the interplay between regularization (often used to estimate model fits to the data when the number of computational features in the model is large) and model complexity on the performance with respect to the noise ceiling. Our results indicate that when considering the variance of the responses across runs, the computing the noise ceiling analytically results in similar estimates as the split half estimator and approaches the true noise ceiling under a variety of simulated noise scenarios. Finally, the methods are tested on real fMRI data acquired at 7 Tesla.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EvcjzeEKdD4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Model simulations indicate that the response of growing cell populations on mechanical stress follows the same functional relationship and is predictable over different cell lines and growth conditions despite the response curves look largely different. We develop a hybrid model strategy in which cells are represented by coarse-grained individual units calibrated with a high resolution cell model and parameterized measurable biophysical and cell-biological parameters. Cell cycle progression in our model is controlled by volumetric strain, the latter being derived from a bio-mechanical relation between applied pressure and cell compressibility. After parameter calibration from experiments with mouse colon carcinoma cells growing against the resistance of an elastic alginate capsule, the model adequately predicts the growth curve in i) soft and rigid capsules, ii) in different experimental conditions where the mechanical stress is generated by osmosis via a high molecular weight dextran solution, and iii) for other cell types with different growth kinetics. Our model simulation results suggest that the growth response of cell population upon externally applied mechanical stress is the same, as it can be quantitatively predicted using the same growth progression function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IDBZAvqfb9o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR-based technology has provided new avenues to interrogate gene function, but difficulties in transgene expression in post-mitotic neurons has delayed incorporation of these tools in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient, neuron-optimized dual lentiviral CRISPR-based transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) system capable of robust, modular, and tunable gene induction and multiplexed gene regulation across several primary rodent neuron culture systems. CRISPRa targeting unique promoters in the complex multi-transcript gene brain-derived neurotrophic factor (&lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt;) revealed both transcript- and genome-level selectivity of this approach, in addition to highlighting downstream transcriptional and physiological consequences of &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; regulation. Finally, we illustrate that CRISPRa is highly efficient &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, resulting in increased protein levels of a target gene in diverse brain structures. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CRISPRa is an efficient and selective method to study gene expression programs in brain health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Functional deficiency in endogenous interleukin‐1 receptor antagonist in patients with febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25439?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently reported successful treatment of a child with febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), a subtype of new onset refractory status epilepticus, with the recombinant interleukin‐1 (IL1) receptor antagonist (IL1RA) anakinra. On this basis, we tested whether endogenous IL1RA production or function is deficient in FIRES patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levels of IL1β and IL1RA were measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The inhibitory activity of endogenous IL1RA was assessed using a cell‐based reporter assay. &lt;i&gt;IL1RN&lt;/i&gt; gene variants were identified by sequencing. Expression levels for the secreted and intracellular isoforms of IL1RA were measured in patient and control cells by real‐time polymerase chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levels of endogenous IL1RA and IL1β were elevated in the serum and CSF of patients with FIRES (n = 7) relative to healthy controls (n = 10). Serum from FIRES patients drove IL1R signaling activity and potentiated IL1R signaling in response to exogenous IL1β in a cell‐based reporter assay. Functional assessment of endogenous IL1RA activity in 3 FIRES patients revealed attenuated inhibition of IL1R signaling. Sequencing of &lt;i&gt;IL1RN&lt;/i&gt; in our index patient revealed multiple variants. This was accompanied by reduced expression of intracellular but not secreted isoforms of IL1RA in the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that FIRES is associated with reduced expression of intracellular IL1RA isoforms and a functional deficiency in IL1RA inhibitory activity. These observations may provide insight into disease pathogenesis for FIRES and other inflammatory seizure disorders and may provide a valuable biomarker for therapeutic decision‐making.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As put forward by neuroscientists, the mechanisms of consciousness can be
elucidated by revealing correlations between neural dynamics and specific
conscious percepts. Recently, I have elaborated on the mathematical formulation
for a system of processes that are mutually connected to be isomorphic to a
conscious percept of a point in space. Importantly, in such a system, any
process can be derived through all other processes that form its complement, or
interpretation. To generate such a solution, I am proposing a dynamical system
of oscillators coupled in a manner to preserve the properties of a percept.
Specifically, I crafted a dynamical system that retains the mutual
relationships among processes, forming an operational map isomorphic to a
distance matrix that mimics a percept of space-like properties. The study and
results pave a novel way to analyze the dynamics of neural-like (oscillatory)
processes with a purpose of extracting the information relevant to specific
conscious percepts, which will facilitate the search for neural correlates of
consciousness.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: What the odor is not: Estimation by elimination. (arXiv:1903.02580v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02580</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The olfactory system uses the responses of a small number of broadly
sensitive receptors to combinatorially encode a vast number of odors. Here, we
propose a method for decoding such a distributed representation. Our main idea
is that a receptor that does not respond to an odor carries more information
than a receptor that does, because a typical receptor binds to many odorants.
So a response below threshold signals the absence of all such odorants. As a
result, it is easier to identify what the odor is not, rather than what the
odor is. We demonstrate that, for biologically realistic numbers of receptors,
response functions, and odor mixture complexity, this remarkably simple method
of elimination turns an underdetermined decoding problem into an overdetermined
one, allowing accurate determination of the odorants in a mixture and their
concentrations. We give a simple neural network realization of our algorithm
which resembles the known circuit architecture of the piriform cortex.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: SCN1A gain of function in early infantile encephalopathy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25438?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To elucidate the biophysical basis underlying the distinct and severe clinical presentation in patients with the recurrent missense &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; variant, p.Thr226Met. Patients with this variant show a well‐defined genotype–phenotype correlation and present with developmental and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy that is far more severe than typical &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt; Dravet syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole cell patch clamp and dynamic action potential clamp were used to study T226M Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 channels expressed in mammalian cells. Computational modeling was used to explore the neuronal scale mechanisms that account for altered action potential firing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T226M channels exhibited hyperpolarizing shifts of the activation and inactivation curves and enhanced fast inactivation. Dynamic action potential clamp hybrid simulation showed that model neurons containing T226M conductance displayed a left shift in rheobase relative to control. At current stimulation levels that produced repetitive action potential firing in control model neurons, depolarization block and cessation of action potential firing occurred in T226M model neurons. Fully computationally simulated neuron models recapitulated the findings from dynamic action potential clamp and showed that heterozygous T226M models were also more susceptible to depolarization block.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a biophysical perspective, the T226M mutation produces gain of function. Somewhat paradoxically, our data suggest that this gain of function would cause interneurons to more readily develop depolarization block. This “functional dominant negative” interaction would produce a more profound disinhibition than seen with haploinsufficiency that is typical of Dravet syndrome and could readily explain the more severe phenotype of patients with T226M mutation.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence corroborates the role of the “central vein sign” in the radiological diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we report human MRI‐pathological data that inflammation‐dependent intracerebral remodeling of the vessel wall is directly associated with the prominence of intralesional veins on susceptibility‐based MRI. In adult marmosets with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), vessel‐wall fibrosis was detected early in the demyelinating process, even in lesions less than two weeks old, though fibrosis was more evident after 6 weeks. Vascular remodeling consisted of both luminal enlargement and eccentric thickening of the perivascular space (fibrillar collagen type I deposition) and affected almost exclusively white matter, but not subpial cortical, lesions. The long‐term effect of vessel remodeling in MS lesions is currently unknown, but it might potentially affect tissue repair.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>RSS PAP: Selectively inhibiting the median preoptic nucleus attenuates angiotensin II and hyperosmotic-induced drinking behavior and vasopressin release in adult male rats</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0473-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) is a putative integrative region that contributes to body fluid balance. Activation of the MnPO can influence thirst but it is not clear how these responses are linked to body fluid homeostasis. We used Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to determine the role of the MnPO in drinking behavior and vasopressin release in response to peripheral angiotensin II (ANG II) or 3% hypertonic saline in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300g). Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and stereotaxically injected with an inhibitory DREADD (rAAV5-CaMKIIa-hM4D(G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)-mCherry) or control (rAAV5-CaMKIIa-mCherry) virus in the MnPO. After 2 weeks’ recovery, a subset of rats were used for extracellular recordings to verify functional effects of ANG II or hyperosmotic challenges in MnPO slice preparations. Remaining rats were used in drinking behavior studies. Each rat was administered either 10mg/kg of exogenous clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) to inhibit DREADD-expressing cells or vehicle ip followed by a test treatment with either 2mg/kg ANG II or 3% hypertonic saline (1mL/100g bw) sc, twice per week for two separate treatment weeks. CNO-induced inhibition during either test treatment significantly attenuated drinking responses compared to vehicle treatments and controls. Brain tissue processed for cFos immunohistochemistry showed decreased expression with CNO-induced inhibition during either test treatment in the MnPO and downstream nuclei compared to controls. CNO-mediated inhibition significantly attenuated treatment-induced increases in plasma vasopressin compared to controls. The results indicate inhibition of CaMKIIa-expressing MnPO neurons significantly reduces drinking and vasopressin release in response to ANG II or hyperosmotic challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The MnPO is an important regulatory center that influences thirst, cardiovascular and neuroendocrine function. Activation of different MnPO neuronal populations can inhibit or stimulate water intake. However, the role of the MnPO and its pathway-specific projections during ANG II and hyperosmotic challenges still have not yet been fully elucidated. These studies directly address this by using DREADDs to acutely and selectively inhibit pathway-specific MnPO neurons, and uses techniques that measure changes at the protein, neuronal, and overall physiological and behavioral level. More importantly, we have been able to demonstrate that physiological challenges related to extracellular (ANG II) or cellular (hypertonic saline) dehydration activate MnPO neurons that may project to different parts of the hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: FGF-23-deficiency impairs hippocampal-dependent cognitive function</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0469-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Fibroblast growth factor receptor and α-Klotho transduce fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) signaling in renal tubules to maintain systemic phosphate/Vitamin D homeostasis. Mice deficient for either the ligand, FGF-23, or the co-receptor, Klotho, are phenocopies with both showing rapid and premature development of multiple aging-like abnormalities. Such similarity in phenotype, suggests that FGF-23 and Klotho have co-dependent systemic functions. Recent reports revealed inverse central nervous system effects of Klotho deficiency or Klotho overexpression on hippocampal synaptic, neurogenic, and cognitive functions. However, it is unknown whether FGF-23 deficiency effects function of the hippocampus. We report that, similar to Klotho-deficient mice, FGF-23-deficient mice develop dose-dependent, hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairment. However, FGF-23-deficient brains had no gross structural or developmental defects, no change in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and only minor impairment to postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis. Together these data provide evidence that FGF-23 deficiency impairs hippocampal-dependent cognition but otherwise results in a brain phenotype that is distinct from the KL-deficient mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Although FGF-23 is reportedly expressed by the brain, it has no known brain function. In the periphery, kidney transduction of FGF-23 signaling is required for proper phosphate, calcium and Vitamin D homeostasis. Recent reports show that Klotho, the obligate FGF-23 co-receptor, is required for multiple hippocampal activities. If Klotho-deficient brain effects are the result of disrupted FGF-23 signaling, similar phenotypes may occur under conditions of FGF-23 deficiency. Herein, studies were undertaken to determine whether FGF-23-deficient mice show impairment of the same hippocampal functions, as a first step toward investigating whether FGF-23 is the mechanism by which Klotho effects brain function. Our data show that FGF-23 is only required for normal hippocampal-dependent cognition suggesting that FGF-23 may effect the brain uniquely.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Phase Coherent Currents underlying neocortical seizure-like state transitions</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0426-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In the epileptic brain, phase amplitude cross frequency coupling (CFC) features have been used to objectively classify seizure-related states, and the inter-seizure state has been demonstrated as being random, in contrast to the seizure state being predictable; however, the excitatory and inhibitory networks underlying their dynamics remain unclear. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to classify the dynamics of seizure sub-states labeling seizure-like event (SLE) onset and termination intervals using CFC features and to obtain their underlying excitatory/inhibitory cellular correlates. SLEs were induced in mouse neocortical brain slices using a low-magnesium perfusate, and were recorded in layer II/III using simultaneous local field potential and whole cell voltage clamp electrodes. Classification of onset and termination of SLE transitions was investigated using CFC features in conjunction with an unsupervised 2-state hidden Markov model (HMM). Gamma distributions of their durations indicated that both are predictable. Furthermore, omitting 4Hz from the HMM classifier switched both SLE sub-states from statistically deterministic to random without changing the dynamics of the SLE state. These results were generalized to 4-AP induced SLEs and human seizure traces. Only during these sub-states, both excitatory and inhibitory currents coupled with the field. Where excitatory currents phase locked to a broad range of frequencies between 1 and 12Hz, inhibitory currents dominantly phase locked at 4Hz. We conclude that inhibition underlies the predictability of neocortical CFC-defined SLE transition sub-states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; To date, the underlying excitatory and inhibitory bases of objectively identified seizure sub-states have not been determined. Here we identify these sub-states using phase amplitude cross frequency coupling features. This is tested in both human and rodent seizure models. Then, using simultaneous field and whole cell recordings in a mouse model, we investigate the potential for explaining seizure sub-state dynamics from interactions of the excitatory and inhibitory currents with local field network activity. We found that the frequency ranges at which these currents are coherent with field oscillations have a dramatic effect on the predictability of seizure state sub-states. Such information is critical for identifying the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0370-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Hilar mossy cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) shape the firing and function of the hippocampal circuit. However, the neural circuitry providing afferent input to mossy cells is incompletely understood, and little is known about the development of these inputs. Thus, we used whole-cell recording and laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) to characterize the developmental trajectory of local excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to mossy cells in the mouse hippocampus. Hilar mossy cells were targeted by visualizing non-red fluorescent cells in the dentate hilus of GAD2-Cre; Ai9 mice, which expressed tdTomato in GAD+ neurons, and were confirmed by post hoc morphological characterization. Our results show that at postnatal days 6-7 (P6-7), mossy cells received more excitatory input from neurons in the proximal CA3 versus those in the DG. In contrast, at P13-14 and P21-28, the largest source of excitatory input originated in DG cells, while the strength of CA3 and hilar inputs declined. A developmental trend was also evident for inhibitory inputs. Overall inhibitory input at P6-7 was weak, while inhibitory inputs from the DG cell layer and the hilus predominated at P13-14 and P21-28. The strength of local DG excitation and inhibition to mossy cells peaked at P13-14 and decreased slightly in older P21-28 mice. Together, these data provide new detailed information on the development of local synaptic connectivity of mossy cells, and suggests mechanisms through which developmental changes in local circuit inputs to hilar mossy cells shape their physiology and vulnerability to injury during postnatal periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Mossy cells of the dentate gyrus (DG) have been implicated in hippocampal circuits regulating pattern separation, an important function attributed to the DG. However, physiological inputs regulating mossy cell activity are incompletely understood. Here, we show that sources of both excitatory and inhibitory inputs arise developmentally. Our results suggest that excitatory inputs from the DG and local inhibitory inputs are well-positioned to powerfully sculpt receptive fields in mature mossy cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0288-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no effective treatments for glioma or for neurodegenerative diseases due, in part, to our limited understanding of the pathophysiology and cellular heterogeneity of these diseases. Mounting evidence suggests that astrocytes play an active role in the pathogenesis of these diseases by contributing to a diverse range of pathophysiological states. In a previous study, five molecularly distinct astrocyte subpopulations from three different brain regions were identified. To further delineate the underlying diversity of these populations, we obtained mouse brain region-specific gene signatures for both protein-coding and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and found that these astrocyte subpopulations are endowed with unique molecular signatures across diverse brain regions. Additional gene set and single-sample enrichment analyses revealed that gene signatures of different subpopulations are differentially correlated with glioma tumors that harbor distinct genomic alterations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that links transcriptional profiles of astrocyte subpopulations with glioma genomic mutations. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that subpopulations of astrocytes in select brain regions are associated with specific neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, the present study provides a new perspective for understanding the pathophysiology of glioma and neurodegenerative diseases and highlights the potential contributions of diverse astrocyte populations to normal, malignant, and degenerative brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Mounting evidence suggests that astrocytes play an active role in disease pathogenesis by contributing to a diverse range of pathophysiological states. The present study identifies new layers of astrocyte diversity and new correlations between distinct astrocyte subpopulations and disease states. Understanding the heterogeneity of astrocytes in different physiological conditions and diseases will provide new avenues for improved diagnostics and therapeutics targeting specific astrocyte subpopulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Choice-Related Activity during Visual Slant Discrimination in Macaque CIP but Not V3A</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0248-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Creating three-dimensional (3D) representations of the world from two-dimensional retinal images is fundamental to visually guided behaviors including reaching and grasping. A critical component of this process is determining the 3D orientation of objects. Previous studies have shown that neurons in the caudal intraparietal area (CIP) of the macaque monkey represent 3D planar surface orientation (i.e., slant and tilt). Here we compare the responses of neurons in areas V3A (which is implicated in 3D visual processing and which precedes CIP in the visual hierarchy) and CIP to 3D oriented planar surfaces. We then examine whether activity in these areas correlates with perception during a fine slant discrimination task in which monkeys report if the top of a surface is slanted towards or away from them. Although we find that V3A and CIP neurons show similar sensitivity to planar surface orientation, significant choice-related activity during the slant discrimination task is rare in V3A but prominent in CIP. These results implicate both V3A and CIP in the representation of 3D surface orientation, and suggest a functional dissociation between the areas based on slant-related choice signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Surface orientation perception is fundamental to visually guided behaviors such as reaching, grasping, and navigation. Previous studies implicate the caudal intraparietal area (CIP) in the representation of 3D surface orientation. Here we show that responses to 3D oriented planar surfaces are similar in CIP and V3A, which precedes CIP in the cortical hierarchy. However, we also find a qualitative distinction between the two areas: only CIP neurons show robust choice-related activity during a fine visual orientation discrimination task.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Electrophysiological properties of medium spiny neuron subtypes in the caudate-putamen of prepubertal male and female Drd1a-tdTomato line 6 BAC transgenic mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0016-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The caudate-putamen is a striatal brain region essential for sensorimotor behaviors, habit learning, and other cognitive and premotor functions. The output and predominant neuron of the caudate-putamen is the medium spiny neuron (MSN). MSNs present discrete cellular subtypes that show differences in neurochemistry, dopamine receptor expression, efferent targets, gene expression, functional roles, and most importantly for this study, electrophysiological properties. MSN subtypes include the striatonigral and the striatopallidal groups. Most studies identify the striatopallidal MSN subtype as being more excitable than the striatonigral MSN subtype. However, there is some divergence between studies regarding the exact differences in electrophysiological properties. Furthermore, MSN subtype electrophysiological properties have not been reported disaggregated by biological sex. We addressed these questions using prepubertal male and female Drd1a-tdTomato line 6 BAC transgenic mice, an important transgenic line that has not yet received extensive electrophysiological analysis. We made acute caudate-putamen brain slices and assessed a robust battery of 16 relevant electrophysiological properties using whole-cell patch clamp recording, including intrinsic membrane, action potential, and miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) properties. We found that: (1) MSN subtypes exhibited multiple differential electrophysiological properties in both sexes, including rheobase, action potential threshold and width, input resistance in both the linear and rectified ranges, and mEPSC amplitude; (2) select electrophysiological properties showed interactions between MSN subtype and sex. These findings provide a comprehensive evaluation of mouse caudate-putamen MSN subtype electrophysiological properties across females and males, both confirming and extending previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The findings presented here provide the most comprehensive evaluation of the electrophysiological properties of caudate-putamen medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes ever performed in a single study, both in terms of electrophysiological metrics and animal sex. These data selectively confirm, diverge from, and extend the findings of previous studies, providing a firm foundation upon which to pursue future studies of caudate-putamen MSNs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: SpykeTorch: Efficient Simulation of Convolutional Spiking Neural Networks with at most one Spike per Neuron. (arXiv:1903.02440v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02440</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Application of deep convolutional spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
artificial intelligence (AI) tasks has recently gained a lot of interest since
SNNs are hardware-friendly and energy-efficient. Unlike the non-spiking
counterparts, most of the existing SNN simulation frameworks are not
practically efficient enough for large-scale AI tasks. In this paper, we
introduce SpykeTorch, an open-source high-speed simulation framework based on
PyTorch. This framework simulates convolutional SNNs with at most one spike per
neuron and the rank-order encoding scheme. In terms of learning rules, both
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and reward-modulated STDP (R-STDP) are
implemented, but other rules could be implemented easily. Apart from the
aforementioned properties, SpykeTorch is highly generic and capable of
reproducing the results of various studies. Computations in the proposed
framework are tensor-based and totally done by PyTorch functions, which in turn
brings the ability of just-in-time optimization for running on CPUs, GPUs, or
Multi-GPU platforms.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Structural Associations of Cortical Contrast and Thickness in First Episode Psychosis</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz040/5371084?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;There is growing evidence that psychosis is characterized by brain network abnormalities. Analyzing morphological abnormalities with T1-weighted structural MRI may be limited in discovering the extent of deviations in cortical associations. We assess whether structural associations of either cortical white–gray contrast (WGC) or cortical thickness (CT) allow for a better understanding of brain structural relationships in first episode of psychosis (FEP) patients. Principal component and structural covariance analyses were applied to WGC and CT derived from T1-weighted MRI for 116 patients and 88 controls, to explore sets of brain regions that showed group differences, and associations with symptom severity and cognitive ability in patients. We focused on 2 principal components: one encompassed primary somatomotor regions, which showed trend-like group differences in WGC, and the second included heteromodal cortices. Patients’ component scores were related to general psychopathology for WGC, but not CT. Structural covariance analyses with WGC revealed group differences in pairwise correlations across widespread brain regions, mirroring areas derived from PCA. More group differences were uncovered with WGC compared with CT. WGC holds potential as a proxy measure of myelin from commonly acquired T1-weighted MRI and may be sensitive in detecting systems-level aberrations in early psychosis, and relationships with clinical/cognitive profiles.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Spatial Patterns of Brain Activity Preferentially Reflecting Transient Pain and Stimulus Intensity</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz026/5371085?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;How pain emerges in the human brain remains an unresolved question. Neuroimaging studies have suggested that several brain areas subserve pain perception because their activation correlates with perceived pain intensity. However, painful stimuli are often intense and highly salient; therefore, using both intensity- and saliency-matched control stimuli is crucial to isolate pain-selective brain responses. Here, we used these intensity/saliency-matched painful and non-painful stimuli to test whether pain-selective information can be isolated in the functional magnetic resonance imaging responses elicited by painful stimuli. Using two independent datasets, multivariate pattern analysis was able to isolate features distinguishing the responses triggered by (1) intensity/saliency-matched painful versus non-painful stimuli, and (2) high versus low-intensity/saliency stimuli regardless of whether they elicit pain. This indicates that neural activity in the so-called “pain matrix” is functionally heterogeneous, and part of it carries information related to both painfulness and intensity/saliency. The response features distinguishing these aspects are spatially distributed and cannot be ascribed to specific brain structures.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Repetitive Diffuse Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Causes an Atypical Astrocyte Response and Spontaneous Recurrent Seizures</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/10/1944?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Focal traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces astrogliosis, a process essential to protecting uninjured brain areas from secondary damage. However, astrogliosis can cause loss of astrocyte homeostatic functions and possibly contributes to comorbidities such as posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE). Scar-forming astrocytes seal focal injuries off from healthy brain tissue. It is these glial scars that are associated with epilepsy originating in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. However, the vast majority of human TBIs also present with diffuse brain injury caused by acceleration-deceleration forces leading to tissue shearing. The resulting diffuse tissue damage may be intrinsically different from focal lesions that would trigger glial scar formation. Here, we used mice of both sexes in a model of repetitive mild/concussive closed-head TBI, which only induced diffuse injury, to test the hypothesis that astrocytes respond uniquely to diffuse TBI and that diffuse TBI is sufficient to cause PTE. Astrocytes did not form scars and classic astrogliosis characterized by upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein was limited. Surprisingly, an unrelated population of atypical reactive astrocytes was characterized by the lack of glial fibrillary acidic protein expression, rapid and sustained downregulation of homeostatic proteins and impaired astrocyte coupling. After a latency period, a subset of mice developed spontaneous recurrent seizures reminiscent of PTE in human TBI patients. Seizing mice had larger areas of atypical astrocytes compared with nonseizing mice, suggesting that these atypical astrocytes might contribute to epileptogenesis after diffuse TBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of acquired epilepsies. Reactive astrocytes have long been associated with seizures and epilepsy in patients, particularly after focal/lesional brain injury. However, most TBIs also include nonfocal, diffuse injuries. Here, we showed that repetitive diffuse TBI is sufficient for the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures in a subset of mice. We identified an atypical response of astrocytes induced by diffuse TBI characterized by the rapid loss of homeostatic proteins and lack of astrocyte coupling while reactive astrocyte markers or glial scar formation was absent. Areas with atypical astrocytes were larger in animals that later developed seizures suggesting that this response may be one root cause of epileptogenesis after diffuse TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Targeted DamID (TaDa) is proving invaluable in identifying the genome-wide binding sites of chromatin-associated proteins &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, without fixation, cell isolation, or immunoprecipitation. The simplicity and efficiency of the technique have led to an ever-expanding TaDa toolbox. These tools enable profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility, as well as the identification of the genome-wide binding sites of chromatin complexes, transcription factors and RNAs. Here, we review these new developments, with particular emphasis on the use of TaDa in studying neuronal specification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Poly-Glutamine Region in the Drosophila VAChT Dictates Fill-Level of Cholinergic Synaptic Vesicles</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0477-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;While the primary role of vesicular transporters is to load neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles (SVs), accumulating evidence suggests that these proteins also contribute to additional aspects of synaptic function, including vesicle release. In this study, we extend the role of the VAChT to include regulating the transmitter content of SVs. We report that manipulation of a C-terminal poly-glutamine (polyQ) region in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; VAChT is sufficient to influence transmitter content, and release frequency, of cholinergic vesicles from the terminals of premotor interneurons. Specifically, we find that reduction of the polyQ region, by one glutamine residue (&lt;i&gt;13Q&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;12Q&lt;/i&gt;), results in a significant increase in both amplitude and frequency of spontaneous cholinergic miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) recorded in the aCC and RP2 motoneurons. Moreover, this truncation also results in evoked synaptic currents that show increased duration: consistent with increased ACh release. By contrast, extension of the polyQ region by one glutamine (&lt;i&gt;13Q&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;14Q&lt;/i&gt;) is sufficient to reduce mEPSC amplitude and frequency and, moreover, prevents evoked SV release. Finally, a complete deletion of the polyQ region (13Q to 0Q) has no obvious effects to mEPSCs, but again evoked synaptic currents show increased duration. The mechanisms that ensure SVs are filled to physiologically-appropriate levels remain unknown. Our study identifies the polyQ region of the insect VAChT to be required for correct vesicle transmitter loading and, thus, provides opportunity to increase understanding of this critical aspect of neurotransmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The Pharmacological Assessment of GABAA Receptor Activation in Experimental Febrile Seizures in Mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0429-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Hyperthermia-induced febrile seizures (FSs) are the most common seizures during childhood, and prolonged complex FSs can result in the development of epilepsy. Currently, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor modulators such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates are used as medications for FSs with the aim of enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition of neuronal activity. However, it is still up for debate whether these enhancers of GABAergic neurotransmission could depolarize immature neurons with relatively higher levels of the intracellular Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; in the developing brain during FSs. Here, we performed simultaneous video-local field potential monitoring to determine whether benzodiazepines and barbiturates affect the phenotypes of FSs in postnatal day (P)11 and P14 mice. We found that low-dose administration of diazepam decreased the incidence of clonic seizures at P11. We also found that high-dose administration of diazepam and pentobarbital exacerbated the behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes of the induction phase of experimental FSs at P11 but not at P14. We further found that the deteriorated phenotypes at P11 were suppressed when Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;2Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1), which mediates Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; influx, was blocked by treatment with the diuretic bumetanide. Though our findings do not exclude the involvement of sedation effect of high-dose GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor modulators in worsening experimental FSs at P11, pharmacological enhancement of GABAergic signaling could aggravate seizure activity in the early phase of FSs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The Effects of Methylphenidate (Ritalin) on the Neurophysiology of the Monkey Caudal Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0371-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Methylphenidate (MPH), commonly known as Ritalin, is the most widely prescribed drug worldwide to treat patients with attention deficit disorders. Although MPH is thought to modulate catecholamine neurotransmission in the brain, it remains unclear how these neurochemical effects influence neuronal activity and lead to attentional enhancements. Studies in rodents overwhelmingly point to the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) as a main site of action of MPH. To understand the mechanism of action of MPH in a primate brain, we recorded the responses of neuronal populations using chronic multielectrode arrays implanted in the caudal LPFC of two macaque monkeys while the animals performed an attention task (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 2811 neuronal recordings). Over different recording sessions (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 55), we orally administered either various doses of MPH or a placebo to the animals. Behavioral analyses revealed positive effects of MPH on task performance at specific doses. However, analyses of individual neurons activity, noise correlations, and neuronal ensemble activity using machine learning algorithms revealed no effects of MPH. Our results suggest that the positive behavioral effects of MPH observed in primates (including humans) may not be mediated by changes in the activity of caudal LPFC neurons. MPH may enhance cognitive performance by modulating neuronal activity in other regions of the attentional network in the primate brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Foxg1 Directly Represses Dbx1 to Confine the POA and Subsequently Regulate Ventral Telencephalic Patterning</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz037/5370812?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;During early development, signaling centers, such as the cortical hem and the preoptic area (POA), are critical for telencephalic patterning. However, the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of signal centers are poorly understood. Here, we report that the transcription factor &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; is required to confine the POA, a resource of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sonic Hedgehog&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Shh)&lt;/span&gt; that is pivotal for ventral telencephalic development. Cell-specific deletion of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; achieved by crossing &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;fl/fl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dbx1-cre&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nestin-CreER&lt;/span&gt; combined with tamoxifen induction results in a dramatic expansion of the POA accompanied by the significantly increased activity of the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Shh&lt;/span&gt; signaling pathway. Ventral pattern formation was severely impaired. Moreover, we demonstrated that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; directly represses &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dbx1&lt;/span&gt; to restrict the POA. Furthermore, we found that the ventral pallium was expanded, which might also contribute to the observed patterning defects. These findings will improve our understanding of the maintenance of signal centers and help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying ventral telencephalic patterning.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: HuR in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex is Critical for Stress-Induced Synaptic Dysfunction and Depressive-Like Symptoms in Mice</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz036/5370740?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Chronic stress has been observed to increase the risk of developing depression and induce neuronal alterations of synaptic plasticity, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that the ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein HuR was up-regulated in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice following chronic stress. In adult mice, AAV-Cre-mediated knockout of HuR in the mPFC prevented anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors induced by chronic stress. HuR was also required for the stress-induced dendritic spine loss and synaptic transmission deficits. Moreover, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;HuR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;flox/flox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nex-Cre&lt;/span&gt; mice, which induce HuR loss of function from embryonic development, exhibited enhanced synaptic functions. Notably, we ascertained RhoA signaling to be regulated by HuR and involved in the modulation of structural synaptic plasticity in response to chronic stress. Our results demonstrate HuR is a critical modulator for the regulation of stress-induced synaptic plasticity alterations and depression, providing a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of depressive disorders.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Disrupted AMPA Receptor Function upon Genetic- or Antibody-Mediated Loss of Autism-Associated CASPR2</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz032/5370683?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neuropsychiatric disorders share susceptibility genes, suggesting a common origin. One such gene is &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CNTNAP2&lt;/span&gt; encoding contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2), which harbours mutations associated to autism, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability. Antibodies targeting CASPR2 have also been recently described in patients with several neurological disorders, such as neuromyotonia, Morvan’s syndrome, and limbic encephalitis. Despite the clear implication of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CNTNAP2&lt;/span&gt; and CASPR2 in neuropsychiatric disorders, the pathogenic mechanisms associated with alterations in CASPR2 function are unknown. Here, we show that Caspr2 is expressed in excitatory synapses in the cortex, and that silencing its expression &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in vitro&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in vivo&lt;/span&gt; decreases the synaptic expression of α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methylisoxazole‐4‐propionic acid (AMPA) receptors and the amplitude of AMPA receptor-mediated currents. Furthermore, Caspr2 loss of function blocks synaptic scaling &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in vitro&lt;/span&gt; and experience-dependent homoeostatic synaptic plasticity in the visual cortex. Patient CASPR2 antibodies decrease the dendritic levels of Caspr2 and synaptic AMPA receptor trafficking, and perturb excitatory transmission in the visual cortex. These results suggest that mutations in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CNTNAP2&lt;/span&gt; may contribute to alterations in AMPA receptor function and homoeostatic plasticity, and indicate that antibodies from anti-CASPR2 encephalitis patients affect cortical excitatory transmission.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Emergence of Hierarchical Somatosensory Processing in Late Prematurity</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz030/5370832?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The somatosensory system has a hierarchical organization. Information processing increases in complexity from the contralateral primary sensory cortex to bilateral association cortices and this is represented by a sequence of somatosensory-evoked potentials recorded with scalp electroencephalographies. The mammalian somatosensory system matures over the early postnatal period in a rostro-caudal progression, but little is known about the development of hierarchical information processing in the human infant brain. To investigate the normal human development of the somatosensory hierarchy, we recorded potentials evoked by mechanical stimulation of hands and feet in 34 infants between 34 and 42 weeks corrected gestational age, with median postnatal age of 3 days. We show that the shortest latency potential was evoked for both hands and feet at all ages with a contralateral somatotopic source in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI). However, the longer latency responses, localized in SI and beyond, matured with age. They gradually emerged for the foot and, although always present for the hand, showed a shift from purely contralateral to bilateral hemispheric activation. These results demonstrate the rostro-caudal development of human somatosensory hierarchy and suggest that the development of its higher tiers is complete only just before the time of normal birth.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

The development of neural manipulation and mapping tools has opened up new avenues to dissect the neural circuits underlying body fluid regulation. Recent studies have identified several nodes in the brain that positively and negatively regulate thirst. The next step forward would be to elucidate how neural populations interact with each other to control drinking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

In recent years, comparative single-cell transcriptomics has opened up new research avenues addressing these issues. Here, we review recent conceptual progress toward an evolutionary definition of cell types, and how it facilitates the identification and large-scale comparison of neuronal types and neuron type families from single-cell data — with the family of GABAergic neurons in distinct parts of the vertebrate forebrain as prime example. We also highlight strategies to infer cell type-specific innovation, so-called apomeres, from single-cell data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Single-cell sequencing studies show that different neuronal cell types express distinct combinations of cell-surface proteins important for synaptic connectivity and function. Emerging evidence indicates that glia-derived cell-surface proteins play critical roles in shaping connectivity as well. These studies begin to suggest that the proteins present on presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, glial processes, and secreted into the synaptic cleft and extracellular matrix together confer unique surface identities to different types of synaptic connections. Here, we summarize recent findings demonstrating that cell-surface proteins derived from both neurons and glia interact and cooperate to control the connectivity, architecture and function of specific synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

The neural circuits that integrate higher order commands from the brain and generate motor outputs are located in the nerve cord of the central nervous system. Recently, genetic access to distinct functional subtypes that make up the &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; adult ventral nerve cord has significantly begun to advance our understanding of the structural organization and functions of the neural circuits coordinating motor outputs. Moreover, lineage-tracing and genetic intersection tools have been instrumental in deciphering the developmental mechanisms that generate and assemble the functional units of the adult nerve cord. Together, the &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; adult ventral nerve cord is emerging as a powerful system to understand the development and function of neural circuits that are responsible for coordinating complex motor outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Lateral Habenular Burst Firing as a Target of the Rapid Antidepressant Effects of Ketamine</title>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30315-1?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>The revolutionary discovery of the rapid antidepressant ketamine has been a milestone in psychiatry field in the last half century. Unlike conventional antidepressants that often take weeks to months to show efficacy, ketamine causes rapid antidepressant effects, emerging as early as within 1h after administration. However, how ketamine improves mood symptoms so quickly has remained elusive. Here, we first introduce the historical background of ketamine as a rapid antidepressant. We then discuss current hypotheses underlying ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects, with a focus on our latest discovery that ketamine silences NMDAR-dependent burst firing in the ‘anti-reward center’, the lateral habenula.</content:encoded>
