	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01727</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nature is in constant flux, so animals must account for changes in their
environment when making decisions. How animals learn the timescale of such
changes and adapt their decision strategies accordingly is not well understood.
Recent psychophysical experiments have shown humans and other animals can
achieve near-optimal performance at two alternative forced choice (2AFC) tasks
in dynamically changing environments. Characterization of performance requires
the derivation and analysis of computational models of optimal decision-making
policies on such tasks. We review recent theoretical work in this area, and
discuss how models compare with subjects' behavior in tasks where the correct
choice or evidence quality changes in dynamic, but predictable, ways.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Insights on the impact of mitochondrial organisation on bioenergetics in high-resolution computational models of cardiac cell architecture</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/2tbMz5eg2PA/article</link>

Recent electron microscopy data have revealed that cardiac mitochondria are not arranged in crystalline columns but are organised with several mitochondria aggregated into columns of varying sizes often spanning the cell cross-section. This raises the question—how does the mitochondrial arrangement affect the metabolite distributions within cardiomyocytes and their impact on force dynamics? Here we employed finite element modelling of cardiac bioenergetics, using computational meshes derived from electron microscope images, to address this question. Our results indicate that heterogeneous mitochondrial distributions can lead to significant spatial variation across the cell in concentrations of inorganic phosphate, creatine (Cr) and creatine phosphate (PCr). However, our model predicts that sufficient activity of the creatine kinase (CK) system, coupled with rapid diffusion of Cr and PCr, maintains near uniform ATP and ADP ratios across the cell cross sections. This homogenous distribution of ATP and ADP should also evenly distribute force production and twitch duration with contraction. These results suggest that the PCr shuttle, and associated enzymatic reactions, act to maintain uniform force dynamics in the cell despite the heterogeneous mitochondrial organization. However, our model also predicts that under hypoxia—activity of mitochondrial CK enzyme and diffusion of high-energy phosphate compounds may be insufficient to sustain uniform ATP/ADP distribution and hence force generation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2tbMz5eg2PA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

New genome wide approaches have revealed that ARG programs are highly cell-type-specific, raising the possibility that they mediate different forms of experience-dependent plasticity in different cell types. The cell-type specificity of these gene programs is achieved by a combination of cell-intrinsic mechanisms that determine the transcriptional response of each neuronal subtype to a given stimulus and by cell-extrinsic mechanisms that influence the nature of the stimulus a cell receives. A better understanding of these mechanisms could usher in an era of molecular systems neuroscience in which genetic perturbations of cell-type-specific plasticities are assessed using electrophysiology and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; imaging to reveal the neural basis of adaptive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Global Connectivity and Function of Descending Spinal Input Revealed by 3D Microscopy and Retrograde Transduction</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10566?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain communicates with the spinal cord through numerous axon tracts that arise from discrete nuclei, transmit distinct functions, and often collateralize to facilitate the coordination of descending commands. This complexity presents a major challenge to interpreting functional outcomes from therapies that target supraspinal connectivity after injury or disease, while the wide distribution of supraspinal nuclei complicates the delivery of therapeutics. Here we harness retrograde viral vectors to overcome these challenges. We demonstrate that injection of AAV2-Retro to the cervical spinal cord of adult female mice results in highly efficient transduction of supraspinal populations throughout the brainstem, midbrain, and cortex. Some supraspinal populations, including corticospinal and rubrospinal neurons, were transduced with &amp;gt;90% efficiency, with robust transgene expression within 3 d of injection. In contrast, propriospinal and raphe spinal neurons showed much lower rates of retrograde transduction. Using tissue clearing and light-sheet microscopy we present detailed visualizations of descending axons tracts and create a mesoscopic projectome for the spinal cord. Moreover, chemogenetic silencing of supraspinal neurons with retrograde vectors resulted in complete and reversible forelimb paralysis, illustrating effective modulation of supraspinal function. Retrograde vectors were also highly efficient when injected after spinal injury, highlighting therapeutic potential. These data provide a global view of supraspinal connectivity and illustrate the potential of retrograde vectors to parse the functional contributions of supraspinal inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The complexity of descending inputs to the spinal cord presents a major challenge in efforts deliver therapeutics to widespread supraspinal systems, and to interpret their functional effects. Here we demonstrate highly effective gene delivery to diverse supraspinal nuclei using a retrograde viral approach and combine it with tissue clearing and 3D microscopy to map the descending projectome from brain to spinal cord. These data highlight newly developed retrograde viruses as therapeutic and research tools, while offering new insights into supraspinal connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Phosphocreatine Levels in the Left Thalamus Decline during Wakefulness and Increase after a Nap</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10552?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Scientists have hypothesized that the availability of phosphocreatine (PCr) and its ratio to inorganic phosphate (Pi) in cerebral tissue form a substrate of wakefulness. It follows then, according to this hypothesis, that the exhaustion of PCr and the decline in the ratio of PCr to Pi form a substrate of fatigue. We used &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-MRS) to investigate quantitative levels of PCr, the -signal of ATP, and Pi in 30 healthy humans (18 female) in the morning, in the afternoon, and while napping (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15) versus awake controls (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 10). Levels of PCr (2.40 mM at 9 A.M.) decreased by 7.0 ± 0.8% (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 7.1 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;–6&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = –5.5) in the left thalamus between 9 A.M. and 5 P.M. Inversely, Pi (0.74 mM at 9 A.M.) increased by 17.1 ± 5% (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = 3.1) and pH levels dropped by 0.14 ± 0.07 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002; &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = 3.6). Following a 20 min nap after 5 P.M., local PCr, Pi, and pH were restored to morning levels. We did not find respective significant changes in the contralateral thalamus or in other investigated brain regions. Left hemispheric PCr was signficantly lower than right hemispheric PCr only at 5 P.M. in the thalamus and at all conditions in the temporal region. Thus, cerebral daytime-related and sleep-related molecular changes are accessible &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Prominent changes were identified in the thalamus. This region is heavily relied on for a series of energy-consuming tasks, such as the relay of sensory information to the cortex. Furthermore, our data confirm that lateralization of brain function is regionally dynamic and includes PCr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The metabolites phosphocreatine (PCr) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) are assumed to inversely reflect the cellular energy load. This study detected a diurnal decrease of intracellular PCr and a nap-associated reincrease in the left thalamus. Pi behaved inversely. This outcome corroborates the role of the thalamus as a region of high energy consumption in agreement with its function as a gateway that relays and modulates information flow. Conversely to the dynamic lateralization of thalamic PCr, a constantly significant lateralization was observed in other regions. Increasing fatigue over the course of the day may also be a matter of cerebral energy supply. Comparatively fast restoration of that supply may be part of the biological basis for the recreational value of &quot;power napping.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Demethylation of G-Protein-Coupled Receptor 151 Promoter Facilitates the Binding of Krüppel-Like Factor 5 and Enhances Neuropathic Pain after Nerve Injury in Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10535?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;G-protein-coupled receptors are considered to be cell-surface sensors of extracellular signals, thereby having a crucial role in signal transduction and being the most fruitful targets for drug discovery. G-protein-coupled receptor 151 (GPR151) was reported to be expressed specifically in the habenular area. Here we report the expression and the epigenetic regulation of GRP151 in the spinal cord after spinal nerve ligation (SNL) and the contribution of GPR151 to neuropathic pain in male mice. SNL dramatically increased GPR151 expression in spinal neurons. &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; mutation or spinal inhibition by shRNA alleviated SNL-induced mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia. Interestingly, the CpG island in the &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; gene promoter region was demethylated, the expression of DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) was decreased, and the binding of DNMT3b with &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; promoter was reduced after SNL. Overexpression of DNMT3b in the spinal cord decreased &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; expression and attenuated SNL-induced neuropathic pain. Furthermore, Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), a transcriptional factor of the KLF family, was upregulated in spinal neurons, and the binding affinity of KLF5 with &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; promoter was increased after SNL. Inhibition of KLF5 reduced &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; expression and attenuated SNL-induced pain hypersensitivity. Further mRNA microarray analysis revealed that mutation of &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; reduced the expression of a variety of pain-related genes in response to SNL, especially mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway-associated genes. This study reveals that GPR151, increased by DNA demethylation and the enhanced interaction with KLF5, contributes to the maintenance of neuropathic pain via increasing MAPK pathway-related gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are targets of various clinically approved drugs. Here we report that SNL increased GPR151 expression in the spinal cord, and mutation or inhibition of GPR151 alleviated SNL-induced neuropathic pain. In addition, SNL downregulated the expression of DNMT3b, which caused demethylation of &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; gene promoter, facilitated the binding of transcriptional factor KLF5 with the &lt;i&gt;GPR151&lt;/i&gt; promoter, and further increased GPR151 expression in spinal neurons. The increased GPR151 may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain via activating MAPK signaling and increasing pain-related gene expression. Our study reveals an epigenetic mechanism underlying GPR151 expression and suggests that targeting GPR151 may offer a new strategy for the treatment of neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Phase Synchronicity of {mu}-Rhythm Determines Efficacy of Interhemispheric Communication Between Human Motor Cortices</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10525?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The theory of communication through coherence predicts that effective connectivity between nodes in a distributed oscillating neuronal network depends on their instantaneous excitability state and phase synchronicity (Fries, 2005). Here, we tested this prediction by using state-dependent millisecond-resolved real-time electroencephalography-triggered dual-coil transcranial magnetic stimulation (EEG-TMS) (Zrenner et al., 2018) to target the EEG-negative (high-excitability state) versus EEG-positive peak (low-excitability state) of the sensorimotor μ-rhythm in the left (conditioning) and right (test) motor cortex (M1) of 16 healthy human subjects (9 female, 7 male). Effective connectivity was tested by short-interval interhemispheric inhibition (SIHI); that is, the inhibitory effect of the conditioning TMS pulse given 10–12 ms before the test pulse on the test motor-evoked potential. We compared the four possible combinations of excitability states (negative peak, positive peak) and phase relations (in-phase, out-of-phase) of the μ-rhythm in the conditioning and test M1 and a random phase condition. Strongest SIHI was found when the two M1 were in phase for the high-excitability state (negative peak of the μ-rhythm), whereas the weakest SIHI occurred when they were out of phase and the conditioning M1 was in the low-excitability state (positive peak). Phase synchronicity contributed significantly to SIHI variation, with stronger SIHI in the in-phase than out-of-phase conditions. These findings are in exact accord with the predictions of the theory of communication through coherence. They open a translational route for highly effective modification of brain connections by repetitive stimulation at instants in time when nodes in the network are phase synchronized and excitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The theory of communication through coherence predicts that effective connectivity between nodes in distributed oscillating brain networks depends on their instantaneous excitability and phase relation. We tested this hypothesis in healthy human subjects by real-time analysis of brain states by electroencephalography in combination with transcranial magnetic stimulation of left and right motor cortex. We found that short-interval interhemispheric inhibition, a marker of interhemispheric effective connectivity, was maximally expressed when the two motor cortices were in phase for a high-excitability state (the trough of the sensorimotor μ-rhythm). We conclude that findings are consistent with the theory of communication through coherence. They open a translational route to highly effectively modify brain connections by repetitive stimulation at instants in time of phase-synchronized high-excitability states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Encoding of Reward and Decoding Movement from the Frontal Eye Field during Smooth Pursuit Eye Movements</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10515?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Expectation of reward potentiates sensorimotor transformations to drive vigorous movements. One of the main challenges in studying reward is to determine how representations of reward interact with the computations that drive behavior. We recorded activity in smooth pursuit neurons in the frontal eye field (FEF) of two male rhesus monkeys while controlling the eye speed by manipulating either reward size or target speed. The neurons encoded the different reward conditions more strongly than the different target speed conditions. This pattern could not be explained by differences in the eye speed, since the eye speed sensitivity of the neurons was also larger for the reward conditions. Pooling the responses by the preferred direction of the neurons attenuated the reward modulation and led to a tighter association between neural activity and behavior. Therefore, a plausible decoder such as the population vector could explain how the FEF both drives behavior and encodes reward beyond behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Motor areas combine sensory and reward information to drive movement. To disambiguate these sources, we manipulated the speed of smooth pursuit eye movements by controlling either the size of the reward or the speed of the visual motion signals. We found that the relationship between activity in frontal eye field and eye kinematics varied: the eye speed sensitivity was larger for the different reward conditions than for the different target speed conditions. Decoders that pooled signals by the preferred direction of the neurons attenuated the reward modulations. These decoders may indicate how reward can be both encoded beyond eye kinematics at the single neuron level and drive movement at the population level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Feedforward and Feedback Control Share an Internal Model of the Arm's Dynamics</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10505?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent work has shown that, when countering external forces, the nervous system adjusts not only predictive (i.e., feedforward) control of reaching but also reflex (i.e., feedback) responses to mechanical perturbations. Here we show that altering the physical properties of the arm (i.e., intersegmental dynamics) causes the nervous system to adjust feedforward control and that this learning transfers to feedback responses even though the latter were never directly trained. Forty-five human participants (30 females) performed a single-joint elbow reaching task and countered mechanical perturbations that created pure elbow motion. In our first experiment, we altered intersegmental dynamics by asking participants to generate pure elbow movements when the shoulder joint was either free to rotate or locked by the robotic manipulandum. With the shoulder unlocked, we found robust activation of shoulder flexor muscles for pure elbow flexion trials, as required to counter the interaction torques that arise at the shoulder because of forearm rotation. After locking the shoulder joint, which cancels these interaction torques, we found a substantial reduction in shoulder muscle activity over many trials. In our second experiment, we tested whether such learning transfers to feedback control. Mechanical perturbations applied to the arm with the shoulder unlocked revealed that feedback responses also account for intersegmental dynamics. After locking the shoulder joint, we found a substantial reduction in shoulder feedback responses, as appropriate for the altered intersegmental dynamics. Our work suggests that feedforward and feedback control share an internal model of the arm's dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we show that altering the physical properties of the arm causes people to learn new motor commands and that this learning transfers to their reflex responses to unexpected mechanical perturbations, even though the reflex responses were never directly trained. Our results suggest that feedforward motor commands and reflex responses share an internal model of the arm's dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: 5-HT2A Receptor-Induced Morphological Reorganization of PKC{gamma}-Expressing Interneurons Gates Inflammatory Mechanical Allodynia in Rat</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10489?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mechanical allodynia, a widespread pain symptom that still lacks effective therapy, is associated with the activation of a dorsally directed polysynaptic circuit within the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) or medullary dorsal horn (MDH), whereby tactile inputs into deep SDH/MDH can gain access to superficial SDH/MDH, eliciting pain. Inner lamina II (II&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) interneurons expressing the  isoform of protein kinase C (PKC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are key elements for allodynia circuits, but how they operate is still unclear. Combining behavioral, &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological, and morphological approaches in an adult rat model of facial inflammatory pain (complete Freund's adjuvant, CFA), we show that the mechanical allodynia observed 1 h after CFA injection is associated with the following (1) sensitization (using ERK1/2 phosphorylation as a marker) and (2) reduced dendritic arborizations and enhanced spine density in exclusively PKC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons, but (3) depolarized resting membrane potential (RMP) in all lamina II&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; PKC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/PKC&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons. Blocking MDH 5HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R) prevents facial mechanical allodynia and associated changes in the morphology of PKC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons, but not depolarized RMP in lamina II&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; interneurons. Finally, activation of MDH 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R in naive animals is enough to reproduce the behavioral allodynia and morphological changes in PKC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons, but not the electrophysiological changes in lamina II&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; interneurons, induced by facial inflammation. This suggests that inflammation-induced mechanical allodynia involves strong morphological reorganization of PKC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons via 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R activation that contributes to open the gate for transmission of innocuous mechanical inputs to superficial SDH/MDH pain circuitry. Preventing 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R-induced structural plasticity in PKC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons might represent new avenues for the specific treatment of inflammation-induced mechanical hypersensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Inflammatory or neuropathic pain syndromes are characterized by pain hypersensitivity such as mechanical allodynia (pain induced by innocuous mechanical stimuli). It is generally assumed that mechanisms underlying mechanical allodynia, because they are rapid, must operate at only the level of functional reorganization of spinal or medullary dorsal horn (MDH) circuits. We discovered that facial inflammation-induced mechanical allodynia is associated with rapid and strong structural remodeling of specifically interneurons expressing the  isoform of protein kinase C (PKC) within MDH inner lamina II. Moreover, we elucidated a 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor to PKC/ERK1/2 pathway leading to the behavioral allodynia and correlated morphological changes in PKC interneurons. Therefore, descending 5-HT sensitize PKC interneurons, a putative &quot;gate&quot; in allodynia circuits, via 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-induced structural reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Changes in Brainstem Pain Modulation Circuitry Function over the Migraine Cycle</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10479?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neural mechanism responsible for migraine remains unclear. While an external trigger has been proposed to initiate a migraine, it has also been proposed that changes in brainstem function are critical for migraine headache initiation and maintenance. Although the idea of altered brainstem function has some indirect support, no study has directly measured brainstem pain modulation circuitry function in migraineurs particularly immediately before a migraine. In male and female humans, we performed fMRI in 31 controls and 31 migraineurs at various times in their migraine cycle. We measured brainstem function during noxious orofacial stimulation and assessed resting-state functional connectivity. First, we found that, in individual migraineurs, pain sensitivity increased over the interictal period but then dramatically decreased immediately before a migraine. Second, despite overall similar pain intensity ratings between groups, in the period immediately before a migraine, compared with controls and other migraine phases, migraineurs displayed greater activation in the spinal trigeminal nucleus during noxious orofacial stimulation and reduced functional connectivity of this region with the rostral ventromedial medulla. Additionally, during the interictal phase, migraineurs displayed reduced activation of the midbrain periaqueductal gray matter and enhanced periaqueductal gray connectivity with the rostral ventromedial medulla. These data support the hypothesis that brainstem sensitivity fluctuates throughout the migraine cycle. However, in contrast to the prevailing hypothesis, our data suggest that, immediately before a migraine attack, endogenous analgesic mechanisms are enhanced and incoming noxious inputs are less likely to reach higher brain centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It has been hypothesized that alterations in brainstem function are critical for the generation of migraine. In particular, modulation of orofacial pain pathways by brainstem circuits alters the propensity of external triggers or ongoing spontaneous activity to evoke a migraine attack. We sought to obtain empirical evidence to support this theory. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that pain sensitivity decreased immediately before a migraine, and this was coupled with increased sensitivity of the spinal trigeminal nucleus to noxious stimuli. We also found that resting connectivity within endogenous pain modulation circuitry alters across the migraine cycle. These changes may reflect enhanced and diminished neural tone states proposed to be critical for the generation of a migraine and underlie cyclic fluctuations in migraine brainstem sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Selective Loss of Thin Spines in Area 7a of the Primate Intraparietal Sulcus Predicts Age-Related Working Memory Impairment</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10467?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brodmann area 7a of the parietal cortex is active during working memory tasks in humans and nonhuman primates, but the composition and density of dendritic spines in area 7a and their relevance both to working memory and cognitive aging remain unexplored. Aged monkeys have impaired working memory, and we have previously shown that this age-induced cognitive impairment is partially mediated by a loss of thin spines in prefrontal cortex area 46, a critical area for working memory. Because area 46 is reciprocally connected with area 7a of the parietal cortex and 7a mediates visual attention integration, we hypothesized that thin spine density in area 7a would correlate with working memory performance as well. To investigate the synaptic profile of area 7a and its relevance to working memory and cognitive aging, we investigated differences in spine type and density in layer III pyramidal cells of area 7a in young and aged, male and female rhesus macaques (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) that were cognitively assessed using the delayed response test of working memory. Area 7a shows age-related loss of thin spines, and thin spine density positively correlates with delayed response performance in aged monkeys. In contrast, these cells show no age-related changes in dendritic length or branching. These changes mirror age-related changes in area 46 but are distinct from other neocortical regions, such as V1. These findings support our hypothesis that cognitive aging is driven primarily by synaptic changes, and more specifically by changes in thin spines, in key association areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study advances our understanding of cognitive aging by demonstrating the relevance of area 7a thin spines to working memory performance. This study is the first to look at cognitive aging in the intraparietal sulcus, and also the first to report spine or dendritic measures for area 7a in either young adult or aged nonhuman primates. These results contribute to the hypothesis that thin spines support working memory performance and confirm our prior observation that cognitive aging is driven by synaptic changes rather than changes in dendritic morphology or neuron death. Importantly, these data show that age-related working memory changes are not limited to disruptions of the prefrontal cortex but also include an association region heavily interconnected with prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Retinoic Acid Receptor RAR{alpha}-Dependent Synaptic Signaling Mediates Homeostatic Synaptic Plasticity at the Inhibitory Synapses of Mouse Visual Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10454?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Homeostatic synaptic plasticity is a synaptic mechanism through which the nervous system adjusts synaptic excitation and inhibition to maintain network stability. Retinoic acid (RA) and its receptor RARα have been established as critical mediators of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies reveal that RA signaling enhances excitatory synaptic strength and decreases inhibitory synaptic strength. However, it is unclear whether RA-mediated homeostatic synaptic plasticity occurs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and if so, whether it operates at specific types of synapses. Here, we examine the impact of RA/RARα signaling in the monocular zone of primary visual cortex (V1m) in mice of either sex. Exogenous RA treatment in acute cortical slices resulted in a reduction in mIPSCs of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, an effect mimicked by visual deprivation induced by binocular enucleation in postcritical period animals. Postnatal deletion of RARα blocked RA's effect on mIPSCs. Cell type-specific deletion of RARα revealed that RA acted specifically on parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons. RARα deletion in PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons blocked visual deprivation-induced changes in mIPSCs, demonstrating the critical involvement of RA signaling in PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, visual deprivation- or RA-induced downregulation of synaptic inhibition was absent in the visual cortical circuit of constitutive and PV-specific &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice, strongly suggesting a functional interaction between fragile X mental retardation protein and RA signaling pathways. Together, our results demonstrate that RA/RARα signaling acts as a key component for homeostatic regulation of synaptic transmission at the inhibitory synapses of the visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies established that retinoic acid (RA) and its receptor RARα play key roles in homeostatic synaptic plasticity, a mechanism by which synaptic excitation/inhibition balance and network stability are maintained. However, whether synaptic RA signaling operates &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; remains undetermined. Here, using a conditional RARα KO mouse and cell type-specific Cre-driver lines, we showed that RARα signaling in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons is crucial for visual deprivation-induced homeostatic synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses in visual cortical circuits. Importantly, this form of synaptic plasticity is absent when fragile X mental retardation protein is selectively deleted in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, suggesting a functional connection between RARα and fragile X mental retardation protein signaling pathways &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, dysfunction of RA-dependent homeostatic plasticity may contribute to cortical circuit abnormalities in fragile X syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Presynaptic mGluRs Control the Duration of Endocannabinoid-Mediated DSI</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10444?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;GABA synapses in the brain undergo depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) that requires activation of presynaptic cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Rs). The brevity of DSI, lasting ~1 min in most brain regions, has been ascribed to the transient production of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Here, we propose that the duration of DSI is controlled by heterologous interactions between presynaptic mGluRs and CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Rs. By examining GABA synapses on parvocellular corticotropin-releasing hormone-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) of male and female mice, we show that DSI decays quickly in experimental conditions in which both GABA and glutamate are released from adjacent nerve terminals. Pharmacological inhibition of group I mGluRs prolongs DSI, whereas prior activation of mGluRs inhibits DSI, collectively suggesting that group I mGluRs quench presynaptic CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling. When photostimulation of genetically identified terminals is used to release only GABA, CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R-dependent DSI persists for many minutes. Under the same conditions, activation of group I mGluRs reestablishes classical, transient DSI. The long-lasting DSI observed when GABA synapses are independently recruited functionally uncouples inhibitory input to PVN neurons. These observations suggest that heterologous interactions between mGluRs and CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Rs control the temporal window of DSI at GABA synapses, providing evidence for a powerful new way to affect functional circuit connectivity in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Postsynaptic depolarization liberates endocannabinoids, resulting in a rapid and transient decrease in release probability at GABA synapses. We discovered that mGluRs control the duration of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), most likely through heterologous desensitization of cannabinoid type 1 receptors by presynaptic mGluR&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. By shortening the duration of DSI, mGluRs control the temporal window for retrograde signaling at GABA synapses. Physiological or pathological changes that affect glutamate spillover may profoundly affect network excitability by shifting the duration of cannabinoid inhibition at GABA synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Specifying a Causal Role for Angular Gyrus in Autobiographical Memory</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10438?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Considerable recent evidence indicates that angular gyrus dysfunction in humans does not result in amnesia, but does impair a number of aspects of episodic memory. Patients with parietal lobe lesions have been reported to exhibit a deficit when freely recalling autobiographical events from their pasts, but can remember details of the events when recall is cued by specific questions. In apparent contradiction, inhibitory brain stimulation targeting angular gyrus in healthy volunteers has been found to have no effect on free recall or cued recall of word pairs. The present study sought to resolve this inconsistency by testing free and cued recall of both autobiographical memories and word-pair memories in the same healthy male and female human participants following continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) of angular gyrus and a vertex control location. Angular gyrus cTBS resulted in a selective reduction in the free recall, but not cued recall, of autobiographical memories, whereas free and cued recall of word-pair memories were unaffected. Additionally, participants reported fewer autobiographical episodes as being experienced from a first-person perspective following angular gyrus cTBS. The findings add to a growing body of evidence that a function of angular gyrus within the network of brain regions responsible for episodic recollection is to integrate memory features within an egocentric framework into the kind of first-person perspective representation that enables the subjective experience of remembering events from our personal pasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In seeking to understand the role played by the angular gyrus region of parietal cortex in human memory, interpreting the often conflicting findings from neuroimaging and neuropsychology studies has been hampered by differences in anatomical specificity and localization between methods. In the present study, we address these limitations using continuous theta burst stimulation in healthy volunteers to disrupt function of angular gyrus and a vertex control region. With this method, we adjudicate between two competing theories of parietal lobe function, finding evidence that is inconsistent with an attentional role for angular gyrus in memory, supporting instead an account in terms of integrating memory features within an egocentric framework into a first-person perspective representation that enables the subjective experience of remembering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Congenital Cytomegalovirus Infection Alters Olfaction Before Hearing Deterioration In Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10424?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In developed countries, cytomegalovirus (CMV)-infected newborns are at high risk of developing sensorineural handicaps such as hearing loss, requiring extensive follow-up. However, early prognostic tools for auditory damage in children are not yet available. In the fetus, CMV infection leads to early olfactory bulb (OB) damage, suggesting that olfaction might represent a valuable prognosis for neurological outcome of this viral infection. Here, we demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; CMV inoculation causes fetal infection and growth retardation in mice of both sexes. It disrupts OB normal development, leading to disproportionate OB cell layers and rapid major olfactory deficits. Olfaction is impaired as early as day 6 after birth in both sexes, long before the emergence of auditory deficits. Olfactometry in males reveals a long-lasting alteration in olfactory perception and discrimination, particularly in binary mixtures of monomolecular odorants. Although sensory inputs to the OB remain unchanged, hallmarks of autophagy are increased in the OB of 3-postnatal week-old mice, leading to local neuroinflammation and loss of neurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase and calbindin. At the cellular level, we found CMV-infected cells and an increased number of apoptotic cells scattered throughout the OB layers, whereas cell proliferation in the neurogenic subventricular zone was decreased. These cellular observations were long-lasting, persisting up to 16 weeks after birth in both males and females and thus providing a mechanism supporting olfactory loss. Despite obvious differences in neurogenesis between human and mouse, these findings offer new strategies aimed at early detection of neurological dysfunctions caused by congenital infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In developed countries, congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV)-infected newborns are at high risk of developing sensory handicaps such as hearing loss, thus requiring prolonged follow-up. In this study, we describe for the first time the functional impact of congenital CMV infection on the olfactory system and its associated sense of smell. We demonstrate that a mouse model of congenital CMV infection shows defects in olfactory bulb (OB) normal development and pronounced olfactory deficits affecting acuity and discrimination of odorants. These major olfactory deficits occur long before the emergence of auditory deficits through the upregulation of OB autophagy inducing local neuroinflammation and altered neuron content. Our findings provide new opportunities for designing olfactory means to monitor the possible neurological outcome during congenital CMV infection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: FABP3 in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex Modulates the Methylation Status of the Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase67 Promoter Region</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10411?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential for brain development and function. Increasing evidence has shown that an imbalance of PUFAs is associated with various human psychiatric disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs), cellular chaperones of PUFAs, are involved in PUFA intracellular trafficking, signal transduction, and gene transcription. In this study, we show that FABP3 is strongly expressed in the GABAergic inhibitory interneurons of the male mouse anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which is a component of the limbic cortex and is important for the coordination of cognitive and emotional behaviors. Interestingly, &lt;i&gt;Fabp3&lt;/i&gt; KO male mice show an increase in the expression of the gene encoding the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (&lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt;) in the ACC. In the ACC of &lt;i&gt;Fabp3&lt;/i&gt; KO mice, &lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt; promoter methylation and the binding of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to the &lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt; promoter are significantly decreased compared with those in WT mice. The abnormal cognitive and emotional behaviors of &lt;i&gt;Fabp3&lt;/i&gt; KO mice are restored by methionine administration. Notably, methionine administration normalizes &lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt; promoter methylation and its mRNA expression in the ACC of &lt;i&gt;Fabp3&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. These findings demonstrate that FABP3 is involved in the control of DNA methylation of the &lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt; promoter and activation of GABAergic neurons in the ACC, thus suggesting the importance of PUFA homeostasis in the ACC for cognitive and emotional behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ACC is important for emotional and cognitive processing. However, the mechanisms underlying its involvement in the control of behavioral responses are largely unknown. We show the following new observations: (1) FABP3, a PUFA cellular chaperone, is exclusively expressed in GABAergic interneurons in the ACC; (2) an increase in &lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt; expression is detected in the ACC of &lt;i&gt;Fabp3&lt;/i&gt; KO mice; (3) the &lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt; promoter is hypomethylated and the binding of transcriptional repressor complexes is decreased in the ACC of &lt;i&gt;Fabp3&lt;/i&gt; KO mice; and (4) elevated &lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt; expression and abnormal behaviors seen in &lt;i&gt;Fabp3&lt;/i&gt; KO mice are mostly recovered by methionine treatment. These suggest that FABP3 regulates GABA synthesis through transcriptional regulation of &lt;i&gt;Gad67&lt;/i&gt; in the ACC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/49/10401?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What has become standard textbook knowledge over the last decade was a hotly debated matter a decade earlier: the proposition that new neurons are generated in the adult mammalian CNS. The early discovery by Altman and colleagues in the 1960s was vulnerable to criticism due to the lack of technical strategies for unequivocal demonstration, quantification, and physiological analysis of newly generated neurons in adult brain tissue. After several technological advancements had been made in the field, we published a paper in 1996 describing the generation of new neurons in the adult rat brain and the decline of hippocampal neurogenesis during aging. The paper coincided with the publication of several other studies that together established neurogenesis as a cellular mechanism in the adult mammalian brain. In this &lt;i&gt;Progressions&lt;/i&gt; article, which is by no means a comprehensive review, we recount our personal view of the initial setting that led to our study and we discuss some of its implications and developments that followed. We also address questions that remain regarding the regulation and function of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain, in particular the existence of neurogenesis in the adult human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Neural Evidences of Hierarchical Cognitive Control during Haptic Processing: An fMRI Study</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0295-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Interacting with our immediate surroundings requires constant manipulation of objects. Dexterous manipulation depends on comparison between actual and predicted sensory input, with these predictions calculated by means of lower- and higher-order corollary discharge signals. However, there is still scarce knowledge about the hierarchy in the neural architecture supporting haptic monitoring during manipulation. The present study aimed to assess this issue focusing on the cross talk between lower-order sensory and higher-order associative regions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans during a haptic discrimination task in which participants had to judge whether a touched shape or texture corresponded to an expected stimulus whose name was previously presented. Specialized haptic regions identified with an independent localizer task did not differ between expected and unexpected conditions, suggesting their lack of involvement in tactile monitoring. When presented stimuli did not match previous expectations, the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG), middle temporal, and medial prefrontal cortices were activated regardless of the nature of the haptic mismatch (shape/texture). The left primary somatosensory area (SI) responded differently to unexpected shapes and textures in line with a specialized detection of haptic mismatch. Importantly, connectivity analyses revealed that the left SMG and SI were more functionally coupled during unexpected trials, emphasizing their interaction. The results point for the first time to a hierarchical organization in the neural substrates underlying haptic monitoring during manipulation with the SMG as a higher-order hub comparing actual and predicted somatosensory input, and SI as a lower-order site involved in the detection of more specialized haptic mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

equivalently a tight upper bound on mutual information between a signal

the distribution of signals, channel outputs and decodes, that minimizes
equivocation and maximizes mutual information. This work addresses a problem in
data analysis, where mutual information between signals and decodes is
sometimes used to lower bound the mutual information between signals and
channel outputs. Our result provides a corresponding upper bound.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Shift in brain-state induced by tDCS: an EEG study. (arXiv:1812.01342v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01342</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is known to have a modulatory
effect on neural tissue and that it is polarity specific. It is also shown that
tDCS demonstrated the lasting effect in therapeutic applications. The main aim
of the study was to examine the effects of tDCS on cortical dynamics by
analyzing EEG recordings. We applied here measures taken from Recurrence
Quantification Analysis, Mean State Shift (MSS) and State Variance (SV) which
were previously used to detect changes in brain-state dynamics after TMS. The
studied cohort comprised of 16 healthy subjects; all subjects received anodal
and cathodal tDCS, which were given in two separate sessions on the same day.
The EEG was recorded from 10 electrodes, positioned over left motor cortex and
mirroring right cortex corresponding to 10/20 standard. From three traces of
recordings (pre, post1 and post2/before the stimulation, immediately after and
30min after tDCS) we extracted five different intervals (T1-T5) comprising of
500 samples. After calculating MSS and SV on those epochs and statistical
testing for a significant difference, we applied Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) on the same time series to check whether the data are separable. The
results show that tDCS exert polarity specific effects on the MSS as shown by
significantly lower MSS values after cathodal stimulation compared to anodal
stimulation. Cathodal stimulation affected the SV, as compared to anodal
stimulation, which did not lead to detectable changes. We are offering here for
the first time an informative PCA visualization of a time-effect of a tDCS
stimulation on brain state shift. Further research is needed to elucidate for
how long that change can be detected and what neurobiological changes are
introduced by that phenomena.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01179</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal excitability is known to be affected by transcranial electrical
stimulation. However, due to the existence of both excitatory and inhibitory
neurons in the cortex, the mechanism of neuronal excitability shift is still
not clear. Here, we study electrical stimulation disturbance on neuronal
excitability in the neuromuscular system on an acute rat model. We design a
special stimulation waveform of enveloped high frequency stimulation (EHFS).
With modeling and in vivo measurements, EHFS is confirmed to synchronize the
neuronal recruitment at the positive and negative electrode. This unique
synchronization property of EHFS amplifies the electrical stimulation
disturbance on neuronal excitability, to enable the macroscopic observations of
large increase and decrease of force output. By eliminating the complicated
inhibitory interneuron effects in the cortex, our observations on the
neuromuscular system supports the argument that electrical stimulation
dynamically shifts neuronal excitability, by inducing depolarization during
anodal stimulation and hyperpolarization during cathodal stimulation.

transfer function is obtained by performing successive numeric-computational
simulations and statistical regressions. Several interesting results are
reported, including the identification of linearity in the transfer functions,
as well as the identification of regions in the parameter space characterized
by sharper transfer functions.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40392</link>
	<content:encoded>A normal endowment of nephrons in the mammalian kidney requires a balance of nephron progenitor self-renewal and differentiation throughout development. Here, we provide evidence for a novel action of ureteric branch tip-derived Wnt11 in progenitor cell organization and interactions within the nephrogenic niche, ultimately determining nephron endowment. In &lt;i&gt;Wnt11&lt;/i&gt; mutants, nephron progenitors dispersed from their restricted niche, intermixing with interstitial progenitors. Nephron progenitor differentiation was accelerated, kidneys were significantly smaller, and the nephron progenitor pool was prematurely exhausted, halving the final nephron count. Interestingly, RNA-seq revealed no significant differences in gene expression. Live imaging of nephron progenitors showed that in the absence of &lt;i&gt;Wnt11&lt;/i&gt; they lose stable attachments to the ureteric branch tips, continuously detaching and reattaching. Further, the polarized distribution of several markers within nephron progenitors is disrupted. Together these data highlight the importance of Wnt11 signaling in directing nephron progenitor behavior which determines a normal nephrogenic program.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39925</link>
	<content:encoded>Aging is an intricate phenomenon associated with the gradual loss of physiological functions, and both nutrient sensing and proteostasis control lifespan. Although multiple approaches have facilitated the identification of candidate genes that govern longevity, the molecular mechanisms that link aging pathways are still elusive. Here, we conducted a quantitative mass spectrometry screen and identified all phosphorylation/dephosphorylation sites on yeast proteins that significantly responded to calorie restriction, a well-established approach to extend lifespan. Functional screening of 135 potential regulators uncovered that Ids2 is activated by PP2C under CR and inactivated by PKA under glucose intake. &lt;i&gt;ids2Δ&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;ids2&lt;/i&gt; phosphomimetic cells displayed heat sensitivity and lifespan shortening. Ids2 serves as a co-chaperone to form a complex with Hsc82 or the redundant Hsp82, and phosphorylation impedes its association with chaperone HSP90. Thus, PP2C and PKA may orchestrate glucose sensing and protein folding to enable cells to maintain protein quality for sustained longevity.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Spliceosome factors target timeless (tim) mRNA to control clock protein accumulation and circadian behavior in Drosophila</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39821</link>
	<content:encoded>Transcription-translation feedback loops that comprise eukaryotic circadian clocks rely upon temporal delays that separate the phase of active transcription of clock genes, such as Drosophila &lt;i&gt;period (per)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;timeless (tim),&lt;/i&gt; from negative feedback by the two proteins. However, our understanding of the mechanisms involved is incomplete. Through an RNA interference screen, we found that pre-mRNA processing 4 (PRP4) kinase, a component of the U4/U5.U6 triple small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (tri-snRNP) spliceosome, and other tri-snRNP components regulate cycling of the molecular clock as well as rest:activity rhythms. Unbiased RNA-Sequencing uncovered an alternatively spliced intron in &lt;i&gt;tim&lt;/i&gt; whose increased retention upon &lt;i&gt;prp4&lt;/i&gt; downregulation leads to decreased TIM levels. We demonstrate that the splicing of &lt;i&gt;tim&lt;/i&gt; is rhythmic with a phase that parallels delayed accumulation of the protein in a 24 hr cycle. We propose that alternative splicing constitutes an important clock mechanism for delaying the daily accumulation of clock proteins, and thereby negative feedback by them.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Single nucleus sequencing reveals evidence of inter-nucleus recombination in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39813</link>
	<content:encoded>Eukaryotes thought to have evolved clonally for millions of years are referred to as ancient asexuals. The oldest group among these are the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which are plant symbionts harboring hundreds of nuclei within one continuous cytoplasm. Some AMF strains (dikaryons) harbor two co-existing nucleotypes but there is no direct evidence that such nuclei recombine in this life-stage, as is expected for sexual fungi. Here, we show that AMF nuclei with distinct genotypes can undergo recombination. Inter-nuclear genetic exchange varies in frequency among strains, and despite recombination all nuclear genomes have an average similarity of at least 99.8%. The present study demonstrates that AMF can generate genetic diversity via meiotic-like processes in the absence of observable mating. The AMF dikaryotic life-stage is a primary source of nuclear variability in these organisms, highlighting its potential for strain enhancement of these symbionts.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Corollary discharge in precerebellar nuclei of sleeping infant rats</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38213</link>
	<content:encoded>In week-old rats, somatosensory input arises predominantly from external stimuli or from sensory feedback (reafference) associated with myoclonic twitches during active sleep. A previous study suggested that the brainstem motor structures that produce twitches also send motor copies (or corollary discharge, CD) to the cerebellum. We tested this possibility by recording from two precerebellar nuclei—the inferior olive (IO) and lateral reticular nucleus (LRN). In most IO and LRN neurons, twitch-related activity peaked sharply around twitch onset, consistent with CD. Next, we identified twitch-production areas in the midbrain that project independently to the IO and LRN. Finally, we blocked calcium-activated slow potassium (SK) channels in the IO to explain how broadly tuned brainstem motor signals can be transformed into precise CD signals. We conclude that the precerebellar nuclei convey a diversity of sleep-related neural activity to the developing cerebellum to enable processing of convergent input from CD and reafferent signals.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/487967v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective: To establish an animal model of cerebral hernia induced by acute intracranial hypertension for subsequent research in emergency medicine. Methods: Six Guangxi Ba-Ma mini-pigs were injected with autologous arterial blood by micropump to induce intracranial hematoma in the frontal and temporal parietal lobes. Changes in intracranial pressure (ICP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were observed during hematoma formation. Morphological changes and the occupying effects of intracranial hematoma were analyzed using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head. Results: ICP, MAP and CPP gradually increased during blood injection, and they began to slowly decrease at 10 min after injection, though they remained higher than before injection. These three parameters were significantly different before blood injection, immediately after injection and at 10 min after injection (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Head CT and MRI showed cerebral hernia induced by acute intracranial hypertension.

	<content:encoded>Detecting errors and adjusting behaviour appropriately are fundamental cognitive abilities that are known to improve through adolescence. The underlying mechanisms of this development, however, are still poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a thorough investigation of error processing in a Flanker task in a cross-sectional sample of participants 8 to 19 years of age (n = 98). We examined age-differences in event related potentials known to be associated with error processing, namely the error-related negativity (ERN) and the error positivity (Pe), as well as their relationships with task performance, post-error adjustments and regional cingulate cortex thickness and surface area. We found that ERN amplitude increased with age, while Pe amplitude remained constant. A more negative ERN was associated with higher task accuracy and faster reaction times, while a more positive Pe was associated with higher accuracy, independently of age. When estimating post-error adjustments from trials following both incongruent and congruent trials, post-error slowing and post-error improvement in accuracy both increased with age, but this was only found for post-error slowing when only analysing trials following incongruent trials. There were no age-independent associations between either ERN or Pe amplitude and cingulate cortex thickness or area measures.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The ability to estimate precisely the time to contact (TTC) of the objects is necessary for planning actions in dynamic environments. TTC estimation is involved in many everyday activities with different levels of difficulty. Although tracking a ball that moves at a constant speed and estimating the time it reaches a non-moving target can be fairly simple, tracking a fast moving car with inconsistent speeds and estimating the time it reaches another car is rather difficult. In this study, we asked participants to estimate TTC of an object in transversal and head-on motions. The object became invisible shortly after movement initiation. The results demonstrated that TTC estimation for transversal motion is more accurate than for head-on motion. We present a mathematical model to explain why humans are better in estimating TTC for transversal motion than for head-on motion.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Response properties of individual neurons in the human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) have yet to be studied, and their role in conscious perception remains unknown. To explore this, we implanted microelectrodes into the VTCs of eight human subjects undergoing invasive epilepsy monitoring. Most (26 of 33) category-selective units showed specificity for face stimuli, with a range of response profiles. Different face exemplars evoked consistent and discriminable responses in the population of units sampled. During a free recall task, face-selective units selectively reactivated in the absence of visual stimulation during the 2-second window prior to face recall events. Furthermore, recalled exemplar identity could be predicted by comparing population activity preceding recall events to activity evoked by visual stimulation with the respective exemplars.</content:encoded>

Contrast is the most fundamental property of images. Consequently, any comprehensive model of biological vision must incorporate this attribute and provide a veritable description of its impact on visual perception. Current theoretical and computational models predict that vision should modify its characteristics at low contrast: for example, it should become broader (more lowpass) to protect from noise, as often demonstrated by individual neurons. We find that the opposite is true for human discrimination of elementary image elements: vision becomes sharper, not broader, as contrast approaches threshold levels. Furthermore, it suffers from increased internal variability at low contrast and it transitions from a surprisingly linear regime at high contrast to a markedly nonlinear processing mode in the low-contrast range. These characteristics are hard-wired in that they happen on a single trial without memory or expectation. Overall, the empirical results urge caution when attempting to interpret human vision from the standpoint of optimality and related theoretical constructs. Direct measurements of this phenomenon indicate that the actual constraints derive from intrinsic architectural features, such as the co-existence of complex-cell-like and simple-cell-like components. Small circuits built around these elements can indeed account for the empirical results, but do not appear to operate in a manner that conforms to optimality even approximately. More generally, our results provide a compelling demonstration of how far we still are from securing an adequate computational account of the most basic operations carried out by human vision.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/p892OX1e4bY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Regulation of harvester ant foraging as a closed-loop excitable system</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/QFEh9jEk6cU/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Renato Pagliara, Deborah M. Gordon, Naomi Ehrich Leonard&lt;/p&gt;

Ant colonies regulate activity in response to changing conditions without using centralized control. Desert harvester ant colonies forage for seeds, and regulate foraging to manage a tradeoff between spending and obtaining water. Foragers lose water while outside in the dry air, but ants obtain water by metabolizing the fats in the seeds they eat. Previous work shows that the rate at which an outgoing forager leaves the nest depends on its recent rate of brief antennal contacts with incoming foragers carrying food. We examine how this process can yield foraging rates that are robust to uncertainty and responsive to temperature and humidity across minute-to-hour timescales. To explore possible mechanisms, we develop a low-dimensional analytical model with a small number of parameters that captures observed foraging behavior. The model uses excitability dynamics to represent response to interactions inside the nest and a random delay distribution to represent foraging time outside the nest. We show how feedback from outgoing foragers returning to the nest stabilizes the incoming and outgoing foraging rates to a common value determined by the volatility of available foragers. The model exhibits a critical volatility above which there is sustained foraging at a constant rate and below which foraging stops. To explain how foraging rates adjust to temperature and humidity, we propose that foragers modify their volatility after they leave the nest and become exposed to the environment. Our study highlights the importance of feedback in the regulation of foraging activity and shows how modulation of volatility can explain how foraging activity responds to conditions and varies across colonies. Our model elucidates the role of feedback across many timescales in collective behavior, and may be generalized to other systems driven by excitable dynamics, such as neuronal networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QFEh9jEk6cU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Development of GABAergic Inputs Is Not Altered in Early Maturation of Adult Born Dentate Granule Neurons in Fragile X Mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0137-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited mental retardation and the most common known cause of autism. Loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in mice (&lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO) leads to altered synaptic and circuit maturation in the hippocampus that is correlated with alterations in hippocampal-dependent behaviors. Previous studies have demonstrated that loss of FMRP increased the rate of proliferation of progenitor cells and altered their fate specification in adult &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. While these studies clearly demonstrate a role for FMRP in adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, it is not known whether the functional synaptic maturation and integration of adult-born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) into hippocampal circuits is affected in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Here, we used retroviral labeling to birthdate abDGCs in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice which allowed us to perform targeted patch clamp recording to measure the development of synaptic inputs to these neurons at precise time points after differentiation. The frequency and amplitude of spontaneous GABAergic events increased over the first three weeks after differentiation; however, this normal development of GABAergic synapses was not altered in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Furthermore, the relatively depolarized GABA reversal potential (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;GABA&lt;/sub&gt;) in immature abDGCs was unaffected by loss of FMRP as was the development of dendritic arbor of the adult generated neurons. These studies systematically characterized the functional development of abDGCs during the first four weeks after differentiation and demonstrate that the maturation of GABAergic synaptic inputs to these neurons is not grossly affected by the loss of FMRP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: State-Dependent Modulation of Locomotion by GABAergic Spinal Sensory Neurons. (arXiv:1812.00625v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00625</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) constitutes an interface through which chemical
cues can reach and modulate the activity of neurons located at the epithelial
boundary within the entire nervous system. Here, we investigate the role and
functional connectivity of a class of GABAergic sensory neurons contacting the
CSF in the vertebrate spinal cord and referred to as CSF-cNs. The remote
activation of CSF-cNs was shown to trigger delayed slow locomotion in the
zebrafish larva, suggesting that these cells modulate components of locomotor
central pattern generators (CPGs). Combining anatomy, electrophysiology, and
optogenetics in vivo, we show that CSF-cNs form active GABAergic synapses onto
V0-v glutamatergic interneurons, an essential component of locomotor CPGs. We
confirmed that activating CSF-cNs at rest induced delayed slow locomotion in
the fictive preparation. In contrast, the activation of CSF-cNs promptly
inhibited ongoing slow locomotion. Moreover, selective activation of rostral
CSF-cNs during ongoing activity disrupted rostrocaudal propagation of
descending excitation along the spinal cord, indicating that CSF-cNs primarily
act at the premotor level. Altogether, our results demonstrate how a spinal
GABAergic sensory neuron can tune the excitability of locomotor CPGs in a
state-dependent manner by projecting onto essential components of the
excitatory premotor pool.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Static Distributed-parameter Circuit Model Explains Electrical Stimulation on the Neuromuscular System. (arXiv:1812.00598v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00598</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Finite Element Modeling (FEM) has been widely used to model the electric
field distribution, to study the interaction between stimulation electrodes and
neural tissue. However, due to the insufficient computational capability to
represent neural tissue down to an atom-level, the existing FEM fails to model
the real electric field that is perpendicular to neuron membrane to initiate an
action potential. Thus, to reveal the real electrode-tissue interactions, we
developed a circuit to model transmembrane voltage waveforms. Here, we show a
distributed-parameter circuit model to systematically study how
electrode-tissue interaction is affected by electrode position, input current
waveform, and biological structures in the neuromuscular system. Our model
explains and predicts various phenomena in neuromuscular stimulation, guides
new stimulation electrode and method design, and more importantly, facilitates
a fundamental understanding of the physical process during electrode-tissue
interaction. In our model, myelin is assumed to be inductive. The voltage
waveform resonance caused by this inductive myelin accounts for the much lower
stimulation threshold to activate motoneurons than muscle fibers, which is
observed with in vivo measurements. These findings confirmed the feasibility of
studying electrode-tissue interaction using a proper distributed-parameter
circuit. Our current application on the neuromuscular system also raises the
possibility that this distributed-parameter circuit model could potentially be
applied to study other neural tissues, including the Peripheral Nervous System
(PNS) and the Central Nervous System (CNS).

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00278</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Encoding and decoding models are widely used in systems, cognitive, and
computational neuroscience to make sense of brain-activity data. However, the
interpretation of their results requires care. Decoding models can help reveal
whether particular information is present in a brain region in a format the
decoder can exploit. Encoding models make comprehensive predictions about
representational spaces. In the context of sensory systems, encoding models
enable us to test and compare brain-computational models, and thus directly
constrain computational theory. Encoding and decoding models typically include
fitted linear-model components. Sometimes the weights of the fitted linear
combinations are interpreted as reflecting, in an encoding model, the
contribution of different sensory features to the representation or, in a
decoding model, the contribution of different measured brain responses to a
decoded feature. Such interpretations can be problematic when the predictor
variables or their noise components are correlated and when priors (or
penalties) are used to regularize the fit. Encoding and decoding models are
evaluated in terms of their generalization performance. The correct
interpretation depends on the level of generalization a model achieves (e.g. to
new response measurements for the same stimuli, to new stimuli from the same
population, or to stimuli from a different population). Significant decoding or
encoding performance of a single model (at whatever level of generality) does
not provide strong constraints for theory. Many models must be tested and
inferentially compared for analyses to drive theoretical progress.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: True Contextuality in a Psychophysical Experiment. (arXiv:1812.00105v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00105</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent crowdsourcing experiments have shown that true contextuality of the
kind found in quantum mechanics can also be present in human behavior. In these
experiments simple human choices were aggregated over large numbers of
respondents, with each respondent dealing with a single context (set of
questions asked). In this paper we present experimental evidence of
contextuality in individual human behavior, in a psychophysical experiment with
repeated presentations of visual stimuli in randomly varying contexts
(arrangements of stimuli). The analysis is based on the
Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) theory whose relevant aspects are reviewed in
the paper. CbD allows one to detect contextuality in the presence of direct
influences, i.e., when responses to the same stimuli have different
distributions in different contexts. The experiment presented is also the first
one in which contextuality is demonstrated for responses that are not
dichotomous, with five options to choose among. CbD requires that random
variables representing such responses be dichotomized before they are subjected
to contextuality analysis. A theorem says that a system consisting of all
possible dichotomizations of responses has to be contextual if these responses
violate a certain condition, called nominal dominance. In our experiment
nominal dominance was violated in all data sets, with very high statistical
reliability established by bootstrapping.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42628</link>
	<content:encoded>Systemic blood pressure is determined, in part, by arterial smooth muscle cells (myocytes). Several Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels are proposed to be expressed in arterial myocytes, but it is unclear if these proteins control physiological blood pressure and contribute to hypertension in vivo. We generated the first inducible, smooth muscle-specific knockout mice for a TRP channel, namely for PKD2 (TRPP1), to investigate arterial myocyte and blood pressure regulation by this protein. Using this model, we show that intravascular pressure and α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenoceptors activate PKD2 channels in arterial myocytes of different systemic organs. PKD2 channel activation in arterial myocytes leads to an inward Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current, membrane depolarization and vasoconstriction. Inducible, smooth muscle cell-specific PKD2 knockout lowers both physiological blood pressure and hypertension and prevents pathological arterial remodeling during hypertension. Thus, arterial myocyte PKD2 controls systemic blood pressure and targeting this TRP channel reduces high blood pressure.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40686</link>
	<content:encoded>Dietary fatty acids are the main building blocks for cell membranes in animals, and mechanisms must therefore exist that compensate for dietary variations. We isolated &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; mutants that improved tolerance to dietary saturated fat in a sensitized genetic background, including eight alleles of the novel gene &lt;i&gt;fld-1&lt;/i&gt; that encodes a homolog of the human TLCD1 and TLCD2 transmembrane proteins. FLD-1 is localized on plasma membranes and acts by limiting the levels of highly membrane-fluidizing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids. Human TLCD1/2 also regulate membrane fluidity by limiting the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing membrane phospholipids. FLD-1 and TLCD1/2 do not regulate the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids but rather limit their incorporation into phospholipids. We conclude that inhibition of FLD-1 or TLCD1/2 prevents lipotoxicity by allowing increased levels of membrane phospholipids that contain fluidizing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39780</link>
	<content:encoded>Impaired angiogenesis is a hallmark of metabolically dysfunctional adipose tissue in obesity. However, the underlying mechanisms restricting angiogenesis within this context remain ill-defined. Here, we demonstrate that induced endothelial-specific depletion of the transcription factor Forkhead Box O1 (FoxO1) in male mice led to increased vascular density in adipose tissue. Upon high-fat diet feeding, endothelial cell FoxO1-deficient mice exhibited even greater vascular remodeling in the visceral adipose depot, which was paralleled with a healthier adipose tissue expansion, higher glucose tolerance and lower fasting glycemia concomitant with enhanced lactate levels. Mechanistically, FoxO1 depletion increased endothelial proliferative and glycolytic capacities by upregulating the expression of glycolytic markers, which may account for the improvements at the tissue level ultimately impacting whole-body glucose metabolism. Altogether, these findings reveal the pivotal role of FoxO1 in controlling endothelial metabolic and angiogenic adaptations in response to high-fat diet and a contribution of the endothelium to whole-body energy homeostasis.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39023</link>
	<content:encoded>Subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) accumulates during infection due to incomplete degradation of viral genomes and interacts with cellular proteins to promote infection. Here we identify host proteins that bind the Zika virus (ZIKV) sfRNA. We identified fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) as a ZIKV sfRNA-binding protein and confirmed this interaction in cultured cells and mouse testes. Depletion of FMRP elevated viral translation and enhanced ZIKV infection, indicating that FMRP is a ZIKV restriction factor. We further observed that an attenuated ZIKV strain compromised for sfRNA production was disproportionately stimulated by FMRP knockdown, suggesting that ZIKV sfRNA antagonizes FMRP activity. Importantly, ZIKV infection and expression of ZIKV sfRNA upregulated endogenous FMRP target genes in cell culture and ZIKV-infected mice. Together, our observations identify FMRP as a ZIKV restriction factor whose activity is antagonized by the sfRNA. Interaction between ZIKV and FMRP has significant implications for the pathogenesis of ZIKV infections.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Exenatide reverts the high-fat-diet-induced impairment of BDNF signaling and inflammatory response in an animal model of Alzheimer\'s disease</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/487629v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: preclinical, clinical, and epidemiological evidence support the notion that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial condition in which, along with {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) and tau-related pathology, the synergistic activity of genetic, environmental, vascular, metabolic, and inflammatory factors promote the onset and progression of the disease. Epidemiological evidence indicate that glucose intolerance, deficits in insulin secretion or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) participate in increasing the risk of developing cognitive impairment or dementia. A pivotal role in the process is played by insulin as the hormone critically regulates brain functioning. GLP-1, the glucagon-like peptide 1, facilitates insulin signaling, regulates glucose homeostasis, and modulates synaptic plasticity. Exenatide is a GLP-1R agonist, characterized by an extended half-life, employed in T2DM. However, exenatide has also been shown to affect the signaling of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synaptic plasticity, and cognitive performances in animal models of brain aging and neurodegeneration. Methods: In this study, we tested whether exenatide exerts neuroprotection in a preclinical AD model set to mimic the clinical complexity of the human disease. To that aim, we investigated the effects of 3-month exenatide treatment in 3xTg-AD mice challenged for six months with a high-fat diet (HFD). Endpoints of the study were variations in systemic metabolism, insulin and neurotrophic signaling, neuroinflammation, levels of A{beta} and tau pathology as well as changes in cognitive performances. Findings and interpretation: results of the study indicate that exenatide reverts the adverse changes of BDNF signaling and the neuroinflammation status of 3xTg-AD mice undergoing HFD.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/487553v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Heightened neuronal plasticity expressed during early postnatal life has been thought to permanently decline once critical periods have ended. For example, monocular deprivation is able to shift ocular dominance in the mouse visual cortex during the first months of life, but this effect is lost later in life. However, various treatments such as the antidepressant fluoxetine can reactivate a critical period-like plasticity in the adult brain. When monocular deprivation is supplemented with chronic fluoxetine administration, a major shift in ocular dominance is produced after the critical period has ended. In the current study, we characterized the temporal patterns of fluoxetine-induced plasticity in the adult mouse visual cortex, using in vivo optical imaging. We found that artificially-induced plasticity in ocular dominance extended beyond the duration of the naturally occurring critical period, and continued as long as fluoxetine was administered. However, this fluoxetine-induced plasticity period ended as soon as the drug was not given. Taken together, our data highlights how a combination of pharmacological treatment and environmental change could be used to improve strategies in antidepressant therapy in humans.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/487538v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs in 1.7 million people annually and many patients go on to develop persistent disorders including post-traumatic headache (PTH). PTH is considered chronic if it continues past 3 months. In this study we aimed to identify changes in cerebral grey matter volume (GMV) associated with PTH in mild TBI patients. Methods: 50 mTBI patients (31 Non-PTH; 19 PTH) underwent MRI scans: within 10 days post-injury, 1 month, 6 months and 18 months. PTH was assessed at visit 4 by a post-TBI headache questionnaire. Healthy controls (n=21) were scanned twice 6 months apart. Results: Compared to non-PTH, PTH patients had decreased GMV across two large clusters described as the right anterior-parietal (p=0.012) and left temporal-opercular (p=0.027). Compared to healthy controls non-PTH patients had decreased GMV in the left thalamus (p=0.047); PTH patients had decreased GMV in several extensive clusters: left temporal-opercular (p=0.003), temporal-parietal (p=0.041), superior frontal gyrus (p=0.008) and right middle frontal/superior frontal gyrus (0.004) and anterior-parietal (p=0.003). Conclusion: Differences between PTH and non-PTH patients were most striking at early time points. These early changes may be associated with an increased risk of PTH. Patients with these changes should be monitored for chronic PTH.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) to modulate motor network excitability is highly variable. The dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) may be a promising alternative target, as it provides high-level control of motor behavior using multiple pathways, including one independent of M1 and one with direct, influencing connections to M1. We differentially targeted these two close brain regions (M1, PMd) using a new high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) system with concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging. PMd HD-tDCS led to more reliable changes in both cortical excitability and motor network complexity, measured by multiscale entropy, than M1 HD-tDCS or sham. PMd responsiveness was also positively correlated with the strength of the corticospinal tract from PMd. Additionally, this method revealed high anatomical variability in individual M1 and PMd localizations using canonical methods. Altogether, these results provide new considerations for improving tDCS effects on motor network modulation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/487405v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>High levels of the amyloid-beta (A{beta}) peptide have been shown to disrupt neuronal function and induce hyperexcitability but it is unclear what effects A{beta}-associated hyperexcitability may have on tauopathy pathogenesis or propagation in vivo. Using a novel transgenic mouse line to model the impact of hAPP/A{beta} accumulation on tauopathy in the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal (EC-HIPP) network, we demonstrate that hAPP aggravates EC tau aggregation and accelerates pathological tau spread into the hippocampus. In vivo recordings revealed a strong role for hAPP/A{beta}, but not tau, in the emergence of EC neuronal hyperactivity and impaired theta rhythmicity. Chemogenetic attenuation of A{beta}-associated hyperactivity led to reduced hAPP/A{beta} accumulation and reduction of pathological tau in downstream hippocampus. These data strongly support the hypothesis that in Alzheimers disease (AD), A{beta}-associated hyperactivity accelerates the progression of pathological tau along vulnerable neuronal circuits, and demonstrates the utility of chronic, neuromodulatory approaches in ameliorating AD pathology in vivo.</content:encoded>

Deviant and standard tones differed in four physical dimensions: intensity, frequency, location and time. Auditory responses were found in the short and long gyri, and the anterior, superior, and inferior segments of the circular sulcus of the insular cortex, but only a subset of electrodes in the inferior segment showed deviance detection responses, i.e. a greater and later response to deviants relative to standards. Altogether, our results indicate that the human insula is engaged during auditory deviance detection.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/487108v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Genetic risk is thought to drive phenotypic variation on a spectrum of schizophrenia-like social and cognitive personality traits; but the intermediate phenotype of brain structural variation that mechanistically links sequence variation to schizotypal experience and behavior is unclear. We assessed schizotypy through a self-reported questionnaire, and measured magnetization transfer (MT), as a putative MRI marker of intra-cortical myelination, in 68 brain regions, in 248 healthy young people (aged 14-25 years). We found that magnetization was positively correlated with schizotypy scores in bilateral regions of posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (FDR-corrected P &amp;lt; 0.05). Meta-analysis of prior normative functional MRI data indicated that this area of schizotypy-related magnetization is specialized for memory and social cognitive functions that are impaired in schizophrenia. Using prior data from case-control studies of human brain gene transcription post mortem, we found that schizotypy-related magnetization was significantly correlated with transcriptional dysregulation in schizophrenia. The proteins coded by genes that were both positively weighted on schizotypy-related magnetization and significantly down-regulated in schizophrenia formed a dense, complex network of interactions for neuronal signaling. We conclude that intra-cortical magnetization - putatively a marker of myelinated neurons - is a plausible brain phenotype of schizotypy and represents some genetic risks for schizophrenia.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Brain-computer interfaces have been largely developed to allow communication, control, and neurofeedback in human beings. Despite their great potential, BCIs perform inconsistently across individuals. Moreover, the neural processes activated by training that enable humans to achieve good control remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that BCI skill acquisition is paralleled by a progressive reinforcement of task-related activity and by the reduction of connectivity between regions beyond those primarily targeted during the experiments. Notably, these patterns of activity and connectivity reflect growing automaticity and predict future BCI performance. Altogether, our findings provide new insights in the neural mechanisms underlying BCI learning, which have implications for the use of this technology in a broad range of real-life applications.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/486910v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective: To investigate the use of muscle MRI for the differential diagnosis and as a disease progression biomarker for two major forms of motor neuron disorders, spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Methods: We applied quantitative 3-point Dixon and semi-quantitative T1-weighted and STIR imaging to bulbar and lower limb muscles and performed clinical and functional assessments in ALS (n=21) and SBMA (n=21) patients, alongside healthy controls (n=16). Acquired images were analyzed for the presence of fat infiltration or edema as well as specific patterns of muscle involvement. Quantitative MRI measurements were correlated with clinical parameters of disease severity in ALS and SBMA. Results: Quantitative imaging revealed significant fat infiltration in bulbar (p&amp;lt;0.001) and limb muscles in SBMA compared to controls (thigh: p&amp;lt;0.001; calf: p=0.001), identifying a characteristic pattern of muscle involvement. In ALS, semi-quantitative STIR imaging detected marked hyperintensities in lower limb muscles, distinguishing ALS from SBMA and controls. Lastly, MRI measurements correlated significantly with clinical scales of disease severity in both ALS and SBMA. Conclusions: Our findings show that muscle MRI differentiates between SBMA and ALS and correlates with disease severity, supporting its use as a diagnostic tool and biomarker for disease progression. This highlights the clinical utility of muscle MRI in motor neuron disorders and contributes to establish objective outcome measures, which is crucial for the development of new drugs.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Visual perception is the ability to interpret the surrounding environment. A hypothetical ventral stream visual pathway explains how we perceive objects with respect to spatial orientation. The ventral stream fibers extend between Visual cortex to Inferior temporal gyrus. The previous studies have failed to prove any indications on the structural connectivity of this pathway. This study is designed to trace the existence of neural structural connectivity between Visual cortex with Inferior temporal gyrus using Diffusion Tensor Imaging Tractography, which aims to correlate its functional importance with visual object perception. The observational analysis used thirty two healthy adults, ultrahigh b-value and diffusion MRI datasets from an Open access research platform. The datasets range from both sexes, between 20 to 49 years, with mean age of 30.4 years. The confirmatory observational analysis process includes datasets acquisition, pre-processing, processing, reconstruction, fiber tractography and analysis using software tools. All the datasets confirmed the fibre structural extension between, Visual cortex to Inferior temporal gyrus in both the sexes may responsible for the visual perception of objects. This new fiber connectivity evidence justifies the structural relevance of visual perception impairments, such as visual object agnosia.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Myeloid cell and transcriptome signatures associated with inflammation resolution in a model of self-limiting acute brain inflammation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/486589v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Inflammation contributes to tissue repair and restoration of function after infection or injury. However, some forms of inflammation can cause tissue damage and disease, particularly if inappropriately activated, excessive, or not resolved adequately. The mechanisms that prevent excessive or chronic inflammation are therefore important to understand. This is particularly important in the central nervous system where some effects of inflammation can have particularly harmful consequences, including irreversible damage. An increasing number of neurological disorders, both acute and chronic, and their complications are associated with aberrant neuroinflammatory activity. Here we describe a model of self-limiting acute brain inflammation optimised to study mechanisms underlying inflammation resolution. Inflammation was induced by intracerebral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the temporal profile of key cellular and molecular changes were defined during the progression of the inflammatory response. The kinetics of accumulation and loss of neutrophils in the brain enabled well demarcated phases of inflammation to be operatively defined, including induction and resolution phases. Microglial reactivity and accumulation of monocyte-derived macrophages were maximal at the onset of and during the resolution phase. We profiled the transcriptome-wide gene expression changes at representative induction and resolution timepoints and used gene coexpression network analysis to identify gene clusters. This revealed a distinct cluster of genes associated with inflammation resolution that were induced selectively or maximally during this phase and indicated an active programming of gene expression that may drive resolution as has been described in other tissues. Induction of gene networks involved in lysosomal function, lipid metabolism and a comparative switch to MHC-II antigen presentation (relative to MHC-I during induction) were prominent during the resolution phase. The restoration and/or further induction of microglial homeostatic signature genes was notable during the resolution phase. We propose the current model as a tractable reductionist system to complement more complex models for further understanding how inflammation resolution in the brain is regulated and as a platform for in vivo testing/screening of candidate resolution-modifying interventions. Our data highlight how resolution involves active cellular and transcriptome reprogramming and identify candidate gene networks associated with resolution-phase adaptations that warrant further study.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/486480v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>When consumed with foods, mint, mustard and chili peppers generate pronounced oral thermosensations. Here we recorded responses in mouse trigeminal ganglion neurons to investigate interactions between thermal sensing and the active ingredients of these plants--menthol, allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), and capsaicin, respectively--at concentrations found in foods and commercial hygiene products. We carried out in vivo confocal calcium imaging of trigeminal ganglia in which neurons express GCaMP3 or GCAMP6s and recorded their responses to oral stimulation with thermal and the above chemesthetic stimuli. In the V3 (oral sensory) region of the ganglion, thermoreceptive neurons accounted for ~10% of imaged neurons. We categorized them into 3 distinct classes: cool-responsive and warm-responsive thermosensors, and nociceptors (responsive only to temperatures [≥]43-45o). Menthol, AITC, and capsaicin also elicited robust calcium responses that differed markedly in their latencies and durations. Most of the neurons that responded to these chemesthetic stimuli were also thermosensitive. Capsaicin and AITC increased the numbers of warm-responding neurons and shifted the nociceptor threshold to lower temperatures. Menthol attenuated the responses in all classes of thermoreceptors. Our data show that while individual neurons may respond to a narrow temperature range (or even bimodally), taken collectively, the population is able to report on graded changes of temperature. Our findings also substantiate an explanation for the thermal sensations experienced when one consumes pungent spices or mint.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows through the brain, transporting chemical signals and removing waste. CSF production in the brain is balanced by a constant outflow of CSF, the anatomical basis of which is poorly understood. Here we characterized the anatomy and physiological function of the CSF outflow pathway along the olfactory sensory nerves through the cribriform plate, and into the nasal epithelia. Chemical ablation of olfactory sensory nerves greatly reduced outflow of CSF through the cribriform plate. The reduction in CSF outflow did not cause an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), consistent with an alteration in the pattern of CSF drainage or production. Our results suggest that damage to olfactory sensory neurons (such as from air pollution) could contribute to altered CSF turnover and flow, providing a potential mechanism for neurological diseases.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/485888v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Stress profoundly impacts the brain and increases the risk of developing a psychiatric disorder. The brain's response to stress is mediated by a number of pathways that affect gene expression and protein function throughout the cell. Understanding how stress achieves such dramatic effects on the brain requires an understanding of the brain's stress response pathways. The majority of studies focused on molecular changes have employed repeated or chronic stress paradigms to assess the long-term consequences of stress and have not taken an integrative genomic and/or proteomic approach. Here, we determined the lasting impact of a single stressful event (restraint) on the broad molecular profile of the basolateral amygdala complex (BLC), a key brain region mediating emotion, memory and stress. Molecular profiling performed thirty days post-restraint consisted of small RNA sequencing, RNA sequencing and quantitative mass spectrometry and identified long-lasting changes in microRNA (miRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA) and proteins. Alignment of the three datasets further delineated the regulation of stress-specific pathways which were validated by qPCR and Western Blot analysis. From this analysis, mir-29a-5p was identified as a putative regulator of stress-induced adaptations in the BLC. Further, a number of predicted mir-29a-5p targets are regulated at the mRNA and protein level. The concerted and long-lasting disruption of multiple molecular pathways in the amygdala by a single stress event is expected to be sufficient to alter behavioral responses to a wide array of future experiences, including exposure to additional stressors.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/483487v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Human brain has developed mechanisms to efficiently decode sensory information according to perceptual categories of high prevalence in the environment, such as faces, symbols, objects. Neural activity produced within localized brain networks has been associated with the process that integrates both sensory bottom-up and cognitive top-down information processing. Yet, how specifically the different types and components of neural responses reflect the local networks' selectivity for categorical information processing is still unknown. By mimicking the decoding of the sensory information with machine learning we can obtain accurate artificial decoding models. Having the artificial system functionally on par with the biological one we can analyze the mechanics of the artificial system to gain insights into the inner workings of its biological counterpart. In this work we train a Random Forest classification model to decode eight perceptual categories from visual stimuli given a broad spectrum of human intracranial signals 4-150 Hz obtained during a visual perception task, and analyze which of the spectral features the algorithm deemed relevant to the perceptual decoding. We show that network selectivity for a single or multiple categories in sensory and non-sensory cortices is related to specific patterns of power increases and decreases in both low 4-50 Hz and high 50-150 Hz frequency bands. We demonstrate that the locations and patterns of activity that are identified by the algorithm not only coincide with the known spectro-spatial signatures, but extend our knowledge by uncovering additional spectral signatures describing neural mechanisms of visual category perception in human brain.</content:encoded>

There is growing evidence that population-level brain activity is often organized into propagating waves that are structured in both space and time. Such spatiotemporal patterns have been linked to brain function and observed across multiple recording methodologies and scales. The ability to detect and analyze these patterns is thus essential for understanding the working mechanisms of neural circuits. Here we present a mathematical and computational framework for the identification and analysis of multiple classes of wave patterns in neural population-level recordings. By drawing a conceptual link between spatiotemporal patterns found in the brain and coherent structures such as vortices found in turbulent flows, we introduce velocity vector fields to characterize neural population activity. These vector fields are calculated for both phase and amplitude of oscillatory neural signals by adapting optical flow estimation methods from the field of computer vision. Based on these velocity vector fields, we then introduce order parameters and critical point analysis to detect and characterize a diverse range of propagating wave patterns, including planar waves, sources, sinks, spiral waves, and saddle patterns. We also introduce a novel vector field decomposition method that extracts the dominant spatiotemporal structures in a recording. This enables neural data to be represented by the activity of a small number of independent spatiotemporal modes, providing an alternative to existing dimensionality reduction techniques which separate space and time components. We demonstrate the capabilities of the framework and toolbox with simulated data, local field potentials from marmoset visual cortex and optical voltage recordings from whole mouse cortex, and we show that pattern dynamics are non-random and are modulated by the presence of visual stimuli. These methods are implemented in a MATLAB toolbox, which is freely available under an open-source licensing agreement.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_y4dI44JGZA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Many microbes are studied by examining colony morphology via two-dimensional top-down images. The quantification of such images typically requires each pixel to be labelled as belonging to either the colony or background, producing a binary image. While this may be achieved manually for a single colony, this process is infeasible for large datasets containing thousands of images. The software Tool for Analysis of the Morphology of Microbial Colonies (TAMMiCol) has been developed to efficiently and automatically convert colony images to binary. TAMMiCol exploits the structure of the images to choose a thresholding tolerance and produce a binary image of the colony. The images produced are shown to compare favourably with images processed manually, while TAMMiCol is shown to outperform standard segmentation methods. Multiple images may be imported together for batch processing, while the binary data may be exported as a CSV or MATLAB MAT file for quantification, or analysed using statistics built into the software. Using the in-built statistics, it is found that images produced by TAMMiCol yield values close to those computed from binary images processed manually. Analysis of a new large dataset using TAMMiCol shows that colonies of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; reach a maximum level of filamentous growth once the concentration of ammonium sulfate is reduced to 200 μM. TAMMiCol is accessed through a graphical user interface, making it easy to use for those without specialist knowledge of image processing, statistical methods or coding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aOVC22Kfiw0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Three-dimensional microscopy is increasingly prevalent in biology due to the development of techniques such as multiphoton, spinning disk confocal, and light sheet fluorescence microscopies. These methods enable unprecedented studies of life at the microscale, but bring with them larger and more complex datasets. New image processing techniques are therefore called for to analyze the resulting images in an accurate and efficient manner. Convolutional neural networks are becoming the standard for classification of objects within images due to their accuracy and generalizability compared to traditional techniques. Their application to data derived from 3D imaging, however, is relatively new and has mostly been in areas of magnetic resonance imaging and computer tomography. It remains unclear, for images of discrete cells in variable backgrounds as are commonly encountered in fluorescence microscopy, whether convolutional neural networks provide sufficient performance to warrant their adoption, especially given the challenges of human comprehension of their classification criteria and their requirements of large training datasets. We therefore applied a 3D convolutional neural network to distinguish bacteria and non-bacterial objects in 3D light sheet fluorescence microscopy images of larval zebrafish intestines. We find that the neural network is as accurate as human experts, outperforms random forest and support vector machine classifiers, and generalizes well to a different bacterial species through the use of transfer learning. We also discuss network design considerations, and describe the dependence of accuracy on dataset size and data augmentation. We provide source code, labeled data, and descriptions of our analysis pipeline to facilitate adoption of convolutional neural network analysis for three-dimensional microscopy data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yuhOvXjwIEI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The confined and crowded environment of developing brains imposes spatial constraints on neuronal cells that have evolved individual and collective strategies to optimize their growth. These include organizing neurons into populations extending their axons to common target territories. How individual axons interact with each other within such populations to optimize innervation is currently unclear and difficult to analyze experimentally &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we developed a stochastic model of 3D axon growth that takes into account spatial environmental constraints, physical interactions between neighboring axons, and branch formation. This general, predictive and robust model, when fed with parameters estimated on real neurons from the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; brain, enabled the study of the mechanistic principles underlying the growth of axonal populations. First, it provided a novel explanation for the diversity of growth and branching patterns observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; within populations of genetically identical neurons. Second, it uncovered that axon branching could be a strategy optimizing the overall growth of axons competing with others in contexts of high axonal density. The flexibility of this framework will make it possible to investigate the rules underlying axon growth and regeneration in the context of various neuronal populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z8xWedFl4Tk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We investigate spatiotemporal dynamics of human interphase chromosomes by employing a heteropolymer model that incorporates the information of human chromosomes inferred from Hi-C data. Despite considerable heterogeneities in the chromosome structures generated from our model, chromatins are organized into crumpled globules with space-filling (SF) statistics characterized by a single universal scaling exponent (&lt;i&gt;ν&lt;/i&gt; = 1/3), and this exponent alone can offer a quantitative account of experimentally observed, many different features of chromosome dynamics. The local chromosome structures, whose scale corresponds to that of topologically associated domains (∼ 0.1 − 1 Mb), display dynamics with a fast relaxation time (≲ 1 − 10 sec); in contrast, the long-range spatial reorganization of the entire chromatin (≳O ( 10 2 ) Mb) occurs on a much slower time scale (≳ hour), providing the dynamic basis of cell-to-cell variability and glass-like behavior of chromosomes. Biological activities, modeled using stronger isotropic white noises added to active loci, accelerate the relaxation dynamics of chromatin domains associated with the low frequency modes and induce phase segregation between the active and inactive loci. Surprisingly, however, they do not significantly change the dynamics at local scales from those obtained under passive conditions. Our study underscores the role of chain organization of chromosome in determining the spatiotemporal dynamics of chromatin loci.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bmoR37BPBlw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDRs) are prevalent in allosteric regulation. It was previously thought that intrinsic disorder is favorable for maximizing the allosteric coupling. Here, we propose a comprehensive ensemble model to compare the roles of both order-order transition and disorder-order transition in allosteric effect. It is revealed that the MWC pathway (order-order transition) has a higher probability than the EAM pathway (disorder-order transition) in allostery, suggesting a complicated role of IDPs/IDRs in regulatory proteins. In addition, an analytic formula for the maximal allosteric coupling response is obtained, which shows that too stable or too unstable state is unfavorable to endow allostery, and is thus helpful for rational design of allosteric drugs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n_64NmyYPwU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Experiments in cognitive neuroscience typically study a psychological process via controlled manipulations, reducing behavior to one of its components. Such reductionism can easily lead to paradigm-bound theories. Predictive models can generalize brain-mind associations to arbitrary new tasks and stimuli. We argue that they are needed to broaden theories beyond specific paradigms. Predicting behavior from neural activity can support robust reverse inference, isolating brain structures that support particular mental processes. The converse prediction enables modeling brain responses as a function of a complete description of the task, rather than building on oppositions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Spinal cord injury in rats disrupts the circadian system</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0328-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) perturbs many physiological systems. The circadian system helps maintain homeostasis throughout the body by synchronizing physiological and behavioural functions to predictable daily events. Whether disruption of these coordinated daily rhythms contributes to SCI-associated pathology remains under-studied. Here, we hypothesized that SCI in rats would dysregulate several prominent circadian outputs including glucocorticoids, core temperature, activity, neuroinflammation, and circadian gene networks. Female and male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to clinically relevant thoracic (T-) 9 moderate contusion SCI (or laminectomy sham surgery). Diurnal measures – including rhythms of plasma corticosterone (CORT), body temperature and activity (using small implanted transmitters), and intraspinal circadian and inflammatory gene expression – were studied prior to and post-surgery. SCI caused overall increases and disrupted rhythms of the major rodent glucocorticoid, CORT. Pre-surgery and sham rats displayed expected rhythms in body temperature and activity, whereas rats with SCI had blunted daily rhythms in body temperature and activity. In parallel, SCI disrupted intraspinal rhythms of circadian clock gene expression. Circadian clock genes can act as transcriptional regulators of inflammatory pathways. Indeed, SCI rats also showed dysregulated rhythms in inflammatory gene expression in both the epicenter and distal spinal cord. Our data show that moderate SCI in rats causes wide-ranging diurnal rhythm dysfunction, which is severe at acute time points, and gradually recovers over time. Normalizing post-SCI diurnal rhythms could enhance recovery of homeostasis and quality-of-life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Spinal cord injury (SCI) can cause physiologic dysfunction throughout the body. Internal physiologic function is typically synchronized with the environment through the circadian system. Despite the crucial roles of the spinal cord and the circadian system in optimizing whole-body function, it remains unclear whether SCI alters diurnal rhythms. Here, we hypothesized that SCI would disrupt key circadian output and feedback mechanisms. Moderate SCI in rats caused widespread disruption of diurnal measures – including glucocorticoids, body temperature, locomotor activity, and intraspinal clock and inflammatory gene expression. We identify the circadian system as a novel potential target for SCI therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Ovarian cycle stages modulate Alzheimer-related cognitive and brain network alterations in female mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0132-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) begins several decades before the onset of clinical symptoms, at a time when women may still undergo reproductive cycling. Whether ovarian functions alter substrates of AD pathogenesis is unknown. Here we show that ovarian cycles stages significantly modulate AD-related alterations in neural network patterns, cognitive impairments, and pathogenic protein production in the hAPP-J20 mouse model of AD. Female hAPP mice spent more time in estrogen-dominant cycle stages and these ovarian stages worsened AD-related network dysfunction and cognitive impairments. In contrast, progesterone-dominant stages and gonadectomy attenuated these AD-related deficits. Further studies revealed a direct role for estradiol in stimulating neural network excitability and susceptibility to seizures in hAPP mice. Understanding dynamic effects of the ovarian cycle on the female nervous system in disease, including AD, is of critical importance and may differ from effects on a healthy brain. The pattern of ovarian cycle effects on disease-related networks, cognition, and pathogenic protein expression may be relevant to young women at risk for AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is insidious and begins several decades before clinical symptoms. For women, this means that pathophysiological changes could occur in the brain during the reproductive life-stage – prior to the cessation of ovarian function. Whether ovarian functions alter substrates of AD pathogenesis is unknown. We show that ovarian cycles are altered in a mouse model of AD and that ovarian cycle stage contributes to AD-related network and cognitive impairments. Investigating network activity, cognition, seizures, and other manifestations of brain function across the reproductive cycle stages in cycling women could reveal differential patterns in the brain at risk for AD compared to normal aging – and potentially open the door for preventative therapies and early treatment in women at risk for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: High-Fidelity Imaging in Brain-Wide Structural Studies Using Light-Sheet Microscopy</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0124-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Light-sheet microscopy (LSM) has proven a useful tool in neuroscience to image whole brains with high frame rates at cellular resolution and, in combination with tissue clearing methods, is often employed to reconstruct the cyto-architecture over the intact mouse brain. Inherently to LSM, however, residual opaque objects, always present to some extent even in extremely well optically cleared samples, cause stripe artifacts, which, in the best case, severely affect image homogeneity and, in the worst case, completely obscure features of interest. Here, demonstrating two example applications in intact optically cleared mouse brains, we report how Bessel beams reduce streaking artifacts and produce high-fidelity structural data for the brain-wide morphology of neuronal and vascular networks. We found that a third of the imaged volume of the brain was affected by strong striated image intensity inhomogeneity and, furthermore, a significant amount of information content lost with Gaussian illumination was accessible when interrogated with Bessel beams. In conclusion, Bessel beams produce high-fidelity structural data of improved image homogeneity and might significantly relax demands placed on the automated tools to count, trace, or segment fluorescent features of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12642</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dementia and especially Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the most common causes
of cognitive decline in elderly people. A spread of the above mentioned mental
health problems in aging societies is causing a significant medical and
economic burden in many countries around the world. According to a recent World
Health Organization (WHO) report, it is approximated that currently, worldwide,
about 47 million people live with a dementia spectrum of neurocognitive
disorders. This number is expected to triple by 2050, which calls for possible
application of AI-based technologies to support an early screening for
preventive interventions and a subsequent mental wellbeing monitoring as well
as maintenance with so-called digital-pharma or beyond a pill therapeutical
approaches. This paper discusses our attempt and preliminary results of
brainwave (EEG) techniques to develop digital biomarkers for dementia progress
detection and monitoring. We present an information geometry-based
classification approach for automatic EEG-derived event related responses
(ERPs) discrimination of low versus high task-load auditory or tactile stimuli
recognition, of which amplitude and latency variabilities are similar to those
in dementia. The discussed approach is a step forward to develop AI, and
especially machine learning (ML) approaches, for the subsequent application to
mild-cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD diagnostics.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12496</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Similarities between the non-deterministic nature of quantum theory and the
unpredictable patterns of human cognition and decision making have been
observed and commented on many times since the invention of Quantum Mechanics
in the first part of the 20th century. Niels Bohr himself took note of the
parallels.[3] In fact, an entire field of study, Quantum Cognition, has been
borne from the study of this analogy. [3] However, many of the attempts to
model human behavior with quantum mechanics con ate the identity of a particle
with its own wavefunction, which is incorrect and invalidates the analogy. In
this paper, we seek to make explicit this error, make necessary corrections,
and then deepen the analogy. We do this by creating a Quantum Decision Theory
that directly parallels Richard Feynman's novel formulation of quantum
mechanics published in 1948 at Cornell University: Space-Time Approach to
Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics&quot;.

	<content:encoded>The attentional sampling hypothesis suggests that attention rhythmically enhances sensory processing when attending to a single (~8 Hz), or multiple (~4 Hz) objects. Here we investigated whether attention samples sensory representations that are not part of the conscious percept during binocular rivalry. When crossmodally cued toward a conscious image, subsequent changes in consciousness occurred at ~8 Hz, consistent with rates of undivided attentional sampling. However, when attention was cued toward the suppressed image, changes in consciousness slowed to ~3.5 Hz, indicating the division of attention away from the conscious visual image. In the electroencephalogram, we found that at attentional sampling frequencies, the strength of inter-trial phase-coherence over fronto-temporal and parieto-occipital regions correlated with changes in perception. When cues were not task-relevant, these effects disappeared, confirming that perceptual changes were dependent upon the allocation of attention, and that attention can flexibly sample away from a conscious image in a task-dependent manner.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39981</link>
	<content:encoded>The neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) affects the cerebellum and inferior olive, though previous research has focused primarily on the cerebellum. As a result, it is unknown what molecular alterations are present in the inferior olive, and whether these changes are found in other affected tissues. This study addresses these questions for the first time using two different SCA1 mouse models. We found that differentially regulated genes in the inferior olive segregated into several biological pathways. Comparison of the inferior olive and cerebellum demonstrates that vulnerable tissues in SCA1 are not uniform in their gene expression changes, and express largely discrete but some commonly enriched biological pathways. Importantly, we also found that brain region-specific differences occur early in disease initiation and progression, and they are shared across the two mouse models of SCA1. This suggests different mechanisms of degeneration at work in the inferior olive and cerebellum.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Replication dependent (RD) core histone mRNA produced during S-phase is the only known protein-coding mRNA presenting a 3' stem-loop instead of the otherwise universal polyA tail. A metallo β-lactamase (MBL) fold enzyme, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 73 (CPSF73), is proposed to be the sole endonuclease responsible for 3' end processing of both mRNA classes. We report cellular, genetic, biochemical, substrate selectivity, and crystallographic studies providing evidence that an additional endoribonuclease, MBL domain containing protein 1 (MBLAC1), is selective for 3' processing of RD histone pre-mRNA during the S-phase of the cell cycle. Depletion of MBLAC1 in cells significantly affects cell cycle progression thus identifying MBLAC1 as a new type of S-phase specific cancer target.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/27706</link>
	<content:encoded>The expression of the transcription factor &lt;i&gt;SOX4&lt;/i&gt; is increased in many human cancers, however, the pro-oncogenic capacity of SOX4 can vary greatly depending on the type of tumor. Both the contextual nature and the mechanisms underlying the pro-oncogenic SOX4 response remain unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that in mammary tumorigenesis, the SOX4 transcriptional network is dictated by the epigenome and is enriched for pro-angiogenic processes. We show that SOX4 directly regulates endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression and can thereby promote tumor-induced angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, in breast tumors, SOX4 expression correlates with blood vessel density and size, and predicts poor-prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Our data provide novel mechanistic insights into context-dependent SOX4 target gene selection, and uncover a novel pro-oncogenic role for this transcription factor in promoting tumor-induced angiogenesis. These findings establish a key role for SOX4 in promoting metastasis through exploiting diverse pro-tumorigenic pathways.</content:encoded>

In the present study, we identify the effect of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; on cortical thickness and surface area in children with ADHD and children with typically developing (TD) using a machine learning approach. In a sample of 39 children with ADHD and 34 age- and IQ-matched TD children, we found that cortical thickness and surface area differences were predominantly observed in the frontal cortex. Furthermore, a path analysis revealed that a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; genotype affected abnormal development of the frontal cortex in terms of both cortical thickness and surface area and was associated with working memory changes in children with ADHD. Our study confirms that the role of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; in ADHD is not restricted to the development of behavior but may also affect the cortical thickness and surface area. Thus, our findings may help to improve the understanding of the neuroanatomic basis for the relationship between the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/span&gt; genotype and ADHD pathogenesis.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: How pupil responses track value-based decision-making during and after reinforcement learning</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/5hv21urPU1s/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Joanne C. Van Slooten, Sara Jahfari, Tomas Knapen, Jan Theeuwes&lt;/p&gt;

Cognition can reveal itself in the pupil, as latent cognitive processes map onto specific pupil responses. For instance, the pupil dilates when we make decisions and these pupil size fluctuations reflect decision-making computations during and after a choice. Surprisingly little is known, however, about how pupil responses relate to decisions driven by the learned value of stimuli. This understanding is important, as most real-life decisions are guided by the outcomes of earlier choices. The goal of this study was to investigate which cognitive processes the pupil reflects during value-based decision-making. We used a reinforcement learning task to study pupil responses during value-based decisions and subsequent decision evaluations, employing computational modeling to quantitatively describe the underlying cognitive processes. We found that the pupil closely tracks reinforcement learning processes independently across participants and across trials. Prior to choice, the pupil dilated as a function of trial-by-trial fluctuations in value beliefs about the to-be chosen option and predicted an individual’s tendency to exploit high value options. After feedback a biphasic pupil response was observed, the amplitude of which correlated with participants’ learning rates. Furthermore, across trials, early feedback-related dilation scaled with value uncertainty, whereas later constriction scaled with signed reward prediction errors. These findings show that pupil size fluctuations can provide detailed information about the computations underlying value-based decisions and the subsequent updating of value beliefs. As these processes are affected in a host of psychiatric disorders, our results indicate that pupillometry can be used as an accessible tool to non-invasively study the processes underlying ongoing reinforcement learning in the clinic.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5hv21urPU1s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cardiac electrical alternans (CEA), manifested as T-wave alternans in ECG, is a clinical biomarker for predicting cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. However, the mechanism underlying the spontaneous transition from CEA to arrhythmias remains incompletely elucidated. In this study, multiscale rabbit ventricular models were used to study the transition and a potential role of &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; in perpetuating such a transition. It was shown CEA evolved into either concordant or discordant action potential (AP) conduction alternans in a homogeneous one-dimensional tissue model, depending on tissue AP duration and conduction velocity (CV) restitution properties. Discordant alternans was able to cause conduction failure in the model, which was promoted by impaired sodium channel with either a reduced or increased channel current. In a two-dimensional homogeneous tissue model, a combined effect of rate- and curvature-dependent CV broke-up alternating wavefronts at localised points, facilitating a spontaneous transition from CEA to re-entry. Tissue inhomogeneity or anisotropy further promoted break-up of re-entry, leading to multiple wavelets. Similar observations have also been seen in human atrial cellular and tissue models. In conclusion, our results identify a mechanism by which CEA spontaneously evolves into re-entry without a requirement for premature ventricular complexes or pre-existing tissue heterogeneities, and demonstrated the important pro-arrhythmic role of impaired sodium channel activity. These findings are model-independent and have potential human relevance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ulraRupDlYg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Toxicity is an important factor in failed drug development, and its efficient identification and prediction is a major challenge in drug discovery. We have explored the potential of microscopy images of fluorescently labeled nuclei for the prediction of toxicity based on nucleus pattern recognition. Deep learning algorithms obtain abstract representations of images through an automated process, allowing them to efficiently classify complex patterns, and have become the state-of-the art in machine learning for computer vision. Here, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) were trained to predict toxicity from images of DAPI-stained cells pre-treated with a set of drugs with differing toxicity mechanisms. Different cropping strategies were used for training CNN models, the nuclei-cropping-based Tox_CNN model outperformed other models classifying cells according to health status. Tox_CNN allowed automated extraction of feature maps that clustered compounds according to mechanism of action. Moreover, fully automated region-based CNNs (RCNN) were implemented to detect and classify nuclei, providing per-cell toxicity prediction from raw screening images. We validated both Tox_(R)CNN models for detection of pre-lethal toxicity from nuclei images, which proved to be more sensitive and have broader specificity than established toxicity readouts. These models predicted toxicity of drugs with mechanisms of action other than those they had been trained for and were successfully transferred to other cell assays. The Tox_(R)CNN models thus provide robust, sensitive, and cost-effective tools for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; screening of drug-induced toxicity. These models can be adopted for compound prioritization in drug screening campaigns, and could thereby increase the efficiency of drug discovery.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rKs-Qld8OJg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Levodopa‐induced dyskinesia is a common complication in Parkinson disease. Pathogenic mechanisms include phasic stimulation of dopamine receptors, nonphysiological levodopa‐to‐dopamine conversion in serotonergic neurons, hyperactivity of corticostriatal glutamatergic transmission, and overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dopamine‐releasing axons. Delay in initiating levodopa is no longer recommended, as dyskinesia development is a function of disease duration rather than cumulative levodopa exposure. We review current and in‐development treatments for peak‐dose dyskinesia but suggest that improvements in levodopa delivery alone may reduce its future prevalence.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25365?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical gray matter (GM) pathology, involving demyelination and neurodegeneration, associated with meningeal inflammation, could be important in determining disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, we need to know more about how cortical demyelination, neurodegeneration, and meningeal inflammation contribute to pathology at early stages of MS to better predict long‐term outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue blocks from short disease duration MS (n = 12, median disease duration = 2 years), progressive MS (n = 21, disease duration = 25 years), non‐diseased controls (n = 11), and other neurological inflammatory disease controls (n = 6) were quantitatively analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and in situ hybridization.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical GM demyelination was extensive in some cases of acute MS (range = 1–48% of total cortical GM), and subpial lesions were the most common type (62%). The numbers of activated (CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) microglia/macrophages were increased in cases with subpial lesions, and the density of neurons was significantly reduced in acute MS normal appearing and lesion GM, compared to controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.005). Significant meningeal inflammation and lymphoid‐like structures were seen in 4 of 12 acute MS cases. The extent of meningeal inflammation correlated with microglial/macrophage activation (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), but not the area of cortical demyelination, reflecting the finding that lymphoid‐like structures were seen adjacent to GM lesions as well as areas of partially demyelinated/remyelinated, cortical GM.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate that cortical demyelination, neuronal loss, and meningeal inflammation are notable pathological hallmarks of acute MS and support the need to identify early biomarkers of this pathology to better predict outcome. Ann Neurol 2018&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 5% of cerebral small vessel diseases are hereditary, which include &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders. &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt; encode type IV collagen α1/2 chains in the basement membranes of cerebral vessels. &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt; mutations impair the secretion of collagen to the extracellular matrix, thereby resulting in vessel fragility. The diagnostic yield for &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt; variants is around 20 to 30%, suggesting other mutated genes might be associated with this disease. This study aimed to identify novel genes that cause &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole exome sequencing was performed in 2 families with suspected &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders. We validated the role of &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; variants by constructing a 3‐dimensional structural model, evaluating collagen β (1‐O) galactosyltransferase 1 (ColGalT1) protein expression and ColGalT activity by Western blotting and collagen galactosyltransferase assays, and performing in vitro RNA interference and rescue experiments.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exome sequencing demonstrated biallelic variants in &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; encoding ColGalT1, which was involved in the post‐translational modification of type IV collagen in 2 unrelated patients: c.452 T &amp;gt; G (p.Leu151Arg) and c.1096delG (p.Glu366Argfs*15) in Patient 1, and c.460G &amp;gt; C (p.Ala154Pro) and c.1129G &amp;gt; C (p.Gly377Arg) in Patient 2. Three‐dimensional model analysis suggested that p.Leu151Arg and p.Ala154Pro destabilized protein folding, which impaired enzymatic activity. ColGalT1 protein expression and ColGalT activity in Patient 1 were undetectable. RNA interference studies demonstrated that reduced ColGalT1 altered COL4A1 secretion, and rescue experiments showed that mutant &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; insufficiently restored COL4A1 production in cells compared with wild type.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biallelic &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; variants cause cerebral small vessel abnormalities through a common molecular pathogenesis with &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders. Ann Neurol 2018&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Vagus nerve stimulation modulates the cranial trigeminal autonomic reflex</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25366?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trigeminal autonomic reflex plays an important role in primary headache syndromes. Noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) may be an effective modulator of this reflex.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐two healthy volunteers underwent kinetic oscillation stimulation (KOS) of the left nostril as a reliable trigger of the trigeminal autonomic reflex. Previous to KOS, left cervical nVNS, sham simulation, or no stimulation was applied. Lacrimation was quantified using the standardized Schirmer ll test.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment with cervical nVNS significantly reduced lacrimation between no stimulation and nVNS on the ipsilateral side (minute 5: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.026, η&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39–18.04; no stimulation: minute 5, 14.4 ± 9.3 mm; nVNS: minute 5, 4.7 ± 8.6 mm, mean ± standard deviation) as well as between sham stimulation and nVNS (minute 5: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.030, η&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.85, 95% CI = 1.04–17.24; sham: minute 5, 13.9 ± 6.4 mm). On the contralateral side, no significant increase between baseline and KOS was observed for nVNS (minute 5: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.614, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.12, 95% CI = −7.09 to 4.31; minute 5, 1.4 ± 11.5 mm) compared to both sham stimulation (minute 5: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.023, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.57, 95% CI = −11.46 to −0.96; minute 5, 6.2 ± 10.9 mm) and no stimulation (minute 5: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.030, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.62, 95% CI = −13.45 to −0.81; minute 5, 7.1 ± 11.4 mm).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cervical nVNS resulted in a robust bilateral reduction of provoked lacrimation. This effect could be mediated either by direct bilateral activation of structures such as the nucleus of the solitary tract or by a top‐down modulation via the hypothalamus.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12314</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To understand how neural networks process information, it is important to
investigate how neural network dynamics varies with respect to different
stimuli. One challenging task is to design efficient statistical approaches to
analyze multiple spike train data obtained from a short recording time. Based
on the development of high-dimensional statistical methods, it is able to deal
with data whose dimension is much larger than the sample size. However, these
methods often require statistically independent samples to start with, while
neural data are correlated over consecutive sampling time bins. We develop an
approach to pretreat neural data to become independent samples over time by
transferring the correlation of dynamics for each neuron in different sampling
time bins into the correlation of dynamics among different dimensions within
each sampling time bin. We verify the method using simulation data generated
from Integrate-and-fire neuron network models and a large-scale network model
of primary visual cortex within a short time, e.g., a few seconds. Our method
may offer experimenters to use the advantage of the development of statistical
methods to analyze high-dimensional neural data.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The normative interplay between circadian and reward function is well
understood in animal models, and is of growing interest as an aetiological
explanation in psychopathologies. While circadian modulation of reward function
has been demonstrated in human behavioural data, a key gap is lack information
at the neural level. In 2017, we published results of a first step in
addressing this lacuna, demonstrating a diurnal rhythm in fMRI-measured reward
activation. In 2018, Steel et al wrote a constructive critique of our findings,
and the aim of this paper is to outline how future research could improve on
our first proof-of-concept study. Key challenges include addressing divergent
and convergent validity (by addressing non-reward neural variation, and testing
for absence of variation in threat-related pathways), preregistration and power
analysis to protect against false positives, wider range of fMRI methods (to
directly test our post-hoc hypothesis of some form of reward prediction error,
and multiple phases of reward), the parallel collection of behavioural data
(particularly self-reported positive affect, and actigraphically measured
activity) to illuminate the nature of the reward activation across the day, and
some attempt to parse out circadian versus homeostatic/masking influences on
any observed diurnal rhythm in neural reward activation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: ImageNet-trained CNNs are biased towards texture; increasing shape bias improves accuracy and robustness. (arXiv:1811.12231v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly thought to recognise
objects by learning increasingly complex representations of object shapes. Some
recent studies hint to a more important role of image textures. We here put
these conflicting hypotheses to a quantitative test by evaluating CNNs and
human observers on images with a texture-shape cue conflict. We show that
ImageNet-trained CNNs are strongly biased towards recognising textures rather
than shapes, which is in stark contrast to human behavioural evidence and
reveals fundamentally different classification strategies. We then demonstrate
that the same standard architecture (ResNet-50) that learns a texture-based
representation on ImageNet is able to learn a shape-based representation
instead when trained on &quot;Stylized-ImageNet&quot;, a stylized version of ImageNet.
This provides a much better fit for human behavioural performance in our
well-controlled psychophysical lab setting (nine experiments totalling 48,560
psychophysical trials across 97 observers) and comes with a number of
unexpected emergent benefits such as improved object detection performance and
previously unseen robustness towards a wide range of image distortions,
highlighting advantages of a shape-based representation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12153</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We study the statistical properties of the stationary firing-rate states of a
neural network model with quenched disorder. The model has arbitrary size,
discrete-time evolution equations and binary firing rates, while the topology
and the strength of the synaptic connections are randomly generated from known,
generally arbitrary, probability distributions. We derived semi-analytical
expressions of the occurrence probability of the stationary states and the mean
multistability diagram of the model, in terms of the distribution of the
synaptic connections and of the external stimuli to the network. Our
calculations rely on the probability distribution of the bifurcation points of
the stationary states with respect to the external stimuli, which can be
calculated in terms of the permanent of special matrices, according to extreme
value theory. While our semi-analytical expressions are exact for any size of
the network and for any distribution of the synaptic connections, we also
specialized our calculations to the case of statistically-homogeneous
multi-population networks. In the specific case of this network topology, we
calculated analytically the permanent, obtaining a compact formula that
outperforms of several orders of magnitude the
Balasubramanian-Bax-Franklin-Glynn algorithm. To conclude, by applying the
Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem, we derived asymptotic expressions of the
stationary-state statistics of multi-population networks in the
large-network-size limit, in terms of the Gumbel (double exponential)
distribution. We also provide a Python implementation of our formulas and some
examples of the results generated by the code.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stochastic resonance is a non-linear phenomenon, in which the sensitivity of
signal detectors can be enhanced by adding random noise to the detector input.
Here, we demonstrate that noise can also improve the information flux in

motifs that the mutual information between successive network states can be
maximized by adding a suitable amount of noise to the neuron inputs. This
striking result suggests that noise in the brain may not be a problem that
needs to be suppressed, but indeed a resource that is dynamically regulated in
order to optimize information processing.

traditional goal of controlling prosthetic devices using brain signals to
combining neural decoding and encoding within a single neuroprosthetic device.
Such a device acts as a &quot;co-processor&quot; for the brain, with applications ranging
from inducing Hebbian plasticity for rehabilitation after brain injury to
reanimating paralyzed limbs and enhancing memory. We review recent progress in
simultaneous decoding and encoding for closed-loop control and plasticity

introduce a unifying framework for developing brain co-processors based on
artificial neural networks and deep learning. These &quot;neural co-processors&quot; can
be used to jointly optimize cost functions with the nervous system to achieve
desired behaviors ranging from targeted neuro-rehabilitation to augmentation of

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41301</link>
	<content:encoded>It is unclear how the two principal functions of the Golgi complex, processing and transport, are spatially organized. Studying such spatial organization by optical imaging is challenging, partially due to the dense packing of stochastically oriented Golgi stacks. Using super-resolution microscopy and markers such as Giantin, we developed a method to identify en face and side views of individual nocodazole-induced Golgi mini-stacks. Our imaging uncovered that Golgi enzymes preferentially localize to the cisternal interior, appearing as a central disk or inner-ring, whereas components of the trafficking machinery reside at the periphery of the stack, including the cisternal rim. Interestingly, conventional secretory cargos appeared at the cisternal interior during their intra-Golgi trafficking and transiently localized to the cisternal rim before exiting the Golgi. In contrast, bulky cargos were found only at the rim. Our study therefore directly demonstrates the spatial separation of processing and transport functions within the Golgi complex.</content:encoded>

To understand the determinants of MHC-I peptide immunogenicity in nascent tumors, we tested the ability of thousands of MHC-I ligands to cause tumor subclone rejection in immunocompetent mice by use of a new ‘PresentER’ antigen presentation platform. Surprisingly, we show that immunogenic tumor antigens do not lead to immune-mediated cell rejection when the fraction of cells bearing each antigen (‘clonal fraction’) is low. Moreover, the clonal fraction necessary to lead to rejection of immunogenic tumor subclones depends on the antigen. These data indicate that tumor neoantigen heterogeneity has an underappreciated impact on immune elimination of cancer cells and has implications for the design of immunotherapeutics such as cancer vaccines.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: A novel enhancer near the Pitx1 gene influences development and evolution of pelvic appendages in vertebrates</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38555</link>
	<content:encoded>Vertebrate pelvic reduction is a classic example of repeated evolution. Recurrent loss of pelvic appendages in sticklebacks has previously been linked to natural mutations in a pelvic enhancer that maps upstream of &lt;i&gt;Pitx1&lt;/i&gt;. The sequence of this upstream &lt;i&gt;PelA&lt;/i&gt; enhancer is not conserved to mammals, so we have surveyed a large region surrounding the mouse &lt;i&gt;Pitx1&lt;/i&gt; gene for other possible hind limb control sequences. Here we identify a new pelvic enhancer, &lt;i&gt;PelB&lt;/i&gt;, that maps downstream rather than upstream of &lt;i&gt;Pitx1. PelB&lt;/i&gt; drives expression in the posterior portion of the developing hind limb, and deleting the sequence from mice alters the size of several hind limb structures. &lt;i&gt;PelB&lt;/i&gt; sequences are broadly conserved from fish to mammals. A wild stickleback population lacking the pelvis has an insertion/deletion mutation that disrupts the structure and function of &lt;i&gt;PelB&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting that changes in this ancient enhancer contribute to evolutionary modification of pelvic appendages in nature.</content:encoded>

However, recently identified PD-linked genes, including DNAJC6 (auxilin), SYNJ1 (synaptojanin 1), and the PD risk gene SH3GL2 (endophilin A1), have also highlighted disruptions in synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE) as a significant contributor to disease pathogenesis. Additionally, the roles of other PD genes such as LRRK2, PRKN, and VPS35 in the regulation of SVE are beginning to emerge.</content:encoded>

The conformational dynamics of proteins is rarely used in methodologies used to predict the impact of genetic mutations due to the paucity of three-dimensional protein structures as compared to the vast number of available sequences. Until now a three-dimensional (3D) structure has been required to predict the conformational dynamics of a protein. We introduce an approach that estimates the conformational dynamics of a protein, without relying on structural information. This &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; approach utilizes coevolving residues identified from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using Potts models. These coevolving residues are used as contacts in a Gaussian network model (GNM) to obtain protein dynamics. B-factors calculated using sequence-based GNM (Seq-GNM) are in agreement with crystallographic B-factors as well as theoretical B-factors from the original GNM that utilizes the 3D structure. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of the calculated B-factors from the Seq-GNM approach to discriminate genomic variants according to their phenotypes for a wide range of proteins. These results suggest that protein dynamics can be approximated based on sequence information alone, making it possible to assess the phenotypes of nSNVs in cases where a 3D structure is unknown. We hope this work will promote the use of dynamics information in genetic disease prediction at scale by circumventing the need for 3D structures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wxCLJAXCQQo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Trial-and-error learning is a universal strategy for establishing which actions are beneficial or harmful in new environments. However, learning stimulus-response associations solely via trial-and-error is often suboptimal, as in many settings dependencies among stimuli and responses can be exploited to increase learning efficiency. Previous studies have shown that in settings featuring such dependencies, humans typically engage high-level cognitive processes and employ advanced learning strategies to improve their learning efficiency. Here we analyze in detail the initial learning phase of a sample of human subjects (N = 85) performing a trial-and-error learning task with deterministic feedback and hidden stimulus-response dependencies. Using computational modeling, we find that the standard Q-learning model cannot sufficiently explain human learning strategies in this setting. Instead, newly introduced deterministic response models, which are theoretically optimal and transform stimulus sequences unambiguously into response sequences, provide the best explanation for 50.6% of the subjects. Most of the remaining subjects either show a tendency towards generic optimal learning (21.2%) or at least partially exploit stimulus-response dependencies (22.3%), while a few subjects (5.9%) show no clear preference for any of the employed models. After the initial learning phase, asymptotic learning performance during the subsequent practice phase is best explained by the standard Q-learning model. Our results show that human learning strategies in the presented trial-and-error learning task go beyond merely associating stimuli and responses via incremental reinforcement. Specifically during initial learning, high-level cognitive processes support sophisticated learning strategies that increase learning efficiency while keeping memory demands and computational efforts bounded. The good asymptotic fit of the Q-learning model indicates that these cognitive processes are successively replaced by the formation of stimulus-response associations over the course of learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PG_zAuAfJnk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

To map the neural substrate of mental function, cognitive neuroimaging relies on controlled psychological manipulations that engage brain systems associated with specific cognitive processes. In order to build comprehensive atlases of cognitive function in the brain, it must assemble maps for many different cognitive processes, which often evoke overlapping patterns of activation. Such data aggregation faces contrasting goals: on the one hand finding correspondences across vastly different cognitive experiments, while on the other hand precisely describing the function of any given brain region. Here we introduce a new analysis framework that tackles these difficulties and thereby enables the generation of brain atlases for cognitive function. The approach leverages ontologies of cognitive concepts and multi-label brain decoding to map the neural substrate of these concepts. We demonstrate the approach by building an atlas of functional brain organization based on 30 diverse functional neuroimaging studies, totaling 196 different experimental conditions. Unlike conventional brain mapping, this functional atlas supports robust &lt;i&gt;reverse inference&lt;/i&gt;: predicting the mental processes from brain activity in the regions delineated by the atlas. To establish that this reverse inference is indeed governed by the corresponding concepts, and not idiosyncrasies of experimental designs, we show that it can accurately decode the cognitive concepts recruited in new tasks. These results demonstrate that aggregating independent task-fMRI studies can provide a more precise global atlas of selective associations between brain and cognition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5NpxV5X7aGY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Cilostazol decreases duration of spreading depolarization and spreading ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25361?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, angiographic vasospasm (aVS) has been thought to cause delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). However, successful treatment of aVS alone does not result in improved neurological outcome. Therefore, there may be other potential causes of poor neurological outcome, including spreading depolarization (SD). A recent study showed beneficial effects of cilostazol on DCI and neurological outcome. The present prospective clinical trial and experimental study focused on effects of cilostazol on SDs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty aSAH patients were treated with clip ligation and randomly assigned to a cilostazol (n = 23) or control group (n = 27). Effects of cilostazol on DCI, aVS, and SDs, measured with subdural electrodes, were examined. The effect of cilostazol on SD‐induced perfusion deficits (spreading ischemia) was assessed in an aSAH‐mimicking model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a trend for less DCI in the cilostazol group, but it did not reach our threshold for statistical significance (13.0% vs 40.0%, odds ratio = 0.266, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.059–1.192, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.084). However, the total SD‐induced depression duration per recording day (22.2 vs 30.2 minutes, β = −251.905, 95% CI = −488.458 to −15.356, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.043) and the occurrence of isoelectric SDs (0 vs 4 patients, β = −0.916, 95% CI = −1.746 to −0.085, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.037) were significantly lower in the cilostazol group. In rats, cilostazol significantly shortened SD‐induced spreading ischemia compared to vehicle (Student &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; test, difference = 30.2, 95% CI = 5.3–55.1, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.020).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repair of the neurovascular response to SDs by cilostazol, as demonstrated in the aSAH‐mimicking model, may be a promising therapy to control DCI. Ann Neurol 2018; 1–13&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0210-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Abnormal gamma band power across cortex and striatum is an important phenotype of Huntington's disease (HD) in both patients and animal models, but neither the origin nor the functional relevance of this phenotype is well understood. Here, we analyzed local field potential (LFP) activity in freely behaving, symptomatic R6/2 and Q175 mouse models and corresponding wild-type (WT) controls. We focused on periods of quiet rest, which show strong gamma activity in HD mice. Simultaneous recording from motor cortex and its target area in dorsal striatum in the R6/2 model revealed exaggerated functional coupling over that observed in WT between the phase of delta frequencies (1-4 Hz) in cortex and striatum and striatal amplitude modulation of low gamma frequencies (25-55 Hz) (i.e. &quot;phase amplitude coupling&quot;), but no evidence that abnormal cortical activity alone can account for the increase in striatal gamma power. Both HD mouse models had stronger coupling of gamma amplitude to delta phase and more uni-modal phase distributions than their WT counterparts. To assess the possible role of striatal fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in these phenomena, we developed a computational model based on additional striatal recordings from Q175 mice. Changes in peak gamma frequency and power ratio were readily reproduced by our computational model, accounting for several experimental findings reported in the literature. Our results suggest that HD is characterized by both a reorganization of cortico-striatal drive and specific population changes related to intra-striatal synaptic coupling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; In HD, functional impairments first impact movement (chorea, dyskinesia) and cognition (executive functions, abstract thinking). Neuronal dysfunction associated with deficits appear first in cerebral cortex and striatum, which displays abnormally strong power in the low gamma band (25-55 Hz). Fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) are a neuronal subtype putatively capable of forming networks that resonate at the gamma frequency. Here we show that FSI networks can implement an early routing bias for more abundant neuronal subtypes in striatum. Specifically, by analyzing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological recordings from HD mice at rest when gamma is strong and using computational modeling, we identify coupling changes between cortex and striatum sufficient to generate periods of abnormal FSI network gamma in response to slow wave cortical inputs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: N‐acetylcysteine targets 5 lipoxygenase‐derived, toxic lipids and can synergize with prostaglandin E2 to inhibit ferroptosis and improve outcomes following hemorrhagic stroke in mice</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25356?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) is a clinically approved thiol‐containing redox modulatory compound currently in trials for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although generically labeled as an “antioxidant,” poor understanding of its site(s) of action is a barrier to its use in neurological practice. Here, we examined the efficacy and mechanism of action of NAC in rodent models of hemorrhagic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemin was used to model ferroptosis and hemorrhagic stroke in cultured neurons. Striatal infusion of collagenase was used to model intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in mice and rats. Chemical biology, targeted lipidomics, arachidonate 5‐lipoxygenase (ALOX5) knockout mice, and viral‐gene transfer were used to gain insight into the pharmacological targets and mechanism of action of NAC.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAC prevented hemin‐induced ferroptosis by neutralizing toxic lipids generated by arachidonate‐dependent ALOX5 activity. NAC efficacy required increases in glutathione and is correlated with suppression of reactive lipids by glutathione‐dependent enzymes such as glutathione &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;‐transferase. Accordingly, its protective effects were mimicked by chemical or molecular lipid peroxidation inhibitors. NAC delivered postinjury reduced neuronal death and improved functional recovery at least 7 days following ICH in mice and can synergize with clinically approved prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAC is a promising, protective therapy for ICH, which acted to inhibit toxic arachidonic acid products of nuclear ALOX5 that synergized with exogenously delivered protective PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in vitro and in vivo. The findings provide novel insight into a target for NAC, beyond the generic characterization as an antioxidant, resulting in neuroprotection and offer a feasible combinatorial strategy to optimize efficacy and safety in dosing of NAC for treatment of neurological disorders involving ferroptosis such as ICH.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Levodopa‐induced dyskinesia in Parkinson disease: Sleep matters</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25360?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spectrum of clinical symptom changes during the course of Parkinson disease (PD). Levodopa therapy, while offering remarkable control of classical motor symptoms, causes abnormal involuntary movements as the disease progresses. This levodopa‐induced dyskinesia (LID) has been associated with abnormal cortical plasticity. Because slow wave activity (SWA) of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep underlies adjustment of cortical excitability, we sought to elucidate the relationship between this physiological process and LID.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐six patients at different stages of PD underwent whole‐night video polysomnography–high‐density electroencephalography (vPSG‐hdEEG), preceded by 1 week of actigraphy. To represent the broad spectrum of the disease, patients were divided into 3 groups by disease stage—(1) de novo (n = 9), (2) advanced (n = 13), and (3) dyskinetic (DYS; n = 14)—were compared to an age‐matched control group (n = 12). The SWA‐NREM content of the vPSG‐hdEEG was then temporally divided into 10 equal parts, from T1 to T10, and power and source analyses were performed. T2‐T3‐T4 were considered early sleep and were compared to T7‐T8‐T9, representing late sleep.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that all groups, except the DYS group, manifested a clear‐cut SWA decrease between early and late sleep.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data demonstrate a strong pathophysiological association between sleep and PD. Given that SWA may be a surrogate for synaptic strength, our data suggest that DYS patients do not have adequate synaptic downscaling. Further analysis is needed to determine the effect of drugs that can enhance cortical SWA in LID. Ann Neurol 2018; 1–13&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Disrupted core-periphery structure of multimodal brain networks in Alzheimer's Disease. (arXiv:1811.11688v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11688</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many neurodegenerative diseases are recognized to include a disconnection
syndrome initiated by the neuronal atrophy process. In Alzheimer's disease
(AD), the progressive destruction of axonal pathways leads to aberrant network
reconfigurations both at the structural and functional level. In such network
reorganization, the core and peripheral nodes appear to be crucial for the
prediction of clinical outcome due to their ability to influence large-scale
functional integration. However, the role of the different types of brain
connectivity in such prediction still remains unclear. Using a multiplex
network approach we integrated information from DWI, fMRI and MEG brain
connectivity to extract an enriched description of the core-periphery structure
in a group of AD patients and age-matched controls. Results showed that the
regional coreness - i.e., the probability of a region to be in the multiplex
core - was mainly driven by DWI structural connectivity with significant
contributions of fMRI and MEG functional connectivity, respectively at 0.1-0.3
Hz and 8-10 Hz. At the global scale, we showed that the coreness significantly
decreased in AD patients as a result of the randomization process initiated by
the neurodegeneration. At the local scale, the most impacted areas were in the
core of the network - including temporal, parietal and occipital areas - while
we reported compensatory increments for the peripheral regions in the
sensorimotor system. Finally, these multiplex network changes significantly
predicted the cognitive and memory impairment of patients as measured
respectively by the MMSE and FCSRT clinical scores. Taken together these
results indicate that a more accurate description of neurodegenerative diseases
can be obtained from the multimodal integration of neuroimaging-derived network
data.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11687</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Slow waves (SWs) occur both during natural sleep and anesthesia and are
universal across species. Even though electrophysiological recordings have been
largely used to characterize brain states, they are limited in the spatial
resolution and cannot target specific neuronal population. Recently,
large-scale optical imaging techniques coupled with functional indicators
overcame these restrictions. Here we combined wide-field fluorescence
microscopy and a transgenic mouse model expressing a calcium indicator
(GCaMP6f) in excitatory neurons to study SW propagation over the meso-scale
under ketamine anesthesia. We developed &quot;de novo&quot; a versatile analysis pipeline
to quantify the spatio-temporal propagation of the SWs in the frequency band
[0.5, 4] Hz. Moreover, we designed a computational simulator based on a simple
theoretical model, which takes into account the statistics of neural activity,
the response of fluorescence proteins and the slow waves dynamics. The
simulator was capable of synthesizing artificial signals that could reliably
reproduce several features of the SWs observed in vivo. Comparison of
preliminary experimental and simulated data shows the robustness of the
analysis tools and its potential to uncover mechanistic insights of the Slow
Wave Activity (SWA).

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Reduced structural connectivity between left auditory thalamus and the motion-sensitive planum temporale in developmental dyslexia. (arXiv:1811.11658v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11658</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developmental dyslexia is characterized by the inability to acquire typical
reading and writing skills. Dyslexia has been frequently linked to cerebral
cortex alterations; however recent evidence also points towards sensory
thalamus dysfunctions: dyslexics showed reduced responses in the left auditory
thalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB) during speech processing in contrast to
neurotypical readers. In addition, in the visual modality, dyslexics have
reduced structural connectivity between the left visual thalamus (lateral
geniculate nucleus, LGN) and V5/MT, a cerebral cortex region involved in visual
movement processing. Higher LGN-V5/MT connectivity in dyslexics was associated
with the faster rapid naming of letters and numbers (RANln), a measure that is
highly correlated with reading proficiency. We here tested two hypotheses that
were directly derived from these previous findings. First, we tested the
hypothesis that dyslexics have reduced structural connectivity between the left
MGB and the auditory motion-sensitive part of the left planum temporale (mPT).
Second, we hypothesized that the amount of left mPT-MGB connectivity correlates
with dyslexics RANln scores. Using diffusion tensor imaging based probabilistic
tracking we show that male adults with developmental dyslexia have reduced
structural connectivity between the left MGB and the left mPT, confirming the
first hypothesis. Stronger left mPT-MGB connectivity was not associated with
faster RANnl scores in dyslexics, but in neurotypical readers. Our findings
provide first evidence that reduced cortico-thalamic connectivity in the
auditory modality is a feature of developmental dyslexia, and that it may also
impact on reading related cognitive abilities in neurotypical readers.

Sequencing of the T cell receptor repertoire is a powerful tool for deeper study of immune response, but the unique structure of this type of data makes its meaningful quantification challenging. We introduce a new method, the Gamma-GPD spliced threshold model, to address this difficulty. This biologically interpretable model captures the distribution of the TCR repertoire, demonstrates stability across varying sequencing depths, and permits comparative analysis across any number of sampled individuals. We apply our method to several datasets and obtain insights regarding the differentiating features in the T cell receptor repertoire among sampled individuals across conditions. We have implemented our method in the open-source R package powerTCR.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1HPkiYuzOtM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25385?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the association between serum soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), a soluble type of an innate immune receptor expressed on the microglia, and the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,349 Japanese community‐residents aged 60 and older without dementia were followed prospectively for 10 years (2002‐2012). Serum sTREM2 levels were quantified by using an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and divided into quartiles. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of serum sTREM2 levels on the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the follow‐up, 300 subjects developed all‐cause dementia; 193 had Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 85 had vascular dementia (VaD). The age‐ and sex‐adjusted incidences of all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD elevated significantly with higher serum sTREM2 levels (all P for trend &amp;lt;0.012). These associations were not altered after adjustment for confounding factors, including high‐sensitive C‐reactive protein. Subjects with the highest quartile of serum sTREM2 levels had significantly higher multivariable‐adjusted risks of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD than those with the lowest quartile (HR=2.03, 95% CI=1.39‐2.97, P&amp;lt;0.001 for all‐cause dementia; HR=1.62, 95% CI=1.02‐2.55, P=0.04 for AD; HR=2.85, 95% CI=1.35‐6.02, P=0.006 for VaD). No significant heterogeneity in the association of serum sTREM2 levels with the development of dementia was observed among the other risk‐factor subgroups (all P for heterogeneity &amp;gt;0.11).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present findings suggest a significant association between increased serum sTREM2 levels and the risk of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD in the general elderly Japanese population.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/48/10384?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The koniocellular (K) layers of the primate dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus house a variety of visual receptive field types, not all of which have been fully characterized. Here we made single-cell recordings targeted to the K layers of diurnal New World monkeys (marmosets). A subset of recorded cells was excited by both increments and decrements of light intensity (on/off-cells). Histological reconstruction of the location of these cells confirmed that they are segregated to K layers; we therefore refer to these cells as K-on/off cells. The K-on/off cells show high contrast sensitivity, strong bandpass spatial frequency tuning, and their response magnitude is strongly reduced by stimuli larger than the excitatory receptive field (silent suppressive surrounds). Stationary counterphase gratings evoke unmodulated spike rate increases or frequency-doubled responses in K-on/off cells; such responses are largely independent of grating spatial phase. The K-on/off cells are not orientation or direction selective. Some (but not all) properties of K-on/off cells are consistent with those of local-edge-detector/impressed-by-contrast cells reported in studies of cat retina and geniculate, and broad-thorny ganglion cells recorded in macaque monkey retina. The receptive field properties of K-on/off cells and their preferential location in the ventral K layers (K1 and K2) make them good candidates for the direct projection from geniculate to extrastriate cortical area MT/V5. If so, they could contribute to visual information processing in the dorsal (&quot;where&quot; or &quot;action&quot;) visual stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We characterize cells in an evolutionary ancient part of the visual pathway in primates. The cells are located in the lateral geniculate nucleus (the main visual afferent relay nucleus), in regions called koniocellular layers that are known to project to extrastriate visual areas as well as primary visual cortex. The cells show high contrast sensitivity and rapid, transient responses to light onset and offset. Their properties suggest they could contribute to visual processing in the dorsal (&quot;where&quot; or &quot;action&quot;) visual stream.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cerebellar Role in Predictive Control of Eye Velocity Initiation and Termination</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/48/10371?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Predictive motor control is essential to achieve rapid and precise motor action in all vertebrates. Visuomotor transformations have been a popular model system to study the underlying neural mechanisms, in particular, the role of the cerebellum in both predictive and gain adaptations. In all species, large-field visual motion produces an involuntary conjugate ocular movement facilitating gaze stabilization called the optokinetic response. Gain adaptation can be induced by prolonged optokinetic visual stimulation; and if the visual stimulation is temporally periodic, predictive behavior emerges. Two predictive timing components were identifiable in this behavior. The first was prediction of stimulus initiation (when to move) and the other was stimulus termination (when to stop). We designed visual training that allowed us to evaluate initiation and termination independently that included the recording of cerebellar activity followed by acute and chronic cerebellar removal in goldfish of both sexes. We found that initiation and termination predictions were present in the cerebellum and more robust than conflicting visual sensory signals. Each prediction could be acquired independently, and both the acquisition and maintenance of each component were cerebellar-dependent. Subsequent analysis of the neuronal connectivity strongly supports the hypothesis that the acquired eye velocity behaviors were dependent on feedforward velocity buildup signals from the brainstem, but the adaptive timing mechanism itself originates within the circuitry of the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Predictive and rapid motor control is essential in our daily life, such as in the playing of musical instruments or sports. The current work evaluates timing of a visuomotor behavior shown to be similar in humans as well as goldfish. Given the latter species' known brainstem cerebellar neuronal connectivity and experimental advantage, it was possible to demonstrate the cerebellum to be necessary for acquisition and maintenance of both the initiation and termination components of when to move and to stop. All evidence in this study points to the adaptive predictive control site to lie within the cerebellar circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling craniofacial development reveals spatiotemporal constraints on robust patterning of the mandibular arch</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/nw45cvIUcgA/article</link>

How does pattern formation occur accurately when confronted with tissue growth and stochastic fluctuations (noise) in gene expression? Dorso-ventral (D-V) patterning of the mandibular arch specifies upper versus lower jaw skeletal elements through a combination of Bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp), Endothelin-1 (Edn1), and Notch signaling, and this system is highly robust. We combine NanoString experiments of early D-V gene expression with live imaging of arch development in zebrafish to construct a computational model of the D-V mandibular patterning network. The model recapitulates published genetic perturbations in arch development. Patterning is most sensitive to changes in Bmp signaling, and the temporal order of gene expression modulates the response of the patterning network to noise. Thus, our integrated systems biology approach reveals non-intuitive features of the complex signaling system crucial for craniofacial development, including novel insights into roles of gene expression timing and stochasticity in signaling and gene regulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nw45cvIUcgA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A Bayesian mixture modelling approach for spatial proteomics</title>

Analysis of the spatial sub-cellular distribution of proteins is of vital importance to fully understand context specific protein function. Some proteins can be found with a single location within a cell, but up to half of proteins may reside in multiple locations, can dynamically re-localise, or reside within an unknown functional compartment. These considerations lead to uncertainty in associating a protein to a single location. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS) based spatial proteomics relies on supervised machine learning algorithms to assign proteins to sub-cellular locations based on common gradient profiles. However, such methods fail to quantify uncertainty associated with sub-cellular class assignment. Here we reformulate the framework on which we perform statistical analysis. We propose a Bayesian generative classifier based on Gaussian mixture models to assign proteins probabilistically to sub-cellular niches, thus proteins have a probability distribution over sub-cellular locations, with Bayesian computation performed using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm, as well as Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Our methodology allows proteome-wide uncertainty quantification, thus adding a further layer to the analysis of spatial proteomics. Our framework is flexible, allowing many different systems to be analysed and reveals new modelling opportunities for spatial proteomics. We find our methods perform competitively with current state-of-the art machine learning methods, whilst simultaneously providing more information. We highlight several examples where classification based on the support vector machine is unable to make any conclusions, while uncertainty quantification using our approach provides biologically intriguing results. To our knowledge this is the first Bayesian model of MS-based spatial proteomics data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xZZza2iv30E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: RNA3DCNN: Local and global quality assessments of RNA 3D structures using 3D deep convolutional neural networks</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/JE7z7RP6F5Y/article</link>

Quality assessment is essential for the computational prediction and design of RNA tertiary structures. To date, several knowledge-based statistical potentials have been proposed and proved to be effective in identifying native and near-native RNA structures. All these potentials are based on the inverse Boltzmann formula, while differing in the choice of the geometrical descriptor, reference state, and training dataset. Via an approach that diverges completely from the conventional statistical potentials, our work explored the power of a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach as a quality evaluator for RNA 3D structures, which used a 3D grid representation of the structure as input without extracting features manually. The RNA structures were evaluated by examining each nucleotide, so our method can also provide local quality assessment. Two sets of training samples were built. The first one included 1 million samples generated by high-temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the second one included 1 million samples generated by Monte Carlo (MC) structure prediction. Both MD and MC procedures were performed for a non-redundant set of 414 RNAs. For two training datasets (one including only MD training samples and the other including both MD and MC training samples), we trained two neural networks, named RNA3DCNN_MD and RNA3DCNN_MDMC, respectively. The former is suitable for assessing near-native structures, while the latter is suitable for assessing structures covering large structural space. We tested the performance of our method and made comparisons with four other traditional scoring functions. On two of three test datasets, our method performed similarly to the state-of-the-art traditional scoring function, and on the third test dataset, our method was far superior to other scoring functions. Our method can be downloaded from https://github.com/lijunRNA/RNA3DCNN.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JE7z7RP6F5Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Adenosine signaling though A1 receptors inhibits chemosensitive neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0404-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A subset of neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) function as respiratory chemoreceptors by regulating depth and frequency of breathing in response to changes in tissue CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The activity of chemosensitive RTN neurons is also subject to modulation by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent purinergic signaling. However, mechanisms contributing to purinergic regulation of RTN chemoreceptors are not entirely clear. Recent evidence suggests adenosine inhibits RTN chemoreception &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by activation of A1 receptors. The goal of this study was to characterize effects of adenosine on chemosensitive RTN neurons and identify intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms underlying this response. Cell-attached recordings from RTN chemoreceptors in slices from rat or wild-type mouse pups (mixed sex) show that exposure to adenosine (1 µM) inhibits chemoreceptor activity by an A1 receptor-dependent mechanism. However, exposure to a selective A1 receptor antagonist (DPCPX, 30 nM) alone did not potentiate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-stimulated activity, suggesting activation of A1 receptors does not limit chemoreceptor activity under these reduced conditions. Whole-cell voltage-clamp from chemosensitive RTN neurons show that exposure to adenosine activated an inward rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance, and at the network level, adenosine preferentially decreased frequency of excitatory but not inhibitory postsynaptic currents. These results show that adenosine activation of A1 receptors inhibits chemosensitive RTN neurons by direct activation of a GIRK-like conductance, and presynaptically, by suppression of excitatory synaptic input to chemoreceptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Adenosine is a potent modulator of all aspects of breathing including chemoreception at the level of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN); however, mechanisms by which adenosine regulates activity of RTN chemoreceptors is not known. Here, we show that adenosine activation of A1 receptors inhibits RTN neurons by activation of an inward rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance, and by selective suppression of excitatory synaptic input to chemoreceptors. These results identify a GIRK-like conductance as the first target of purinergic signaling in chemosensitive RTN neurons. This work may also have clinical relevance since A1 receptor antagonists like caffeine are used to treat respiratory problems in premature infancy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Newly Identified Electrically Coupled Neurons Support Development of the Drosophila Giant Fiber Model Circuit</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0346-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Giant Fiber (GF) escape circuit is an extensively studied model for neuron connectivity and function. Researchers have long taken advantage of the simple linear neuronal pathway, which begins at peripheral sensory modalities, travels through the central GF Interneuron (GFI) to motor neurons, and terminates on wing/leg muscles. This circuit is more complex than it seems however, as there exists a complex web of coupled neurons connected to the GFI, which widely innervate the thoracic ganglion. Here, we define four new neuron clusters dye-coupled to the central GFI, which we name GF Coupled (GFC) 1-4. We identify new transgenic Gal4 drivers that express specifically in these neurons, and map both neuronal architecture and synaptic polarity. GFC1-4 share a central site of GFI connectivity, the Inframedial Bridge (IB), where the neurons each form electrical synapses. Targeted apoptotic ablation of GFC1 reveals a key role for proper development of the GF circuit, including the maintenance of GFI connectivity with upstream and downstream synaptic partners. GFC1 ablation frequently results in loss of one GFI, which is always compensated for by contralateral innervation from a branch of the persisting GFI axon. Overall, this work reveals extensively coupled interconnectivity within the GF circuit, and the requirement of coupled neurons for circuit development. Identification of this large population of electrically-coupled neurons in this classic model, and the ability to genetically manipulate these electrically synapsed neurons, expands the GF system capabilities for the nuanced, sophisticated circuit dissection necessary for deeper investigations into brain formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Genetic model neural circuits with individually identifiable neurons help us understand how nervous systems wire together during development, and then operate through coordinated chemical and electrical signaling. The &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Giant Fiber circuit has long served as such a model, due to large neuron size, genetic malleability and easily visualized behavioral output: a jump in response to a threat. This study unveils new members of this circuit, all of which synapse with the circuit at one site on the central Giant Fiber Interneuron. We use new tools to identify and transgenically manipulate these neurons and show that these neurons are required for proper circuit development. This study provides a detailed circuit map for further dissection of neuronal connectivity and electrically-coupled communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Overweighed mice show coordinated homeostatic and hedonic transcriptional response across brain</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0287-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Obesogenic diets lead to overeating and obesity by inducing the expression of genes involved in hedonic and homeostatic responses in specific brain regions. However, how the effects on gene expression are coordinated in the brain so far remains largely unknown. In our study, we provided mice with access to energy-dense diet, which induced overeating and overweight, and we explored the transcriptome changes across the main regions involved in feeding and energy balance: hypothalamus, frontal cortex and striatum. Interestingly, we detected two regulatory processes: a switch-like regulation with differentially expressed genes changing over 1.5-fold, and &quot;fine-tuned&quot; subtler changes of genes whose levels correlated with body weight and behavioral changes. We found that genes in both categories were positioned within specific topologically associating domains (TADs), which were often differently regulated across different brain regions. These TADs were enriched in genes relevant for the physiological and behavioral observed changes. Our results suggest that chromatin structure coordinates diet-dependent transcriptional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Mice fed with free-choice access to chocolate mixture become overweight and compulsive, recapitulating what happens during obesity. For the first time, we correlated these physical and behavioural changes with the transcriptome in the frontal cortex and the striatum, involved in the hedonic &quot;liking&quot; associated to eating, and the hypothalamus, involved in the homeostasic regulation of food intake. We detected two groups of genes: some transcript were strongly deregulated in term of fold changes; while others were only subtly deregulated but were especially correlating with measurements associated with body-weight and compulsivity. These genes were not randomly distributed, but were positioned in chromatin domains, many of which rich in genes differentially co-regulated across brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Hierarchical Cognition causes Task Related Deactivations but not just in Default Mode Regions</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0008-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The well-known deactivation of the Default Mode Network (DMN) during external tasks is usually thought to reflect the suppression of internally directed mental activity during external attention. In 3 experiments with human participants we organized sequences of task events identical in their attentional and control demands into larger task episodes. We found that DMN deactivation across such sequential events was never constant, but was maximum at the beginning of the episode, then decreased gradually across the episode, reaching baseline towards episode completion, with the final event of the episode eliciting an activation. Crucially, this pattern of activity was not limited to a fixed set of DMN regions but, across experiments, was shown by a variable set of regions expected to be uninvolved in processing the ongoing task. This change in deactivation across sequential but identical events showed that the deactivation cannot be related to attentional/control demands which were constant across the episode, instead it has to be related to some episode related load that was maximal at the beginning and then decreased gradually as parts of the episode got executed. We argue that this load resulted from cognitive programs through which the entire episode was hierarchically executed as one unit. At the beginning of task episodes, programs related to their entire duration is assembled, causing maximal deactivation. As execution proceeds, elements within the program related to the completed parts of the episode dismantle, thereby decreasing the program load and causing a decrease in deactivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We prepare breakfasts and write emails, and not individually execute their many component acts. The current study suggests that cognitive entities that enable such hierarchical execution of goal-directed behavior may cause the ubiquitously seen deactivation during external task execution. Further, while this deactivation has previously been associated with a defined set of the so called default mode regions, current study demonstrates that deactivation is shown by &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; region not &lt;i&gt;currently&lt;/i&gt; involved in task execution, and in certain task episodes can even include attention related fronto-parietal regions as well as primary sensory and motor regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Six‐months assessment of a hand prosthesis with intraneural tactile feedback</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25384?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hand amputation is a highly disabling event, which significantly affects quality of life. An effective hand replacement can be achieved if the user, in addition to motor functions, is provided with the sensations that are naturally perceived while grasping and moving. Intraneural peripheral electrodes have shown promising results toward the restoration of the sense of touch. However, the long‐term usability and clinical relevance of intraneural sensory feedback have not yet been clearly demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this aim, we performed a six months clinical study with three trans‐radial amputees who received implants of transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) in their median and ulnar nerves. After calibration, electrical stimulation was delivered through the TIMEs connected to artificial sensors in the digits of a prosthesis to generate sensory feedback, which was then used by the subjects while performing different grasping tasks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the subjects, notwithstanding their important clinical differences, reported stimulation‐induced sensations from the phantom hand for the whole duration of the trial. They also successfully integrated the sensory feedback into their motor control strategies while performing experimental tests simulating tasks of real life (with and without the support of vision). Finally, they reported a decrement of their phantom limb pain and a general improvement in mood state.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promising results achieved with all subjects show the feasibility of the use of intraneural stimulation in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Genome-wide association studies have implicated many ion channels in schizophrenia pathophysiology. Although the functions of these channels are relatively well characterized by single-cell studies, the contributions of common variation in these channels to neurophysiological biomarkers and symptoms of schizophrenia remain elusive. Here, using computational modeling, we show that a common biomarker of schizophrenia, namely, an increase in delta-oscillation power, may be a direct consequence of altered expression or kinetics of voltage-gated ion channels or calcium transporters. Our model of a circuit of layer V pyramidal cells highlights multiple types of schizophrenia-related variants that contribute to altered dynamics in the delta-frequency band. Moreover, our model predicts that the same membrane mechanisms that increase the layer V pyramidal cell network gain and response to delta-frequency oscillations may also cause a deficit in a single-cell correlate of the prepulse inhibition, which is a behavioral biomarker highly associated with schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Emotions can be characterized by dimensions of arousal and valence (pleasantness). While the functional brain bases of emotional arousal and valence have been actively investigated, the neuromolecular underpinnings remain poorly understood. We tested whether the opioid and dopamine systems involved in reward and motivational processes would be associated with emotional arousal and valence. We used in vivo positron emission tomography to quantify μ-opioid receptor and type 2 dopamine receptor (MOR and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R, respectively) availability in brains of 35 healthy adult females. During subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging carried out to monitor hemodynamic activity, the subjects viewed movie scenes of varying emotional content. Arousal and valence were associated with hemodynamic activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing, including amygdala, thalamus, and superior temporal sulcus. Cerebral MOR availability correlated negatively with the hemodynamic responses to arousing scenes in amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus, whereas no positive correlations were observed in any brain region. D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R availability—here reliably quantified only in striatum—was not associated with either arousal or valence. These results suggest that emotional arousal is regulated by the MOR system, and that cerebral MOR availability influences brain activity elicited by arousing stimuli.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0219-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural stem cells (NSCs) hold great promise for neural repair in cases of CNS injury and neurodegeneration; however, conventional cell-based transplant methods face the challenges of poor survival and inadequate neuronal differentiation. Here, we report an alternative, tissue-based transplantation strategy whereby cerebral organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) were grafted into lesioned mouse cortex. Cerebral organoid transplants exhibited enhanced survival and robust vascularization from host brain as compared to transplants of dissociated neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Engrafted cerebral organoids harbored a large NSC pool and displayed multilineage neurodifferentiation at two and four weeks after grafting. Cerebral organoids therefore represent a promising alternative source to NSCs or fetal tissues for transplantation, as they contain a large set of neuroprogenitors and differentiated neurons in a structured organization. Engrafted cerebral organoids may also offer a unique experimental paradigm for modeling human neurodevelopment and CNS diseases in the context of vascularized cortical tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Superior Visual Timing Sensitivity in Auditory but not Visual World Class Drum Corps Experts</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0241-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;World class drum corps require cooperation among performance artists to render precisely synchronized and asynchronized events. For example, drum corps visual aesthetics often feature salient radial and rotational motion displays from color guard. Accordingly, extensive color guard training might predict superior visual timing sensitivity to asynchronies in radial and rotational motion displays. Less intuitively, one might instead predict superior visual timing sensitivity among world class drum corps musicians, who regularly sub-divide musical tempos into brief time units. This prediction arises from the possibility that auditory training transfers cross-modally. Here, we investigated whether precise visual temporal order judgments more strongly align with color guard’s visual training or musicians’ auditory training. To mimic color guard visual displays, stimuli comprised bilateral plaid patterns that radiated or rotated before changing direction asynchronously. Human participants indicated whether the direction changed first on the left or right –a temporal order judgment (TOJ). Twenty-five percussionists, 67 brass players, and 29 color guard from a world class drum corps collectively completed 67,760 visual TOJ trials. Percussionists exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did brass players, who exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did color guard. Group median thresholds spanned an order of magnitude, ranging between 29 milliseconds (percussionists judging rotational asynchronies) and 290 milliseconds (color guard judging radial asynchronies). The results suggest that visual timing can improve more by training cross-modally than intra-modally, even when intra-modal training and testing stimuli closely match. More broadly, pre-existing training histories can provide a unique window into the nervous system’s timing sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Optimal cognitive and behavioral performance typically occurs when training conditions closely match testing conditions. This fundamental principle from learning and memory predicts greater visual test performance after visual training than after auditory training. Contrastingly, a fundamental sensory principle –superior temporal precision for auditory versus visual stimuli – predicts better visual test performance after auditory training than after visual training. We observed more precise visual timing among musical experts than among visual experts who had years of visual experience that closely matched the testing stimuli. The musicians’ superior performance suggests that shared neural events mediate the precision of auditory and visual timing. Moreover, these shared neural events provide greater temporal precision than does matching sensory modalities across training and testing contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Gas Anesthesia Impairs Peripheral Auditory Sensitivity in Barn Owls (Tyto alba)</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0140-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Auditory nerve single-unit recordings were obtained from two groups of young barn owls (age, between posthatching days 11 and 86) in terminal experiments under two different anesthetic regimes: ketamine (6–11 mg/kg) plus xylazine (~2 mg/kg); or isoflurane (1–1.5%) in oxygen, delivered via artificial respiration. In a second series of minimally invasive experiments, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded in the same four adult barn owls (&lt;i&gt;Tyto alba&lt;/i&gt;; age, between 5 and 32 months) under three different anesthetic protocols: ketamine (10 mg/kg) plus xylazine (3 mg/kg), isoflurane (1–1.5%), and sevoflurane (2–3%) in carbogen. Finally, the ABR measurements on adult owls were repeated in terminal experiments including more invasive procedures such as artificial respiration and higher isoflurane dosage. The main finding was a significant deterioration of auditory sensitivity in barn owls under gas anesthesia, at the level of the auditory nerve (i.e., a very peripheral level of the auditory system). The effect was drastic in the young animals that experienced threshold elevations in auditory nerve single-unit responses of ≥20 dB. ABR thresholds assessed repeatedly in experiments on adult owls were also significantly higher under isoflurane and sevoflurane, on average by 7 and 15 dB, compared with ketamine/xylazine. This difference already occurred with minimal dosages and was reversibly enlarged with increased isoflurane concentration. Finally, there was evidence for confounding detrimental effects associated with artificial respiration over many hours, which suggested oxygen toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Fingolimod enhances the efficacy of delayed alteplase administration in acute ischemic stroke by promoting anterograde reperfusion and retrograde collateral flow</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25352?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of coadministration of fingolimod with alteplase in acute ischemic stroke patients in a delayed time window.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a prospective, randomized, open‐label, blinded endpoint clinical trial, enrolling patients with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery proximal occlusion within 4.5 to 6 hours from symptom onset. Patients were randomly assigned to receive alteplase alone or alteplase with fingolimod. All patients underwent pretreatment and 24‐hour noncontrast computed tomography (CT)/perfusion CT/CT angiography. The coprimary endpoints were the decrease of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores over 24 hours and the favorable shift of modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) distribution at day 90. Exploratory outcomes included vessel recanalization, anterograde reperfusion, and retrograde reperfusion of collateral flow.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each treatment group included 23 patients. Compared with alteplase alone, patients receiving fingolimod plus alteplase exhibited better early clinical improvement at 24 hours and a favorable shift of mRS distribution at day 90. In addition, patients who received fingolimod and alteplase exhibited a greater reduction in the perfusion lesion accompanied by suppressed infarct growth by 24 hours. Fingolimod in conjunction with alteplase significantly improved anterograde reperfusion of downstream territory and prevented the failure of retrograde reperfusion from collateral circulation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingolimod may enhance the efficacy of alteplase administration in the 4.5‐ to 6‐hour time window in patients with a proximal cerebral arterial occlusion and salvageable penumbral tissue by promoting both anterograde reperfusion and retrograde collateral flow. These findings are instructive for the design of future trials of recanalization therapies in extended time windows. Ann Neurol 2018;84:725–736&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: KCTD7 deficiency defines a distinct neurodegenerative disorder with a conserved autophagy‐lysosome defect</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25351?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several small case series identified &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; mutations in patients with a rare autosomal recessive disorder designated progressive myoclonic epilepsy (EPM3) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN14). Despite the name KCTD (potassium channel tetramerization domain), KCTD protein family members lack predicted channel domains. We sought to translate insight gained from yeast studies to uncover disease mechanisms associated with deficiencies in KCTD7 of unknown function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; variants in new and published patients were assessed for disease causality using genetic analyses, cell‐based functional assays of patient fibroblasts and knockout yeast, and electron microscopy of patient samples.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; mutations can exhibit movement disorders or developmental regression before seizure onset, and are distinguished from similar disorders by an earlier age of onset. Although most published &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; patient variants were excluded from a genome sequence database of normal human variations, most newly identified patient variants are present in this database, potentially challenging disease causality. However, genetic analysis and impaired biochemical interactions with cullin 3 support a causal role for patient &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; variants, suggesting deleterious alleles of &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; and other rare disease variants may be underestimated. Both patient‐derived fibroblasts and yeast lacking Whi2 with sequence similarity to KCTD7 have impaired autophagy consistent with brain pathology.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biallelic &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; mutations define a neurodegenerative disorder with lipofuscin and lipid droplet accumulation but without defining features of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis or lysosomal storage disorders. &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; deficiency appears to cause an underlying autophagy‐lysosome defect conserved in yeast, thereby assigning a biological role for KCTD7.

&lt;p&gt;We used 2 independent samples (discovery, n = 390; validation, n = 1,035) of individuals, aged ≥ 60 years, along the cognitive continuum with imaging from the population‐based sample of Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We ascertained vascular health by summing up recently existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from health care records (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke). Using multiple regression models, we quantified associations between CMC and brain health after accounting for age, sex, education/occupation, and AD burden (from amyloid and tau PET).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systemic vascular health was associated with medial temporal lobe thinning, widespread cerebral hypoperfusion, and loss of microstructural integrity in several white matter tracts including the corpus callosum and fornix. Further investigations suggested that microstructural integrity of the genu of the corpus callosum was suitable for assessing prodromal cerebrovascular health, had similar distributions in the discovery and independent validation datasets, and predicted cognitive performance above and beyond amyloid deposition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systemic vascular health has significant impact on brain structure and function. Quantifying prodromal cerebrovascular health–related brain measures that are independent of AD pathology–related changes has great utility for cognitive aging.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Disease progression and outcome measures in spinobulbar muscular atrophy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25345?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a slowly progressive disease with weakness of bulbar and extremity muscles. There is no curative treatment for the disease, but several clinical trials have been conducted over the past years. The results from these trials have uncovered a great need to develop quantitative, reliable outcome measures. In this study, we prospectively investigated disease progression over 18 months in 29 patients with genetically confirmed SBMA, using quantitative outcome measures, including Dixon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used MRI to assess changes in muscle fat content and stationary dynamometry to assess changes in muscle strength. Disease progression was also investigated with the SBMA functional rating scale, bulbar rating scale, 6‐minute walk test, and blood samples, among others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mean muscle fat content, muscle strength in knee extensors, handgrip strength, walking distance, and creatinine levels changed significantly. Mean muscle fat content increased by 2 ± 1.25%, and knee extension strength decreased from 83 ± 60 to 76 ± 56Nm, handgrip strength from 31 ± 13 to 29 ± 13kg, walking distance from 362 ± 216 to 336 ± 219m, and creatinine level from 58 ± 21 to 54 ± 20 μmol/l. Functional rating scores did not change.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study demonstrates a slow and steady disease progression in SBMA. Dixon MRI detected increases in muscle fat content in all investigated muscles and is therefore a suitable candidate for an outcome measure in natural history or treatment studies in SBMA. The 6‐minute walk test and handgrip strength also seem to be reliable outcome measures for SBMA. Ann Neurol 2018;84:762–773&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Optogenetic dissection of temporal dynamics of amygdala-striatal interplay during risk/reward decision making</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0422-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Decision making often requires weighing costs and benefits of different options that vary in terms of reward magnitude and uncertainty. Previous studies using pharmacological inactivations have shown that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) pathway promotes choice towards larger/riskier rewards. Neural activity in BLA and NAc show distinct, phasic changes in firing prior to choice and following action outcomes, yet, how these temporally-discrete patterns of activity within BLA-NAc circuitry influence choice is unclear. We assessed how optogenetic silencing of BLA terminals in the NAc altered action selection during probabilistic decision making. Rats received intra-BLA infusions of viruses encoding the inhibitory opsin eArchT and were well-trained on a probabilistic discounting task, where they chose between smaller/certain rewards and larger rewards delivered in a probabilistic manner, with the odds of obtaining the larger reward changing over a session (50-12.5%). During testing, activity of BLA&amp;amp;cenveo_unknown_entity_wingdings_F0E0;NAc inputs were suppressed with 4-7 s pulses of light delivered via optic fibers into the NAc during discrete task events: prior to choice or after choice outcomes. Inhibition prior to choice reduced selection of the preferred option, suggesting that during deliberation, BLA-NAc activity biases choice towards preferred rewards. Inhibition during reward omissions increased risky choice during the low-probability block, indicating that activity after non-rewarded actions serves to modify subsequent choice. In contrast, silencing during rewarded outcomes did not reliably affect choice. These data demonstrate how patterns of activity in BLA-NAc circuitry convey different types of information that guide action selection in situations involving reward uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Amygdala projections to the nucleus accumbens form a neural circuit that has been implicated in guiding risk-related decision making, and dysfunction in this circuitry is thought to underlie aberrant decision making observed a variety of psychiatric illnesses. The present study used temporally-discrete optogenetic inhibition to identify how activity in amygdala inputs to the accumbens, during different phases of the decision process, promotes optimal decision making. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms through which these circuits contribute to normal and abnormal decisions involving reward uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Asymmetrical relationship between prediction and control during visuomotor adaptation</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0280-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Current theories suggest that the ability to control the body and to predict its associated sensory consequences is key for skilled motor behavior. It is also suggested that these abilities need both be updated when the mapping between motor commands and sensory consequences is altered. Here we challenge this view by investigating the transfer of adaptation to rotated visual feedback between one task in which human participants had to control a cursor with their hand in order to track a moving target, and another in which they had to predict with their eyes the visual consequences of their hand movement on the cursor. Hand and eye tracking performances were evaluated respectively through cursor-target and gaze-cursor distance. Results reveal a striking dissociation: although prior adaptation of hand tracking greatly facilitates eye tracking, adaptation of eye tracking does not transfer to hand tracking. We conclude that although the update of control is associated with the update of prediction, prediction can be updated independently of control. To account for this pattern of results we propose that task demands mediate the update of prediction and control. Although a joint update of prediction and control seemed mandatory for success in our hand tracking task, the update of control was only facultative for success in our eye tracking task. More generally those results promote the view that prediction and control are mediated by separate neural processes and suggest that people can learn to predict movement consequences without necessarily promoting their ability to control these movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Current theories suggest that accurately predicting the sensory consequences of one’s actions is central for perception, awareness of action, and motor learning. In the latter case, it is assumed that prediction errors are used to train the controller that transforms our desired sensory consequences into motor commands. Here we show that, following exposure to biased hand visual feedback, people can update their ability to predict visual consequences of hand movements without necessarily improving their ability to control these movements. This work challenges the view that the joint update of prediction and control is mandatory when facing a change in the mapping between motor commands and sensory consequences. Instead we propose that task demands mediate the update of prediction and control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: A gate-and-switch model for head orientation behaviors in C. elegans</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0121-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The nervous system seamlessly integrates perception and action. This ability is essential for stable representation of and appropriate responses to the external environment. How the sensorimotor integration underlying this ability occurs at the level of individual neurons is of keen interest. In &lt;i&gt;C. elegans,&lt;/i&gt; RIA interneurons receive input from sensory pathways and have reciprocal connections with head motor neurons. RIA simultaneously encodes both head orientation and sensory stimuli, which may allow it to integrate these two signals to detect the spatial distribution of stimuli across head sweeps and generate directional head responses. Here, we show that blocking synaptic release from RIA disrupts head orientation behaviors in response to unilaterally presented stimuli. We found that sensory encoding in RIA is gated according to head orientation. This dependence on head orientation is independent of motor encoding in RIA, suggesting a second, posture-dependent pathway upstream of RIA. This gating mechanism may allow RIA to selectively attend to stimuli that are asymmetric across head sweeps. Attractive odor removal during head bends triggers rapid head withdrawal in the opposite direction. Unlike sensory encoding, this directional response is dependent on motor inputs to and synaptic output from RIA. Together, these results suggest that RIA is part of a sensorimotor pathway that is dynamically regulated according to head orientation at two levels: the first is a gate that filters sensory representations in RIA, and the second is a switch that routes RIA synaptic output to dorsal or ventral head motor neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Simple head orientation behaviors in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; provide an opportunity to dissect sensorimotor integration at the cellular and subcellular levels. We describe a single interneuron that coordinates posture, sensation, and movement to detect the spatial distribution of stimuli and direct motor output to guide navigation behavior. Our findings underscore the fundamental role of neural mechanisms for integrating sensory input into ongoing behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Inhibitory Projections from the Inferior Colliculus to the Medial Geniculate body Originate from Four Subtypes of GABAergic Cells</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0406-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;GABAergic cells constitute 20–40% of the cells that project from the inferior colliculus [(IC) a midbrain auditory hub] to the medial geniculate body [(MG) the main auditory nucleus of the thalamus]. Four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells have been identified based on their association with perineuronal nets (PNs) and dense rings of axosomatic terminals expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2 rings). These subtypes differ in their soma size and distribution within the IC. Based on previous work emphasizing large GABAergic cells as the origin of GABAergic IC–MG projections, we hypothesized that GABAergic IC cells surrounded by PNs and VGLUT2 rings, which tend to have larger somas, were more likely to project to the MG than smaller cells lacking these extracellular markers. Here, we injected retrograde tract tracers into the MG of guinea pigs of either sex and analyzed retrogradely labeled GABAergic cells in the ipsilateral IC for soma size and association with PNs and/or VGLUT2 rings. We found a range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC–MG pathway, which were reflective of the full range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC. Further, we found that all four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells participate in the IC–MG pathway, and that GABAergic cells lacking PNs and VGLUT2 rings were more prevalent within the pathway than would be expected based on their overall prevalence in the IC. These results may provide an anatomical substrate for the multiple roles of inhibition in the IC–MG pathway, which have emerged in electrophysiological studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: 3DMorph automatic analysis of microglial morphology in 3 dimensions from ex vivo and in vivo imaging</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0266-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Microglia are dynamic immune cells of the central nervous system, and their morphology is commonly used as a readout of cellular function. However, current morphological analysis techniques rely on either tracing of cells or 2D projection analysis, which are time-consuming, subject to bias, and may ignore important three-dimensional (3D) information. Therefore, we have created 3DMorph, a Matlab-based script that analyzes microglial morphology from 3D data. The program initially requires input of threshold levels, cell size expectations, and preferred methods of skeletonization. This makes 3DMorph easily scalable and adaptable to different imaging parameters or cell types. After these settings are defined, the program is completely automatic and can batch process files without user input. Output data includes cell volume, territorial volume, branch length, number of endpoints and branch points, and average distance between cells. We show that 3DMorph is accurate when compared to manual tracing, with significantly decreased user input time. Importantly, 3DMorph is capable of processing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microglial morphology, as well as other 3D branching cell types, from mouse cranial windows or acute hippocampal slices. Therefore, we present a novel, user-friendly, scalable, and semi-automatic method of analyzing cell morphology in 3 dimensions. This method should improve the accuracy of cell measurements, remove user bias between conditions, increase reproducibility between experimenters and labs, and reduce user input time. We provide this open source code on GitHub so that it is free and accessible to all investigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Microglial morphology is often considered to be an indicator of cellular activity, however current techniques to analyze morphology either lose valuable z-dimension information or are time intensive to perform. Therefore, we introduce 3DMorph, a MATLAB-based program that semi-automatically processes individual microglial morphology from overlapping 3D clusters, improving accuracy and processing time compared to current tools. 3DMorph is straightforward to use and adaptable to many imaging or experimental parameters. Once user settings are selected, 3DMorph can run in batch mode to automatically process multiple files. We validate 3DMorph against current techniques, and demonstrate the ability to detect differences in microglial morphologies from different &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; experimental conditions, as well as from &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data, and images of other branching cell types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Development of GABAergic inputs is not altered in early maturation of adult born dentate granule neurons in Fragile X mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0137-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation and the most common known cause of autism. Loss of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in mice (&lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO) leads to altered synaptic and circuit maturation in the hippocampus that are correlated with alterations in hippocampal-dependent behaviors. Previous studies have demonstrated that loss of FMRP increased the rate of proliferation of progenitor cells and altered their fate specification in adult &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. While these studies clearly demonstrate a role for FMRP in adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, it is not known whether the functional synaptic maturation and integration of adult born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) into hippocampal circuits is affected in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Here we used retroviral labeling to birthdate abDGCs in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice which allowed us to perform targeted patch clamp recording to measure the development of synaptic inputs to these neurons at precise time points after differentiation. The frequency and amplitude of spontaneous GABAergic events increased over the first three weeks after differentiation, however this normal development of GABAergic synapses was not altered in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Furthermore, the relatively depolarized GABA reversal potential (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;GABA&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) in immature abDGCs was unaffected by loss of FMRP as was the development of dendritic arbor of the adult generated neurons. These studies systematically characterized the functional development of abDGCs during the first four weeks after differentiation and demonstrate that the maturation of GABAergic synaptic inputs to these neurons is not grossly affected by the loss of FMRP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Loss of FMRP causes Fragile X Syndrome, a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that causes multiple alterations in the development of synapses and neurons. Previous studies have described a role for FMRP in neurogenesis and hippocampal-dependent conditioning tasks linked to neurogenesis. This study systematically assessed the functional development of GABAergic inputs to adult born dentate granule cells during the first four weeks after differentiation of adult neural stem cells in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Novelty and Dopaminergic Modulation of Memory Persistence: A Tale of Two Systems</title>

	<content:encoded>Adaptation to the ever-changing world is critical for survival, and our brains are particularly tuned to remember events that differ from previous experiences. Novel experiences induce dopamine release in the hippocampus, a process which promotes memory persistence. While axons from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were generally thought to be the exclusive source of hippocampal dopamine, recent studies have demonstrated that noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) corelease noradrenaline and dopamine in the hippocampus and that their dopamine release boosts memory retention as well.</content:encoded>
