Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Critical to progressing the field is the identification of molecular underpinnings necessary for microglia to carry out these important functions within neural circuits. Here, we focus a review specifically on roles for microglial cytokine signaling within developing and mature neural circuits. We review exciting new studies demonstrating essential roles for microglial cytokine signaling in axon outgrowth, synaptogenesis and synapse maturation during development, as well as synaptic transmission and plasticity in adulthood. Together, these studies identify microglia and cytokines as critical modulators of neural circuits within the healthy brain, with implications for a broad range of neurological disorders with disruptions in synaptic structure and function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095943881730137X-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

The morphological and molecular heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes and their progenitors point to functions beyond establishing saltatory nerve conduction. Here, we review the diversity in the oligodendroglial lineage as well as the classical and new functions identified for oligodendrocytes and their progenitors. Because oligodendroglia remain highly responsive to environmental changes, they likely contribute to various neurological and psychiatric diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent work suggests that they play a key role in regulating brain energy supply by increasing blood flow to regions where neurons are active, and setting the baseline level of blood flow. Controversy persists over whether lactate derived from astrocyte glycolysis is used to power oxidative phosphorylation in neurons, but astrocytes sustain neuronal ATP production by recycling neurotransmitter glutamate that would otherwise need to be resynthesised from glucose, and by providing a short-term energy store in the form of glycogen that can be mobilised when neurons are active. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

To achieve these precise shapes, glia and neurons exhibit coordinated morphological changes on the time scale of minutes and on size scales ranging from nanometers to hundreds of microns. Here, we review recent studies that reveal the highly dynamic, localized morphological changes of mammalian neuron–glia contacts. We then explore the power of Drosophila and C. elegans models to study coordinated changes at defined neuron–glia contacts, highlighting the use of innovative genetic and imaging tools to uncover the molecular mechanisms responsible for coordinated morphogenesis of neurons and glia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Derived from the yolk sac during development, microglia self-renew, self-regulate their numbers during homeostatic conditions, and show a robust proliferative capacity even in adulthood. Together with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), microglia coordinate the regeneration of CNS myelin around axons, termed remyelination. Gene expression analyses and experimental modelling have identified pro-remyelination roles for microglia/MDM in clearance of myelin debris, secretion of growth factors, and remodelling of the extracellular matrix. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms controlling these regenerative functions will reveal novel therapeutic strategies to enhance remyelination, by harnessing the beneficial effects of the innate immune response to injury. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Such findings are of importance since prenatal inflammation and microglia dysfunction have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. This review provides a selective overview of the early roles of microglia, their link with a specific spatiotemporal distribution and how they can be modulated by intrinsic factors or environmental signals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08041</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The goal of the present study is to identify autism using machine learning
techniques and resting-state brain imaging data, leveraging the temporal
variability of the functional connections (FC) as the only information. We
estimated and compared the FC variability across brain regions between typical,
healthy subjects and autistic population by analyzing brain imaging data from a
world-wide multi-site database known as ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data
Exchange). Our analysis revealed that patients diagnosed with autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) show increased FC variability in several brain regions that are
associated with low FC variability in the typical brain. We then used the
enhanced FC variability of brain regions as features for training machine
learning models for ASD classification and achieved 65% accuracy in
identification of ASD versus control subjects within the dataset. We also used
node strength estimated from number of functional connections per node averaged
over the whole scan as features for ASD classification.The results reveal that
the dynamic FC measures outperform or are comparable with the static FC
measures in predicting ASD.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07843</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human self has many facets: there is the physical body and then there are
different concepts or representations supported by processes in the brain such
as the ecological, social, temporal, conceptual, and experiential self. The
mechanisms of operation and formation of the self are, however, largely
unknown. The basis is constituted by the ecological or sensorimotor self that
deals with the configuration of the body in space and its action possibilities.
This self is prereflective, prelinguistic, and initially perhaps even largely
independent of visual inputs. Instead, somatosensory (tactile and
proprioceptive) information both before and after birth may play a key part. In
this paper, we propose that self-touch experience may be a fundamental
mechanisms to bootstrap the formation of the sensorimotor self and perhaps even
beyond. We will investigate this from the perspectives of phenomenology,
developmental psychology, and neuroscience. In light of the evidence from fetus
and infant development, we will speculate about the possible mechanisms that

	<content:encoded>Spike count correlations (SCCs) are ubiquitous in sensory cortices, are characterized by rich structure and arise from structured internal interactions. Yet, most theories of visual perception focus exclusively on the mean responses of individual neurons. Here, we argue that feedback interactions in primary visual cortex (V1) establish the context in which individual neurons process complex stimuli and that changes in visual context give rise to stimulus-dependent SCCs. Measuring V1 population responses to natural scenes in behaving macaques, we show that the fine structure of SCCs is stimulus-specific and variations in response correlations across-stimuli are independent of variations in response means. Moreover, we demonstrate that stimulus-specificity of SCCs in V1 can be directly manipulated by controlling the high-order structure of synthetic stimuli. We propose that stimulus-specificity of SCCs is a natural consequence of hierarchical inference where inferences on the presence of high-level image features modulate inferences on the presence of low-level features.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Sparse ordinal logistic regression and its application to brain decoding</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/238758v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain decoding with multivariate classification and regression has provided a powerful framework for characterizing information encoded in population neural activity. Classification and regression models are respectively used to predict discrete and continuous variables of interest. However, cognitive and behavioral parameters that we wish to decode are often ordinal variables whose values are discrete but ordered, such as subjective ratings. To date, there is no established method of predicting ordinal variables in brain decoding. In this study, we present a new algorithm, sparse ordinal logistic regression (SOLR), that combines ordinal logistic regression with Bayesian sparse weight estimation. We found that, in both simulation and analyses using real functional magnetic resonance imaging data, SOLR outperformed ordinal logistic regression with non-sparse regularization, indicating that sparseness leads to better decoding performance. SOLR also outperformed classification and linear regression models with the same type of sparseness, indicating the advantage of the modeling tailored to ordinal outputs. Our results suggest that SOLR provides a principled and effective method of decoding ordinal variables.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Unfolding of a noise-invariant neural representation of attended speech</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/238642v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In real-life multi-talker listening environments, the auditory system needs to isolate attended from distracting sound sources and to compensate for non-stationary acoustical conditions. How and at which stages of the central auditory pathway this is achieved is unclear. Here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the effect of continuously varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the neural response to speech while listeners (N=18) attended to one of two simultaneously presented, spatially non-segregated talkers. We show that the differential impact of attentional set (i.e., which talker to attend to) and SNR (i.e., which talker is louder) on successive components of neural phase-locking reflects the unfolding of an SNR-invariant representation of the target talker in time and cortical topography. Using a forward encoding-model approach, neural responses to the temporal envelopes of individual talkers and their respective modulation by both, attentional set and SNR were estimated. The model response yielded a clear succession of P1-N1-P2-like components and attention detection accuracies of ~80% in sensor and source space. The earlier component were driven almost exclusively by SNR, while the latest P2 component reflected only attentional set. Under the most adverse SNR, the modeled response yielded an additional, late component and enhanced low-frequency phase coherence to the ignored talker, which indicate contributions of a fronto-parietal attention network in suppressing irrelevant acoustic input. Modeling the neurocortical response can thus provide us with a comprehensive spatio-temporal view on how attentional filters for successful suppression of distracting sensory information are implemented neurally.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/238592v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In recent years, the development of algorithms to detect neuronal spiking activity from two-photon calcium imaging data has received much attention. Meanwhile, few researchers have examined the metrics used to assess the similarity of detected spike trains with the ground truth. We highlight the limitations of the two most commonly used metrics, the spike train correlation and success rate, and propose an alternative, which we refer to as CosMIC. Rather than operating on the true and estimated spike trains directly, the proposed metric assesses the similarity of the pulse trains obtained from convolution of the spike trains with a smoothing pulse. The pulse width, which is derived from the statistics of the imaging data, reflects the temporal tolerance of the metric. The final metric score is the size of the commonalities of the pulse trains as a fraction of their average size. Viewed through the lens of set theory, CosMIC resembles a continuous Sorensen-Dice coefficient - an index commonly used to assess the similarity of discrete, presence/absence data. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed metric to discriminate the precision and recall of spike train estimates. Unlike the spike train correlation, which appears to reward overfitting, the proposed metric score is maximised when the correct number of spikes have been detected. Furthermore, we show that CosMIC discriminates the temporal precision of estimates more consistently than either the success rate or the spike train correlation.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Aberrant cerebellar-default-mode functional connectivity underlying auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia revealed by multi-voxel pattern analysis of resting-state functional connectivity MRI data</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/238519v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Past neuroimaging studies have reported that aberrant functional connectivity (FC) underlying auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) in schizophrenia is highly distributed over multiple functional networks. There is thus a need for exploratory approaches without limiting analysis to particular seed regions or functional networks, to identify FC alterations underlying AVH. We applied a multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of FC together with a series of post-hoc FC analyses to resting-state fMRI data acquired from 25 patients with schizophrenia and 25 matched healthy controls. First, the MVPA revealed multiple clusters exhibiting altered FC patterns in schizophrenia. Subsequent multiple linear regression analysis using scores of these clusters identified that FC alteration in the right cerebellum crus I was significantly associated with the severity of AVH. Furthermore, post-hoc FC analysis with the right crus I as a seed revealed significant FC alterations with regions distributed across multiple functional networks, including speech, default-mode, thalamus, and cerebellum. Subsequent linear regression analyses further demonstrated that, among these regions, only reduced FC in the left precuneus was significantly associated with the severity of AVH. Our unbiased exploratory analysis of FC data revealed a novel evidence for the crucial role of FC between cerebellar and default-mode networks in AVH.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cell-type specific parallel circuits in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the central nucleus of the amygdala of the mouse</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/238493v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The central extended amygdala (EAc) is a forebrain macrosystem which has been widely implicated in fear, anxiety and pain. Its two key structures, the lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (STL) and the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA), share similar mesoscale connectivity. However, it is not known whether they also share similar cell-specific neuronal circuits. We addressed this question using tract-tracing and immunofluorescence to reveal the connectivity of two neuronal populations expressing either protein kinase C delta (PKC{delta}) or somatostatin (SOM). PKC{delta} and SOM are expressed predominantly in the dorsal part of STL (STLD) and in the lateral/capsular parts of CeA (CeL/C). We found that, in both STLD and CeL/C, PKC{delta}+ cells are the main recipient of extra-EAc inputs from the external lateral part of the parabrachial nucleus (LPBE), while SOM+ cells are the sources of long-range projections to extra-EAc targets, including LPBE and periaqueductal gray. PKC{delta}+ cells can also integrate inputs from posterior basolateral nucleus of amygdala or insular cortex. Within EAc, PKC{delta}+, but not SOM+ neurons, serve as the major source of projections to the ventral part of STL and to the medial part of CeA. However, both cell types mediate interconnections between STLD and CeL/C. These results unveil the pivotal positions of PKC{delta} and SOM neurons in organizing parallel cell-specific neuronal circuits of CeA and STL, which further support the idea of EAc as a structural and functional macrostructure.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/238352v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>During development, neurons form extensive synaptic connectivity with their fate-determined targets. Ectopic synapse formation with aberrant targets underlie various neurological disorders including autism. While we are beginning to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which extracellular ligand-receptor interactions enhance synapse specificity by inhibiting synaptogenesis, our knowledge about their intracellular mechanisms remains limited. Here we show that Rap2 GTPase (rap-2) and its effector, TNIK (mig-15), act downstream of Plexin (plx-1) signaling to restrict presynaptic assembly and to form tiled synaptic innervation of two cholinergic motor neurons (DA8 and DA9) in C. elegans. Both constitutively GTP- and GDP-forms of rap-2 mutants exhibit similar synaptic tiling defects as plx-1 mutants, suggesting that cycling of the RAP-2 nucleotide state is critical for synapse inhibition. Consistently, RAP-2 activity is suppressed in a short segment of axon lacking synapses where PLX-1 is enriched. Excessive ectopic synapse formation in mig-15 mutants causes expansion of the synaptic domains in DA8 and DA9, which induces a severe synaptic tiling defect. Conversely, overexpression of mig-15 strongly inhibited synapse formation, which suggests that mig-15 is a negative regulator of synapse formation. These results reveal that subcellular regulation of small GTPase activity by Plexin shapes proper synapse patterning in vivo.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/238246v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Prism adaptation is a well-known model to study sensorimotor adaptive processes. It has been shown that following prism exposure, after-effects are not only restricted to the sensorimotor level but extend as well into spatial cognition. The main purpose of the present study was to investigate in healthy individuals whether expansion to spatial cognition is restricted to adaptive processes peculiar to prism adaptation or whether it occurs as well following other forms of adaptive process such as adaptation to a novel dynamic environment during pointing movements. Representational after-effects were assessed by the perceptual line bisection task before and after adaptation to a leftward or a rightward force field. The main results showed that adaptation developed at sensorimotor level but did not produce after-effects in space representation. However appropriate analysis showed that the slower a participant de-adapt to a rightward dynamic perturbation, the stronger the influence on the perceptual midline judgment during the late phase of the bisection task. The discussion highlights the commonalities between prism and dynamic adaptation on the effects on space representation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/238113v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Using fMRI and functional connectivity analyses, it is possible to establish a functional connectome for an individual. The extent to which functional connectomes from adolescents and young adults remain identifiable across many years has not been investigated. Here we show in three publically available longitudinal resting-state fMRI datasets that connectome-based identification of adolescents and young adults scanned 1-3 years apart is possible at levels well above chance using whole-brain functional connectivity data. When we restrict the identification process to specific edges, we find that edges in the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices tend to lead to the highest identification rates. We also demonstrate that highly unique edges contributing the most to a successful ID tend to connect nodes in these same cortical regions, while edges contributing the least tend to connect cross-hemispheric homologs. These results suggest that despite developmental changes, adolescent and young adult subjects have unique and stable functional connectomes and that the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices are important in defining individual uniqueness in younger subjects.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Impaired expected value computations coupled with overreliance on prediction error learning in schizophrenia</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/238089v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: While many have emphasized impaired reward prediction error (RPE) signaling in schizophrenia, multiple studies suggest that some decision-making deficits may arise from overreliance on RPE systems together with a compromised ability to represent expected value. Guided by computational frameworks, we formulated and tested two scenarios in which maladaptive representation of expected value should be most evident, thereby delineating conditions that may evoke decision-making impairments in schizophrenia. Methods: In a modified reinforcement learning paradigm, 42 medicated people with schizophrenia (PSZ) and 36 healthy volunteers learned to select the most frequently rewarded option in a 75-25 pair: once when presented with more deterministic (90-10) and once when presented with more probabilistic (60-40) pairs. Novel and old combinations of choice options were presented in a subsequent transfer phase. Computational modeling was employed to elucidate contributions from RPE systems (actor-critic) and expected value (Q-learning). Results: PSZ showed robust performance impairments with increasing value difference between two competing options, which strongly correlated with decreased contributions from expected value-based (Q-learning) learning. Moreover, a subtle yet consistent contextual choice bias for the 'probabilistic' 75 option was present in PSZ, which could be accounted for by a context-dependent RPE in the actor-critic. Conclusions: We provide evidence that decision-making impairments in schizophrenia increase monotonically with demands placed on expected value computations. A contextual choice bias is consistent with overreliance on RPE-based learning, which may signify a deficit secondary to the maladaptive representation of expected value. These results shed new light on conditions under which decision-making impairments may arise.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/229948v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The neocortex is a six-layered laminated structure with a precise anatomical and functional organization ensuring proper function. Laminar positioning of cortical neurons, as determined by termination of neuronal migration, is a key determinant of their ability to assemble into functional circuits. However, the exact contribution of laminar placement to dendrite morphogenesis and synapse formation remains unclear. Here we manipulated the laminar position of cortical neurons by knocking down Dcx, a crucial effector of migration, and show that misplaced neurons fail to properly form dendrites, spines and functional glutamatergic synapses. We further show that knocking down Dcx in properly positioned neurons induces similar but milder defects, suggesting that the laminar misplacement is the primary cause of altered neuronal development. Thus, the specific laminar environment of their fated layers is crucial for the maturation of cortical neurons, and influences their functional integration into developing cortical circuits.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mechanistic modeling quantifies the influence of tumor growth kinetics on the response to anti-angiogenic treatment</title>

Tumors exploit angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature, in order to obtain nutrients required for continued growth and proliferation. Targeting factors that regulate angiogenesis, including the potent promoter vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is therefore an attractive strategy for inhibiting tumor growth. Computational modeling can be used to identify tumor-specific properties that influence the response to anti-angiogenic strategies. Here, we build on our previous systems biology model of VEGF transport and kinetics in tumor-bearing mice to include a tumor compartment whose volume depends on the “angiogenic signal” produced when VEGF binds to its receptors on tumor endothelial cells. We trained and validated the model using published &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; measurements of xenograft tumor volume, producing a model that accurately predicts the tumor’s response to anti-angiogenic treatment. We applied the model to investigate how tumor growth kinetics influence the response to anti-angiogenic treatment targeting VEGF. Based on multivariate regression analysis, we found that certain intrinsic kinetic parameters that characterize the growth of tumors could successfully predict response to anti-VEGF treatment, the reduction in tumor volume. Lastly, we use the trained model to predict the response to anti-VEGF therapy for tumors expressing different levels of VEGF receptors. The model predicts that certain tumors are more sensitive to treatment than others, and the response to treatment shows a nonlinear dependence on the VEGF receptor expression. Overall, this model is a useful tool for predicting how tumors will respond to anti-VEGF treatment, and it complements pre-clinical &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; mouse studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Fxm9nfQQELA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Central chemoreceptors are highly sensitive neurons that respond to changes in pH and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels. An increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; typically reflects a rise in the firing rate of these neurons, which stimulates an increase in ventilation. Here, we present an ionic current model that reproduces the basic electrophysiological activity of individual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive neurons from the locus coeruleus (LC). We used this model to explore chemoreceptor discharge patterns in response to electrical and chemical stimuli. The modeled neurons showed both stimulus-evoked activity and spontaneous activity under physiological parameters. Neuronal responses to electrical and chemical stimulation showed specific firing patterns of spike frequency adaptation, postinhibitory rebound, and post-stimulation recovery. Conversely, the response to chemical stimulation alone (based on physiological CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; changes), in the absence of external depolarizing stimulation, showed no signs of postinhibitory rebound or post-stimulation recovery, and no depolarizing sag. A sensitivity index for the firing-rate response to the different stimuli revealed that the contribution of an applied stimulus current exceeded that of the chemical signals. The firing-rate response increased indefinitely with injected depolarizing current, but reached saturation with chemical stimuli. Our computational model reproduced the regular pacemaker-like spiking pattern, action potential shape, and most of the membrane properties that characterize CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive neurons from the locus coeruleus. This validates the model and highlights its potential as a tool for studying the cellular mechanisms underlying the altered central chemosensitivity present in a variety of disorders such as sudden infant death syndrome, depression, and anxiety. In addition, the model results suggest that small external electrical signals play a greater role in determining the chemosensitive response to changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; than previously thought. This highlights the importance of considering electrical synaptic transmission in studies of intrinsic chemosensitivity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oQuj4KpDgu4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Tensor-driven extraction of developmental features from varying paediatric EEG datasets. (arXiv:1712.07443v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07443</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective. Consistently changing physiological properties in developing
children's brains challenges new data heavy technologies, like brain-computer
interfaces (BCI). Advancing signal processing methods in such technologies to
be more sensitive to developmental changes could help improve their function
and usability in paediatric populations. Taking advantage of the
multi-dimensional structure of EEG data through tensor analysis offers a
framework to extract relevant developmental features present in paediatric
resting-state EEG datasets. Methods. Three paediatric datasets from varying
developmental states and populations were analyzed using a developed two-step
constrained Parallel Factor (PARAFAC) tensor decomposition. The datasets
included the Muir Maxwell Epilepsy Centre, Children's Hospital Boston-MIT and
the Child Mind Institute, outlining two impaired and one healthy population,
respectively. Within dataset cross-validation used support vector machines
(SVM) for classification of out-of-fold data predicting subject age as a proxy
measure of development. t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE)
maps complemented classification analysis through visualization of the
high-dimensional feature structures. Main Results. Development-sensitive
features were successfully identified for the developmental conditions of each
dataset. SVM classification accuracy and misclassification costs were improved
significantly for both healthy and impaired paediatric populations. t-SNE maps
revealed suitable tensor factorization was key in extracting developmental
features. Significance. The described methods are a promising tool for
incorporating the unique developmental features present throughout childhood
EEG into new technologies like BCI and its applications.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07417</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Quantum cognition emerged as an important discipline of mathematical
psychology during the last two decades. Using abstract analogies between mental
phenomena and the formal framework of physical quantum theory, quantum
cognition demonstrated its ability to resolve several puzzles from cognitive
psychology, issued in the bounded rationality research program. Until now,
quantum cognition essentially exploited ideas from projective (Hilbert space)
geometry, such as quantum probability or quantum similarity. However, many
powerful tools provided by physical quantum theory, such as symmetry groups and
their representation theories, particularly local gauge symmetries and their
connection to physical forces, have not been utilized in the field of quantum
cognition research sofar. This is somewhat astonishing as &quot;mental forces&quot; or
&quot;mental energies&quot; appear as important metaphorical concepts in cognitive
science. One particular example is music psychology, where static or dynamic
tonal attraction phenomena are computationally often modeled in terms of
metaphorical forces. Inspired by seminal work by Guerino Mazzola on the
connection between musical forces and symmetries in tonal music, our study aims
at elucidating and reconciling musical forces in the framework of quantum
cognition. Based on the fundamental transposition symmetry of tonal music, as
reflected by the circle of fifths, we develop different wave function
descriptions over this underlying tonal space, governed by a Schr\&quot;odinger
equation containing different interaction energies. We present quantum models
for static and dynamic tonal attraction and compare them with traditional
computational models in musicology. Our approach turns out to be more
parsimonious and of greater explanatory power than symbolic models of music
perception.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Improvement of Resting-state EEG Analysis Process with Spectrum Weight-Voting based on LES. (arXiv:1712.07369v1 [eess.SP])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07369</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;EEG is a non-invasive technique for recording brain bioelectric activity,
which has potential applications in various fields such as human-computer
interaction and neuroscience. However, there are many difficulties in analyzing
EEG data, including its complex composition, low amplitude as well as low
signal-to-noise ratio. Some of the existing methods of analysis are based on
feature extraction and machine learning to differentiate the phase of
schizophrenia that samples belong to. However, medical research requires the
use of machine learning not only to give more accurate classification results,
but also to give the results that can be applied to pathological studies. The
main purpose of this study is to obtain the weight values as the representation
of influence of each frequency band on the classification of schizophrenia
phases on the basis of a more effective classification method using the LES
feature extraction, and then the weight values are processed and applied to
improve the accuracy of machine learning classification. We propose a method
called weight-voting to obtain the weights of sub-bands features by using
results of classification for voting to fit the actual categories of EEG data,
and using weights for reclassification. Through this method, we can first
obtain the influence of each band in distinguishing three schizophrenia phases,
and analyze the effect of band features on the risk of schizophrenia
contributing to the study of psychopathology. Our results show that there is a
high correlation between the change of weight of low gamma band and the
difference between HC, CHR and FES. If the features revised according to
weights are used for reclassification, the accuracy of result will be improved
compared with the original classifier, which confirms the role of the band
weight distribution.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03063</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optimization results are one method for understanding neural computation from
Nature's perspective and for defining the physical limits on neuron-like
engineering. Earlier work looks at individual properties or performance
criteria and occasionally a combination of two, such as energy and information.
Here we make use of Jaynes' maximum entropy method and combine a larger set of
constraints, possibly dimensionally distinct, each expressible as an
expectation. The method identifies a likelihood-function and a sufficient
statistic arising from each such optimization. This likelihood is a
first-hitting time distribution in the exponential class. Particular constraint
sets are identified that, from an optimal inference perspective, justify
earlier neurocomputational models. Interactions between constraints, mediated
through the inferred likelihood, restrict constraint-set parameterizations,
e.g., the energy-budget limits estimation performance which, in turn, matches
an axonal communication constraint. Such linkages are, for biologists,
experimental predictions of the method. In addition to the related likelihood,
at least one type of constraint set implies marginal distributions, and in this
case, a Shannon bits/joule statement arises.

	<content:encoded>Synaptic plasticity – the directed modulation of synaptic connections by specific activity histories or physiological signals – is believed to be a major mechanism for the modification of neuronal network function. This belief, however, has a ‘flip side’: the supposition that synapses do not change spontaneously in manners unrelated to such signals. Contrary to this supposition, recent studies reveal that synapses do change spontaneously, and to a fairly large extent. Here we review experimental results on spontaneous synaptic remodeling, its relative contributions to total synaptic remodeling, its statistical characteristics, and its physiological importance.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/238345v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Visual stimuli are encoded in the activity patterns of neocortical neuronal populations. Trial-averaged neuronal activity is selectively modulated by particular visual stimulus parameters, such as the direction of a moving bar of light, resulting in well-defined tuning properties. However, a large number of neurons in visual cortex remain unmodulated by any given stimulus parameter, and the role of this untuned population is not well understood. Here, we use two-photon calcium imaging to record, in an unbiased manner, from large populations of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons in mouse primary visual cortex to describe co-varying activity on single trials in populations consisting of tuned and untuned neurons. Specifically, we summarize pairwise covariability with an asymmetric partial correlation coefficient, allowing us to analyze the population correlation structure with graph theory. Using the graph neighbors of a neuron, we find that the local population, with contributions from tuned and untuned neurons, are able to predict individual neuron activity on a single trial basis and recapitulate average tuning properties of tuned neurons. We also find that a specific functional triplet motif in the graph results in the best predictions, suggesting a signature of informative correlations in these populations. Variance explained in total population activity scales with the number of neurons imaged, suggesting larger sample sizes are required to fully capture local network interactions. In summary, we show that unbiased sampling of the local population can explain single trial response variability as well as trial-averaged tuning properties in V1, and the ability to predict responses is tied to the occurrence of a functional triplet motif.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Lhx2 regulates temporal changes in chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding in retinal progenitor cells.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/238279v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) pass through multiple stages of developmental competence, where they successively acquire and lose the ability to generate individual cell subtypes. To identify the transcriptional regulatory networks that control these transitions, we conducted epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling of early and late-stage RPCs and observed a developmentally dynamic landscape of chromatin accessibility. Open chromatin regions that showed stage-specificity, as well as those shared by early and late-stage RPCs, were selectively targeted by the homeodomain factor Lhx2, which is expressed throughout retinal neurogenesis but also regulates many stage-specific processes in RPCs. Stage-specific Lhx2 binding sites were frequently associated with target sites for transcription factors that are preferentially expressed in either early or late-stage RPCs, and which were predicted to possess pioneer activity. Lhx2 loss of function in RPCs led to a loss of chromatin accessibility at both direct Lhx2 target sites and more broadly across the genome, as well as a loss of binding by transcription factors associated with stage-specific Lhx2 target sites. These findings demonstrate a central role for Lhx2 in control of chromatin accessibility in RPCs, and identify transcription factors that may guide stage-specific target site selection by Lhx2.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/238162v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Sensitive and specific antibodies are essential for detecting molecules in cells and tissues. However, currently used polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are often less sensitive than desired, difficult to produce, and available in limited quantities. A promising recent approach to circumvent these limitations is to employ chemically-defined antigen-combining sites called nanobodies, derived from single chain camelid antibodies. Here, we used nanobodies to prepare sensitive unimolecular detection reagents by genetically fusing cDNAs encoding nanobodies to enzymatic or antigenic reporters. We call these fusions between a reporter and a nanobody RANbodies. They can be used to localize epitopes and to amplify signals from fluorescent proteins. They be generated and purified simply and in unlimited amounts, and can be preserved safely and inexpensively in the form of DNA or digital sequence.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Real-time visual interactions across the boundary of awareness</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/237917v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The relationship between our conscious experiences of the visual world and the neuronal processes involved in the processing of visual information is a central theme of current research. However, it is not yet known whether conscious experiences possess unique quantitative or qualitative processing features. Recently we have shown that two visual stimuli, one consciously experienced and one not, interact as function of features and objects similarity, pointing to preserved visual representations in the absence of perceptual awareness. Here we ask whether these representations can be modified in the absence of perceptual awareness by testing interactions while the unperceived stimulus is being modified outside of one's awareness. Observers performed a Motion Induced Blindness task, wherein a plaid Target was morphed into a Gabor patch once disappearance was reported. Reappearances of the morphed target were induced by a visible Cue. Our results indicate that the effectiveness of the cue depends on the target representation during the time of suppression. Reappearance rates were highest when the morphed target and the cue share the same orientations. Our findings indicate that the target-cue interactions do not depend on memory-stored representations, but rather on the current state of the consciously unavailable target. We conclude that visual representations can be modified in the absence of conscious perception.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Data-driven brain-types and their cognitive consequences</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/237859v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The canonical approach to exploring brain-behaviour relationships is to group individuals according to a phenotype of interest, and then explore the neural correlates of this grouping. A limitation of this approach is that multiple aetiological pathways could result in the phenotype of interest, so the role of any one brain mechanism may be substantially underestimated. We show that recent advances in network analysis make it possible to group individuals at a neural level - to identify subgroups of individuals with similarly organized brains. Across three independent samples (total N = 313, mean age: 11.24 years, range: 5-21 years) we used a data-driven community clustering algorithm to identify robust subgroups using white-matter microstructure organization in childhood and adolescence. The algorithm indicated the presence of two groups of roughly equal sizes. A critical organizational difference between the groups was the role of the left and right cingulum. These different brain types had profoundly different cognitive abilities: Groups with higher FA in the cingulum performed better across assessments of fluid intelligence, vocabulary, verbal and visuospatial short-term and working memory, and longer-term memory. We next explored the potential mechanistic role of the cingulum. A connectomics analysis indicated reduced anterior-posterior structural connectivity in the low cingulum FA subgroup. We then used resting-state functional data from the same individuals and showed that cingulum FA was strongly related to activation of the default mode network. In summary, inter-individual differences in cingulum microstructural organisation allowed for biologically-based grouping, which has a dramatic effect on cognition and the functional activation of the default mode network. Using this new approach, we propose that the cingulum plays a key role in the integration of cortical areas, which is pivotal for cognitive ability in children and young people.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/237818v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>To understand the brain, molecular details need to be overlaid onto neural wiring diagrams so that synaptic mode, neuromodulation and critical signaling operations can be considered. Single-cell transcriptomics provide a unique opportunity to collect this information. Here we present an initial analysis of thousands of individual cells from Drosophila midbrain, that were acquired using Drop-Seq. A number of approaches permitted the assignment of transcriptional profiles to several major brain regions and cell-types. Expression of biosynthetic enzymes and reuptake mechanisms allows all the neurons to be typed according to the neurotransmitter or neuromodulator that they produce and presumably release. Some neuropeptides are preferentially co-expressed in neurons using a particular fast-acting transmitter, or monoamine. Neuromodulatory and neurotransmitter receptor subunit expression illustrates the potential of these molecules in generating complexity in neural circuit function. This cell atlas dataset provides an important resource to link molecular operations to brain regions and complex neural processes.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/237669v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In the past two decades, substantial amount of work characterized the odorant receptors, neuroanatomy and odorant response properties of the early olfactory system of Drosophila melanogaster. Yet many odorant receptors remain only partly characterized, the odorant transduction process and the axon hillock spiking mechanism have yet to be fully determined. The essential functionality of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) is to jointly encode both odorant identity and odorant concentration. We model identity and concentration by an odorant-receptor binding rate tensor modulated by the odorant concentration profile and an odorant-receptor dissociation rate tensor, and quantitatively describe the ligand binding/dissociation process. To validate our modeling approach, we first propose an algorithm for estimating the affinity and the dissociation rate of an odorant-receptor pair. We then apply the algorithm to estimate the affinity and dissociation rate for (acetone, Or59b) using two different datasets of electrophysiology recordings. Second, we evaluate the temporal response of the Or59b OSN model to acetone with a multitude of stimuli, including step, ramp and parabolic odorant waveforms. We further interrogate the model with staircase and white noise waveforms. Lastly, we evaluate the affinity and the dissociation rate for different odorant-receptor pairs including (methyl butyrate, Or59b) and (butyraldehyde, Or7a). We demonstrate how to evaluate the odorant transduction process and biological spike generator cascade underlying the fruit fly OSN model at the circuit level of the antennae and maxillary palps under two scenarios. First, we empirically estimate the odorant-receptor affinity of the active receptor model in response to constant concentration odorants using the spike count records in the DoOR database. Second, we evaluate and graphically visualize the temporal response of the antennae and maxillary palps using a staircase odorant concentration waveform. Finally, we describe how to construct, execute and explore various instantiations of the antennae and maxillary palps as a parallel information preprocessor in the open-source Fruit Fly Brain Observatory platform.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Gaze Behaviour During Sensorimotor Adaptation Parcellates the Explicit and Implicit Contributions to Learning</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/237651v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Successful motor performance relies on our ability to adapt to changes in the environment by learning novel mappings between motor commands and sensory outcomes. Such adaptation is thought to involve two distinct mechanisms: An implicit, error-based component linked to slow learning and an explicit, strategic component linked to fast learning and savings (i.e., faster relearning). Because behaviour, at any given moment, is the resultant combination of these two processes, it has remained a challenge to parcellate their relative contributions to performance. The explicit component to visuomotor rotation (VMR) learning has recently been measured by having participants verbally report their aiming strategy used to counteract the rotation. However, this procedure has been shown to magnify the explicit component. Here we tested whether task-specific eye movements, a natural component of reach planning, but poorly studied in motor learning tasks, can provide a direct read-out of the state of the explicit component during VMR learning. We show, by placing targets on a visible ring and including a delay between target presentation and reach onset, that individual differences in gaze patterns during sensorimotor adaptation are linked to participants' rates of learning and can predict the expression of savings. Specifically, we find that participants who, during reach planning, naturally fixate an aimpoint, rotated away from the target location, show faster initial adaptation and readaptation 24 hrs. later. Our results demonstrate that gaze behaviour can not only uniquely identify individuals who implement cognitive strategies during learning, but also how their implementation is linked to differences in learning.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Partial Correlation Analysis Reveals Abnormal Retinotopically Organized Functional Connectivity of Visual Areas in Amblyopia</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/237362v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Amblyopia is a prevalent developmental visual disorder of childhood that typically persists in adults. Due to altered visual experience during critical periods of youth, the structure and function of adult visual cortex is abnormal. In addition to substantial deficits shown with task-based fMRI, previous studies have used resting state measures to demonstrate altered long-range connectivity in amblyopia. This is the first study in amblyopia to analyze connectivity between regions of interest that are smaller than a single cortical area and to apply partial correlation analysis to reduce network effects. We specifically assess short-range connectivity between retinotopically defined regions of interest within the occipital lobe of 8 subjects with amblyopia and 7 subjects with normal vision (aged 19-45). The representations of visual areas V1, V2, and V3 within each of the four quadrants of visual space were further subdivided into three regions based on maps of visual field eccentricity. Connectivity between pairs of all nine regions of interest in each quadrant was tested via correlation and partial correlation for both groups. Only the tests of partial correlation, i.e., correlation between time courses of two regions following the regression of time courses from all other regions, yielded significant differences between resting state functional connectivity in amblyopic and normal subjects. Subjects with amblyopia showed significantly higher partial correlation between para-foveal and more eccentric representations within V1, and this effect associated with poor acuity of the worse eye. In addition, we observed reduced correlation in amblyopic subjects between iso-eccentricity regions in V1 and V2, and separately, between such regions in V2 and V3. We conclude that partial correlation-based connectivity is altered in an eccentricity-dependent pattern in visual field maps of amblyopic patients. Moreover, results are consistent with known clinical and psychophysical vision loss. More broadly, this provides evidence that abnormal cortical adaptations to disease may be better isolated with tests of partial correlation connectivity than with the regular correlation techniques that are currently widely used.</content:encoded>

Magnetic resonance imaging features were accordingly homogenous, with bilateral basal ganglia involvement (98%); the characteristic “putaminal eye” was seen in 53%. The urinary marker 3-methylglutaconic aciduria was present in virtually all patients (98%).

As a result, the optimal threshold to define the ischemic core in thrombectomy patients was rCBF &amp;lt;20% (area under the curve [AUC], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84, 0.94), whereas in alteplase controls the optimal ischemic core threshold remained rCBF &amp;lt;30% (AUC, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77, 0.85).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Boys in a famous choir: Singing and ticcing</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25112</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This informal observational study on the tic prevalence in 40 young singers was carried out during a public concert of Bach's Christmas Oratorio. Tics were highly prevalent (present in 35% = 14 boys). Given the possibility of an overrepresentation of perioral tics in this group of highly achieving young vocal artists, one might speculate that there is a relationship between the ability of the motor system to produce a surplus of movements (tics) and high performance (exquisite singing). Despite the unusual study design, with all its limitations, our observations strengthen the view that tics may be related to motor learning. However, alternative explanations, for example, that repetitive motor performance or personality traits in singers drive tic development, could also be true. In light of the boys choir's enchantment, the sole perception of tics as a disorder falls short of the properties of the motor system.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Efficient Algorithms for Searching the Minimum Information Partition in Integrated Information Theory. (arXiv:1712.06745v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06745</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to integrate information in the brain is considered to be an
essential property for cognition and consciousness. Integrated Information
Theory (IIT) hypothesizes that the amount of integrated information ($\Phi$) in
the brain is related to the level of consciousness. IIT proposes that to
quantify information integration in a system as a whole, integrated information
should be measured across the partition of the system at which information loss
caused by partitioning is minimized, called the Minimum Information Partition
(MIP). The computational cost for exhaustively searching for the MIP grows
exponentially with system size, making it difficult to apply IIT to real neural
data. It has been previously shown that if a measure of $\Phi$ satisfies a
mathematical property, submodularity, the MIP can be found in a polynomial
order by an optimization algorithm. However, although the first version of
$\Phi$ is submodular, the later versions are not. In this study, we empirically
explore to what extent the algorithm can be applied to the non-submodular
measures of $\Phi$ by evaluating the accuracy of the algorithm in simulated
data and real neural data. We find that the algorithm identifies the MIP in a
nearly perfect manner even for the non-submodular measures. Our results show
that the algorithm allows us to measure $\Phi$ in large systems within a
practical amount of time.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00579</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It has been repeatedly conjectured that the brain retrieves statistical
regularities from stimuli. Here we present a new statistical approach allowing
to address this conjecture. This approach is based on a new class of stochastic
processes driven by chains with memory of variable length. It leads to a new
experimental protocol in which sequences of auditory stimuli generated by a
stochastic chain are presented to volunteers while electroencephalographic
(EEG) data is recorded from their scalp. A new statistical model selection
procedure for functional data is introduced and proved to be consistent.
Applied to samples of EEG data collected using our experimental protocol it
produces results supporting the conjecture that the brain effectively
identifies the structure of the chain generating the sequence of stimuli.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Molecular recognition and packing frustration in a helical protein</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/OC7JzGxYhIA/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Loan Huynh, Chris Neale, Régis Pomès, Hue Sun Chan&lt;/p&gt;

Biomolecular recognition entails attractive forces for the functional native states and discrimination against potential nonnative interactions that favor alternate stable configurations. The challenge posed by the competition of nonnative stabilization against native-centric forces is conceptualized as frustration. Experiment indicates that frustration is often minimal in evolved biological systems although nonnative possibilities are intuitively abundant. Much of the physical basis of minimal frustration in protein folding thus remains to be elucidated. Here we make progress by studying the colicin immunity protein Im9. To assess the energetic favorability of nonnative versus native interactions, we compute free energies of association of various combinations of the four helices in Im9 (referred to as H1, H2, H3, and H4) by extensive explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations (total simulated time &amp;gt; 300 μs), focusing primarily on the pairs with the largest native contact surfaces, H1-H2 and H1-H4. Frustration is detected in H1-H2 packing in that a nonnative packing orientation is significantly stabilized relative to native, whereas such a prominent nonnative effect is not observed for H1-H4 packing. However, in contrast to the favored nonnative H1-H2 packing in isolation, the native H1-H2 packing orientation is stabilized by H3 and loop residues surrounding H4. Taken together, these results showcase the contextual nature of molecular recognition, and suggest further that nonnative effects in H1-H2 packing may be largely avoided by the experimentally inferred Im9 folding transition state with native packing most developed at the H1-H4 rather than the H1-H2 interface.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OC7JzGxYhIA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A Prospective Trial of Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound Thalamotomy for Essential Tremor: Results at the 2-year Follow-up</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25126</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has recently been investigated as a new treatment modality for essential tremor (ET), but the durability of the procedure has not yet been evaluated. This study reports results at a 2- year follow-up after MRgFUS thalamotomy for ET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 76 patients with moderate-to-severe ET, who had not responded to at least two trials of medical therapy, were enrolled in the original randomized study of unilateral thalamotomy and evaluated using the clinical rating scale for tremor. Sixty-seven of the patients continued in the open-label extension phase of the study with monitoring for 2 years. Nine patients were excluded by two years, for example because of alternative therapy such as deep brain stimulation (n = 3) or inadequate thermal lesioning (n = 1). However, all patients in each follow-up period were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Mean hand tremor score at baseline (19.8±4.9, 76 patients) improved by 55% at 6 months (8.6±4.5, 75 patients). The improvement in tremor score from baseline was durable at 1 year (53%, 8.9±4.8, 70 patients) and at 2 years (56%, 8.8±5.0, 67 patients). Similarly, the disability score at baseline (16.4±4.5, 76 patients) improved by 64% at 6 months (5.4±4.7, 75 patients). This improvement was also sustained at 1 year (5.4±5.3, 70 patients) and at 2 years (6.5±5.0, 67 patients). Paresthesias and gait disturbances were the most common adverse effects at 1 year-each observed in 10 patients with an additional 5 patients experiencing neurological adverse effects. None of the adverse events worsened over the period of follow up and 2 of these resolved. There were no new delayed complications at 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Tremor suppression after MRgFUS thalamotomy for ET is stably maintained at 2 years. Latent or delayed complications do not develop after treatment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: MYRF is associated with encephalopathy with reversible myelin vacuolization</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25125</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reversible myelin vacuolization is associated with variable conditions including mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS), which is characterized by mildly impaired consciousness and transient splenial lesion. Familial and/or recurrent cases with a clinical diagnosis of MERS suggest the presence of genetic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined a family in which the proband presented with a history of recurrent encephalopathy with extensive but reversible cerebral myelin vacuolization and neurological symptoms similar to those of MERS spanning over three generations. Whole-exome sequencing was performed in family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight rare nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants shared by all patients were identified. By filtering genes expressed in the corpus callosum, we identified a heterozygous c.1208A&amp;gt;G predicting p.Gln403Arg in the highly conserved DNA-binding domain in the myelin regulatory factor (&lt;em&gt;MYRF&lt;/em&gt;) gene. We subsequently screened the coding regions of &lt;em&gt;MYRF&lt;/em&gt; by Sanger sequencing in our cohort comprised of 33 sporadic cases with MERS and three cases in another family with extensive myelin vacuolization, and identified the same heterozygous c.1208A&amp;gt;G in all affected members in the second family. Luciferase assay revealed that transcriptional activity of N-terminal region of MYRF was significantly diminished by introducing the c.1208A&amp;gt;G variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MYRF is a transcriptional regulator that is necessary for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin maintenance. Functional defects of MYRF are likely to be causally associated with encephalopathy with extensive myelin vacuolization. We propose the term “&lt;em&gt;MYRF&lt;/em&gt;-related mild encephalopathy with reversible myelin vacuolization (MMERV)”. Our findings provide a new perspective on the pathogenesis of myelin vacuolization. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06353</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The characterisation of biomarkers and endophenotypic measures has been a
central goal of research in psychiatry over the last years. While most of this
research has focused on the identification of biomarkers and endophenotypes,
using various experimental approaches, it has been recognised that their
instantiations, through computational models, have a great potential to help us
understand and interpret these experimental results. However, the enormous
increase in available neurophysiological and neurocognitive as well as
computational data also poses new challenges. How can a researcher stay on top
of the experimental literature? How can computational modelling data be
efficiently compared to experimental data? How can computational modelling most
effectively inform experimentalists? Recently, a general scientific framework
for the generation of executable tests that automatically compare model results
to experimental observations, SciUnit, has been proposed. Here we exploit this
framework for research in psychiatry to address the challenges mentioned above.
We extend the SciUnit framework by adding an experimental database, which
contains a comprehensive collection of relevant experimental observations, and
a prediction database, which contains a collection of predictions generated by
computational models. Together with appropriately designed SciUnit tests and
methods to mine and visualise the databases, model data and test results, this
extended framework has the potential to greatly facilitate the use of
computational models in psychiatry. As an initial example we present ASSRUnit,
a module for auditory steady-state response deficits in psychiatric disorders.

Predicting novel microRNA (miRNA)-disease associations is clinically significant due to miRNAs’ potential roles of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for various human diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated the viability of utilizing different types of biological data to computationally infer new disease-related miRNAs. Yet researchers face the challenge of how to effectively integrate diverse datasets and make reliable predictions. In this study, we presented a computational model named Laplacian Regularized Sparse Subspace Learning for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (LRSSLMDA), which projected miRNAs/diseases’ statistical feature profile and graph theoretical feature profile to a common subspace. It used Laplacian regularization to preserve the local structures of the training data and a &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-norm constraint to select important miRNA/disease features for prediction. The strength of dimensionality reduction enabled the model to be easily extended to much higher dimensional datasets than those exploited in this study. Experimental results showed that LRSSLMDA outperformed ten previous models: the AUC of 0.9178 in global leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) and the AUC of 0.8418 in local LOOCV indicated the model’s superior prediction accuracy; and the average AUC of 0.9181+/-0.0004 in 5-fold cross validation justified its accuracy and stability. In addition, three types of case studies further demonstrated its predictive power. Potential miRNAs related to Colon Neoplasms, Lymphoma, Kidney Neoplasms, Esophageal Neoplasms and Breast Neoplasms were predicted by LRSSLMDA. Respectively, 98%, 88%, 96%, 98% and 98% out of the top 50 predictions were validated by experimental evidences. Therefore, we conclude that LRSSLMDA would be a valuable computational tool for miRNA-disease association prediction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8AF4L8T4qyg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Optimal number of spacers in CRISPR arrays</title>

Prokaryotic organisms survive under constant pressure of viruses. CRISPR-Cas system provides its prokaryotic host with an adaptive immune defense against viruses that have been previously encountered. It consists of two components: Cas-proteins that cleave the foreign DNA and CRISPR array that suits as a virus recognition key. CRISPR array consists of a series of spacers, short pieces of DNA that originate from and match the corresponding parts of viral DNA called protospacers. Here we estimate the number of spacers in a CRISPR array of a prokaryotic cell which maximizes its protection against a viral attack. The optimality follows from a competition between two trends: too few distinct spacers make host vulnerable to an attack by a virus with mutated corresponding protospacers, while an excessive variety of spacers dilutes the number of the CRISPR complexes armed with the most recent and thus most useful spacers. We first evaluate the optimal number of spacers in a simple scenario of an infection by a single viral species and later consider a more general case of multiple viral species. We find that depending on such parameters as the concentration of CRISPR-Cas interference complexes and its preference to arm with more recently acquired spacers, the rate of viral mutation, and the number of viral species, the predicted optimal number of spacers lies within a range that agrees with experimentally-observed values.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1nIpevm5XbY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Survival analysis represents an important outcome measure in clinical research and clinical trials; further, survival ranking may offer additional advantages in clinical trials. In this study, we developed a non-parametric ranking-based technique to transform patients' survival data into a linear space of hazard ranks. The transformation enables the utilization of machine learning base-learners including Gaussian process regression, Lasso, and random forest on survival data. The method was submitted to the DREAM Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Stratification Challenge. Ranked first place, the model gave more accurate ranking predictions on the PRO-ACT ALS dataset in comparison to Cox proportional hazard model. By utilizing right-censored data in its training process, the method demonstrated its state-of-the-art predictive power in ALS survival ranking. Its feature selection identified multiple important factors, some of which conflicts with previous studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6KF5NSd6aag&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Current models of sensorimotor control posit that motor commands are generated by combining multiple modules which may consist of internal models, motor primitives or motor synergies. The mechanisms which select modules based on task requirements and modify their output during learning are therefore critical to our understanding of sensorimotor control. Here we develop a novel modular architecture for multi-dimensional tasks in which a set of fixed primitives are each able to compensate for errors in a single direction in the task space. The contribution of the primitives to the motor output is determined by both top-down contextual information and bottom-up error information. We implement this model for a task in which subjects learn to manipulate a dynamic object whose orientation can vary. In the model, visual information regarding the context (the orientation of the object) allows the appropriate primitives to be engaged. This top-down module selection is implemented by a Gaussian function tuned for the visual orientation of the object. Second, each module's contribution adapts across trials in proportion to its ability to decrease the current kinematic error. Specifically, adaptation is implemented by cosine tuning of primitives to the current direction of the error, which we show to be theoretically optimal for reducing error. This error-tuned model makes two novel predictions. First, interference should occur between alternating dynamics only when the kinematic errors associated with each oppose one another. In contrast, dynamics which lead to orthogonal errors should not interfere. Second, kinematic errors alone should be sufficient to engage the appropriate modules, even in the absence of contextual information normally provided by vision. We confirm both these predictions experimentally and show that the model can also account for data from previous experiments. Our results suggest that two interacting processes account for module selection during sensorimotor control and learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EJRADLSVu2E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Invariant recognition drives neural representations of action sequences</title>

Recognizing the actions of others from visual stimuli is a crucial aspect of human perception that allows individuals to respond to social cues. Humans are able to discriminate between similar actions despite transformations, like changes in viewpoint or actor, that substantially alter the visual appearance of a scene. This ability to generalize across complex transformations is a hallmark of human visual intelligence. Advances in understanding action recognition at the neural level have not always translated into precise accounts of the computational principles underlying what representations of action sequences are constructed by human visual cortex. Here we test the hypothesis that invariant action discrimination might fill this gap. Recently, the study of artificial systems for static object perception has produced models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), that achieve human level performance in complex discriminative tasks. Within this class, architectures that better support invariant object recognition also produce image representations that better match those implied by human and primate neural data. However, whether these models produce representations of action sequences that support recognition across complex transformations and closely follow neural representations of actions remains unknown. Here we show that spatiotemporal CNNs accurately categorize video stimuli into action classes, and that deliberate model modifications that improve performance on an invariant action recognition task lead to data representations that better match human neural recordings. Our results support our hypothesis that performance on invariant discrimination dictates the neural representations of actions computed in the brain. These results broaden the scope of the invariant recognition framework for understanding visual intelligence from perception of inanimate objects and faces in static images to the study of human perception of action sequences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O-ttRSy9wU0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Filament turnover tunes both force generation and dissipation to control long-range flows in a model actomyosin cortex</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/lHK-if0u2KM/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by William M. McFadden, Patrick M. McCall, Margaret L. Gardel, Edwin M. Munro&lt;/p&gt;

Actomyosin-based cortical flow is a fundamental engine for cellular morphogenesis. Cortical flows are generated by cross-linked networks of actin filaments and myosin motors, in which active stress produced by motor activity is opposed by passive resistance to network deformation. Continuous flow requires local remodeling through crosslink unbinding and and/or filament disassembly. But how local remodeling tunes stress production and dissipation, and how this in turn shapes long range flow, remains poorly understood. Here, we study a computational model for a cross-linked network with active motors based on minimal requirements for production and dissipation of contractile stress: Asymmetric filament compliance, spatial heterogeneity of motor activity, reversible cross-links and filament turnover. We characterize how the production and dissipation of network stress depend, individually, on cross-link dynamics and filament turnover, and how these dependencies combine to determine overall rates of cortical flow. Our analysis predicts that filament turnover is required to maintain active stress against external resistance and steady state flow in response to external stress. Steady state stress increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, then decreases with lifetime above &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;. Effective viscosity increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, and then becomes independent of filament lifetime and sharply dependent on crosslink dynamics. These individual dependencies of active stress and effective viscosity define multiple regimes of steady state flow. In particular our model predicts that when filament lifetimes are shorter than both &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, the dependencies of effective viscosity and steady state stress on filament turnover cancel one another, such that flow speed is insensitive to filament turnover, and shows a simple dependence on motor activity and crosslink dynamics. These results provide a framework for understanding how animal cells tune cortical flow through local control of network remodeling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lHK-if0u2KM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The need for high-throughput, precise, and meaningful methods for measuring
behavior has been amplified by our recent successes in measuring and
manipulating neural circuitry. The largest challenges associated with moving in
this direction, however, are not technical but are instead conceptual: what
numbers should one put on the movements an animal is performing (or not
performing)? In this review, I will describe how theoretical and data
analytical ideas are interfacing with recently-developed computational and
experimental methodologies to answer these questions across a variety of
contexts, length scales, and time scales. I will attempt to highlight
commonalities between approaches and areas where further advances are necessary
to place behavior on the same quantitative footing as other scientific fields.

Over the past decades, quantitative methods linking theory and observation became increasingly important in many areas of life science. Subsequently, a large number of mathematical and computational models has been developed. The BioModels database alone lists more than 140,000 Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models. However, while the exchange within specific models classes has been supported by standardisation and database efforts, the generic application and especially the re-use of models is still limited by practical issues such as easy and straight forward model execution. MAGPIE, a Modeling and Analysis Generic Platform with Integrated Evaluation, closes this gap by providing a software platform for both, publishing and executing computational models without restrictions on the programming language, thereby combining a maximum on flexibility for programmers with easy handling for non-technical users. MAGPIE goes beyond classical SBML platforms by including &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; models, independent of the underlying programming language, ranging from simple script models to complex data integration and computations. We demonstrate the versatility of MAGPIE using four prototypic example cases. We also outline the potential of MAGPIE to improve transparency and reproducibility of computational models in life sciences. A demo server is available at magpie.imb.medizin.tu-dresden.de.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/V972smzk-78&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Optimal occlusion uniformly partitions red blood cells fluxes within a microvascular network</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/5_-91bcH5rs/article</link>

In animals, gas exchange between blood and tissues occurs in narrow vessels, whose diameter is comparable to that of a red blood cell. Red blood cells must deform to squeeze through these narrow vessels, transiently blocking or occluding the vessels they pass through. Although the dynamics of vessel occlusion have been studied extensively, it remains an open question why microvessels need to be so narrow. We study occlusive dynamics within a model microvascular network: the embryonic zebrafish trunk. We show that pressure feedbacks created when red blood cells enter the finest vessels of the trunk act together to uniformly partition red blood cells through the microvasculature. Using mathematical models as well as direct observation, we show that these occlusive feedbacks are tuned throughout the trunk network to prevent the vessels closest to the heart from short-circuiting the network. Thus occlusion is linked with another open question of microvascular function: how are red blood cells delivered at the same rate to each micro-vessel? Our analysis shows that tuning of occlusive feedbacks increase the total dissipation within the network by a factor of 11, showing that uniformity of flows rather than minimization of transport costs may be prioritized by the microvascular network.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5_-91bcH5rs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: High-frequency oscillations are not better biomarkers of epileptogenic tissues than spikes</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25124</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracerebral EEG (stereoelectroencephalography, SEEG) are considered as better biomarkers of epileptogenic tissues than spikes. How this can be applied at the patient level remains poorly understood. We investigated how well the HFOs and the spikes can predict epileptogenic regions with a large spatial sampling at the patient level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We analyzed non-REM sleep SEEG recordings sampled at 2,048Hz of thirty patients. Ripples (R, 80-250Hz), fast ripples (FR, 250-500Hz) and spikes were automatically detected. Rates of these markers and several combinations – spikes co-occurring with HFOs or FRs and cross rate (Spk⊗HFO) – were compared to a quantified measure of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) by performing a receiver operating characteristic analysis for each patient individually. We used a Wilcoxon sign rank test corrected for false-discovery rate to assess whether a marker was better than the others for predicting the SOZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 2930 channels was analyzed (median of 100 channels per patient). The HFOs or any of its variants were not statistically better than spikes. Only one feature, the cross-rate was better than all the other markers. Moreover, fast ripples, even though very specific, were not delineating all epileptogenic tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: At the patient level, the performance of the HFOs is weakened by the presence of strong physiological HFO generators. Fast ripples are not sensitive enough to be the unique biomarker of epileptogenicity. Nevertheless, combining HFOs and spikes using our proposed measure –the cross rate– is a better strategy than using only one marker. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Person-specific contribution of neuropathologies to cognitive loss in old age</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25123</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Mixed neuropathologies are the most common cause of dementia at the population level, but how different neuropathologies contribute to cognitive decline at the individual level remains unknown. We quantified the contribution of nine neuropathologies to cognitive loss at an individual level. Methods: Participants (n=1,079) came from 2 longitudinal clinical-pathologic studies of aging. All completed 2+ cognitive evaluations (maximum = 22), died and underwent neuropathologic examinations to identify Alzheimer's disease (AD), other neurodegenerative diseases, and vascular pathologies. Linear mixed models examined associations of neuropathologies with cognitive decline and estimated the proportion of cognitive loss accounted for by each neuropathology at a person-specific level. Results: Neuropathology was ubiquitous, with 94% of participants having 1+, 78% having 2+, 58% having 3+, and 35% having 4+. AD was most frequent (65%) but rarely occurred in isolation (9%). Remarkably, more than 230 different neuropathologic combinations were observed, each of which occurred in &amp;lt;6% of the cohort. The relative contributions of specific neuropathologies to cognitive loss varied widely across individuals. Although AD accounted for an average of about 50% of the observed cognitive loss, the proportion accounted for at the individual level ranged widely from 22% to 100%. Lewy bodies and hippocampal sclerosis also had potent effects, but again their impacts varied at the person-specific level. Interpretation: There is much greater heterogeneity in the comorbidity and cognitive impact of age-related neuropathologies than currently appreciated, suggesting an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches that embrace the complexity of disease to combat cognitive decline in old age.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monoclonal antibodies that target CD20 expressing B cells represent an important new treatment option for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). B cell depleting therapy is highly effective against relapsing forms of the disease, and is also the first treatment approach proven to protect against disability worsening in primary progressive MS. Moreover, evolving clinical experience with B cell therapy, combined with a more sophisticated understanding of humoral immunity in preclinical models and in patients with MS, have led to major progress in deciphering the immune pathogenesis of MS. Here, we review the nuanced roles of B cells in MS autoimmunity, the clinical data supporting use of ocrelizumab and other anti-CD20 therapies in the treatment of MS, as well as safety and practical considerations for prescribing. Lastly, we summarize remaining unanswered questions regarding the proper role of anti-CD20 therapy in MS, its limitations, and the future landscape of B cell based approaches to treatment.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To determine the pathogenic mechanisms of autoantibodies to the cell adhesion molecule Caspr2 in acquired neuromyotonia and autoimmune encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Caspr2 positive samples were confirmed using a cell-based assay, and their IgG subtypes were determined by ELISA and cell-based assay. A solid phase binding assay quantified the binding of Caspr2 to contactin-2 in the presence of Caspr2 autoantibodies. Living cultures of primary rat hippocampal neurons were incubated with Caspr2-positive or control sera and the distribution of Caspr2-positive immunofluorescent puncta and total surface Caspr2 were quantified. HEK cells transfected to express Caspr2 were incubated with Caspr2-positive or control samples, and cell-surface biotinylation and Western blot were used to assess total, internalized, and surface levels of Caspr2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We confirmed six samples with strong Caspr2 reactivity. IgG4 Caspr2 antibodies were present in all six cases. Caspr2 interacted with another cell adhesion molecule, contactin-2, with nanomolar affinity in the solid phase assay, and Caspr2 autoantibodies inhibited this interaction. Caspr2 autoantibodies did not affect the surface expression of Caspr2 in rat primary hippocampal neurons or transfected HEK cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Caspr2 autoantibodies inhibit the interaction of Caspr2 with contactin-2 but do not cause internalization of Caspr2. Functional blocking of cell adhesion molecule interactions represents a potential mechanism with therapeutic implications for IgG4 autoantibodies to cell adhesion molecules in neurological diseases.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Motor sequence awareness in impaired in dystonia despite normal performance</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25121</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;/b&gt;: Dystonia is a movement disorder that has been associated with impaired motor learning and sequence recognition. However, despite evidence that patients with dystonia have a reduced sense of agency, it is unclear whether dystonia is specifically associated with impaired recognition of a &lt;em&gt;movement&lt;/em&gt; sequence. We have shown previously that performance consistency in the temporal and kinematic domains predicts awareness of underlying motor patterns in a finger tapping task. Because movements in dystonia are characterized by high variability, we predicted that subjects with dystonia would have decreased motor sequence awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;METHODS: Subjects with dystonia (n= 20) and healthy control adults (n= 30) performed finger tapping sequences with a common motor pattern and changing stimulus-to-response mappings. Subjects were said to be “aware” of the motor pattern if they recognized their fingers moved in the same order during each stimulus-to-response remapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RESULTS&lt;/b&gt;: Subjects with dystonia had decreased motor pattern awareness, but those differences were not due to greater performance variability. Subjects with dystonia tapped sequences as series of discrete movements, rather than as a combined series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTERPRETATION: Dystonia is associated with impaired recognition of a repeating movement pattern. This difference may result from a strategy to separate sequential elements and attend to them individually. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Inadequate Brain Glycogen or Sleep Increases Spreading Depression Susceptibility</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25122</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Glycogen in astrocyte endfeet contributes to maintenance of low extracellular glutamate and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations around synapses. Sleep deprivation (SD), a common migraine trigger induces transcriptional changes in astrocytes reducing glycogen breakdown. We hypothesize that when glycogen utilization cannot match synaptic energy demand, extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can rise to levels that activate neuronal pannexin-1 channels and downstream inflammatory pathway, which might be one of the mechanisms initiating migraine headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We suppressed glycogen breakdown by inhibiting glycogen phosphorylation with 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol (DAB) and by SD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: DAB caused neuronal pannexin-1 large-pore opening and activation of the downstream inflammatory pathway as shown by procaspase-1 cleavage and HMGB1 release from neurons. Six-hour SD induced pannexin-1 mRNA. DAB and SD also lowered the cortical spreading depression (CSD) induction threshold, which was reversed by glucose or lactate supplement, suggesting that glycogen-derived energy substrates are needed to prevent CSD generation. Supporting this, knocking-down neuronal lactate transporter, MCT2 with an anti-sense oligonucleotide or inhibiting glucose transport from vessels to astrocytes with intracerebroventricularly given phloretin reduced the CSD threshold. In vivo recordings with a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive/selective fluoroprobe, APG-4 disclosed that DAB treatment or SD caused significant rise in extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; during whisker-stimulation, illustrating the critical role of glycogen in extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Synaptic metabolic stress caused by insufficient glycogen-derived energy substrate supply can activate neuronal pannexin-1 channels as well as lowering the CSD threshold.

	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25111-sec-0101&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focal seizures are assumed to arise from a hypersynchronous activity affecting a circumscribed brain region. Using microelectrodes in seizure-generating deep mesial regions of 9 patients, we investigated the firing of hundreds of single neurons before, during, and after ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) discharges. Neuronal spiking activity at seizure initiation was highly heterogeneous and not hypersynchronous. Furthermore, groups of neurons showed significant changes in activity minutes before the seizure with no concomitant changes in the corresponding macroscopic EEG recordings. Altogether, our findings suggest that only limited subsets of neurons in epileptic depth regions initiate the seizure-onset and that ictogenic mechanisms operate in submillimeter-scale microdomains.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Adaptation to criticality through organizational invariance in embodied agents. (arXiv:1712.05284v1 [nlin.AO])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05284</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many biological and cognitive systems do not operate deep within one or other
regime of activity. Instead, they are poised at critical points located at
transitions of their parameter space. The pervasiveness of criticality suggests
that there may be general principles inducing this behaviour, yet there is no
well-founded theory for understanding how criticality is found at a wide range
of levels and contexts. In this paper we present a general adaptive mechanism
that maintains an internal organizational structure in order to drive a system
towards critical points while it interacts with different environments. We
implement the mechanism in artificial embodied agents controlled by a neural
network maintaining a correlation structure randomly sampled from an Ising
model at critical temperature. Agents are evaluated in two classical
reinforcement learning scenarios: the Mountain Car and the Acrobot double
pendulum. In both cases the neural controller reaches a point of criticality,
which coincides with a transition point between two regimes of the agent's
behaviour. These results suggest that adaptation to criticality could be used
as a general adaptive mechanism in some circumstances, providing an alternative
explanation for the pervasive presence of criticality in biological and
cognitive systems.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Towards Deep Modeling of Music Semantics using EEG Regularizers. (arXiv:1712.05197v2 [cs.IR] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05197</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Modeling of music audio semantics has been previously tackled through
learning of mappings from audio data to high-level tags or latent unsupervised
spaces. The resulting semantic spaces are theoretically limited, either because
the chosen high-level tags do not cover all of music semantics or because audio
data itself is not enough to determine music semantics. In this paper, we
propose a generic framework for semantics modeling that focuses on the
perception of the listener, through EEG data, in addition to audio data. We
implement this framework using a novel end-to-end 2-view Neural Network (NN)
architecture and a Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) loss function
that forces the semantic embedding spaces of both views to be maximally
correlated. We also detail how the EEG dataset was collected and use it to
train our proposed model. We evaluate the learned semantic space in a transfer
learning context, by using it as an audio feature extractor in an independent
dataset and proxy task: music audio-lyrics cross-modal retrieval. We show that
our embedding model outperforms Spotify features and performs comparably to a
state-of-the-art embedding model that was trained on 700 times more data. We
further discuss improvements to the model that are likely to improve its
performance.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Why early tactile speech aids may have failed: no perceptual integration of tactile and auditory signals. (arXiv:1712.04987v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04987</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tactile speech aids, though extensively studied in the 1980s and 90s, never
became a commercial success. A hypothesis to explain this failure might be that
it is difficult to obtain true perceptual integration of a tactile signal with
information from auditory speech: exploitation of tactile cues from a tactile
aid might require cognitive effort and so prevent speech understanding at the
high rates typical of everyday speech. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to
create true perceptual integration of tactile with auditory information in what
might be considered the simplest situation encountered by a hearing-impaired
listener. We created an auditory continuum between the syllables BA and VA, and
trained participants to associate BA to one tactile stimulus VA to another
tactile stimulus. After training, we tested if auditory discrimination along
the continuum between the two syllables could be biased by incongruent tactile
stimulation. We found that such a bias occurred only when the tactile stimulus
was above its previously measured tactile discrimination threshold. Such a
pattern is compatible with the idea that the effect is due to a cognitive or
decisional strategy, rather than to truly perceptual integration. We therefore
ran a further study, where we created a tactile version of the McGurk effect.
We extensively trained two Subjects over six days to associate four recorded
auditory syllables with four corresponding apparent motion tactile patterns. In
a subsequent test, we presented stimulation that was either congruent or
incongruent with the learnt association, and asked Subjects to report the
syllable they perceived. We found no analog to the McGurk effect. These
findings strengthen our hypothesis according to which tactile aids failed
because integration of tactile cues with auditory speech occurred at a
cognitive or decisional level, rather than truly at a perceptual level

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Costs of task allocation with local feedback: Effects of colony size and extra workers in social insects and other multi-agent systems</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Xk21hJ2vyb0/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Tsvetomira Radeva, Anna Dornhaus, Nancy Lynch, Radhika Nagpal, Hsin-Hao Su&lt;/p&gt;

Adaptive collective systems are common in biology and beyond. Typically, such systems require a task allocation algorithm: a mechanism or rule-set by which individuals select particular roles. Here we study the performance of such task allocation mechanisms measured in terms of the time for individuals to allocate to tasks. We ask: (1) Is task allocation fundamentally difficult, and thus costly? (2) Does the performance of task allocation mechanisms depend on the number of individuals? And (3) what other parameters may affect their efficiency? We use techniques from distributed computing theory to develop a model of a social insect colony, where workers have to be allocated to a set of tasks; however, our model is generalizable to other systems. We show, first, that the ability of workers to quickly assess demand for work in tasks they are not currently engaged in crucially affects whether task allocation is quickly achieved or not. This indicates that in social insect tasks such as thermoregulation, where temperature may provide a global and near instantaneous stimulus to measure the need for cooling, for example, it should be easy to match the number of workers to the need for work. In other tasks, such as nest repair, it may be impossible for workers not directly at the work site to know that this task needs more workers. We argue that this affects whether task allocation mechanisms are under strong selection. Second, we show that colony size does not affect task allocation performance under our assumptions. This implies that when effects of colony size are found, they are not inherent in the process of task allocation itself, but due to processes not modeled here, such as higher variation in task demand for smaller colonies, benefits of specialized workers, or constant overhead costs. Third, we show that the ratio of the number of available workers to the workload crucially affects performance. Thus, workers in excess of those needed to complete all tasks improve task allocation performance. This provides a potential explanation for the phenomenon that social insect colonies commonly contain inactive workers: these may be a ‘surplus’ set of workers that improves colony function by speeding up optimal allocation of workers to tasks. Overall our study shows how limitations at the individual level can affect group level outcomes, and suggests new hypotheses that can be explored empirically.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xk21hJ2vyb0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Xinxin Wang, Anders E. Carlsson&lt;/p&gt;

We present a Master Equation approach to calculating polymerization dynamics and force generation by branched actin networks at membranes. The method treats the time evolution of the F-actin distribution in three dimensions, with branching included as a directional spreading term. It is validated by comparison with stochastic simulations of force generation by actin polymerization at obstacles coated with actin “nucleation promoting factors” (NPFs). The method is then used to treat the dynamics of actin polymerization and force generation during endocytosis in yeast, using a model in which NPFs form a ring around the endocytic site, centered by a spot of molecules attaching the actin network strongly to the membrane. We find that a spontaneous actin filament nucleation mechanism is required for adequate forces to drive the process, that partial inhibition of branching and polymerization lead to different characteristic responses, and that a limited range of polymerization-rate values provide effective invagination and obtain correct predictions for the effects of mutations in the active regions of the NPFs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cZc3KkNB-1s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Specific excitatory connectivity for feature integration in mouse primary visual cortex</title>

Local excitatory connections in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) are stronger and more prevalent between neurons that share similar functional response features. However, the details of how functional rules for local connectivity shape neuronal responses in V1 remain unknown. We hypothesised that complex responses to visual stimuli may arise as a consequence of rules for selective excitatory connectivity within the local network in the superficial layers of mouse V1. In mouse V1 many neurons respond to overlapping grating stimuli (plaid stimuli) with highly selective and facilitatory responses, which are not simply predicted by responses to single gratings presented alone. This complexity is surprising, since excitatory neurons in V1 are considered to be mainly tuned to single preferred orientations. Here we examined the consequences for visual processing of two alternative connectivity schemes: in the first case, &lt;i&gt;local connections are aligned with visual properties inherited from feedforward input&lt;/i&gt; (a ‘like-to-like’ scheme specifically connecting neurons that share similar preferred orientations); in the second case, &lt;i&gt;local connections group neurons into excitatory subnetworks that combine and amplify multiple feedforward visual properties (a ‘feature binding’ scheme)&lt;/i&gt;. By comparing predictions from large scale computational models with &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings of visual representations in mouse V1, we found that responses to plaid stimuli were best explained by assuming ‘feature binding’ connectivity. Unlike under the ‘like-to-like’ scheme, selective amplification within feature-binding excitatory subnetworks replicated experimentally observed facilitatory responses to plaid stimuli; explained selective plaid responses not predicted by grating selectivity; and was consistent with broad anatomical selectivity observed in mouse V1. Our results show that visual feature binding can occur through local recurrent mechanisms without requiring feedforward convergence, and that such a mechanism is consistent with visual responses and cortical anatomy in mouse V1.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-UU1qp-u0DM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Novel linear motif filtering protocol reveals the role of the LC8 dynein light chain in the Hippo pathway</title>

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) formed between short linear motifs and globular domains play important roles in many regulatory and signaling processes but are highly underrepresented in current protein-protein interaction databases. These types of interactions are usually characterized by a specific binding motif that captures the key amino acids shared among the interaction partners. However, the computational proteome-level identification of interaction partners based on the known motif is hindered by the huge number of randomly occurring matches from which biologically relevant motif hits need to be extracted. In this work, we established a novel bioinformatic filtering protocol to efficiently explore interaction network of a hub protein. We introduced a novel measure that enabled the optimization of the elements and parameter settings of the pipeline which was built from multiple sequence-based prediction methods. In addition, data collected from PPI databases and evolutionary analyses were also incorporated to further increase the biological relevance of the identified motif hits. The approach was applied to the dynein light chain LC8, a ubiquitous eukaryotic hub protein that has been suggested to be involved in motor-related functions as well as promoting the dimerization of various proteins by recognizing linear motifs in its partners. From the list of putative binding motifs collected by our protocol, several novel peptides were experimentally verified to bind LC8. Altogether 71 potential new motif instances were identified. The expanded list of LC8 binding partners revealed the evolutionary plasticity of binding partners despite the highly conserved binding interface. In addition, it also highlighted a novel, conserved function of LC8 in the upstream regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway. Beyond the LC8 system, our work also provides general guidelines that can be applied to explore the interaction network of other linear motif binding proteins or protein domains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NZ17tOKCm8c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Feature reliability determines specificity and transfer of perceptual learning in orientation search</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ky4fAG2t6r4/article</link>

Training can modify the visual system to produce a substantial improvement on perceptual tasks and therefore has applications for treating visual deficits. Visual perceptual learning (VPL) is often specific to the trained feature, which gives insight into processes underlying brain plasticity, but limits VPL’s effectiveness in rehabilitation. Under what circumstances VPL transfers to untrained stimuli is poorly understood. Here we report a qualitatively new phenomenon: intrinsic variation in the representation of features determines the transfer of VPL. Orientations around cardinal are represented more reliably than orientations around oblique in V1, which has been linked to behavioral consequences such as visual search asymmetries. We studied VPL for visual search of near-cardinal or oblique targets among distractors of the other orientation while controlling for other display and task attributes, including task precision, task difficulty, and stimulus exposure. Learning was the same in all training conditions; however, transfer depended on the orientation of the target, with full transfer of learning from near-cardinal to oblique targets but not the reverse. To evaluate the idea that representational reliability was the key difference between the orientations in determining VPL transfer, we created a model that combined orientation-dependent reliability, improvement of reliability with learning, and an optimal search strategy. Modeling suggested that not only search asymmetries but also the asymmetric transfer of VPL depended on preexisting differences between the reliability of near-cardinal and oblique representations. Transfer asymmetries in model behavior also depended on having different learning rates for targets and distractors, such that greater learning for low-reliability distractors facilitated transfer. These findings suggest that training on sensory features with intrinsically low reliability may maximize the generalizability of learning in complex visual environments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ky4fAG2t6r4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: On the organization of grid and place cells: Neural de-noising via subspace learning. (arXiv:1712.04602v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04602</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Place cells in the hippocampus are active when an animal visits a certain
locations (referred to as place fields) within an environment and remain silent
otherwise. Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) respond at multiple
locations, with firing fields that exhibit a hexagonally symmetric periodic
pattern. The joint activity of grid and place cell populations, as a function
of location, forms a neural code for space. An ensemble of codes, for a given
set of parameters, is generated by selecting grid and place cell population and
tuning curve parameters. For each ensemble, codewords are generated by
stimulating a network with a discrete set of locations. In this manuscript, we
develop an understanding of the relationships between coding theoretic
properties of these combined populations and code construction parameters.
These observations are revisited by measuring the performances of biologically
realizable algorithms (e.g. neural bit-flipping) implemented by a network of
place and grid cell populations, as well as interneurons, which perform
de-noising operations. Simulations demonstrate that de-noising mechanisms
analyzed here can significantly improve fidelity of this neural representation
of space. Further, patterns observed in connectivity of each population of
simulated cells suggest the existence of heretofore unobserved neurobiological
phenomena.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We revisit the behavior of a prototypical model of balanced activity in
networks of spiking neurons. A detailed study of an appropriate thermodynamic
limit for fixed density of connections shows that, when inhibition prevails,
the asymptotic regime is characterized by a self-sustained irregular,
macroscopic (collective) dynamics rather than being asynchronous. This holds
true even for very small coupling strengths. A relationship with the collective
chaos observed in standard (unbalanced) heterogeneous networks is also put
forward and the role played by clustered states discussed.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5610</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present data for the lognormal distributions of spike
rates, synaptic weights and intrinsic excitability (gain) for neurons in
various brain areas, such as auditory or visual cortex, hippocampus,
cerebellum, striatum, midbrain nuclei. We find a remarkable consistency of
heavy-tailed, specifically lognormal, distributions for rates, weights and
gains in all brain areas examined. The difference between strongly recurrent
and feed-forward connectivity (cortex vs. striatum and cerebellum),
neurotransmitter (GABA (striatum) or glutamate (cortex)) or the level of
activation (low in cortex, high in Purkinje cells and midbrain nuclei) turns
out to be irrelevant for this feature. Logarithmic scale distribution of
weights and gains appears to be a general, functional property in all cases
analyzed. We then created a generic neural model to investigate adaptive
learning rules that create and maintain lognormal distributions. We
conclusively demonstrate that not only weights, but also intrinsic gains, need
to have strong Hebbian learning in order to produce and maintain the
experimentally attested distributions. This provides a solution to the
long-standing question about the type of plasticity exhibited by intrinsic
excitability.

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Translational Control Mechanisms in Persistent Pain</title>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30233-3?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Persistent pain, which is poorly treated and estimated to afflict one third of the world’s population, is largely mediated by the sensitization of nociceptive neurons. This sensitization involves de novo gene expression to support biochemical and structural changes required to maintain amplified pain signaling that frequently persists even after injury to tissue resolves. While transcription-dependent changes in gene expression are important, recent work demonstrates that activity-dependent regulation of mRNA translation is key to controlling the cellular proteome and the development and maintenance of persistent pain.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: 17{beta}-Estradiol Acutely Potentiates Glutamatergic Synaptic Transmission in the Hippocampus through Distinct Mechanisms in Males and Females</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12314?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Estradiol (E2) acutely potentiates glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of both male and female rats. Here, we investigated whether E2-induced synaptic potentiation occurs via presynaptic and/or postsynaptic mechanisms and which estrogen receptors (ERs) mediate E2's effects in each sex. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of mEPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons showed that E2 increases both mEPSC frequency and amplitude within minutes, but often in different cells. This indicated that both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms are involved, but that they occur largely at different synapses. Two-photon (2p) glutamate uncaging at individual dendritic spines showed that E2 increases the amplitude of uncaging-evoked EPSCs (2pEPSCs) and calcium transients (2pCaTs) at a subset of spines on a dendrite, demonstrating synapse specificity of E2's postsynaptic effects. All of these results were essentially the same in males and females. However, additional experiments using ER-selective agonists indicated sex differences in the mechanisms underlying E2-induced potentiation. In males, an ERβ agonist mimicked the postsynaptic effects of E2 to increase mEPSC, 2pEPSC, and 2pCaT amplitude, whereas in females, these effects were mimicked by an agonist of G protein-coupled ER-1. The presynaptic effect of E2, increased mEPSC frequency, was mimicked by an ERα agonist in males, whereas in females, an ERβ agonist increased mEPSC frequency. Thus, E2 acutely potentiates glutamatergic synapses similarly in both sexes, but distinct ER subtypes mediate the presynaptic and postsynaptic aspects of potentiation in each sex. This indicates a latent sex difference in which different molecular mechanisms converge to the same functional endpoint in males versus females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Some sex differences in the brain may be latent differences, in which the same functional endpoint is achieved through distinct underlying mechanisms in males versus females. Here we report a latent sex difference in molecular regulation of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus. The steroid 17β-estradiol is known to acutely potentiate glutamatergic synaptic transmission in both sexes. We find that this occurs through a combination of increased presynaptic glutamate release probability and increased postsynaptic sensitivity to glutamate in both sexes, but that distinct estrogen receptor subtypes underlie each aspect of potentiation in each sex. These results indicate that therapeutics targeting a specific estrogen receptor subtype or its downstream signaling would likely affect synaptic transmission differently in the hippocampus of each sex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Graded Elevation of c-Jun in Schwann Cells In Vivo: Gene Dosage Determines Effects on Development, Remyelination, Tumorigenesis, and Hypomyelination</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12297?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Schwann cell c-Jun is implicated in adaptive and maladaptive functions in peripheral nerves. In injured nerves, this transcription factor promotes the repair Schwann cell phenotype and regeneration and promotes Schwann-cell-mediated neurotrophic support in models of peripheral neuropathies. However, c-Jun is associated with tumor formation in some systems, potentially suppresses myelin genes, and has been implicated in demyelinating neuropathies. To clarify these issues and to determine how c-Jun levels determine its function, we have generated c-Jun OE/+ and c-Jun OE/OE mice with graded expression of c-Jun in Schwann cells and examined these lines during development, in adulthood, and after injury using RNA sequencing analysis, quantitative electron microscopic morphometry, Western blotting, and functional tests. Schwann cells are remarkably tolerant of elevated c-Jun because the nerves of c-Jun OE/+ mice, in which c-Jun is elevated ~6-fold, are normal with the exception of modestly reduced myelin thickness. The stronger elevation of c-Jun in c-Jun OE/OE mice is, however, sufficient to induce significant hypomyelination pathology, implicating c-Jun as a potential player in demyelinating neuropathies. The tumor suppressor P19&lt;sup&gt;ARF&lt;/sup&gt; is strongly activated in the nerves of these mice and, even in aged c-Jun OE/OE mice, there is no evidence of tumors. This is consistent with the fact that tumors do not form in injured nerves, although they contain proliferating Schwann cells with strikingly elevated c-Jun. Furthermore, in crushed nerves of c-Jun OE/+ mice, where c-Jun levels are overexpressed sufficiently to accelerate axonal regeneration, myelination and function are restored after injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In injured and diseased nerves, the transcription factor c-Jun in Schwann cells is elevated and variously implicated in controlling beneficial or adverse functions, including trophic Schwann cell support for neurons, promotion of regeneration, tumorigenesis, and suppression of myelination. To analyze the functions of c-Jun, we have used transgenic mice with graded elevation of Schwann cell c-Jun. We show that high c-Jun elevation is a potential pathogenic mechanism because it inhibits myelination. Conversely, we did not find a link between c-Jun elevation and tumorigenesis. Modest c-Jun elevation, which is beneficial for regeneration, is well tolerated during Schwann cell development and in the adult and is compatible with restoration of myelination and nerve function after injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Representations of Hierarchical Rule Sets: The Human Control System Represents Rules Irrespective of the Hierarchical Level to Which They Belong</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12281?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans use rules to organize their actions to achieve specific goals. Although simple rules that link a sensory stimulus to one response may suffice in some situations, often, the application of multiple, hierarchically organized rules is required. Recent theories suggest that progressively higher level rules are encoded along an anterior-to-posterior gradient within PFC. Although some evidence supports the existence of such a functional gradient, other studies argue for a lesser degree of specialization within PFC. We used fMRI to investigate whether rules at different hierarchical levels are represented at distinct locations in the brain or encoded by a single system. Thirty-seven male and female participants represented and applied hierarchical rule sets containing one lower-level stimulus–response rule and one higher-level selection rule. We used multivariate pattern analysis to investigate directly the representation of rules at each hierarchical level in absence of information about rules from other levels or other task-related information, thus providing a clear identification of low- and high-level rule representations. We could decode low- and high-level rules from local patterns of brain activity within a wide frontoparietal network. However, no significant difference existed between regions encoding representations of rules from both levels except for precentral gyrus, which represented only low-level rule information. Our findings show that the brain represents conditional rules regardless of their level in the explored hierarchy, so the human control system did not organize task representation according to this dimension. Our paradigm represents a promising approach to identifying critical principles that shape this control system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Several recent studies investigating the organization of the human control system propose that rules at different control levels are organized along an anterior-to-posterior gradient within PFC. In this study, we used multivariate pattern analysis to explore independently the representation of formally identical conditional rules belonging to different levels of a cognitive hierarchy and provide for the first time a clear identification of low- and high-level rule representations. We found no major spatial differences between regions encoding rules from different hierarchical levels. This suggests that the human brain does not use levels in the investigated hierarchy as a topographical organization principle to represent rules controlling our behavior. Our paradigm represents a promising approach to identifying which principles are critical.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activation of {gamma}-Secretase Trimming Activity by Topological Changes of Transmembrane Domain 1 of Presenilin 1</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12272?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;-Secretase is an intramembrane cleaving protease that is responsible for the generation of amyloid-β peptides, which are linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Recently, -secretase modulators (GSMs) have been shown to specifically decrease production of the aggregation-prone and toxic longer Aβ species, and concomitantly increase the levels of shorter Aβ. We previously found that phenylimidazole-type GSMs bind to presenilin 1 (PS1), the catalytic subunit of the -secretase, and allosterically modulate -secretase activity. However, the precise conformational alterations in PS1 remained unclear. Here we mapped the amino acid residues in PS1 that is crucial for the binding and pharmacological actions of E2012, a phenylimidazole-type GSM, using photoaffinity labeling and the substituted cysteine accessibility method. We also demonstrated that a piston-like vertical motion of transmembrane domain (TMD) 1 occurs during modulation of Aβ production. Taking these results together, we propose a model for the molecular mechanism of phenylimidazole-type GSMs, in which the trimming activity of -secretase is modulated by the position of the TMD1 of PS1 in the lipid bilayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Reduction of the toxic longer amyloid-β peptide is one of the therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer disease. A subset of small compounds called -secretase modulators specifically decreases the longer amyloid-β production, although its mechanistic action remains unclear. Here we found that the modulator compound E2012 targets to the hydrophilic loop 1 of presenilin 1, which is a catalytic subunit of the -secretase. Moreover, E2012 triggers the piston movement of the transmembrane domain 1 of presenilin 1, which impacts on the -secretase activity. These results illuminate how -secretase modulators allosterically affect the proteolytic activity, and highlight the importance of the structural dynamics of presenilin 1 in the complexed process of the intramembrane cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multimodal Imaging in Rat Model Recapitulates Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers Abnormalities</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12263?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Imaging biomarkers are frequently proposed as endpoints for clinical trials targeting brain amyloidosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the specific impact of amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation on biomarker abnormalities remains elusive in AD. Using the McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rat as a model of selective Aβ pathology, we characterized the longitudinal progression of abnormalities in biomarkers commonly used in AD research. Middle-aged (9–11 months) transgenic animals (both male and female) displayed mild spatial memory impairments and disrupted cingulate network connectivity measured by resting-state fMRI, even in the absence of hypometabolism (measured with PET [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG) or detectable fibrillary amyloidosis (measured with PET [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]NAV4694). At more advanced ages (16–19 months), cognitive deficits progressed in conjunction with resting connectivity abnormalities; furthermore, hypometabolism, Aβ plaque accumulation, reduction of CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1-42&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations, and hippocampal atrophy (structural MRI) were detectable at this stage. The present results emphasize the early impact of Aβ on brain connectivity and support a framework in which persistent Aβ aggregation itself is sufficient to impose memory circuits dysfunction, which propagates to adjacent brain networks at later stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The present study proposes a &quot;back translation&quot; of the Alzheimer pathological cascade concept from human to animals. We used the same set of Alzheimer imaging biomarkers typically used in large human cohorts and assessed their progression over time in a transgenic rat model, which allows for a finer spatial resolution not attainable with mice. Using this translational platform, we demonstrated that amyloid-β pathology recapitulates an Alzheimer-like profile of biomarker abnormalities even in the absence of other hallmarks of the disease such as neurofibrillary tangles and widespread neuronal losses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cellular and Molecular Analysis of Dendritic Morphogenesis in a Retinal Cell Type That Senses Color Contrast and Ventral Motion</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12247?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As neuronal dendrites develop, they acquire cell-type-specific features including characteristic size, shape, arborization, location and synaptic patterns. These features, in turn, are major determinants of type-specific neuronal function. Because neuronal diversity complicates the task of relating developmental programs to adult structure and function, we analyzed dendritic morphogenesis in a single retinal ganglion cell (RGC) type in mouse called J-RGC. We documented the emergence of five dendritic features that underlie J-RGC physiology: (1) dendritic field size, which approximate receptive field size; (2) dendritic complexity, which affects how J-RGCs sample space; (3) asymmetry, which contributes to direction-selectivity; (4) restricted lamination within the inner plexiform layer (IPL), which renders J-RGCs responsive to light decrements; and (5) distribution of synaptic inputs, which generate a color-opponent receptive field. We found dendritic growth in J-RGCs is accompanied by a refinement in dendritic self-crossing. Asymmetry arises by a combination of selective pruning and elaboration, whereas laminar restriction results from biased outgrowth toward the outermost IPL. Interestingly, asymmetry develops in a protracted dorsoventral wave, whereas lamination does so in a rapid centrifugal wave. As arbors mature, they acquire excitatory and inhibitory synapses, with the latter forming first and being concentrated in proximal dendrites. Thus, distinct mechanisms operate in different spatiotemporal dimensions of J-RGC dendritic patterning to generate the substrate for specific patterns of synaptogenesis. Finally, we asked whether the defining molecular signature of J-RGCs, the adhesion molecule JAM-B, regulates morphogenesis, and showed that it promotes dendro-dendritic interactions. Our results reveal multiple mechanisms that shape a dendritic arbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Visual perception begins in the retina, where distinct types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are tuned to specific visual features such as direction of motion. The features to which each RGC type responds are determined largely by the number and type of synaptic inputs it receives, and these, in turn, are greatly influenced by the size, shape, arborization pattern, and location of its dendrites. We analyzed dendritic morphogenesis in a functionally characterized RGC type, the J-RGC, demonstrating distinct mechanisms that operate in different dimensions to generate the dendritic scaffold and synaptic patterns for feature detection. Our work elucidates cellular and molecular mechanisms that shape dendritic arbors and synaptic distribution, enabling J-RGC connectivity and thus, function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12238?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Replay of hippocampal neural representations during sleep is thought to promote systems consolidation of declarative memory. How this reprocessing of memory during sleep affects the hippocampal representation itself, is unclear. Here we tested hippocampal stimulus processing (i.e., pattern separation) before and after periods of sleep and wakefulness in humans (female and male participants). Pattern separation deteriorated across the wake period but remained stable across sleep (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013) with this sleep–wake difference being most pronounced for stimuli with low similarity to targets (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006). Stimuli with the highest similarity showed a reversed pattern with reduced pattern separation performance after sleep (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.038). Pattern separation performance was positively correlated with sleep spindle density, slow oscillation density, and theta power phase-locked to slow oscillations. Sleep, presumably by neural memory replay, shapes hippocampal representations and enhances computations of pattern separation to subsequent presentation of similar stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memories is causally related to reactivation during sleep of previously encoded representations. Here, we show that reactivation-based consolidation processes during sleep shape the hippocampal representation itself. We studied the effect of sleep and wakefulness on pattern separation (i.e., orthogonalization of similar representations) and completion performance (i.e., recall of a memory in light of noisy input) that are essential cognitive elements of encoding and retrieval of information by the hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that pattern separation was stabilized after sleep but diminished after wakefulness. We further showed that pattern separation was related to EEG oscillatory parameters of non-REM sleep serving as markers of sleep-dependent memory consolidation and hippocampal reactivation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Network Configurations in the Human Brain Reflect Choice Bias during Rapid Face Processing</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12226?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Network interactions are likely to be instrumental in processes underlying rapid perception and cognition. Specifically, high-level and perceptual regions must interact to balance pre-existing models of the environment with new incoming stimuli. Simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI (EEG/fMRI) enables temporal characterization of brain–network interactions combined with improved anatomical localization of regional activity. In this paper, we use simultaneous EEG/fMRI and multivariate dynamical systems (MDS) analysis to characterize network relationships between constitute brain areas that reflect a subject's choice for a face versus nonface categorization task. Our simultaneous EEG and fMRI analysis on 21 human subjects (12 males, 9 females) identifies early perceptual and late frontal subsystems that are selective to the categorical choice of faces versus nonfaces. We analyze the interactions between these subsystems using an MDS in the space of the BOLD signal. Our main findings show that differences between face-choice and house-choice networks are seen in the network interactions between the early and late subsystems, and that the magnitude of the difference in network interaction positively correlates with the behavioral false-positive rate of face choices. We interpret this to reflect the role of saliency and expectations likely encoded in frontal &quot;late&quot; regions on perceptual processes occurring in &quot;early&quot; perceptual regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our choices are affected by our biases. In visual perception and cognition such biases can be commonplace and quite curious—e.g., we see a human face when staring up at a cloud formation or down at a piece of toast at the breakfast table. Here we use multimodal neuroimaging and dynamical systems analysis to measure whole-brain spatiotemporal dynamics while subjects make decisions regarding the type of object they see in rapidly flashed images. We find that the degree of interaction in these networks accounts for a substantial fraction of our bias to see faces. In general, our findings illustrate how the properties of spatiotemporal networks yield insight into the mechanisms of how we form decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neuropeptide S Activates Paraventricular Oxytocin Neurons to Induce Anxiolysis</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12214?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuropeptides, such as neuropeptide S (NPS) and oxytocin (OXT), represent potential options for the treatment of anxiety disorders due to their potent anxiolytic profile. In this study, we aimed to reveal the mechanisms underlying the behavioral action of NPS, and present a chain of evidence that the effects of NPS within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) are mediated via actions on local OXT neurons in male Wistar rats. First, retrograde studies identified NPS fibers originating in the brainstem locus coeruleus, and projecting to the PVN. FACS identified prominent NPS receptor expression in PVN-OXT neurons. Using genetically encoded calcium indicators, we further demonstrated that NPS reliably induces a transient increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration in a subpopulation of OXT neurons, an effect mediated by NPS receptor. In addition, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) NPS evoked a significant somatodendritic release of OXT within the PVN as assessed by microdialysis in combination with a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay. Finally, we could show that the anxiolytic effect of NPS seen after i.c.v. or intra-PVN infusion requires responsive OXT neurons of the PVN and locally released OXT. Thus, pharmacological blockade of OXT receptors as well as chemogenetic silencing of OXT neurons within the PVN prevented the effect of synthetic NPS. In conclusion, our results indicate a significant role of the OXT system in mediating the effects of NPS on anxiety, and fill an important gap in our understanding of brain neuropeptide interactions in the context of regulation of emotional behavior within the hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Given the rising scientific interest in neuropeptide research in the context of emotional and stress-related behaviors, our findings demonstrate a novel intrahypothalamic mechanism involving paraventricular oxytocin neurons that express the neuropeptide S receptor. These neurons respond with transient Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase and somatodendritic oxytocin release following neuropeptide S stimulation. Thereby, oxytocin neurons seem essential for neuropeptide S-induced anxiolysis, as this effect was blocked by pharmacological and chemogenetic inhibition of the oxytocin system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional Deletion of Ric-8b in Olfactory Sensory Neurons Leads to Olfactory Impairment</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12202?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The olfactory system can discriminate a vast number of odorants. This ability derives from the existence of a large family of odorant receptors expressed in the cilia of the olfactory sensory neurons. Odorant receptors signal through the olfactory-specific G-protein subunit, Gαolf. Ric-8b, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, interacts with Gαolf and can amplify odorant receptor signal transduction &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. To explore the function of Ric-8b &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we generated a tissue specific knock-out mouse by crossing OMP-Cre transgenic mice to Ric-8b floxed mice. We found that olfactory-specific Ric-8b knock-out mice of mixed sex do not express the Gαolf protein in the olfactory epithelium. We also found that in these mice, the mature olfactory sensory neuron layer is reduced, and that olfactory sensory neurons show increased rate of cell death compared with wild-type mice. Finally, behavioral tests showed that the olfactory-specific Ric-8b knock-out mice show an impaired sense of smell, even though their motivation and mobility behaviors remain normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Ric-8b is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) expressed in the olfactory epithelium and in the striatum. Ric-8b interacts with the olfactory Gαolf subunit, and can amplify odorant signaling through odorant receptors &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. However, the functional significance of this GEF in the olfactory neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; remains unknown. We report that deletion of Ric-8b in olfactory sensory neurons prevents stable expression of Gαolf. In addition, we demonstrate that olfactory neurons lacking Ric-8b (and consequently Gαolf) are more susceptible to cell death. Ric-8b conditional knock-out mice display impaired olfactory guided behavior. Our results reveal that Ric-8b is essential for olfactory function, and suggest that it may also be essential for Gαolf-dependent functions in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Extensive Tonotopic Mapping across Auditory Cortex Is Recapitulated by Spectrally Directed Attention and Systematically Related to Cortical Myeloarchitecture</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12187?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Auditory selective attention is vital in natural soundscapes. But it is unclear how attentional focus on the primary dimension of auditory representation—acoustic frequency—might modulate basic auditory functional topography during active listening. In contrast to visual selective attention, which is supported by motor-mediated optimization of input across saccades and pupil dilation, the primate auditory system has fewer means of differentially sampling the world. This makes spectrally-directed endogenous attention a particularly crucial aspect of auditory attention. Using a novel functional paradigm combined with quantitative MRI, we establish in male and female listeners that human frequency-band-selective attention drives activation in both myeloarchitectonically estimated auditory core, and across the majority of tonotopically mapped nonprimary auditory cortex. The attentionally driven best-frequency maps show strong concordance with sensory-driven maps in the same subjects across much of the temporal plane, with poor concordance in areas outside traditional auditory cortex. There is significantly greater activation across most of auditory cortex when best frequency is attended, versus ignored; the same regions do not show this enhancement when attending to the least-preferred frequency band. Finally, the results demonstrate that there is spatial correspondence between the degree of myelination and the strength of the tonotopic signal across a number of regions in auditory cortex. Strong frequency preferences across tonotopically mapped auditory cortex spatially correlate with R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-estimated myeloarchitecture, indicating shared functional and anatomical organization that may underlie intrinsic auditory regionalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Perception is an active process, especially sensitive to attentional state. Listeners direct auditory attention to track a violin's melody within an ensemble performance, or to follow a voice in a crowded cafe. Although diverse pathologies reduce quality of life by impacting such spectrally directed auditory attention, its neurobiological bases are unclear. We demonstrate that human primary and nonprimary auditory cortical activation is modulated by spectrally directed attention in a manner that recapitulates its tonotopic sensory organization. Further, the graded activation profiles evoked by single-frequency bands are correlated with attentionally driven activation when these bands are presented in complex soundscapes. Finally, we observe a strong concordance in the degree of cortical myelination and the strength of tonotopic activation across several auditory cortical regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Working Memory and Decision-Making in a Frontoparietal Circuit Model</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12167?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) and decision-making (DM) are fundamental cognitive functions involving a distributed interacting network of brain areas, with the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) at the core. However, the shared and distinct roles of these areas and the nature of their coordination in cognitive function remain poorly understood. Biophysically based computational models of cortical circuits have provided insights into the mechanisms supporting these functions, yet they have primarily focused on the local microcircuit level, raising questions about the principles for distributed cognitive computation in multiregional networks. To examine these issues, we developed a distributed circuit model of two reciprocally interacting modules representing PPC and PFC circuits. The circuit architecture includes hierarchical differences in local recurrent structure and implements reciprocal long-range projections. This parsimonious model captures a range of behavioral and neuronal features of frontoparietal circuits across multiple WM and DM paradigms. In the context of WM, both areas exhibit persistent activity, but, in response to intervening distractors, PPC transiently encodes distractors while PFC filters distractors and supports WM robustness. With regard to DM, the PPC module generates graded representations of accumulated evidence supporting target selection, while the PFC module generates more categorical responses related to action or choice. These findings suggest computational principles for distributed, hierarchical processing in cortex during cognitive function and provide a framework for extension to multiregional models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Working memory and decision-making are fundamental &quot;building blocks&quot; of cognition, and deficits in these functions are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. These cognitive functions engage distributed networks with prefrontal cortex (PFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) at the core. It is not clear, however, what the contributions of PPC and PFC are in light of the computations that subserve working memory and decision-making. We constructed a biophysical model of a reciprocally connected frontoparietal circuit that revealed shared and distinct functions for the PFC and PPC across working memory and decision-making tasks. Our parsimonious model connects circuit-level properties to cognitive functions and suggests novel design principles beyond those of local circuits for cognitive processing in multiregional brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Morphological Constraints on Cerebellar Granule Cell Combinatorial Diversity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12153?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Combinatorial expansion by the cerebellar granule cell layer (GCL) is fundamental to theories of cerebellar contributions to motor control and learning. Granule cells (GrCs) sample approximately four mossy fiber inputs and are thought to form a combinatorial code useful for pattern separation and learning. We constructed a spatially realistic model of the cerebellar GCL and examined how GCL architecture contributes to GrC combinatorial diversity. We found that GrC combinatorial diversity saturates quickly as mossy fiber input diversity increases, and that this saturation is in part a consequence of short dendrites, which limit access to diverse inputs and favor dense sampling of local inputs. This local sampling also produced GrCs that were combinatorially redundant, even when input diversity was extremely high. In addition, we found that mossy fiber clustering, which is a common anatomical pattern, also led to increased redundancy of GrC input combinations. We related this redundancy to hypothesized roles of temporal expansion of GrC information encoding in service of learned timing, and we show that GCL architecture produces GrC populations that support both temporal and combinatorial expansion. Finally, we used novel anatomical measurements from mice of either sex to inform modeling of sparse and filopodia-bearing mossy fibers, finding that these circuit features uniquely contribute to enhancing GrC diversification and redundancy. Our results complement information theoretic studies of granule layer structure and provide insight into the contributions of granule layer anatomical features to afferent mixing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cerebellar granule cells are among the simplest neurons, with tiny somata and, on average, just four dendrites. These characteristics, along with their dense organization, inspired influential theoretical work on the granule cell layer as a combinatorial expander, where each granule cell represents a unique combination of inputs. Despite the centrality of these theories to cerebellar physiology, the degree of expansion supported by anatomically realistic patterns of inputs is unknown. Using modeling and anatomy, we show that realistic input patterns constrain combinatorial diversity by producing redundant combinations, which nevertheless could support temporal diversification of like combinations, suitable for learned timing. Our study suggests a neural substrate for producing high levels of both combinatorial and temporal diversity in the granule cell layer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Interlayer Repulsion of Retinal Ganglion Cell Mosaics Regulates Spatial Organization of Functional Maps in the Visual Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12141?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In higher mammals, orientation tuning of neurons is organized into a quasi-periodic pattern in the primary visual cortex. Our previous model studies suggested that the topography of cortical orientation maps may originate from moiré interference of ON and OFF retinal ganglion cell (RGC) mosaics, but did not account for how the consistent spatial period of maps could be achieved. Here we address this issue with two crucial findings on the development of RGC mosaics: first, homotypic local repulsion between RGCs can develop a long-range hexagonal periodicity. Second, heterotypic interaction restrains the alignment of ON and OFF mosaics, and generates a periodic interference pattern map with consistent spatial frequency. To validate our model, we quantitatively analyzed the RGC mosaics in cat data, and confirmed that the observed retinal mosaics showed evidence of heterotypic interactions, contrary to the previous view that ON and OFF mosaics are developed independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Orientation map is one of the most studied functional maps in the brain, but it has remained unanswered how the consistent spatial periodicity of maps could be developed. In the current study, we address this issue with our developmental model for the retinal origin of orientation map. We showed that local repulsive interactions between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) can develop a hexagonal periodicity in the RGC mosaics and restrict the alignment between ON and OFF mosaics, so that they generate a periodic pattern with consistent spatial frequency for both the RGC mosaics and the cortical orientation maps. Our results demonstrate that the organization of functional maps in visual cortex, including its structural consistency, may be constrained by a retinal blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Ubiquitin E3 Ligase TRAF6 Exacerbates Ischemic Stroke by Ubiquitinating and Activating Rac1</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12123?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and excitotoxicity contribute to neuronal death during ischemic stroke; however, the mechanisms underlying these complicated pathophysiological processes remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we found that the expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) was markedly increased after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in mice. TRAF6 ablation in male mice decreased the infarct volume and neurological deficit scores and decreased proinflammatory signaling, oxidative stress, and neuronal death after cerebral I/R, whereas transgenic overexpression of TRAF6 in male mice exhibited the opposite effects. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that TRAF6 induced Rac1 activation and consequently promoted I/R injury by directly binding and ubiquitinating Rac1. Either functionally mutating the TRAF6 ubiquitination site on Rac1 or inactivating Rac1 with a specific inhibitor reversed the deleterious effects of TRAF6 overexpression during I/R injury. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that TRAF6 is a key promoter of ischemic signaling cascades and neuronal death after cerebral I/R injury. Therefore, the TRAF6/Rac1 pathway might be a promising target to attenuate cerebral I/R injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Stroke is one of the most severe and devastating neurological diseases globally. The complicated pathophysiological processes restrict the translation of potential therapeutic targets into medicine. Further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury may open a new window for pharmacological interventions to promote recovery from stroke. Our study revealed that ischemia-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) upregulation binds and ubiquitinates Rac1 directly, which promotes neuron death through neuroinflammation and neuro-oxidative signals. Therefore, precisely targeting the TRAF6-Rac1 axis may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for stroke recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Detailed Dendritic Excitatory/Inhibitory Balance through Heterosynaptic Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12106?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs is a key feature of cortical dynamics. Such a balance is arguably preserved in dendritic branches, yet its underlying mechanism and functional roles remain unknown. In this study, we developed computational models of heterosynaptic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to show that the excitatory/inhibitory balance in dendritic branches is robustly achieved through heterosynaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The model reproduces key features of experimental heterosynaptic STDP well, and provides analytical insights. Furthermore, heterosynaptic STDP explains how the maturation of inhibitory neurons modulates the selectivity of excitatory neurons for binocular matching in the critical period plasticity. The model also provides an alternative explanation for the potential mechanism underlying the somatic detailed balance that is commonly associated with inhibitory STDP. Our results propose heterosynaptic STDP as a critical factor in synaptic organization and the resultant dendritic computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent experimental studies reveal that relative differences in spike timings experienced among neighboring glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses on a dendritic branch significantly influences changes in the efficiency of these synapses. This heterosynaptic form of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is potentially important for shaping the synaptic organization and computation of neurons, but its functional role remains elusive. Through computational modeling at the parameter regime where previous experimental results are well reproduced, we show that heterosynaptic plasticity serves to finely balance excitatory and inhibitory inputs on the dendrite. Our results suggest a principle of GABA-driven neural circuit formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: FGF-FGFR Mediates the Activity-Dependent Dendritogenesis of Layer IV Neurons during Barrel Formation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/50/12094?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and FGF receptors (FGFRs) are known for their potent effects on cell proliferation/differentiation and cortical patterning in the developing brain. However, little is known regarding the roles of FGFs/FGFRs in cortical circuit formation. Here we show that &lt;i&gt;Fgfr1&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;/3 and &lt;i&gt;Fgf7&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;9&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;10&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;22&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs are expressed in the developing primary somatosensory (S1) barrel cortex. Barrel cortex layer IV spiny stellate cells (bSCs) are the primary recipients of ascending sensory information via thalamocortical axons (TCAs). Detail quantification revealed distinctive phases for bSC dendritogenesis: orienting dendrites toward TCAs, adding &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; dendritic segments, and elongating dendritic length, while maintaining dendritic patterns. Deleting &lt;i&gt;Fgfr1&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt; in bSCs had minimal impact on dendritic polarity but transiently increased the number of dendritic segments. However, 6 d later, FGFR1/2/3 loss of function reduced dendritic branch numbers. These data suggest that FGFs/FGFRs have a role in stabilizing dendritic patterning. Depolarization of cultured mouse cortical neurons upregulated the levels of several &lt;i&gt;Fgf&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Fgfr&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs within 2 h. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, within 6 h of systemic kainic acid administration at postnatal day 6, mRNA levels of &lt;i&gt;Fgf9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fgf10&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fgfr2c&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Fgfr3b&lt;/i&gt; in S1 cortices were enhanced, and this was accompanied by exuberant dendritogenesis of bSCs by 24 h. Deleting &lt;i&gt;Fgfr1&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt; abolished kainic acid-induced bSC dendritic overgrowth. Finally, FGF9/10 gain of function also resulted in extensive dendritogenesis. Together, our data suggest that FGFs/FGFRs can be regulated by glutamate transmission to modulate/stabilize bSC dendritic complexity. Both male and female mice were used for our study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Glutamatergic transmission plays critical roles in cortical circuit formation. Its dysregulation has been proposed as a core factor in the etiology of many neurological diseases. We found that excessive glutamate transmission upregulated mRNA expression of &lt;i&gt;Fgfrs&lt;/i&gt; and their ligands &lt;i&gt;Fgfs&lt;/i&gt;. Deleting &lt;i&gt;Fgfr1&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt; not only impaired bSC dendritogenesis but also abolished glutamate transmission-induced dendritic overgrowth. Overexpressing FGF9 or FGF10 in cortical glutamatergic neurons results in excessive dendritic outgrowth within 24 h, resembling the changes induced by excessive glutamate transmission. Our findings provide strong evidence for the physiological role of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and FGF receptors (FGFRs) in establishing and maintaining cortical circuits. Perturbing the expression levels of FGFs/FGFRs by excessive glutamatergic neurotransmission could lead to abnormal neuronal circuits, which may contribute to neurological and psychiatric disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A geometric model of multi-scale orientation preference maps via Gabor functions. (arXiv:1712.04329v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04329</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we present a new model for the generation of orientation
preference maps in the primary visual cortex (V1), considering both orientation
and scale features. First we undertake to model the functional architecture of
V1 by interpreting it as a principal fiber bundle over the 2-dimensional
retinal plane by introducing intrinsic variables orientation and scale. The
intrinsic variables constitute a fiber on each point of the retinal plane and
the set of receptive profiles of simple cells is located on the fiber. Each
receptive profile on the fiber is mathematically interpreted as a rotated Gabor
function derived from an uncertainty principle. The visual stimulus is lifted
in a 4-dimensional space, characterized by coordinate variables, position,
orientation and scale, through a linear filtering of the stimulus with Gabor
functions. Orientation preference maps are then obtained by mapping the
orientation value found from the lifting of a noise stimulus onto the
2-dimensional retinal plane. This corresponds to a Bargmann transform in the
reducible representation of the $\text{SE}(2)=\mathbb{R}^2\times S^1$ group. A
comparison will be provided with a previous model based on the Bargman
transform in the irreducible representation of the $\text{SE}(2)$ group,
outlining that the new model is more physiologically motivated. Then we present
simulation results related to the construction of the orientation preference
map by using Gabor filters with different scales and compare those results to
the relevant neurophysiological findings in the literature.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Concept Formation and Dynamics of Repeated Inference in Deep Generative Models. (arXiv:1712.04195v1 [stat.ML])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04195</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep generative models are reported to be useful in broad applications
including image generation. Repeated inference between data space and latent
space in these models can denoise cluttered images and improve the quality of
inferred results. However, previous studies only qualitatively evaluated image
outputs in data space, and the mechanism behind the inference has not been
investigated. The purpose of the current study is to numerically analyze
changes in activity patterns of neurons in the latent space of a deep
generative model called a &quot;variational auto-encoder&quot; (VAE). What kinds of
inference dynamics the VAE demonstrates when noise is added to the input data
are identified. The VAE embeds a dataset with clear cluster structures in the
latent space and the center of each cluster of multiple correlated data points
(memories) is referred as the concept. Our study demonstrated that transient
dynamics of inference first approaches a concept, and then moves close to a
memory. Moreover, the VAE revealed that the inference dynamics approaches a
more abstract concept to the extent that the uncertainty of input data
increases due to noise. It was demonstrated that by increasing the number of
the latent variables, the trend of the inference dynamics to approach a concept
can be enhanced, and the generalization ability of the VAE can be improved.

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25106-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1988 to 2016, all consecutive patients with at least one cerebral or spinal pial AVF were screened for genetic disease. All patients aged &amp;lt;18 years were included. Symptoms associated with AVF were recorded: heart failure, neurological deficit/seizure, and hemorrhage. The outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale and school performance in children with cerebral AVF and the American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale in children with spinal AVF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25106-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty-three children were included. Twenty-five children were male and 18 were female. A germline mutation was identified in 23 probands (53.5 ± 14.9%): 8 in &lt;em&gt;ENG&lt;/em&gt; (34.8 ± 14.2%), 1 in &lt;em&gt;ACVRL1&lt;/em&gt; (4.3 ± 6%) leading to a diagnosis of HHT, and 14 in &lt;em&gt;RASA1&lt;/em&gt; (60.9 ± 14.4%) leading to a diagnosis of capillary malformation/arteriovenous malformation type 1. No &lt;em&gt;EphB4&lt;/em&gt; gene mutation was identified. HHT patients presented a significantly lower rate of heart failure at diagnosis (p = 0.047). A trend toward an increased bleeding rate at presentation was observed in HHT (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.069) and an increased rate of giant venous pouch in children in whom no mutation was identified (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.097). Finally, an association with &lt;em&gt;RASA1&lt;/em&gt; mutation was observed in children with associated skin capillary hemangioma (&lt;em&gt;p &amp;lt; &lt;/em&gt; 0001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

At the cellular level, mHTT aggregates were more often encountered in the extracellular matrix but could also be observed within cell bodies and neurites as well as within the endothelium of blood vessels with an increase in the density of small blood vessels in cervical sections of HD cases. These vasculature changes were accompanied with features of BSCB leakage, as assessed by the presence of increased levels of fibrinogen in the surrounding parenchyma and enhanced leukocyte infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25107-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This alteration in BSCB integrity may be explained, in part, by the dysregulation we found in some of the main proteins associated with it such as junctional adhesion molecule-1 and vascular endothelial cadherin. These observations have important implications for our understanding of HD pathology and may also have significant therapeutic implications.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Antisense suppression of glial fibrillary acidic protein as a treatment for Alexander disease</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25118</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Alexander disease is a fatal leukodystrophy caused by autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in the gene for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament protein primarily expressed in astrocytes of the central nervous system. A key feature of pathogenesis is over-expression and accumulation of GFAP, with formation of characteristic cytoplasmic aggregates known as Rosenthal fibers. Here we investigate whether suppressing GFAP with antisense oligonucleotides could provide a therapeutic strategy for treating Alexander disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: In this study we use GFAP mutant mouse models of Alexander disease to test the efficacy of antisense suppression and evaluate the effects on molecular and cellular phenotypes and non-cell autonomous toxicity. Antisense oligonucleotides were designed to target the murine &lt;em&gt;Gfap&lt;/em&gt; transcript, and screened using primary mouse cortical cultures. Lead oligonucleotides were then tested for their ability to reduce GFAP transcripts and protein, first in wild-type mice with normal levels of GFAP, and then in adult mutant mice with established pathology and elevated levels of GFAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Nearly complete and long-lasting elimination of GFAP occurred in brain and spinal cord following single bolus intracerebroventricular injections, with a striking reversal of Rosenthal fibers and downstream markers of microglial and other stress related responses. GFAP protein was also cleared from cerebrospinal fluid, demonstrating its potential utility as a biomarker in future clinical applications. Finally, treatment led to improved body condition and rescue of hippocampal neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These results demonstrate the efficacy of antisense suppression for an astrocyte target, and provide a compelling therapeutic approach for Alexander disease.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Representations of Sound in Deep Learning of Audio Features from Music. (arXiv:1712.02898v1 [cs.SD])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02898</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The work of a single musician, group or composer can vary widely in terms of
musical style. Indeed, different stylistic elements, from performance medium
and rhythm to harmony and texture, are typically exploited and developed across
an artist's lifetime. Yet, there is often a discernable character to the work
of, for instance, individual composers at the perceptual level - an experienced
listener can often pick up on subtle clues in the music to identify the
composer or performer. Here we suggest that a convolutional network may learn
these subtle clues or features given an appropriate representation of the
music. In this paper, we apply a deep convolutional neural network to a large
audio dataset and empirically evaluate its performance on audio classification
tasks. Our trained network demonstrates accurate performance on such
classification tasks when presented with 5 s examples of music obtained by
simple transformations of the raw audio waveform. A particularly interesting
example is the spectral representation of music obtained by application of a
logarithmically spaced filter bank, mirroring the early stages of auditory
signal transduction in mammals. The most successful representation of music to
facilitate discrimination was obtained via a random matrix transform (RMT).
Networks based on logarithmic filter banks and RMT were able to correctly guess
the one composer out of 31 possibilities in 68 and 84 percent of cases
respectively.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Effect of sleep on overnight CSF amyloid-β kinetics</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25117</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disturbances are associated with future risk of Alzheimer's disease. Disrupted sleep increases soluble amyloid-β, suggesting a mechanism for sleep disturbances to increase Alzheimer's disease risk. We tested this response in humans using indwelling lumbar catheters to serially sample cerebrospinal fluid while participants were sleep-deprived, treated with sodium oxybate, or allowed to sleep normally. All participants were infused with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-leucine to measure amyloid-β kinetics. We found that sleep deprivation increased overnight amyloid-β-38, amyloid-β-40, and amyloid-β-42 levels by 25-30% via increased overnight amyloid-β production relative to sleeping controls. These findings suggest that disrupted sleep increases Alzheimer's disease risk via increased amyloid-β production. This article is protected by copyright.

	<content:encoded>Early brain activity is crucial for neurogenesis and the development of brain networks. However, it has been challenging to localize regions in the developing human brain that contribute to spontaneous waves of neuronal activity. Recently, Arichi and colleagues reported that the temporal and heteromodal insular cortices have a central role in propagating these neural instructional signals.</content:encoded>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Bioprinting for Neural Tissue Engineering</title>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30213-8?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Bioprinting is a method by which a cell-encapsulating bioink is patterned to create complex tissue architectures. Given the potential impact of this technology on neural research, we review the current state-of-the-art approaches for bioprinting neural tissues. While 2D neural cultures are ubiquitous for studying neural cells, 3D cultures can more accurately replicate the microenvironment of neural tissues. By bioprinting neuronal constructs, one can precisely control the microenvironment by specifically formulating the bioink for neural tissues, and by spatially patterning cell types and scaffold properties in three dimensions.</content:encoded>
