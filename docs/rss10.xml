	<title>Journal of Neurology: Event-related potentials using the auditory novel paradigm in patients with myotonic dystrophy</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10465-1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Many neuropsychological disorders, especially attentional abnormality, are present in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate attention function by auditory event-related potential (ERP) P3a (novelty paradigm) in DM1 patients. A total of 10 young DM1 patients (mean age 30.4 years) and 14 age-matched normal controls participated in this study. ERPs were recorded using an auditory novel paradigm, consisting of three types of stimuli, i.e., standard sound (70%), target sound (20%), and various novel sounds (10%), and participants pressed buttons to the target sounds. ERP components P3b after the target stimuli and P3a following the novel stimuli were analyzed. Correlations of neuropsychological evaluations with the amplitudes and latencies of P3b and P3a were analyzed in DM1 patients. We found that P3a latency was significantly delayed in patients with DM1 compared with normal controls, although the latency and amplitude of P3b in DM1 patients were comparable with those in normal controls. The achievement rates of both the Symbol Digit Modality Test and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were significantly correlated with P3a amplitude, as well as P3b amplitude. These results suggest that ERPs, including P3a and P3b, provide important insights into the physiological basis of neuropsychological abnormalities in patients with DM1, especially from the viewpoint of the frontal lobe and attention function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Clinical course of central nervous system demyelinating neurological adverse events associated with anti-TNF therapy</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10460-6</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous studies have reported an association between anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) treatment and central nervous system (CNS) events. We described eight patients presenting with demyelinating CNS events while on treatment with anti-TNFα for autoimmune diseases and followed up for a medium period of 4 years. Four patients presented with isolated demyelinating events, three patients fulfilled the criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS), and one patient showed worsening of pre-existing MS after anti-TNF therapy initiation. All patients except one, showed a good medium-term prognosis. Our observation supports an association between anti-TNFα treatment and demyelinating events and suggests that a prompt discontinuation of the drug may lead to a favorable demyelinating disease outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a pleomorphic cytokine that can be found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a wide spectrum of inflammatory pathologies of the central nervous system (CNS).&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Our aim was to characterize the diagnostic significance of CSF IL-6 among various CNS inflammatory diseases with pseudotumoral lesions (CNSID) and primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL).&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We retrospectively analyzed the CSF IL-6 concentrations in 43 consecutive patients with suspected PCNSL. A total of 28 patients were positively diagnosed with PCNSL and 15 with CNSID. We verified the results with CSF IL-10, an established biomarker for PCNSL.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In the PCNSL group, the median CSF IL-6 concentration was 8 pg/ml, interquartile range (IQR) 5–18.5. For the patients with CNSID, the median concentration was 70 pg/ml, IQR 5–1368. A group comparison showed significantly higher CSF IL-6 levels in patients with CNSID than in those with PCNSL (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.032). Moreover, IL-6 was correlated with CSF cell count in the CNSID group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.56, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.028), but not in the PCNSL group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.3, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.13).&lt;/p&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We found significantly higher CSF IL-10 levels in patients with PCNSL than in patients with CNS inflammatory lesions (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Discussion and conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Our study suggests that CSF IL-6 levels could represent, in addition to CSF IL-10, a useful biomarker in the differential diagnosis of CNSID and suspected PCNSL.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We report a 57-year-old man with recurrent meningoencephalitis resulting in bouts of altered consciousness, encephalopathy, tremors, focal seizures, and paraparesis. The neurological manifestations were accompanied by fever and leukocytosis in the absence of other systemic manifestations. MRI abnormalities of the brain, brainstem, spinal cord and meninges and CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein were observed. Exhaustive studies failed to reveal an etiology. Brain biopsy revealed nodules of neutrophils and macrophages, but no vasculitis. The lesions were not vasocentric as would be expected with neuro-Behcet’s disease and neuro-Sweet’s disease. The disorder was responsive to high-dose corticosteroid therapy and, ultimately, to anakinra, an IL-1α and IL-1β receptor antagonist.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Mononeuritis multiplex: an unexpectedly frequent feature of severe COVID-19</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10321-8</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The prolonged mechanical ventilation that is often required by patients with severe COVID-19 is expected to result in significant intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) in many of the survivors. However, in our post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic we have found that, as well as the anticipated global weakness related to loss of muscle mass, a significant proportion of these patients also have disabling focal neurological deficits relating to multiple axonal mononeuropathies. Amongst the 69 patients with severe COVID-19 that have been discharged from the intensive care units in our hospital, we have seen 11 individuals (16%) with such a mononeuritis multiplex. In many instances, the multi-focal nature of the weakness in these patients was initially unrecognised as symptoms were wrongly assumed to relate simply to “critical illness neuromyopathy”. While mononeuropathy is well recognised as an occasional complication of intensive care, our experience suggests that such deficits are surprisingly frequent and often disabling in patients recovering from severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Critical illness-associated cerebral microbleeds for patients with severe COVID-19: etiologic hypotheses</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10313-8</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background and purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;During the COVID-19 outbreak, the presence of extensive white matter microhemorrhages was detected by brain MRIs. The goal of this study was to investigate the origin of this atypical hemorrhagic complication.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Between March 17 and May 18, 2020, 80 patients with severe COVID-19 infections were admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome to intensive care units at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg for whom a brain MRI for neurologic manifestations was performed. 19 patients (24%) with diffuse microhemorrhages were compared to 18 control patients with COVID-19 and normal brain MRI.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The first hypothesis was hypoxemia. The latter seemed very likely since respiratory failure was longer and more pronounced in patients with microhemorrhages (prolonged endotracheal intubation (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0002), higher FiO&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03), increased use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04)). A relevant hypothesis, the role of microangiopathy, was also considered, since patients with microhemorrhages presented a higher increase of the D-Dimers (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01) and a tendency to more frequent thrombotic events (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.12). Another hypothesis tested was the role of kidney failure, which was more severe in the group with diffuse microhemorrhages (higher creatinine level [median of 293 µmol/L versus 112 µmol/L, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04] and more dialysis were introduced in this group during ICU stay [12 versus 5 patients, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04]).&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Blood–brain barrier dysfunction secondary to hypoxemia and high concentration of uremic toxins seems to be the main mechanism leading to critical illness-associated cerebral microbleeds, and this complication remains to be frequently described in severe COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;

                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To perform an updated review of the literature on the neurological manifestations of COVID-19-infected patients&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A PRISMA-guideline-based systematic review was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. Series reporting neurological manifestations of COVID-19 patients were studied.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;39 studies and 68,361 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Up to 21.3% of COVID-19 patients presented neurological symptoms. Headache (5.4%), skeletal muscle injury (5.1%), psychiatric disorders (4.6%), impaired consciousness (2.8%), gustatory/olfactory dysfunction (2.3%), acute cerebrovascular events (1.4%), and dizziness (1.3%), were the most frequently reported neurological manifestations. Ischemic stroke occurred among 1.3% of COVID-19 patients. Other less common neurological manifestations were cranial nerve impairment (0.6%), nerve root and plexus disorders (0.4%), epilepsy (0.7%), and hemorrhagic stroke (0.15%). Impaired consciousness and acute cerebrovascular events were reported in 14% and 4% of patients with a severe disease, respectively, and they were significantly higher compared to non-severe patients (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Individual patient data from 129 COVID-19 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) were extracted: mean age was 64.4 (SD ± 6.2), 78.5% had anterior circulation occlusions, the mean NIHSS was 15 (SD ± 7), and the intra-hospital mortality rate was 22.8%. Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was required among 63% of patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This updated review of literature, shows that headache, skeletal muscle injury, psychiatric disorders, impaired consciousness, and gustatory/olfactory dysfunction were the most common neurological symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Impaired consciousness and acute cerebrovascular events were significantly higher among patients with a severe infection. AIS patients required ICU admission in 63% of cases, while intra-hospital mortality rate was close to 23%.&lt;/p&gt;

                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We retrospectively collected data on all patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at two Italian hospitals who developed encephalopathy during disease course and were treated with IVIg.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Five patients (two females, mean age 66.8 years) developed encephalopathy after a mean of 12.6 days, since the onset of respiratory/constitutional symptoms related to COVID-19. Four patients suffered severe respiratory distress, three of which required invasive mechanical ventilation. Neurological manifestations included impaired consciousness, agitation, delirium, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. EEG demonstrated diffuse slowing in all patients. Brain MRI showed non-specific findings. CSF analysis revealed normal cell count and protein levels. In all subjects, RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF tested negative. IVIg at 0.4 g/kg/die was commenced 29.8 days (mean, range: 19–55 days) after encephalopathy onset, leading to complete electroclinical recovery in all patients, with an initial improvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in 3.4 days (mean, range: 1–10 days). No adverse events related to IVIg were observed.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                      &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                      &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Our preliminary findings suggest that IVIg may represent a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19-associated encephalopathy. Clinical efficacy may be driven by the anti-inflammatory action of IVIg, associated with its anti-cytokine qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Valproate is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED) of particular interest in pediatric epilepsy syndromes and idiopathic generalized epilepsy, as it is relatively more effective in these syndromes than other AEDs. In 2018, the European Medicines Agency introduced new restrictions on the use of valproate in girls and women of childbearing potential to avoid exposure during pregnancy. The strengthening of existing restrictions sparked controversy and debate among patients and the medical community. The high prevalence of epilepsy syndromes amenable to valproate treatment in women of childbearing age and the little information available on the teratogenic potential of alternative treatments have created uncertainty on how to manage these patients. In this consensus statement, based on a review of the literature and the clinical experience of a panel of European epilepsy experts, we present general recommendations for the optimal clinical management of AED treatment in girls, women of childbearing potential, and pregnant women across the different epilepsy syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Autoencoder based local T cell repertoire density can be used to classify samples and T cell receptors</title>

Recent advances in T cell repertoire (TCR) sequencing allow for the characterization of repertoire properties, as well as the frequency and sharing of specific TCR. However, there is no efficient measure for the local density of a given TCR. TCRs are often described either through their Complementary Determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences, or theirV/J usage, or their clone size. We here show that the local repertoire density can be estimated using a combined representation of these components through distance conserving autoencoders and Kernel Density Estimates (KDE). We present ELATE–an Encoder-based LocAl Tcr dEnsity and show that the resulting density of a sample can be used as a novel measure to study repertoire properties. The cross-density between two samples can be used as a similarity matrix to fully characterize samples from the same host. Finally, the same projection in combination with machine learning algorithms can be used to predict TCR-peptide binding through the local density of known TCRs binding a specific target.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Pewz_SNSPBo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A mechanistic and data-driven reconstruction of the time-varying reproduction number: Application to the COVID-19 epidemic</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rTXxUPc-m_E/article</link>

The effective reproduction number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; is a critical epidemiological parameter that characterizes the transmissibility of a pathogen. However, this parameter is difficult to estimate in the presence of silent transmission and/or significant temporal variation in case reporting. This variation can occur due to the lack of timely or appropriate testing, public health interventions and/or changes in human behavior during an epidemic. This is exactly the situation we are confronted with during this COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we propose to estimate &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; for the SARS-CoV-2 (the etiological agent of the COVID-19), based on a model of its propagation considering a time-varying transmission rate. This rate is modeled by a Brownian diffusion process embedded in a stochastic model. The model is then fitted by Bayesian inference (particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method) using multiple well-documented hospital datasets from several regions in France and in Ireland. This mechanistic modeling framework enables us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the transmission rate of the COVID-19 based only on the available data. Except for the specific model structure, it is non-specifically assumed that the transmission rate follows a basic stochastic process constrained by the observations. This approach allows us to follow both the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and the temporal evolution of its &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;(t)&lt;/i&gt;. Besides, it allows to assess and to interpret the evolution of transmission with respect to the mitigation strategies implemented to control the epidemic waves in France and in Ireland. We can thus estimate a reduction of more than 80% for the first wave in all the studied regions but a smaller reduction for the second wave when the epidemic was less active, around 45% in France but just 20% in Ireland. For the third wave in Ireland the reduction was again significant (&amp;gt;70%).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rTXxUPc-m_E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Bridging cell-scale simulations and radiologic images to explain short-time intratumoral oxygen fluctuations</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/NVLRZweZEC8/article</link>

Radiologic images provide a way to monitor tumor development and its response to therapies in a longitudinal and minimally invasive fashion. However, they operate on a macroscopic scale (average value per voxel) and are not able to capture microscopic scale (cell-level) phenomena. Nevertheless, to examine the causes of frequent fast fluctuations in tissue oxygenation, models simulating individual cells’ behavior are needed. Here, we provide a link between the average data values recorded for radiologic images and the cellular and vascular architecture of the corresponding tissues. Using hybrid agent-based modeling, we generate a set of tissue morphologies capable of reproducing oxygenation levels observed in radiologic images. We then use these in silico tissues to investigate whether oxygen fluctuations can be explained by changes in vascular oxygen supply or by modulations in cellular oxygen absorption. Our studies show that intravascular changes in oxygen supply reproduce the observed fluctuations in tissue oxygenation in all considered regions of interest. However, larger-magnitude fluctuations cannot be recreated by modifications in cellular absorption of oxygen in a biologically feasible manner. Additionally, we develop a procedure to identify plausible tissue morphologies for a given temporal series of average data from radiology images. In future applications, this approach can be used to generate a set of tissues comparable with radiology images and to simulate tumor responses to various anti-cancer treatments at the tissue-scale level.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NVLRZweZEC8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Explaining distortions in metacognition with an attractor network model of decision uncertainty</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/yvdY5LR61fI/article</link>

Metacognition is the ability to reflect on, and evaluate, our cognition and behaviour. Distortions in metacognition are common in mental health disorders, though the neural underpinnings of such dysfunction are unknown. One reason for this is that models of key components of metacognition, such as decision confidence, are generally specified at an algorithmic or process level. While such models can be used to relate brain function to psychopathology, they are difficult to map to a neurobiological mechanism. Here, we develop a biologically-plausible model of decision uncertainty in an attempt to bridge this gap. We first relate the model’s uncertainty in perceptual decisions to standard metrics of metacognition, namely mean confidence level (bias) and the accuracy of metacognitive judgments (sensitivity). We show that dissociable shifts in metacognition are associated with isolated disturbances at higher-order levels of a circuit associated with self-monitoring, akin to neuropsychological findings that highlight the detrimental effect of prefrontal brain lesions on metacognitive performance. Notably, we are able to account for empirical confidence judgements by fitting the parameters of our biophysical model to first-order performance data, specifically choice and response times. Lastly, in a reanalysis of existing data we show that self-reported mental health symptoms relate to disturbances in an uncertainty-monitoring component of the network. By bridging a gap between a biologically-plausible model of confidence formation and observed disturbances of metacognition in mental health disorders we provide a first step towards mapping theoretical constructs of metacognition onto dynamical models of decision uncertainty. In doing so, we provide a computational framework for modelling metacognitive performance in settings where access to explicit confidence reports is not possible.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yvdY5LR61fI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, the Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) domain containing protein ZEITLUPE (ZTL) integrates light quality, intensity, and duration into regulation of the circadian clock. Recent structural and biochemical studies of ZTL indicate that the protein diverges from other members of the LOV superfamily in its allosteric mechanism, and that the divergent allosteric mechanism hinges upon conservation of two signaling residues G46 and V48 that alter dynamic motions of a Gln residue implicated in signal transduction in all LOV proteins. Here, we delineate the allosteric mechanism of ZTL via an integrated computational approach that employs atomistic simulations of wild type and allosteric variants of ZTL in the functional dark and light states, together with Markov state and supervised machine learning classification models. This approach has unveiled key factors of the ZTL allosteric mechanisms, and identified specific interactions and residues implicated in functional allosteric changes. The final results reveal atomic level insights into allosteric mechanisms of ZTL function that operate via a non-trivial combination of population-shift and dynamics-driven allosteric pathways.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kjMpqMWlUHc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for models that can project epidemic trends, explore intervention scenarios, and estimate resource needs. Here we describe the methodology of Covasim (COVID-19 Agent-based Simulator), an open-source model developed to help address these questions. Covasim includes country-specific demographic information on age structure and population size; realistic transmission networks in different social layers, including households, schools, workplaces, long-term care facilities, and communities; age-specific disease outcomes; and intrahost viral dynamics, including viral-load-based transmissibility. Covasim also supports an extensive set of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing and protective equipment; pharmaceutical interventions, including vaccination; and testing interventions, such as symptomatic and asymptomatic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine. These interventions can incorporate the effects of delays, loss-to-follow-up, micro-targeting, and other factors. Implemented in pure Python, Covasim has been designed with equal emphasis on performance, ease of use, and flexibility: realistic and highly customized scenarios can be run on a standard laptop in under a minute. In collaboration with local health agencies and policymakers, Covasim has already been applied to examine epidemic dynamics and inform policy decisions in more than a dozen countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/L4aiHLnWwdA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Insights into substrate recognition and specificity for IgG by Endoglycosidase S2</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/N8dx-zUlq_s/article</link>

Antibodies bind foreign antigens with high affinity and specificity leading to their neutralization and/or clearance by the immune system. The conserved N-glycan on IgG has significant impact on antibody effector function, with the endoglycosidases of &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pyogen&lt;/i&gt;es deglycosylating the IgG to evade the immune system, a process catalyzed by the endoglycosidase EndoS2. Studies have shown that two of the four domains of EndoS2, the carbohydrate binding module (CBM) and the glycoside hydrolase (GH) domain site are critical for catalytic activity. To yield structural insights into contributions of the CBM and the GH domains as well as the overall flexibility of EndoS2 to the proteins’ catalytic activity, models of EndoS2-Fc complexes were generated through enhanced-sampling molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation and site-identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) docking followed by reconstruction and multi-microsecond MD simulations. Modeling results predict that EndoS2 initially interacts with the IgG through its CBM followed by interactions with the GH yielding catalytically competent states. These may involve the CBM and GH of EndoS2 simultaneously interacting with either the same Fc CH2/CH3 domain or individually with the two Fc CH2/CH3 domains, with EndoS2 predicted to assume closed conformations in the former case and open conformations in the latter. Apo EndoS2 is predicted to sample both the open and closed states, suggesting that either complex can directly form following initial IgG-EndoS2 encounter. Interactions of the CBM and GH domains with the IgG are predicted to occur through both its glycan and protein regions. Simulations also predict that the Fc glycan can directly transfer from the CBM to the GH, facilitating formation of catalytically competent complexes and how the 734 to 751 loop on the CBM can facilitate extraction of the glycan away from the Fc CH2/CH3 domain. The predicted models are compared and consistent with Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange data. In addition, the complex models are consistent with the high specificity of EndoS2 for the glycans on IgG supporting the validity of the predicted models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N8dx-zUlq_s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Mathematical models have played a key role in understanding the spread of directly-transmissible infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as the effectiveness of public health responses. As the risk of contracting directly-transmitted infections depends on who interacts with whom, mathematical models often use contact matrices to characterise the spread of infectious pathogens. These contact matrices are usually generated from diary-based contact surveys. However, the majority of places in the world do not have representative empirical contact studies, so synthetic contact matrices have been constructed using more widely available setting-specific survey data on household, school, classroom, and workplace composition combined with empirical data on contact patterns in Europe. In 2017, the largest set of synthetic contact matrices to date were published for 152 geographical locations. In this study, we update these matrices with the most recent data and extend our analysis to 177 geographical locations. Due to the observed geographic differences within countries, we also quantify contact patterns in rural and urban settings where data is available. Further, we compare both the 2017 and 2020 synthetic matrices to out-of-sample empirically-constructed contact matrices, and explore the effects of using both the empirical and synthetic contact matrices when modelling physical distancing interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the synthetic contact matrices show qualitative similarities to the contact patterns in the empirically-constructed contact matrices. Models parameterised with the empirical and synthetic matrices generated similar findings with few differences observed in age groups where the empirical matrices have missing or aggregated age groups. This finding means that synthetic contact matrices may be used in modelling outbreaks in settings for which empirical studies have yet to be conducted.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BJMpiYaNShg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/MuMN7f--6iY/article</link>

Architectural changes at the cellular and organism level are integral and necessary to successful development and growth. During mammalian preimplantation development, cells reduce in size and the architecture of the embryo changes significantly. Such changes must be coordinated correctly to ensure continued development of the embryo and, ultimately, a successful pregnancy. However, the nature of such transformations is poorly defined during mammalian preimplantation development. In order to quantitatively describe changes in cell environment and organism architecture, we designed Internal Versus External Neighbourhood (IVEN). IVEN is a user-interactive, open-source pipeline that classifies cells into different populations based on their position and quantifies the number of neighbours of every cell within a dataset in a 3D environment. Through IVEN-driven analyses, we show how transformations in cell environment, defined here as changes in cell neighbourhood, are related to changes in embryo geometry and major developmental events during preimplantation mammalian development. Moreover, we demonstrate that modulation of the FGF pathway alters spatial relations of inner cells and neighbourhood distributions, leading to overall changes in embryo architecture. In conjunction with IVEN-driven analyses, we uncover differences in the dynamic of cell size changes over the preimplantation period and determine that cells within the mammalian embryo initiate growth phase only at the time of implantation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MuMN7f--6iY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metaheuristics (MHs) in general and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) in
particular are well known tools for successful optimization of difficult
problems. But when is their application meaningful and how does one approach
such a project as a novice? How do you avoid beginner's mistakes or use the
design possibilities of a metaheuristic search as efficiently as possible? This
paper tries to give answers to these questions based on 30 years of research
and application of the Evolutionary Algorithm GLEAM and its memetic extension
HyGLEAM. Most of the experience gathered and discussed here can also be applied
to the use of other metaheuristics such as ant algorithms or particle swarm
optimization. This paper addresses users with basic knowledge of MHs in general
and EAs in particular who want to apply them in an optimization project. For
this purpose, a number of questions that arise in the course of such a project
are addressed. At the end, some non-technical project management issues are
discussed, whose importance for project success is often underestimated.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Solving Mixed Integer Programs Using Neural Networks. (arXiv:2012.13349v2 [math.OC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13349</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solvers rely on an array of sophisticated
heuristics developed with decades of research to solve large-scale MIP
instances encountered in practice. Machine learning offers to automatically
construct better heuristics from data by exploiting shared structure among
instances in the data. This paper applies learning to the two key sub-tasks of
a MIP solver, generating a high-quality joint variable assignment, and bounding
the gap in objective value between that assignment and an optimal one. Our
approach constructs two corresponding neural network-based components, Neural
Diving and Neural Branching, to use in a base MIP solver such as SCIP. Neural
Diving learns a deep neural network to generate multiple partial assignments
for its integer variables, and the resulting smaller MIPs for un-assigned
variables are solved with SCIP to construct high quality joint assignments.
Neural Branching learns a deep neural network to make variable selection
decisions in branch-and-bound to bound the objective value gap with a small
tree. This is done by imitating a new variant of Full Strong Branching we
propose that scales to large instances using GPUs. We evaluate our approach on
six diverse real-world datasets, including two Google production datasets and
MIPLIB, by training separate neural networks on each. Most instances in all the
datasets combined have $10^3-10^6$ variables and constraints after presolve,
which is significantly larger than previous learning approaches. Comparing
solvers with respect to primal-dual gap averaged over a held-out set of
instances, the learning-augmented SCIP is 2x to 10x better on all datasets
except one on which it is $10^5$x better, at large time limits. To the best of
our knowledge, ours is the first learning approach to demonstrate such large
improvements over SCIP on both large-scale real-world application datasets and
MIPLIB.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Science is a crowning glory of the human spirit and its applications remain
our best hope for social progress. But there are limitations to current science
and perhaps to any science. The general mind-body problem is known to be
intractable and currently mysterious. This is one of many deep problems that
are universally agreed to be beyond the current purview of Science, including
quantum phenomena, etc. But all of these famous unsolved problems are either
remote from everyday experience (entanglement, dark matter) or are hard to even
define sharply (phenomenology, consciousness, etc.).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this note, we will consider some obvious computational problems in vision
that arise every time that we open our eyes and yet are demonstrably
incompatible with current theories of neural computation. The focus will be on
two related phenomena, known as the neural binding problem and the illusion of
a detailed stable visual world.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Lovastatin Alleviates α-Synuclein Aggregation and Phosphorylation in Cellular Models of Synucleinopathy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.682320</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Pathologically, it is characterized by the aberrant aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in neurons. Clinical evidence shows that patients with hypercholesterolemia are more likely to get PD, while lovastatin users have a lower risk of suffering from it. In this study, we investigated the effects of lovastatin on the aggregation and phosphorylation of α-syn in vitro. Our results demonstrate that α-syn preformed fibrils induce the phosphorylation and aggregation of α-syn in HEK293 cells stably transfected with α-syn-GFP and SH-SY5Y cells as well, which could be attenuated by in a concentration-dependent manner. Besides, lovastatin inhibited oxidative stress, histone acetylation, and the activation of casein kinase 2 (CK2). Collectively, lovastatin alleviates α-syn aggregation and phosphorylation in cellular models of synucleinopathy, indicating its potential value of being adopted in the management of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: A Simulation Toolkit for Testing the Sensitivity and Accuracy of Corticometry Pipelines</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.665560</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the replicability of neuroimaging findings has become an important concern to the research community. Neuroimaging pipelines consist of myriad numerical procedures, which can have a cumulative effect on the accuracy of findings. To address this problem, we propose a method for simulating artificial lesions in the brain in order to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of lesion detection, using different automated corticometry pipelines. We have applied this method to different versions of two widely used neuroimaging pipelines (CIVET and FreeSurfer), in terms of coefficients of variation; sensitivity and specificity of detecting lesions in 4 different regions of interest in the cortex, while introducing variations to the lesion size, the blurring kernel used prior to statistical analyses, and different thickness metrics (in CIVET). These variations are tested in a between-subject design (in two random groups, with and without lesions, using T1-weigted MRIs of 152 individuals from the International Consortium of Brain Mapping (ICBM) dataset) and in a within-subject pre-/post-lesion design [using 21 T1-Weighted MRIs of a single adult individual, scanned in the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS)]. The simulation method is sensitive to partial volume effect and lesion size. Comparisons between pipelines illustrate the ability of this method to uncover differences in sensitivity and specificity of lesion detection. We propose that this method be adopted in the workflow of software development and release.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effects of Group Therapeutic Singing on Cortisol and Motor Symptoms in Persons With Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.703382</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of music into the treatment plan for persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) may be a viable strategy to target multiple motor symptoms. However, potential mechanisms to explain why music has an impact on multiple motor symptoms in persons with PD remain understudied. The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of 1 h of group therapeutic singing (GTS) on physiological measures of stress and clinical motor symptoms in persons with PD. We posit that improvement in motor symptoms after GTS may be related to stress reduction. Seventeen participants with PD completed 1 h of GTS and eight participants completed 1 h of a quiet reading (control session). Cortisol was collected via passive drool immediately before and after the singing and control session. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part-III (motor examination) was also video-recorded immediately before and after the singing and control session and scored by two raters masked to time and condition. Secondary outcome measures for quality of life, depression, and mood were collected. Results revealed no significant change in cortisol or motor UPDRS scores, as well as no significant relationship between cortisol and motor UPDRS scores. There was a trend for the singing group to report feeling less sad compared to the control group after the 1-h session (effect size = 0.86), and heart rate increased in the singing group while heart rate decreased in the control group after the 1-h session. These results suggest that an acute session of GTS is not unduly stressful and promotes the use of GTS for persons with PD. Multiple mechanisms may underlie the benefits of GTS for persons with PD. Further exploring potential mechanisms by which singing improves motor symptoms in persons with PD will provide greater insight on the therapeutic use of music for persons with PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings from patients with epilepsy provide distinct opportunities and novel data for the study of co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Comorbid psychiatric disorders are very common in drug-resistant epilepsy and their added complexity warrants careful consideration. In this review, we first discuss psychiatric comorbidities and symptoms in patients with epilepsy. We describe how epilepsy can potentially impact patient presentation and how these factors can be addressed in the experimental designs of studies focused on the electrophysiologic correlates of mood. Second, we review emerging technologies to integrate long-term iEEG recording with dense behavioral tracking in naturalistic environments. Third, we explore questions on how best to address the intersection between epilepsy and psychiatric comorbidities. Advances in ambulatory iEEG and long-term behavioral monitoring technologies will be instrumental in studying the intersection of seizures, epilepsy, psychiatric comorbidities, and their underlying circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cortical Networks of Creative Ability Trace Gene Expression Profiles of Synaptic Plasticity in the Human Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.694274</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to produce novel ideas is central to societal progress and innovation; however, little is known about the biological basis of creativity. Here, we investigate the organization of brain networks that support creativity by combining functional neuroimaging data with gene expression information. Given the multifaceted nature of creative thinking, we hypothesized that distributed connectivity would not only be related to individual differences in creative ability, but also delineate the cortical distributions of genes involved in synaptic plasticity. We defined neuroimaging phenotypes using a graph theory approach that detects local and distributed network circuits, then characterized the spatial associations between functional connectivity and cortical gene expression distributions. Our findings reveal strong spatial correlations between connectivity maps and sets of genes devoted to synaptic assembly and signaling. This connectomic-transcriptome approach thus identifies gene expression profiles associated with high creative ability, linking cognitive flexibility to neural plasticity in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The study attempts to indicate the features influencing the perception of attractiveness and trust. In order to select individual factors, a model of backward stepwise logistic regression was used, analyzing the results of the psychological tests and the attractiveness and trust survey. Statistical analysis made it possible to select the most important personality traits related to attractiveness and trust assessments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Electrophysiological and Transcriptomic Features Reveal a Circular Taxonomy of Cortical Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.684950</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The complete understanding of the mammalian brain requires exact knowledge of the function of each neuron subpopulation composing its parts. To achieve this goal, an exhaustive, precise, reproducible, and robust neuronal taxonomy should be defined. In this paper, a new circular taxonomy based on transcriptomic features and novel electrophysiological features is proposed. The approach is validated by analysing more than 1850 electrophysiological signals of different mouse visual cortex neurons proceeding from the Allen Cell Types database. The study is conducted on two different levels: neurons and their cell-type aggregation into Cre lines. At the neuronal level, electrophysiological features have been extracted with a promising model that has already proved its worth in neuronal dynamics. At the Cre line level, electrophysiological and transcriptomic features are joined on cell types with available genetic information. A taxonomy with a circular order is revealed by a simple transformation of the first two principal components that allow the characterization of the different Cre lines. Moreover, the proposed methodology locates other Cre lines in the taxonomy that do not have transcriptomic features available. Finally, the taxonomy is validated by Machine Learning methods which are able to discriminate the different neuron types with the proposed electrophysiological features.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Menstrual Cycle Alters Resting-State Cortical Activity: A Magnetoencephalography Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.652789</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Resting-state neural oscillations are used as biomarkers for functional diseases such as dementia, epilepsy, and stroke. However, accurate interpretation of clinical outcomes requires the identification and minimisation of potential confounding factors. While several studies have indicated that the menstrual cycle also alters brain activity, most of these studies were based on visual inspection rather than objective quantitative measures. In the present study, we aimed to clarify the effect of the menstrual cycle on spontaneous neural oscillations based on quantitative magnetoencephalography (MEG) parameters. Resting-state MEG activity was recorded from 25 healthy women with normal menstrual cycles. For each woman, resting-state brain activity was acquired twice using MEG: once during their menstrual period (MP) and once outside of this period (OP). Our results indicated that the median frequency and peak alpha frequency of the power spectrum were low, whereas Shannon spectral entropy was high, during the MP. Theta intensity within the right temporal cortex and right limbic system was significantly lower during the MP than during the OP. High gamma intensity in the left parietal cortex was also significantly lower during the MP than during the OP. Similar differences were also observed in the parietal and occipital regions between the proliferative (the late part of the follicular phase) and secretory phases (luteal phase). Our findings suggest that the menstrual cycle should be considered to ensure accurate interpretation of functional neuroimaging in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.692334</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Texture information plays a critical role in the rapid perception of scenes, objects, and materials. Here, we propose a novel model in which visual texture perception is essentially determined by the 1st-order (2D-luminance) and 2nd-order (4D-energy) spectra. This model is an extension of the dimensionality of the Filter-Rectify-Filter (FRF) model, and it also corresponds to the frequency representation of the Portilla-Simoncelli (PS) statistics. We show that preserving two spectra and randomizing phases of a natural texture image result in a perceptually similar texture, strongly supporting the model. Based on only two single spectral spaces, this model provides a simpler framework to describe and predict texture representations in the primate visual system. The idea of multi-order spectral analysis is consistent with the hierarchical processing principle of the visual cortex, which is approximated by a multi-layer convolutional network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.716747</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The programmed cell death protein-1/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) axis is a widely studied immune checkpoint that modulates signaling pathways related to T cell activation. The use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors is a promising immune therapy strategy for cancer patients. However, individuals treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors may develop immune-related adverse events due to excessive immune reactions. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. T cells and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis play vital roles in the pathogenesis of MS. A better understanding of the complex relationship between the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and T cells may extend our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic approaches for MS. In this review, we summarize the most recent findings regarding the role of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in MS and discuss the potential therapeutic strategies to modulate the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Alteration of Mesopontine Cholinergic Function by the Lack of KCNQ4 Subunit</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.707789</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), a structure known as a cholinergic member of the reticular activating system (RAS), is source and target of cholinergic neuromodulation and contributes to the regulation of the sleep–wakefulness cycle. The M-current is a voltage-gated potassium current modulated mainly by cholinergic signaling. KCNQ subunits ensemble into ion channels responsible for the M-current. In the central nervous system, KCNQ4 expression is restricted to certain brainstem structures such as the RAS nuclei. Here, we investigated the presence and functional significance of KCNQ4 in the PPN by behavioral studies and the gene and protein expressions and slice electrophysiology using a mouse model lacking KCNQ4 expression. We found that this mouse has alterations in the adaptation to changes in light–darkness cycles, representing the potential role of KCNQ4 in the regulation of the sleep–wakefulness cycle. As cholinergic neurons from the PPN participate in the regulation of this cycle, we investigated whether the cholinergic PPN might also possess functional KCNQ4 subunits. Although the M-current is an electrophysiological hallmark of cholinergic neurons, only a subpopulation of them had KCNQ4-dependent M-current. Interestingly, the absence of the KCNQ4 subunit altered the expression patterns of the other KCNQ subunits in the PPN. We also determined that, in wild-type animals, the cholinergic inputs of the PPN modulated the M-current, and these in turn can modulate the level of synchronization between neighboring PPN neurons. Taken together, the KCNQ4 subunit is present in a subpopulation of PPN cholinergic neurons, and it may contribute to the regulation of the sleep–wakefulness cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.703810</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes are essential for the development and homeostatic maintenance of the central nervous system (CNS). They are also critical players in the CNS injury response during which they undergo a process referred to as “reactive astrogliosis.” Diversity in astrocyte morphology and gene expression, as revealed by transcriptional analysis, is well-recognized and has been reported in several CNS pathologies, including ischemic stroke, CNS demyelination, and traumatic injury. This diversity appears unique to the specific pathology, with significant variance across temporal, topographical, age, and sex-specific variables. Despite this, there is limited functional data corroborating this diversity. Furthermore, as reactive astrocytes display significant environmental-dependent plasticity and fate-mapping data on astrocyte subsets in the adult CNS is limited, it remains unclear whether this diversity represents heterogeneity or plasticity. As astrocytes are important for neuronal survival and CNS function post-injury, establishing to what extent this diversity reflects distinct established heterogeneous astrocyte subpopulations vs. environmentally dependent plasticity within established astrocyte subsets will be critical for guiding therapeutic development. To that end, we review the current state of knowledge on astrocyte diversity in the context of three representative CNS pathologies: ischemic stroke, demyelination, and traumatic injury, with the goal of identifying key limitations in our current knowledge and suggesting future areas of research needed to address them. We suggest that the majority of identified astrocyte diversity in CNS pathologies to date represents plasticity in response to dynamically changing post-injury environments as opposed to heterogeneity, an important consideration for the understanding of disease pathogenesis and the development of therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Computational and Molecular Properties of Starburst Amacrine Cell Synapses Differ With Postsynaptic Cell Type</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.660773</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A presynaptic neuron can increase its computational capacity by transmitting functionally distinct signals to each of its postsynaptic cell types. To determine whether such computational specialization occurs over fine spatial scales within a neurite arbor, we investigated computation at output synapses of the starburst amacrine cell (SAC), a critical component of the classical direction-selective (DS) circuit in the retina. The SAC is a non-spiking interneuron that co-releases GABA and acetylcholine and forms closely spaced (&amp;lt;5 μm) inhibitory synapses onto two postsynaptic cell types: DS ganglion cells (DSGCs) and neighboring SACs. During dynamic optogenetic stimulation of SACs in mouse retina, whole-cell recordings of inhibitory postsynaptic currents revealed that GABAergic synapses onto DSGCs exhibit stronger low-pass filtering than those onto neighboring SACs. Computational analyses suggest that this filtering difference can be explained primarily by presynaptic properties, rather than those of the postsynaptic cells per se. Consistent with functionally diverse SAC presynapses, blockade of N-type voltage-gated calcium channels abolished GABAergic currents in SACs but only moderately reduced GABAergic and cholinergic currents in DSGCs. These results jointly demonstrate how specialization of synaptic outputs could enhance parallel processing in a compact interneuron over fine spatial scales. Moreover, the distinct transmission kinetics of GABAergic SAC synapses are poised to support the functional diversity of inhibition within DS circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: tDCS-Induced Memory Reconsolidation Effects and Its Associations With Structural and Functional MRI Substrates in Subjective Cognitive Decline</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.695232</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous evidence suggests that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (l-DLPFC) can enhance episodic memory in subjects with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), known to be at risk of dementia. Our main goal was to replicate such findings in an independent sample and elucidate if baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics predicted putative memory improvement. Thirty-eight participants with SCD (aged: 60–65 years) were randomly assigned to receive active (N = 19) or sham (N = 19) tDCS in a double-blind design. They underwent a verbal learning task with 15 words (DAY-1), and 24 h later (DAY-2) stimulation was applied for 15 min at 1.5 mA targeting the l-DLPFC after offering a contextual reminder. Delayed recall and recognition were measured 1 day after the stimulation session (DAY-3), and at 1-month follow-up (DAY-30). Before the experimental session, structural and functional MRI were acquired. We identified a group&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;time interaction in recognition memory, being the active tDCS group able to maintain stable memory performance between DAY-3 and DAY-30. MRI results revealed that individuals with superior tDCS-induced effects on memory reconsolidation exhibited higher left temporal lobe thickness and greater intrinsic FC within the default-mode network. Present findings confirm that tDCS, through the modulation of memory reconsolidation, is capable of enhancing performance in people with self-perceived cognitive complaints. Results suggest that SCD subjects with more preserved structural and functional integrity might benefit from these interventions, promoting maintenance of cognitive function in a population at risk to develop dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Functional MRI-Specific Alterations in Salience Network in Mild Cognitive Impairment: An ALE Meta-Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.695210</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia. Amnestic MCI (aMCI) and non-amnestic MCI are the two subtypes of MCI with the former having a higher risk for progressing to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compared with healthy elderly adults, individuals with MCI have specific functional alterations in the salience network (SN). However, no consistent results are documenting these changes. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the specific functional alterations in the SN in MCI and aMCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for scientific neuroimaging literature based on three research methods, namely, functional connectivity (FC), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation or fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF/fALFF). Then, we conducted the coordinate-based meta-analysis by using the activation likelihood estimation algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In total, 30 functional neuroimaging studies were included. After extracting the data and analyzing it, we obtained specific changes in some brain regions in the SN including decreased ALFF/fALFF in the left superior temporal gyrus, the insula, the precentral gyrus, and the precuneus in MCI and aMCI; increased FC in the thalamus, the caudate, the superior temporal gyrus, the insula, and the cingulate gyrus in MCI; and decreased ReHo in the anterior cingulate gyrus in aMCI. In addition, as to FC, interactions of the SN with other networks including the default mode network and the executive control network were also observed mainly in the middle frontal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus in MCI and inferior frontal gyrus in aMCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Specific functional alternations in the SN and interactions of the SN with other networks in MCI could be useful as potential imaging biomarkers for MCI or aMCI. Meanwhile, it provided a new insight in predicting the progression of health to MCI or aMCI and novel targets for proper intervention to delay the progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic Review Registration: [PROSPERO], identifier [No. CRD42020216259].&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Related Olfactory Decline Is Associated With Levels of Exercise and Non-exercise Physical Activities</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.695115</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This cross-sectional study evaluates the impact of active or non-active lifestyle in terms of physical, cognitive and social activity on the olfactory function in Elderly Subjects (ES) and aims at looking for a correlation between the time devoted to life activities and the score obtained during the olfactory tests by each individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One hundred and twenty-two elderly volunteers were recruited in Sardinia (Italy) and divided into active ES (n = 60; 17 men, 43 women; age 67.8 ± 1.12 years) and inactive ES (n = 62; 21 men, 41 women, age 71.1 ± 1.14 years) based on their daily physical activities. The olfactory function was evaluated using the “Sniffin’s Sticks” battery test, while the assessment of daily activities was made by means of personal interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A significant effect of active or inactive lifestyle was found on the olfactory function of ES (F&lt;sub&gt;(1,120)&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 10.16; p &amp;lt; 0.005). A positive correlation was found between the olfactory scores and the number of hours per week dedicated to physical activities (Pearson’s r &amp;gt; 0.32, p ≤ 0.014) in both active and inactive ES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: High levels of exercise and non-exercise physical activity are strongly associated with the olfactory function and, consequently, with the quality of life of the elderly. Given the limited physical exercise of elderly people, they can benefit from a more active lifestyle by increasing non-exercise physical activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Validity Evidence for the Research Category, “Cognitively Unimpaired – Declining,” as a Risk Marker for Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.688478</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While clinically significant cognitive impairment is the key feature of the symptomatic stages of the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) continuum, subtle cognitive decline is now known to occur years before a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia due to AD is made. The primary aim of this study was to examine criterion validity evidence for an operational definition of “cognitively unimpaired-declining” (CU-D) in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP), a longitudinal cohort study following cognition and risk factors from mid-life and on. Cognitive status was determined for each visit using a consensus review process that incorporated internal norms and published norms; a multi-disciplinary panel reviewed cases first to determine whether MCI or dementia was present, and subsequently whether CU-D was present, The CU-D group differed from CU-stable (CU-S) and MCI on concurrent measures of cognition, demonstrating concurrent validity. Participants who changed from CU-S to CU-D at the next study visit demonstrated greater declines than those who stayed CU-S. In addition, those who were CU-D were more likely to progress to MCI or dementia than those who were CU-S (predictive validity). In a subsample with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, the CU-D group also differed from the CU-S and MCI/Dementia groups on measures of amyloid and tau burden, indicating that biomarker evidence of AD was elevated in those showing sub-clinical (CU-D) decline. Together, the results corroborate other studies showing that cognitive decline begins long before a dementia diagnosis and indicate that operational criteria can detect subclinical decline that may signal AD or other dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Serum miR-96-5P and miR-339-5P Are Potential Biomarkers for Multiple System Atrophy and Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.632891</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) are progressive neurodegenerative diseases with overlap of symptoms in early stages of disease. No reliable biomarker exists and the diagnosis is mainly based on clinical features. Several studies suggest that miRNAs are involved in PD and MSA pathogenesis. Our goal was to study two serum circulating microRNAs (miR-96-5p and miR-339-5p) as novel biomarkers for the differential diagnosis between PD and MSA. Serum samples were obtained from 51 PD patients, 52 MSA patients and 56 healthy controls (HC). We measured levels of miRNAs using quantitative PCR and compared the levels of miR-96-5p and miR-339-5p among PD, MSA and HC groups using a one-way analysis of variance. Correlations between miRNA expression and clinical data were calculated using Pearson's rho test. We used the miRTarBase to detect miRNA targets and STRING to evaluate co-expression relationship among target genes. MiR-96-5p was significantly increased in MSA patients compared with HC (Fold change (fc): 3.6; p = 0.0001) while it was decreased in PD patients compared with HC (Fold change: 4; p = 0.0002). Higher miR-96-5P levels were directly related to longer disease duration in MSA patients. We observed a significant increase of miR-339-5p in MSA patients compared with PD patients (fc: 2.5; p = 0.00013). miR-339-5p was increased in MSA patients compared with HC (fc: 2.4; p = 0.002). We identified 32 target genes of miR-96-5p and miR-339-5p, some of which are involved in neurodegenerative diseases. The study of those miRNAs could be useful to identify non-invasive biomarkers for early differential diagnosis between PD and MSA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68710</link>
	<content:encoded>Respiratory complex I is a multi-subunit membrane protein complex that reversibly couples NADH oxidation and ubiquinone reduction with proton translocation against trans-membrane potential. Complex I from &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli &lt;/i&gt;is among the best functionally characterized complexes, but its structure remains unknown, hindering further mechanistic studies to understand the enzyme coupling mechanism. Here we describe the single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the entire catalytically active &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; complex I reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs. The structure of this mesophilic bacterial complex I displays highly dynamic connection between the peripheral and membrane domains. The peripheral domain assembly is stabilized by unique terminal extensions and an insertion loop. The membrane domain structure reveals novel dynamic features. Unusual conformation of the conserved interface between the peripheral and membrane domains suggests an uncoupled conformation of the complex. Considering constraints imposed by the structural data we suggest a new simple hypothetical coupling mechanism for the molecular machine.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Sequence structure organizes items in varied latent states of working memory neural network</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67589</link>
	<content:encoded>In memory experiences, events do not exist independently but are linked with each other via structure-based organization. Structure context largely influences memory behavior, but how it is implemented in the brain remains unknown. Here, we combined magnetoencephalogram (MEG) recordings, computational modeling, and impulse-response approaches to probe the latent states when subjects held a list of items in working memory (WM). We demonstrate that sequence context reorganizes WM items into distinct latent states, i.e., being reactivated at different latencies during WM retention, and the reactivation profiles further correlate with recency behavior. In contrast, memorizing the same list of items without sequence task requirements weakens the recency effect and elicits comparable neural reactivations. Computational modeling further reveals a dominant function of sequence context, instead of passive memory decaying, in characterizing recency effect. Taken together, sequence structure context shapes the way WM items are stored in the human brain and essentially influences memory behavior.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A Brownian ratchet model for DNA loop extrusion by the cohesin complex</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67530</link>
	<content:encoded>The cohesin complex topologically encircles DNA to promote sister chromatid cohesion. Alternatively, cohesin extrudes DNA loops, thought to reflect chromatin domain formation. Here, we propose a structure-based model explaining both activities. ATP and DNA binding promote cohesin conformational changes that guide DNA through a kleisin N-gate into a DNA gripping state. Two HEAT-repeat DNA binding modules, associated with cohesin’s heads and hinge, are now juxtaposed. Gripping state disassembly, following ATP hydrolysis, triggers unidirectional hinge module movement, which completes topological DNA entry by directing DNA through the ATPase head gate. If head gate passage fails, hinge module motion creates a Brownian ratchet that, instead, drives loop extrusion. Molecular-mechanical simulations of gripping state formation and resolution cycles recapitulate experimentally observed DNA loop extrusion characteristics. Our model extends to asymmetric and symmetric loop extrusion, as well as z-loop formation. Loop extrusion by biased Brownian motion has important implications for chromosomal cohesin function.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67390</link>
	<content:encoded>Kinetochores are multi-subunit protein assemblies that link chromosomes to microtubules of the mitotic and meiotic spindle. It is still poorly understood how efficient, centromere-dependent kinetochore assembly is accomplished from hundreds of individual protein building blocks in a cell cycle dependent manner. Here, by combining comprehensive phosphorylation analysis of native Ctf19&lt;sup&gt;CCAN&lt;/sup&gt; subunits with biochemical and functional assays in the model system budding yeast, we demonstrate that Cdk1 phosphorylation activates phospho-degrons on the essential subunit Ame1&lt;sup&gt;CENP-U &lt;/sup&gt;which are recognized by the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF-Cdc4. Gradual phosphorylation of degron motifs culminates in M-Phase and targets the protein for degradation. Binding of the Mtw1&lt;sup&gt;Mis12&lt;/sup&gt; complex shields the proximal phospho-degron, protecting kinetochore-bound Ame1 from the degradation machinery. Artificially increasing degron strength partially suppresses the temperature-sensitivity of a &lt;i&gt;cdc4&lt;/i&gt; mutant, while overexpression of Ame1-Okp1 is toxic in SCF mutants, demonstrating the physiological importance of this mechanism. We propose that phospho-regulated clearance of excess CCAN subunits facilitates efficient centromere-dependent kinetochore assembly. Our results suggest a novel strategy for how phospho-degrons can be used to regulate the assembly of multi-subunit complexes.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66649</link>
	<content:encoded>Living with relatives can be highly beneficial, enhancing reproduction and survival. High relatedness can, however, increase susceptibility to pathogens. Here, we examine whether the benefits of living with relatives offset the harm caused by pathogens, and if this depends on whether species typically live with kin. Using comparative meta-analysis of plants, animals, and a bacterium (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;species&lt;/sub&gt; = 56), we show that high within-group relatedness increases mortality when pathogens are present. In contrast, mortality decreased with relatedness when pathogens were rare, particularly in species that live with kin. Furthermore, across groups variation in mortality was lower when relatedness was high, but abundances of pathogens were more variable. The effects of within-group relatedness were only evident when pathogens were experimentally manipulated, suggesting that the harm caused by pathogens is masked by the benefits of living with relatives in nature. These results highlight the importance of kin selection for understanding disease spread in natural populations.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65634</link>
	<content:encoded>Summation of ionotropic receptor-mediated responses is critical in neuronal computation by shaping input-output characteristics of neurons. However, arithmetics of summation for metabotropic signals are not known. We characterized the combined ionotropic and metabotropic output of neocortical neurogliaform cells (NGFCs) using electrophysiological and anatomical methods in the rat cerebral cortex. These experiments revealed that GABA receptors are activated outside release sites and confirmed coactivation of putative NGFCs in superficial cortical layers in vivo. Triple recordings from presynaptic NGFCs converging to a postsynaptic neuron revealed sublinear summation of ionotropic GABAA responses and linear summation of metabotropic GABAB responses. Based on a model combining properties of volume transmission and distributions of all NGFC axon terminals, we predict that in 83% of cases one or two NGFCs can provide input to a point in the neuropil. We suggest that interactions of metabotropic GABAergic responses remain linear even if most superficial layer interneurons specialized to recruit GABAB receptors are simultaneously active.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65459</link>
	<content:encoded>For solving tasks such as recognizing a song, answering a question, or inverting a sequence of symbols, cortical microcircuits need to integrate and manipulate information that was dispersed over time during the preceding seconds. Creating biologically realistic models for the underlying computations, especially with spiking neurons and for behaviorally relevant integration time spans, is notoriously difficult. We examine the role of spike frequency adaptation in such computations and find that it has a surprisingly large impact. The inclusion of this well-known property of a substantial fraction of neurons in the neocortex – especially in higher areas of the human neocortex – moves the performance of spiking neural network models for computations on network inputs that are temporally dispersed from a fairly low level up to the performance level of the human brain.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Chondrocytes in the resting zone of the postnatal growth plate are characterized by slow cell cycle progression, and encompass a population of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP)-expressing skeletal stem cells that contribute to the formation of columnar chondrocytes. However, how these chondrocytes are maintained in the resting zone remains undefined. We undertook a genetic pulse-chase approach to isolate slow cycling, label-retaining chondrocytes (LRCs) using a chondrocyte-specific doxycycline-controllable Tet-Off system regulating expression of histone 2B-linked GFP. Comparative RNA-seq analysis identified significant enrichment of inhibitors and activators for Wnt signaling in LRCs and non-LRCs, respectively. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in PTHrP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; resting chondrocytes using &lt;i&gt;Pthlh-creER&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Apc&lt;/i&gt;-floxed allele impaired their ability to form columnar chondrocytes.

	<title>eLife: HOXA9 promotes MYC-mediated leukemogenesis by maintaining gene expression for multiple anti-apoptotic pathways</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64148</link>
	<content:encoded>HOXA9 is often highly expressed in leukemias. However, its precise roles in leukemogenesis remain elusive. Here, we show that HOXA9 maintains gene expression for multiple anti-apoptotic pathways to promote leukemogenesis. In MLL fusion-mediated leukemia, MLL fusion directly activates the expression of MYC and HOXA9. Combined expression of MYC and HOXA9 induced leukemia, whereas single gene transduction of either did not, indicating a synergy between MYC and HOXA9. HOXA9 sustained expression of the genes implicated in the hematopoietic precursor identity when expressed in hematopoietic precursors, but did not reactivate it once silenced. Among the HOXA9 target genes, &lt;i&gt;BCL2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SOX4&lt;/i&gt; synergistically induced leukemia with &lt;i&gt;MYC&lt;/i&gt;. Not only BCL2, but also SOX4 suppressed apoptosis, indicating that multiple anti-apoptotic pathways underlie cooperative leukemogenesis by HOXA9 and MYC. These results demonstrate that HOXA9 is a crucial transcriptional maintenance factor that promotes MYC-mediated leukemogenesis, potentially explaining why HOXA9 is highly expressed in many leukemias.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Autoregulatory control of microtubule binding in doublecortin-like kinase 1</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60126</link>
	<content:encoded>The microtubule-associated protein, doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1), is highly expressed in a range of cancers and is a prominent therapeutic target for kinase inhibitors. The physiological roles of DCLK1 kinase activity and how it is regulated remain elusive. Here, we analyze the role of mammalian DCLK1 kinase activity in regulating microtubule binding. We find that DCLK1 autophosphorylates a residue within its C-terminal tail to restrict its kinase activity and prevent aberrant hyperphosphorylation within its microtubule-binding domain. Removal of the C-terminal tail or mutation of this residue causes an increase in phosphorylation within the doublecortin domains, which abolishes microtubule binding. Therefore, autophosphorylation at specific sites within DCLK1 have diametric effects on the molecule's association with microtubules. Our results suggest a mechanism by which DCLK1 modulates its kinase activity to tune its microtubule-binding affinity. These results provide molecular insights for future therapeutic efforts related to DCLK1's role in cancer development and progression.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Trial-wise exposure to visual appetitive cues increases physiological arousal but not temporal discounting.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.24.452477v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Humans and many animals devalue future rewards as a function of time (temporal discounting). Increased discounting has been linked to various psychiatric conditions, including substance-use-disorders, behavioral addictions and obesity. Despite its high intra-individual stability, temporal discounting is partly under contextual control. One prominent manipulation that has been linked to increases in discounting is the exposure to highly arousing appetitive cues. However, results from trial-wise cue exposure studies appear highly mixed, and changes in physiological arousal were not adequately controlled. Here we tested the effects of appetitive (erotic), aversive and neutral visual cues on temporal discounting in thirty-five healthy male participants. The contribution of single-trial physiological arousal was assessed using comprehensive monitoring of autonomic activity (pupil size, heart rate, electrodermal activity). Physiological arousal was elevated following aversive and in particular erotic cues. In contrast to our pre-registered hypothesis, if anything, we observed decreased temporal discounting following erotic cue exposure. Aversive cues tended to increase decision noise. Computational modeling revealed that trial-wise arousal only accounted for minor variance over and above aversive and erotic condition effects, arguing against a general effect of physiological arousal on temporal discounting.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Global, Low Amplitude Cortical State Predicts Response Outcomes in a Selective Detection Task</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.23.453568v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Spontaneous neuronal activity strongly impacts stimulus encoding and behavioral responses. We sought to determine the effects of neocortical prestimulus activity on stimulus detection. We trained mice in a selective whisker detection task, in which they learned to respond (lick) to target stimuli in one whisker field and ignore distractor stimuli in the contralateral whisker field. During expert task performance, we used widefield Ca2+ imaging to assess prestimulus and post-stimulus neuronal activity broadly across frontal and parietal cortices. We found that lower prestimulus activity correlated with enhanced stimulus detection: lower prestimulus activity predicted response versus no response outcomes and faster reaction times. The activity predictive of trial outcome was distributed through dorsal neocortex, rather than being restricted to whisker or licking regions. Using principal component analysis, we demonstrate that response trials are associated with a distinct and less variable prestimulus neuronal subspace. For single units, prestimulus choice probability was weak yet distributed broadly, with lower than chance choice probability correlating with stronger sensory and motor encoding. These findings support a low amplitude, low variability, optimal prestimulus cortical state for stimulus detection that presents globally and predicts response outcomes for both target and distractor stimuli.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Emotional states as distinct configurations of functional brain networks</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.23.453552v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The conceptualization of emotional states as patterns of interactions between large-scale brain networks has recently gained support. Yet, few studies have directly examined the brain's network structure during emotional experiences. Here, we investigated the brain's functional network organization during experiences of sadness, amusement, and neutral states elicited by movies, in addition to a resting-state. We tested the effects of the experienced emotion on individual variability in the brain's functional connectome. Next, for each state, we defined a modular organization of the brain and quantified its segregation and integration. Our results show that emotional states increase the similarity between and within individuals in the brain's functional connectome. Second, in the brain's modular organization, sadness, relative to amusement, was associated with higher integration and increased connectivity of cognitive control networks: the salience and fronto-parietal networks. Modular metrics of brain segregation and integration were further associated with the reported emotional valence. Last, in both the functional connectome and emotional report, a higher similarity was found among women. Our results suggest that the experience of emotion is linked to a reconfiguration of whole-brain distributed, not emotion-specific, functional brain networks and that the topological structure carries information about the subjective emotional experience.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A distributed dopamine-gated circuit underpins reproductive state-dependent behavior in Drosophila females</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.24.453623v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Motherhood induces a drastic, sometimes long-lasting, change in internal state and behavior in most female animals. Here, we show that a mating-induced increase in olfactory attraction of female Drosophila flies to nutrients relies on interconnected neural pathways in the two higher olfactory brain regions, the lateral horn (LH) and the mushroom body (MB). Using whole brain calcium imaging, we find that mating does not induce a global change in the activity of the whole brain nor of entire brain regions, suggesting specific neuronal or network changes in the olfactory system. Systematic behavioral screening and electron microscopy (EM) connectomics identify two types of LH output neurons required for the attraction of females to polyamines -one of them previously implicated in the processing of male pheromones. In addition, we characterize multiple MB pathways capable of inducing or suppressing polyamine attraction, with synaptic connections to the identified LH neurons and a prominent role for the {beta}'1 compartment. Moreover, {beta}'1 dopaminergic neurons are modulated by mating and are sufficient to replace mating experience in virgins inducing the lasting behavioral switch in female preference. Taken together, our data in the fly suggests that reproductive state-dependent expression of female choice behavior is regulated by a dopamine-gated distributed learning circuit comprising both higher olfactory brain centers.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.24.453572v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The lateral habenula (LHb) plays a central role in balancing reward and aversion by opposing the contributions of brain reward nuclei. Using a rat cocaine self-administration model, we previously found that LHb inhibition or non-selective blockade of LHb muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) led to persistent cocaine seeking despite its signaled unavailability. As understanding roles for the LHb and cholinergic signaling in behavioral control is important to psychiatric illness and addiction, we examine how mAChRs act on LHb neurons using in vitro electrophysiology. We find that different groups of LHb neurons are depolarized or hyperpolarized by the cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh), and that CCh could inhibit GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic inputs to these cells. Presynaptic CCh effects were reversed by the M2 mAChR (M2R) antagonist AFDX-116, but not by pirenzepine, an M1R antagonist. Contemporaneous measurement of CCh effects on synaptic inhibition and excitation in LHb neurons showed a smaller effect on inhibition, suggesting a net shift in synaptic integration toward greater inhibition by mAChRs. Synaptic currents elicited by light-activation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) axons in the LHb, following channelrhodopsin-2 transfection of VTA, were also inhibited by M2Rs, suggesting the VTA as at least one M2R-sensitive LHb afferent. Finally, Go-NoGo cocaine seeking studies showed that blockade of LHb M2Rs, and not M1Rs, triggered continued cocaine seeking. These data identify LHb M2Rs as a potential control point of LHb function that enables withholding responses for cocaine and define cellular mechanisms through which mAChRs modulate LHb activity.</content:encoded>

However, the underlying cause(s) of this hyper-dopaminergic state remain elusive. Various lines of evidence point to glutamatergic dysfunction and impairments in synaptic plasticity in the aetiology of schizophrenia, including deficits associated with the GluA1 AMPAR subunit. GluA1 knockout (Gria1-/-) mice provide a model of impaired synaptic plasticity in schizophrenia and exhibit a selective deficit in a form of short-term memory which underlies short-term habituation. As such, these mice are unable to reduce attention to recently presented stimuli. In this study we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to measure phasic dopamine responses in the nucleus accumbens of Gria1-/- mice to determine whether this behavioral phenotype might be a key driver of a hyper-dopaminergic state. There was no effect of GluA1 deletion on electrically-evoked dopamine responses in anaesthetized mice, demonstrating normal endogenous release properties of dopamine neurons in Gria1-/- mice. Furthermore, dopamine signals were initially similar in Gria1-/- mice compared to controls in response to both sucrose rewards and neutral light stimuli. They were also equally sensitive to changes in the magnitude of delivered rewards. In contrast, however, these stimulus-evoked dopamine signals failed to habituate with repeated presentations in Gria1-/- mice, resulting in a task-relevant, hyper-dopaminergic phenotype. Thus, here we show that GluA1 dysfunction, resulting in impaired short-term habituation, is a key driver of enhanced striatal dopamine responses, which may be an important contributor to aberrant salience and psychosis in psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Necroptosis increases with age in the brain and contributes to age-related neuroinflammation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.23.453580v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Chronic inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS), termed neuroinflammation, is a hallmark of aging and a proposed mediator of cognitive decline associated with aging. Neuroinflammation is characterized by the persistent activation of microglia, the innate immune cells of the CNS, with damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) being one of the well-known activators of microglia. Because necroptosis is a cell death pathway that induce inflammation through the release of DAMPs, we hypothesized that an age-associated increase in necroptosis contributes to increased neuroinflammation with age. The marker of necroptosis, phosphorylated form of MLKL (P-MLKL), and kinases in the necroptosis pathway (RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL) showed a region-specific increase in the brain with age, specifically in the cortex layer V and the CA3 region of the hippocampus of mice. Similarly, MLKL-oligomers, which causes membrane binding and permeabilization were significantly increased in the cortex and hippocampus of old mice relative to young mice. Nearly 70 to 80% of P-MLKL immunoreactivity was localized to neurons and less than 10% was localized to microglia, whereas no P-MLKL was detected in astrocytes. P-MLKL expression in neurons was detected in the soma, not in the processes. Blocking necroptosis using Mlkl-/- mice reduced markers (Iba-1 and GFAP) of neuroinflammation in the brains of old mice and short-term treatment with the necroptosis inhibitor, necrostatin-1s, reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-1{beta}, in the hippocampus of old mice. Thus, our data demonstrate for the first time that brain necroptosis increases with age and contributes to age-related neuroinflammation in mice.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.23.453577v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>With the recent development and rapidly accelerating adoption of machine-learning based rodent behavioral tracking tools such as DeepLabCut, one common variable that can impact the quality and consistency of results is the camera system. Many experimenters use webcams, GoPros, or other commercially available cameras that are not only relatively expensive, but offer very little flexibility over recording parameters. These cameras are not optimized for recording many types of behavioral experiments, which can lead to suboptimal video quality. Furthermore, it is a challenge, if not impossible, to synchronize multiple cameras with each other, or to send/receive a trigger with external signals such as a TTL pulse or a network connection. We have developed an affordable ecosystem of behavioral recording equipment, PiRATeMC (Pi-based Remote Acquisition Technology for Motion Capture), that relies on Raspberry Pi Camera Boards that are ideal for recording in both bright light, low light, and dark conditions under infrared light. PiRATeMC offers users control over nearly every recording parameter. This setup can easily be scaled up and synchronously controlled in clusters via a self-contained network to record a large number of simultaneous behavioral sessions without burdening institutional network infrastructure. Furthermore, the Raspberry Pi is an excellent platform for novice and inexperienced programmers interested in using an open-source recording system, with a large online community that is very active in developing novel open-source tools. Moreover, it easily interfaces with Arduinos and other microcontrollers, allowing simple synchronization and interfacing of video recording with nearly any behavioral equipment using GPIO pins to send or receive 3.3V or 5V signals, I2C, or serial communication.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Transcriptomic Analysis of Human Sensory Neurons in Painful Diabetic Neuropathy Reveals Inflammation and Neuronal Loss</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.23.453576v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Pathological sensations caused by peripheral painful neuropathy occurring in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are often described as sharp and burning and are commonly spontaneous in origin. Proposed etiologies implicate dysfunction of nociceptive sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) induced by generation of reactive oxygen species, microvascular defects, and ongoing axonal degeneration and regeneration. To investigate the molecular mechanisms contributing to diabetic pain, DRGs were acquired postmortem from patients who had been experiencing painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and subjected to transcriptome analyses to identify genes contributing to pathological processes and neuropathic pain. DPN occurs in distal extremities resulting in the characteristic glove and stocking pattern. Accordingly, the L4 and L5 DRGs, which contain the perikarya of primary afferent neurons innervating the foot, were analyzed from five DPN patients and compared with seven controls. Transcriptome analyses identified 844 differentially expressed genes. We observed increases in levels of inflammation-associated genes from macrophages in DPN patients that may contribute to increased pain hypersensitivity and, conversely, there were frequent decreases in neuronally-related genes. The elevated inflammatory gene profile and the accompanying downregulation of multiple neuronal genes provide new insights into intraganglionic pathology and mechanisms causing neuropathic pain in DPN patients with T2DM.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Strong and opponent contributions of dorsomedial striatal pathways to behavior depends on cognitive demands and task strategy</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.23.453573v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A classic view of the striatum holds that activity in direct and indirect pathways oppositely modulates motor output. Whether this involves direct control of movement, or reflects a cognitive process underlying movement, has remained unresolved. Here we find that strong, opponent control of behavior by the two pathways of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) depends on a task's cognitive demands. Furthermore, a latent state model (a hidden markov model with generalized linear model observations) reveals that - even within a single task - the contribution of the two pathways to behavior is state-dependent. Specifically, the two pathways have large contributions in one of two states associated with a strategy of evidence accumulation, compared to a state associated with a strategy of repeating previous choices. Thus, both the cognitive demands imposed by a task, as well as the strategy that mice pursue within a task, determine whether DMS pathways provide strong and opponent control of behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.23.453443v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Commonly prescribed antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) take weeks to achieve therapeutic benefits1, 2. The underlying mechanisms of why antidepressants take weeks or months to reverse depressed mood are not understood. Using a single cell sequencing approach, we analyzed gene expression changes in mice subjected to stress-induced depression and determined their temporal response to antidepressant treatment in the cerebral cortex. We discovered that both glial and neuronal cell populations elicit gene expression changes in response to stress, and that these changes are reversed upon treatment with fluoxetine (Prozac), a widely prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Upon reproducing the molecular signaling events regulated by fluoxetine3 in a cortical culture system, we found that these transcriptional changes are serotonin-dependent, require reciprocal neuron-glia communication, and involve temporally-specified sequences of autoregulation and cross-regulation between FGF2 and BDNF signaling pathways. Briefly, stimulation of Fgf2 synthesis and signaling directly regulates Bdnf synthesis and secretion cell-non-autonomously requiring neuron-glia interactions, which then activates neuronal BDNF-TrkB signaling to drive longer-term neuronal adaptations4-6 leading to improved mood. Our studies highlight temporal and cell type specific mechanisms promoting the onset of the antidepressant response, that we propose could offer novel avenues for mitigating delayed onset of antidepressant therapies.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.22.453396v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>For decades we have known that the brain &quot;drains&quot; through the subarachnoid space following a route that crosses the cribriform plate to the nasal mucosa and cervical lymph nodes. Yet little is known about the potential role of the olfactory epithelia and associated lymphatic vasculature in the immune response. To better understand the immune response in the olfactory organs we used cell-specific fluorescent reporter lines in dissected, intact adult brains to visualize blood-lymphatic vasculature and neutrophils in the olfactory sensory system. Here we show that the extensive blood vasculature of the olfactory organs is associated with a lymphatic cell type resembling high endothelial venules (HEVs) of the lymph nodes in mammals and a second resembling Mural Lymphatic Endothelial Cells (muLECs) that extended from the brain to the peripheral olfactory epithelia. Surprisingly, the olfactory organs contained the only neutrophil populations observed in the brain. Damage to the olfactory epithelia resulted in a rapid increase of neutrophils within the olfactory organs as well as the appearance of neutrophils in the brain suggesting that neutrophils enter the brain in response to damage. Analysis of cell division during and after damage showed an increase in BrdU labeling in the olfactory epithelia and a subset of the neutrophils. Our results reveal a unique population of neutrophils in the olfactory organs that are associated with an extensive lymphatic vasculature suggesting a dual olfactory-immune function for this unique sensory system.</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;With disease-modifying approaches under evaluation in ataxia-telangiectasia and other ataxias, there is a need for objective and reliable biomarkers of free-living motor function. In this study, we test the hypothesis that metrics derived from a single wrist sensor worn at home provide accurate, reliable, and interpretable information about neurological disease severity in children with A-T.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A total of 15 children with A-T and 15 age- and sex-matched controls wore a sensor with a triaxial accelerometer on their dominant wrist for 1 week at home. Activity intensity measures, derived from the sensor data, were compared with in-person neurological evaluation on the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS) and performance on a validated computer mouse task.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Children with A-T were inactive the same proportion of each day as controls but produced more low intensity movements (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01; Cohen’s &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; = 1.48) and fewer high intensity movements (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; Cohen’s &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; = 1.71). The range of activity intensities was markedly reduced in A-T compared to controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001; Cohen’s &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; = 2.72). The activity metrics correlated strongly with arm, gait, and total clinical severity (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;: 0.71–0.87; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), correlated with specific computer task motor features (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;: 0.67–0.92; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), demonstrated high reliability (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;: 0.86–0.93; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.00001), and were not significantly influenced by age in the healthy control group.&lt;/p&gt;

These low-burden measurements are applicable independent of ambulatory status and are potential digital behavioral biomarkers in A-T.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Multiple patterns of infant rolling in limb coordination and ground contact pressure</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Infants acquire the ability to roll over from the supine to the prone position, which requires body coordination of multiple degrees of freedom under dynamic interactions with the ground. Although previous studies on infant rolling observed kinematic characteristics, little is known about the kinetic characteristics of body segments in contact with the surface. We measured the ground contact pressure under the arms, legs, head, and proximal body segments using a pressure mat and their displacements using a three-dimensional motion capture system. The data obtained from 17 infants aged 9–10 months indicated that most of them showed 2–4 of 6 highly observed movement patterns, including 1 axial rolling, 2 spinal flexion, and 3 shoulder girdle leading patterns. The arms and legs had small contributions to the ground contact pressure in the axial rolling and spinal flexion patterns. The ipsilateral leg in relation to the rolling direction was involved in supporting the body weight in only 1 shoulder girdle leading pattern. The contralateral leg showed large peak pressure to push on the floor before rolling in 3 shoulder girdle leading patterns. The results indicate that infants can produce multiple rolling-over patterns with different strategies to coordinate their body segments and interact with the floor. The results of the analysis of the movement patterns further suggest that few patterns correspond to those reported in adults. This implies that infants generate unique motor patterns by taking into account their own biomechanical constraints.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Subpopulations of primary nociceptors (C- and Aδ-fibers), express the TRPV1 receptor for heat and capsaicin. During cutaneous inflammation, these afferents may become sensitized, leading to primary hyperalgesia. It is known that TRPV1&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; nociceptors are involved in heat hyperalgesia; however, their involvement in mechanical hyperalgesia is unclear. This study explored the contribution of capsaicin-sensitive nociceptors in the development of mechanical and heat hyperalgesia in humans following ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation. Skin areas in 18 healthy volunteers were randomized to treatment with 8% capsaicin/vehicle patches for 24 h. After patches removal, one capsaicin-treated area and one vehicle area were irradiated with 2xMED (minimal erythema dose) of UVB. 1, 3 and 7 days post-UVB exposure, tests were performed to evaluate the development of UVB-induced cutaneous hyperalgesia: thermal detection and pain thresholds, pain sensitivity to supra-threshold heat stimuli, mechanical pain threshold and sensitivity, touch pleasantness, trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), inflammatory response, pigmentation and micro-vascular reactivity. Capsaicin pre-treatment, in the UVB-irradiated area (Capsaicin + UVB area), increased heat pain thresholds (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), and decreased supra-threshold heat pain sensitivity (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) 1, 3 and 7 days post-UVB irradiation, while mechanical hyperalgesia resulted unchanged (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.2). No effects of capsaicin were reported on touch pleasantness (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 1), TEWL (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.31), inflammatory response and pigmentation (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.3) or micro-vascular reactivity (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.8) in response to the UVB irradiation. 8% capsaicin ablation predominantly defunctionalizes TRPV1&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-expressing cutaneous nociceptors responsible for heat pain transduction, suggesting that sensitization of these fibers is required for development of heat hyperalgesia following cutaneous UVB-induced inflammation but they are likely only partially necessary for the establishment of robust primary mechanical hyperalgesia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Morphology of P2X3‐immunoreactive basket‐like afferent nerve endings surrounding serosal ganglia and close relationship with vesicular nucleotide transporter‐immunoreactive nerve fibers in the rat gastric antrum</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25219?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We discovered P2X3‐immunoreactive basket‐like nerve endings surrounding serosal ganglia in the rat antral lesser curvature by immunohistochemistry of whole‐mount preparations with confocal scanning laser microscopy. The nerve endings were derived from large web‐like structures of vagal subserosal mechanoreceptors, and wrapped around the whole serosal ganglia with pleomorphic terminal structures. The nerve endings may be specialized ending structures of vagal mechanoreceptors to increase the sensitivity during antral peristalsis.






Abstract
We previously reported P2X3 purinoceptor (P2X3)‐expressing vagal afferent nerve endings with large web‐like structures in the subserosal tissue of the antral lesser curvature, suggesting that these nerve endings were one of the vagal mechanoreceptors. The present study investigated the morphological relationship of P2X3‐immunoreactive nerve endings and serosal ganglia in the rat gastric antrum by immunohistochemistry of whole‐mount preparations using confocal scanning laser microscopy. P2X3‐immunoreactive basket‐like subserosal nerve endings with new morphology were distributed laterally to the gastric sling muscles in the distal antrum of the lesser curvature. Parent axons ramified into numerous nerve fibers with pleomorphic flattened structures to form basket‐like nerve endings, and the parent axons were originated from large net‐like structures of vagal afferent nerve endings. Basket‐like nerve endings wrapped around the whole serosal ganglia, which were characterized by neurofilament 200 kDa‐immunoreactive neurons with or without neuronal nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity and S100B‐immunoreactive glial cells. Furthermore, basket‐like nerve endings were localized in close apposition to dopamine beta‐hydroxylase‐immunoreactive sympathetic nerve fibers immunoreactive for vesicular nucleotide transporter. These results suggest that P2X3‐immunoreactive basket‐like nerve endings associated with serosal ganglia are the specialized ending structures of vagal subserosal mechanoreceptors in order to increase the sensitivity during antral peristalsis, and are activated by ATP from sympathetic nerve fibers and/or serosal ganglia for the regulation of mechanoreceptor function.

Metabolic adaptations to complex perturbations, like the response to pharmacological treatments in multifactorial diseases such as cancer, can be described through measurements of part of the fluxes and concentrations at the systemic level and individual transporter and enzyme activities at the molecular level. In the framework of Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA), ensembles of linear constraints can be built integrating these measurements at both systemic and molecular levels, which are expressed as relative differences or changes produced in the metabolic adaptation. Here, combining MCA with Linear Programming, an efficient computational strategy is developed to infer additional non-measured changes at the molecular level that are required to satisfy these constraints. An application of this strategy is illustrated by using a set of fluxes, concentrations, and differentially expressed genes that characterize the response to cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 inhibition in colon cancer cells. Decreases and increases in transporter and enzyme individual activities required to reprogram the measured changes in fluxes and concentrations are compared with down-regulated and up-regulated metabolic genes to unveil those that are key molecular drivers of the metabolic response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QKi_mazON1g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse process, mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), are believed to play key roles in facilitating the metastatic cascade. Metastatic lesions often exhibit a similar epithelial-like state to that of the primary tumour, in particular, by forming carcinoma cell clusters via E-cadherin-mediated junctional complexes. However, the factors enabling mesenchymal-like micrometastatic cells to resume growth and reacquire an epithelial phenotype in the target organ microenvironment remain elusive. In this study, we developed a workflow using image-based cell profiling and machine learning to examine morphological, contextual and molecular states of individual breast carcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231). MDA-MB-231 heterogeneous response to the host organ microenvironment was modelled by substrates with controllable stiffness varying from 0.2kPa (soft tissues) to 64kPa (bone tissues). We identified 3 distinct morphological cell types (morphs) varying from compact round-shaped to flattened irregular-shaped cells with lamellipodia, predominantly populating 2-kPa and &amp;gt;16kPa substrates, respectively. These observations were accompanied by significant changes in E-cadherin and vimentin expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the bone-mimicking substrate (64kPa) induced multicellular cluster formation accompanied by E-cadherin cell surface localisation. MDA-MB-231 cells responded to different substrate stiffness by morphological adaptation, changes in proliferation rate and cytoskeleton markers, and cluster formation on bone-mimicking substrate. Our results suggest that the stiffest microenvironment can induce MET.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QmUMx1sedBc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cellular RNA levels typically fluctuate and are influenced by different transcription rates and RNA degradation rates. However, the understanding of the fundamental relationships between RNA abundance, environmental stimuli, RNA activities, and RNA age distributions is incomplete. Furthermore, the rates of RNA degradation and transcription are difficult to measure in transcriptomic experiments in living organisms, especially in studies involving humans. A model based on activity demands and RNA age was developed to explore the mechanisms of RNA level fluctuations. Using single-cell time-series gene expression experimental data, we assessed the transcription rates, RNA degradation rates, RNA life spans, RNA demand, accumulated transcription levels, and accumulated RNA degradation levels. This model could also predict RNA levels under simulation backgrounds, such as stimuli that induce regular oscillations in RNA abundance, stable RNA levels over time that result from long-term shortage of total RNA activity or from uncontrollable transcription, and relationships between RNA/protein levels and metabolic rates. This information contributes to existing knowledge.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NJca8-5FT8w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The lysosome is an essential organelle to recycle cellular materials and maintain nutrient homeostasis, but the mechanism to down-regulate its membrane proteins is poorly understood. In this study, we performed a cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay to measure the half-lives of approximately 30 human lysosomal membrane proteins (LMPs) and identified RNF152 and LAPTM4A as short-lived membrane proteins. The degradation of both proteins is ubiquitin dependent. RNF152 is a transmembrane E3 ligase that ubiquitinates itself, whereas LAPTM4A uses its carboxyl-terminal PY motifs to recruit NEDD4-1 for ubiquitination. After ubiquitination, they are internalized into the lysosome lumen by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery for degradation. Strikingly, when ectopically expressed in budding yeast, human RNF152 is still degraded by the vacuole (yeast lysosome) in an ESCRT-dependent manner. Thus, our study uncovered a conserved mechanism to down-regulate lysosome membrane proteins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/UJYuvP_w8-M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

A major cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum disorder is the hexanucleotide G&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; repeat expansion in the first intron of the C9orf72 gene. Many underlying mechanisms lead to manifestation of disease that include toxic gain of function by repeat G&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; RNAs, dipeptide repeat proteins, and a reduction of the C9orf72 gene product. The C9orf72 protein interacts with SMCR8 and WDR41 to form a trimeric complex and regulates multiple cellular pathways including autophagy. Here, we report the structure of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex at 3.8 Å resolution using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The structure reveals 2 distinct dimerization interfaces between C9orf72 and SMCR8 that involves an extensive network of interactions. Homology between C9orf72-SMCR8 and Folliculin-Folliculin Interacting Protein 2 (FLCN-FNIP2), a GTPase activating protein (GAP) complex, enabled identification of a key residue within the active site of SMCR8. Further structural analysis suggested that a coiled-coil region within the uDenn domain of SMCR8 could act as an interaction platform for other coiled-coil proteins, and its deletion reduced the interaction of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex with FIP200 upon starvation. In summary, this study contributes toward our understanding of the biological function of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7LGfr-v975Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
In the current study, we examined the number, distribution, and aspects of the neurochemical identities of infracortical white matter neurons, also termed white matter interstitial cells (WMICs), in the brains of a southern lesser galago (Galago moholi), a black‐capped squirrel monkey (Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis), and a crested macaque (Macaca nigra). Staining for neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN) revealed WMICs throughout the infracortical white matter, these cells being most dense close to inner cortical border, decreasing in density with depth in the white matter. Stereological analysis of NeuN‐immunopositive cells revealed estimates of approximately 1.1, 10.8, and 37.7 million WMICs within the infracortical white matter of the galago, squirrel monkey, and crested macaque, respectively. The total numbers of WMICs form a distinct negative allometric relationship with brain mass and white matter volume when examined in a larger sample of primates where similar measures have been obtained. In all three primates studied, the highest densities of WMICs were in the white matter of the frontal lobe, with the occipital lobe having the lowest. Immunostaining revealed significant subpopulations of WMICs containing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and calretinin, with very few WMICs containing parvalbumin, and none containing calbindin. The nNOS and calretinin immunopositive WMICs represent approximately 21% of the total WMIC population; however, variances in the proportions of these neurochemical phenotypes were noted. Our results indicate that both the squirrel monkey and crested macaque might be informative animal models for the study of WMICs in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders in humans.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24923?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Upon infection of primary neurons, astrocytes and microglia with tick‐borne encephalitis virus, astrocytes mount particularly high IFN‐β responses that initially depend on MAVS and later on MyD88/TRIF signaling.

Abstract
Tick‐borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, is typically transmitted upon tick bite and can cause meningitis and encephalitis in humans. In TBEV‐infected mice, mitochondrial antiviral‐signaling protein (MAVS), the downstream adaptor of retinoic acid‐inducible gene‐I (RIG‐I)‐like receptor (RLR) signaling, is needed to induce early type I interferon (IFN) responses and to confer protection. To characterize the brain‐resident cell subset that produces protective IFN‐β in TBEV‐infected mice, we isolated neurons, astrocytes, and microglia from mice and exposed these cell types to TBEV in vitro. Under such conditions, neurons showed the highest percentage of infected cells, whereas astrocytes and microglia were infected to a lesser extent. In the supernatant (SN) of infected neurons, IFN‐β was not detectable, while infected astrocytes showed high and microglia low IFN‐β expression. Transcriptome analyses of astrocytes implied that MAVS signaling was needed early after TBEV infection. Accordingly, MAVS‐deficient astrocytes showed enhanced TBEV infection and significantly reduced early IFN‐β responses. Nevertheless, at later time points, moderate amounts of IFN‐β were detected in the SN of infected MAVS‐deficient astrocytes. Transcriptome analyses indicated that MAVS deficiency negatively affected the induction of early anti‐viral responses, which resulted in significantly increased TBEV replication. Treatment with MyD88 and TRIF inhibiting peptides reduced only late IFN‐β responses of TBEV‐infected WT astrocytes and blocked entirely IFN‐β responses of infected MAVS‐deficient astrocytes. Thus, upon TBEV exposure of brain‐resident cells, astrocytes are important IFN‐β producers showing biphasic IFN‐β induction that initially depends on MAVS and later on MyD88/TRIF signaling.</content:encoded>

Stereological analysis of NeuN‐immunopositive cells revealed an estimate of approximately 137.2 million WMICs within the infracortical white matter of the chimpanzee brain studied. Immunostaining revealed subpopulations of WMICs containing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS, approximately 14.4 million in number), calretinin (CR, approximately 16.7 million), very few WMICs containing parvalbumin (PV), and no calbindin‐immunopositive neurons. The nNOS, CR, and PV immunopositive WMICs, possibly all inhibitory neurons, represent approximately 22.6% of the total WMIC population. As the white matter is affected in many cognitive conditions, such as schizophrenia, autism, epilepsy, and also in neurodegenerative diseases, understanding these neurons across species is important for the translation of findings of neural dysfunction in animal models to humans. Furthermore, studies of WMICs in species such as apes provide a crucial phylogenetic context for understanding the evolution of these cell types in the human brain.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The avian dorsal telencephalon contains discrete areas receiving visual, auditory, and trigeminal ascending projections. Recent studies have shown that the auditory and the visual regions embodied “columnar and layered” cytoarchitectural motifs, which bears a striking resemblance to that of the mammalian sensory cortices. At present, it is not known to what extent this type of organization also extends to the trigemino‐recipient area. The question is of interest, since afferents forming this sensory pathway are exceptionally not thalamic but rhombencephalic in origin. We investigated this question by placing minute injections of neural tracers into selected locations of vital slices of the chicken telencephalon. We conclude that the trigeminal area share, to a detailed level, a common columnar‐layered neuroarchitectectonic motif with other sensory areas.







Abstract
The dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR), which is the largest component of the avian pallium, contains discrete partitions receiving tectovisual, auditory, and trigeminal ascending projections. Recent studies have shown that the auditory and the tectovisual regions can be regarded as complexes composed of three highly interconnected layers: an internal senso‐recipient one, an intermediate afferent/efferent one, and a more external re‐entrant one. Cells located in homotopic positions in each of these layers are reciprocally linked by an interlaminar loop of axonal processes, forming columnar‐like local circuits. Whether this type of organization also extends to the trigemino‐recipient DVR is, at present, not known. This question is of interest, since afferents forming this sensory pathway, exceptional among amniotes, are not thalamic but rhombencephalic in origin. We investigated this question by placing minute injections of neural tracers into selected locations of vital slices of the chicken telencephalon. We found that neurons of the trigemino‐recipient nucleus basorostralis pallii (Bas) establish reciprocal, columnar and homotopical projections with cells located in the overlying ventral mesopallium (MV). “Column‐forming” axons originated in B and MV terminate also in the intermediate strip, the fronto‐trigeminal nidopallium (NFT), in a restricted manner. We also found that the NFT and an internal partition of B originate substantial, coarse‐topographic projections to the underlying portion of the lateral striatum. We conclude that all sensory areas of the DVR are organized according to a common neuroarchitectonic motif, which bears a striking resemblance to that of the radial/laminar intrinsic circuits of the sensory cortices of mammals.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25198?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Tonic activity in the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which holds the upper eyelid open, is interrupted during blinks. Here, we demonstrate a monosynpatic pathway from cells distributed along the rostral edge of the principal trigeminal nucleus that targets, and presumably inhibits, levator motoneurons for blinks triggered from the face.







Abstract
For normal viewing, the eyes are held open by the tonic actions of the levator palpebrae superioris (levator) muscle raising the upper eyelid. This activity is interrupted during blinks, when the eyelid sweeps down to spread the tear film or protect the cornea. We examined the circuit connecting the principal trigeminal nucleus to the levator motoneurons by use of both anterograde and retrograde tracers in macaque monkeys. Injections of anterograde tracer were made into the principal trigeminal nucleus using either a stereotaxic approach or localization following physiological characterization of trigeminal second order neurons. Anterogradely labeled axonal arbors were located both within the caudal central subdivision, which contains levator motoneurons, and in the adjacent supraoculomotor area. Labeled boutons made synaptic contacts on retrogradely labeled levator motoneurons indicating a monosynaptic connection. As the eye is also retracted through the actions of the rectus muscles during a blink, we examined whether these trigeminal injections labeled boutons contacting rectus motoneurons within the oculomotor nucleus. These were not found when the injection sites were confined to the principal trigeminal nucleus region. To identify the source of the projection to the levator motoneurons, we injected retrograde tracer into the oculomotor complex. Retrogradely labeled cells were confined to a narrow, dorsoventrally oriented cell population that lined the rostral edge of the principal trigeminal nucleus. Presumably these cells inhibit levator motoneurons, while other parts of the trigeminal sensory complex are activating orbicularis oculi motoneurons, when a blink is initiated by sensory stimuli contacting the face.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We confirmed the presence of von Economo neurons in the frontoinsular cortex of all animals. Focusing on problem‐solving ability, raccoons exhibiting high levels of cognitive flexibility had increased total cell counts (via isotropic fractionation) and higher numbers of fusiform cells (via thionin histology) in the hippocampus.







Abstract
With rates of psychiatric illnesses such as depression continuing to rise, additional preclinical models are needed to facilitate translational neuroscience research. In the current study, the raccoon (Procyon lotor) was investigated due to its similarities with primate brains, including comparable proportional neuronal densities, cortical magnification of the forepaw area, and cortical gyrification. Specifically, we report on the cytoarchitectural characteristics of raccoons profiled as high, intermediate, or low solvers in a multiaccess problem‐solving task. Isotropic fractionation indicated that high‐solvers had significantly more cells in the hippocampus (HC) than the other solving groups; further, a nonsignificant trend suggested that this increase in cell profile density was due to increased nonneuronal (e.g., glial) cells. Group differences were not observed in the cellular density of the somatosensory cortex. Thionin‐based staining confirmed the presence of von Economo neurons (VENs) in the frontoinsular cortex, although no impact of solving ability on VEN cell profile density levels was observed. Elongated fusiform cells were quantified in the HC dentate gyrus where high‐solvers were observed to have higher levels of this cell type than the other solving groups. In sum, the current findings suggest that varying cytoarchitectural phenotypes contribute to cognitive flexibility. Additional research is necessary to determine the translational value of cytoarchitectural distribution patterns on adaptive behavioral outcomes associated with cognitive performance and mental health.</content:encoded>

Abstract
Egg laying in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis is regulated by the photoperiod; long‐day conditions (16L8D) promote egg laying whereas medium‐day conditions (12L12D) suppress it. In this snail, a caudo‐dorsal cell hormone (CDCH) is produced by neurosecretory cells, CDCs in the cerebral ganglion (CG), and its release triggers ovulation and subsequent egg laying. However, the physiological basis for photoperiod‐dependent egg laying remains unraveled. Here, we compared electrophysiological properties of CDCs between 16L8D and 12L12D using intracellular recording, and found that CDC excitability is higher in 16L8D than in 12L12D. Striking differences are as follows: (1) a shallower resting membrane potential in 16L8D than in 12L12D, and (2) a smaller threshold voltage (minimum depolarization from rest to elicit action potentials) in 16L8D than in 12L12D. Switching of the excitability can be a physiological basis of a photoperiod‐dependent CDCH release. Simultaneous intracellular dye injection identified two morphological subtypes of CDCs, validating a previous report. Both types bear short lateral extensions in CG, some of which probably function as integration sites of photoperiodic inputs. In addition, we found two novel CDCH‐immunoreactive cell groups (CDCCOM and SCm) in the CG besides conventional CDCs and small cells expressing CDCH. The CDCCOM with cell bodies and fibers in the neurohemal commissure may be involved in triggering ovulation. Notably, the total number of CDCs is larger than that previously reported, the right CDC cluster with more cells than the left. Our findings are instructive in following the neurophysiology of photoperiodism in L. stagnalis.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: An important chain of supermarkets in the western zone of the
capital of Chile, needs to obtain key information to make decisions, this
information is available in the databases but needs to be processed due to the
complexity and quantity of information which becomes difficult to visualiz,.
Method: For this purpose, an algorithm was developed using artificial neural
networks applying Kohonen's SOM method. To carry it out, certain key procedures
must be followed to develop it, such as data mining that will be responsible
for filtering and then use only the relevant data for market basket analysis.
After filtering the information, the data must be prepared. After data
preparation, we prepared the Python programming environment to adapt it to the
sample data, then proceed to train the SOM with its parameters set after test
results. Result: the result of the SOM obtains the relationship between the
products that were most purchased by positioning them topologically close, to
form promotions, packs and bundles for the retail manager to take into
consideration, because these relationships were obtained as a result of the SOM
training with the real transactions of the clients. Conclusion: Based on this,
recommendations on frequent shopping baskets have been made to the supermarket
chain that provided the data used in the research

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Light-Up puzzle, also known as the AKARI puzzle, has never been solved
using modern artificial intelligence (AI) methods. Currently, the most widely
used computational technique to autonomously develop solutions involve
evolution theory algorithms. This project is an effort to apply new AI
techniques for solving the Light-up puzzle faster and more computationally
efficient. The algorithms explored for producing optimal solutions include hill
climbing, simulated annealing, feed-forward neural network (FNN), and
convolutional neural network (CNN). Two algorithms were developed for hill
climbing and simulated annealing using 2 actions (add and remove light bulb)
versus 3 actions(add, remove, or move light-bulb to a different cell). Both
hill climbing and simulated annealing algorithms showed a higher accuracy for
the case of 3 actions. The simulated annealing showed to significantly
outperform hill climbing, FNN, CNN, and an evolutionary theory algorithm
achieving 100% accuracy in 30 unique board configurations. Lastly, while FNN
and CNN algorithms showed low accuracies, computational times were
significantly faster compared to the remaining algorithms. The GitHub
repository for this project can be found at

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we proposed a multi-objective approach for the EEG Inverse
Problem. This formulation does not need unknown parameters that involve
empirical procedures. Due to the combinatorial characteristics of the problem,
this alternative included evolutionary strategies to resolve it. The result is
a Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Anatomical Restrictions
(MOEAAR) to estimate distributed solutions. The comparative tests were between
this approach and 3 classic methods of regularization: LASSO, Ridge-L and
ENET-L. In the experimental phase, regression models were selected to obtain
sparse and distributed solutions. The analysis involved simulated data with
different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The indicators for quality control were
Localization Error, Spatial Resolution and Visibility. The MOEAAR evidenced
better stability than the classic methods in the reconstruction and
localization of the maximum activation. The norm L0 was used to estimate sparse
solutions with the evolutionary approach and its results were relevant.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present a short survey of ways in which existing scientific knowledge are
included when constructing models with neural networks. The inclusion of
domain-knowledge is of special interest not just to constructing scientific
assistants, but also, many other areas that involve understanding data using
human-machine collaboration. In many such instances, machine-based model
construction may benefit significantly from being provided with human-knowledge
of the domain encoded in a sufficiently precise form. This paper examines the
inclusion of domain-knowledge by means of changes to: the input, the
loss-function, and the architecture of deep networks. The categorisation is for
ease of exposition: in practice we expect a combination of such changes will be
employed. In each category, we describe techniques that have been shown to
yield significant changes in network performance.

Here, the authors perform time-resolved SAXS experiments with the low-complexity domain (LCD) of hnRNPA1 and uncover multiple kinetic regimes on the micro- to millisecond timescale. Initially, individual proteins collapse. Nucleation then occurs via two steps distinguished by their protein cluster size distributions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/rjedO2Wd5rE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.687182</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Segmenting individual neurons from a large number of noisy raw images is the first step in building a comprehensive map of neuron-to-neuron connections for predicting information flow in the brain. Thousands of fluorescence-labeled brain neurons have been imaged. However, mapping a complete connectome remains challenging because imaged neurons are often entangled and manual segmentation of a large population of single neurons is laborious and prone to bias. In this study, we report an automatic algorithm, NeuroRetriever, for unbiased large-scale segmentation of confocal fluorescence images of single neurons in the adult Drosophila brain. NeuroRetriever uses a high-dynamic-range thresholding method to segment three-dimensional morphology of single neurons based on branch-specific structural features. Applying NeuroRetriever to automatically segment single neurons in 22,037 raw brain images, we successfully retrieved 28,125 individual neurons validated by human segmentation. Thus, automated NeuroRetriever will greatly accelerate 3D reconstruction of the single neurons for constructing the complete connectomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.713031</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disease, leading to behavioral changes and language difficulties. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in progranulin (GRN) induce haploinsufficiency of the protein and are associated with up to one-third of all genetic FTD cases worldwide. While the loss of GRN is primarily associated with neurodegeneration, the biological functions of the secreted growth factor-like protein are more diverse, ranging from wound healing, inflammation, vasculogenesis, and metabolic regulation to tumor cell growth and metastasis. To date, no disease-modifying treatments exist for FTD, but different therapeutic approaches to boost GRN levels in the central nervous system are currently being developed (including AAV-mediated GRN gene delivery as well as anti-SORT1 antibody therapy). In this review, we provide an overview of the multifaceted regulation of GRN levels and the corresponding therapeutic avenues. We discuss the opportunities, advantages, and potential drawbacks of the diverse approaches. Additionally, we highlight the therapeutic potential of elevating GRN levels beyond patients with loss-of-function mutations in GRN.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Mesoscopic Mapping of Ictal Neurovascular Coupling in Awake Behaving Mice Using Optical Spectroscopy and Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.704834</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Unambiguously identifying an epileptic focus with high spatial resolution is a challenge, especially when no anatomic abnormality can be detected. Neurovascular coupling (NVC)-based brain mapping techniques are often applied in the clinic despite a poor understanding of ictal NVC mechanisms, derived primarily from recordings in anesthetized animals with limited spatial sampling of the ictal core. In this study, we used simultaneous wide-field mesoscopic imaging of GCamp6f and intrinsic optical signals (IOS) to record the neuronal and hemodynamic changes during acute ictal events in awake, behaving mice. Similar signals in isoflurane-anesthetized mice were compared to highlight the unique characteristics of the awake condition. In awake animals, seizures were more focal at the onset but more likely to propagate to the contralateral hemisphere. The HbT signal, derived from an increase in cerebral blood volume (CBV), was more intense in awake mice. As a result, the “epileptic dip” in hemoglobin oxygenation became inconsistent and unreliable as a mapping signal. Our data indicate that CBV-based imaging techniques should be more accurate than blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)-based imaging techniques for seizure mapping in awake behaving animals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Age-Related Inflammatory Balance Shift, Nasal Barrier Function, and Cerebro-Morphological Status in Healthy and Diseased Rodents</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.700729</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increased blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability and extensive neuronal changes have been described earlier in both healthy and pathological aging like apolipoprotein B-100 (APOB-100) and amyloid precursor protein (APP)–presenilin-1 (PSEN1) transgenic mouse models. APOB-100 hypertriglyceridemic model is a useful tool to study the link between cerebrovascular pathology and neurodegeneration, while APP–PSEN1 humanized mouse is a model of Alzheimer’s disease. The aim of the current study was to characterize the inflammatory changes in the brain with healthy aging and in neurodegeneration. Also, the cerebro-morphological and cognitive alterations have been investigated. The nose-to-brain delivery of a P-glycoprotein substrate model drug (quinidine) was monitored in the disease models and compared with the age-matched controls. Our results revealed an inflammatory balance shift in both the healthy aged and neurodegenerative models. In normal aging monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, stem cell factor and Rantes were highly upregulated indicating a stimulated leukocyte status. In APOB-100 mice, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) were induced (vascular reaction), while in APP–PSEN1 mice resistin, IL-17A and GM-CSF were mostly upregulated. The nasal drug absorption was similar in the brain and blood indicating the molecular bypass of the BBB. The learning and memory tests showed no difference in the cognitive performance of healthy aged and young animals. Based on these results, it can be concluded that various markers of chronic inflammation are present in healthy aged and diseased animals. In APOB-100 mice, a cerebro-ventricular dilation can also be observed. For development of proper anti-aging and neuroprotective compounds, further studies focusing on the above inflammatory targets are suggested.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Brain and Retinal Abnormalities in the 5xFAD Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease at Early Stages</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.681831</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of the major challenges in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) is its early diagnosis. Increasing data from clinical and animal research indicate that the retina may facilitate an early diagnosis of AD. However, a previous study on the 5xFAD (a fast AD model), showing retinal changes before those in the brain, has been questioned because of the involvement of the retinal degeneration allele Pde6b&lt;sup&gt;rd1&lt;/sup&gt;. Here, we tested in parallel, at 4 and 6 months of age, both the retinal and the brain structure and function in a 5xFAD mouse line that carries no mutation of rd1. In the three tested regions of the 5xFAD brain (hippocampus, visual cortex, and olfactory bulb), the Aβ plaques were more numerous than in wild-type (WT) littermates already at 4 months, but deterioration in the cognitive behavioral test and long-term potentiation (LTP) lagged behind, showing significant deterioration only at 6 months. Similarly in the retina, structural changes preceded functional decay. At 4 months, the retina was generally normal except for a thicker outer nuclear layer in the middle region than WT. At 6 months, the visual behavior (as seen by an optomotor test) was clearly impaired. While the full-field and pattern electroretinogram (ERG) responses were relatively normal, the light responses of the retinal ganglion cells (measured with multielectrode-array recording) were decreased. Structurally, the retina became abnormally thick with few more Aβ plaques and activated glia cells. In conclusion, the timeline of the degenerative processes in the retina and the brain is similar, supporting the use of non-invasive methods to test the retinal structure and function to reflect changes in the brain for early AD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance and abnormalities of plexus via quantitative multisequence magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) for CIDP.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Brachial and lumbosacral (LS) plexus of 37 CIDP patients and 37 age- and gender-matched controls were examined by using multisequence MRN. Nerve diameter, nerve-to-muscle T2 signal intensity ratio (nT2), contrast-enhanced ratio (CR), fractional anisotropy (FA), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were determined in both plexus, and tractographies were performed. The disease histories and the Inflammatory Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (I-RODS) questionnaire scores were documented before MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The sizes of nerve roots were larger in CIDP (p &amp;lt; 0.01). CR, nT2, and ADC were significantly higher, while FA was lower in CIDP than in controls (p &amp;lt; 0.01). FA had the highest sensitivity (0.809) and area under the curve (AUC) (0.925), while the highest specificity was 0.961 for CR in single parameters. The combination of FA and CR has the highest sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC in the LS plexus. CR only had a weak correlation with nT2 (p &amp;lt; 0.05). ADC and diameter had a positive correlation with nT2, and the diameter and nT2 had a negative correlation with FA in CIDP (p &amp;lt; 0.05). FA had a negative correlation with the duration in the CIDP (r’s = −0.404, p &amp;lt; 0.05). There was no significant correlation between the I-RODS scores and MR multiparameters (p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Multisequence MRN possesses a high diagnostic performance in the LS plexus. Sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolutions (SPACE) combined with DTI and contrast enhancement serves as a recommended composite protocol for CIDP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Low-Frequency TMS Results in Condition-Related Dynamic Activation Changes of Stimulated and Contralateral Inferior Parietal Lobule</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.684367</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive brain stimulation is a promising approach to study the causal relationship between brain function and behavior. However, it is difficult to interpret behavioral null results as dynamic brain network changes have the potential to prevent stimulation from affecting behavior, ultimately compensating for the stimulation. The present study investigated local and remote changes in brain activity via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) after offline disruption of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) or the vertex in human participants via 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Since the IPL acts as a multimodal hub of several networks, we implemented two experimental conditions in order to robustly engage task-positive networks, such as the fronto-parietal control network (on-task condition) and the default mode network (off-task condition). The condition-dependent neural after-effects following rTMS applied to the IPL were dynamic in affecting post-rTMS BOLD activity depending on the exact time-window. More specifically, we found that 1 Hz rTMS applied to the right IPL led to a delayed activity increase in both, the stimulated and the contralateral IPL, as well as in other brain regions of a task-positive network. This was markedly more pronounced in the on-task condition suggesting a condition-related delayed upregulation. Thus together, our results revealed a dynamic compensatory reorganization including upregulation and intra-network compensation which may explain mixed findings after low-frequency offline TMS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Temporal Dynamics of Corticomuscular Coherence Reflects Alteration of the Central Mechanisms of Neural Motor Control in Post-Stroke Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.682080</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neural control of muscular activity during a voluntary movement implies a continuous updating of a mix of afferent and efferent information. Corticomuscular coherence (CMC) is a powerful tool to explore the interactions between the motor cortex and the muscles involved in movement realization. The comparison of the temporal dynamics of CMC between healthy subjects and post-stroke patients could provide new insights into the question of how agonist and antagonist muscles are controlled related to motor performance during active voluntary movements. We recorded scalp electroencephalography activity, electromyography signals from agonist and antagonist muscles, and upper limb kinematics in eight healthy subjects and seventeen chronic post-stroke patients during twenty repeated voluntary elbow extensions and explored whether the modulation of the temporal dynamics of CMC could contribute to motor function impairment. Concomitantly with the alteration of elbow extension kinematics in post-stroke patients, dynamic CMC analysis showed a continuous CMC in both agonist and antagonist muscles during movement and highlighted that instantaneous CMC in antagonist muscles was higher for post-stroke patients compared to controls during the acceleration phase of elbow extension movement. In relation to motor control theories, our findings suggest that CMC could be involved in the online control of voluntary movement through the continuous integration of sensorimotor information. Moreover, specific alterations of CMC in antagonist muscles could reflect central command alterations of the selectivity in post-stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Corticofugal VIP Gabaergic Projection Neurons in the Mouse Auditory and Motor Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.714780</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anatomical and physiological studies have described the cortex as a six-layer structure that receives, elaborates, and sends out information exclusively as excitatory output to cortical and subcortical regions. This concept has increasingly been challenged by several anatomical and functional studies that showed that direct inhibitory cortical outputs are also a common feature of the sensory and motor cortices. Similar to their excitatory counterparts, subsets of Somatostatin- and Parvalbumin-expressing neurons have been shown to innervate distal targets like the sensory and motor striatum and the contralateral cortex. However, no evidence of long-range VIP-expressing neurons, the third major class of GABAergic cortical inhibitory neurons, has been shown in such cortical regions. Here, using anatomical anterograde and retrograde viral tracing, we tested the hypothesis that VIP-expressing neurons of the mouse auditory and motor cortices can also send long-range projections to cortical and subcortical areas. We were able to demonstrate, for the first time, that VIP-expressing neurons of the auditory cortex can reach not only the contralateral auditory cortex and the ipsilateral striatum and amygdala, as shown for Somatostatin- and Parvalbumin-expressing long-range neurons, but also the medial geniculate body and both superior and inferior colliculus. We also demonstrate that VIP-expressing neurons of the motor cortex send long-range GABAergic projections to the dorsal striatum and contralateral cortex. Because of its presence in two such disparate cortical areas, this would suggest that the long-range VIP projection is likely a general feature of the cortex’s network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Dopaminergic Dysregulation in Syndromic Autism Spectrum Disorders: Insights From Genetic Mouse Models</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.700968</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by altered social interaction and communication, and repetitive, restricted, inflexible behaviors. Approximately 1.5-2% of the general population meet the diagnostic criteria for ASD and several brain regions including the cortex, amygdala, cerebellum and basal ganglia have been implicated in ASD pathophysiology. The midbrain dopamine system is an important modulator of cellular and synaptic function in multiple ASD-implicated brain regions via anatomically and functionally distinct dopaminergic projections. The dopamine hypothesis of ASD postulates that dysregulation of dopaminergic projection pathways could contribute to the behavioral manifestations of ASD, including altered reward value of social stimuli, changes in sensorimotor processing, and motor stereotypies. In this review, we examine the support for the idea that cell-autonomous changes in dopaminergic function are a core component of ASD pathophysiology. We discuss the human literature supporting the involvement of altered dopamine signaling in ASD including genetic, brain imaging and pharmacologic studies. We then focus on genetic mouse models of syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders in which single gene mutations lead to increased risk for ASD. We highlight studies that have directly examined dopamine neuron number, morphology, physiology, or output in these models. Overall, we find considerable support for the idea that the dopamine system may be dysregulated in syndromic ASDs; however, there does not appear to be a consistent signature and some models show increased dopaminergic function, while others have deficient dopamine signaling. We conclude that dopamine dysregulation is common in syndromic forms of ASD but that the specific changes may be unique to each genetic disorder and may not account for the full spectrum of ASD-related manifestations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: A Characterization of the Electrophysiological and Morphological Properties of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) Interneurons in the Medial Entorhinal Cortex (MEC)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.653116</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Circuit interactions within the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) translate movement into a coherent code for spatial location. Entorhinal principal cells are subject to strong lateral inhibition, suggesting that a disinhibitory mechanism may drive their activation. Cortical Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) expressing inhibitory neurons are known to contact other interneurons and excitatory cells and are thus capable of providing a local disinhibitory mechanism, yet little is known about this cell type in the MEC. To investigate the electrophysiological and morphological properties of VIP cells in the MEC, we use in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in VIPcre/tdTom mice. We report several gradients in electrophysiological properties of VIP cells that differ across laminae and along the dorsal-ventral MEC axis. We additionally show that VIP cells have distinct morphological features across laminae. Together, these results characterize the cellular and morphological properties of VIP cells in the MEC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Buffering by Transporters Can Spare Geometric Hindrance in Controlling Glutamate Escape</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.707813</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The surface of astrocyte processes that often surround excitatory synapses is packed with high-affinity glutamate transporters, largely preventing extrasynaptic glutamate escape. The shape and prevalence of perisynaptic astroglia vary among brain regions, in some cases providing a complete isolation of synaptic connections from the surrounding tissue. The perception has been that the geometry of perisynaptic environment is therefore essential to preventing extrasynaptic glutamate escape. To understand to what degree this notion holds, we modelled brain neuropil as a space filled with a scatter of randomly sized, overlapping spheres representing randomly shaped cellular elements and intercellular lumen. Simulating release and diffusion of glutamate molecules inside the interstitial gaps in this medium showed that high-affinity transporters would efficiently constrain extrasynaptic spread of glutamate even when diffusion passages are relatively open. We thus estimate that, in the hippocampal or cerebellar neuropil, the bulk of glutamate released by a synaptic vesicle is rapidly bound by transporters (or high-affinity target receptors) mainly in close proximity of the synaptic cleft, whether or not certain physiological or pathological events change local tissue geometry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.705660</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic, debilitating mental illness marked by abnormal fear responses and deficits in extinction of fear memories. The pathophysiology of PTSD is linked to decreased activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). This study aims to investigate underlying functional changes in synaptic drive and intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons in the rodent homolog of the vmPFC, the infralimbic cortex (IL), following exposure to single prolonged stress (SPS), a paradigm that mimics core symptoms of PTSD in rats. Rats were exposed to SPS and allowed 1 week of recovery, following which brain slices containing the PFC were prepared for whole-cell patch clamp recordings from layer V pyramidal neurons in the IL. Our results indicate that SPS reduces spontaneous excitatory synaptic drive to pyramidal neurons. In addition, SPS decreases the intrinsic membrane excitability of IL PFC pyramidal cells, as indicated by an increase in rheobase, decrease in input resistance, hyperpolarization of resting membrane potential, and a reduction in repetitive firing rate. Our results suggest that SPS causes a lasting reduction in PFC activity, supporting a body of evidence linking traumatic stress with prefrontal hypoactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.697560</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Efferent cholinergic neurons inhibit sensory hair cells of the vertebrate inner ear through the combined action of calcium-permeable α9α10-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and associated calcium-dependent potassium channels. The venom of cone snails is a rich repository of bioactive peptides, many with channel blocking activities. The conopeptide analog, RgIA-5474, is a specific and potent antagonist of α9α10-containing nAChRs. We added an alkyl functional group to the N-terminus of the RgIA-5474, to enable click chemistry addition of the fluorescent cyanine dye, Cy3. The resulting peptide, Cy3-RgIA-5727, potently blocked mouse α9α10 nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 23 pM), with 290-fold less activity on α7 nAChRs and 40,000-fold less activity on all other tested nAChR subtypes. The tight binding of Cy3-RgIA-5727 provided robust visualization of hair cell nAChRs juxtaposed to cholinergic efferent terminals in excised, unfixed cochlear tissue from mice. Presumptive postsynaptic sites on outer hair cells (OHCs) were labeled, but absent from inner hair cells (IHCs) and from OHCs in cochlear tissue from α9-null mice and in cochlear tissue pre-incubated with non-Cy3-conjugated RgIA-5474. In cochlear tissue from younger (postnatal day 10) mice, Cy3-RgIA-5727 also labeled IHCs, corresponding to transient efferent innervation at that age. Cy3 puncta in Kölliker’s organ remained in the α9-null tissue. Pre-exposure with non-Cy3-conjugated RgIA-5474 or bovine serum albumin reduced this non-specific labeling to variable extents in different preparations. Cy3-RgIA-5727 and RgIA-5474 blocked the native hair cell nAChRs, within the constraints of application to the excised cochlear tissue. Cy3-RgIA-5727 or RgIA-5474 block of efferent synaptic currents in young IHCs was not relieved after 50 min washing, so effectively irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Track-Density Ratio Mapping With Fiber Types in the Cerebral Cortex Using Diffusion-Weighted MRI</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.715571</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The nerve fibers are divided into three categories: projection, commissural, and association fibers. This study demonstrated a novel cortical mapping method based on these three fiber categories using MR tractography data. The MR fiber-track data were extracted using the diffusion-weighted 3T-MRI data from 19 individuals’ Human Connectome Project dataset. Anatomical MR images in each dataset were parcellated using FreeSurfer software and Brainnetome atlas. The 5 million extracted tracks per subject by MRtrix software were classified based on the basic cortical structure (cortical area in the left and right hemisphere, subcortical area), after the tracks validation procedure. The number of terminals for each categorized track per unit-sized cortical area (1 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) was defined as the track-density in that cortical area. Track-density ratio mapping with fiber types was achieved by mapping the density-dependent color intensity for each categorized tracks with a different primary color. The mapping results showed a highly localized, unique density ratio map determined by fiber types. Furthermore, the quantitative group data analysis based on the parcellation information revealed that the majority of nerve fibers in the brain are association fibers, particularly in temporal, inferior parietal, and occipital lobes, while the projection and commissural fibers were mainly located in the superior part of the brain. Hemispheric asymmetries in the fiber density were also observed, such as long association fiber in the Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. We believe this new dimensional brain mapping information allows us to further understand brain anatomy, function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to investigate therapeutic interventions in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases depends on extensive characterization of the model(s) being used. There are numerous models that have been generated to study Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and the underlying pathogenesis of the disease. While transgenic models have been instrumental in understanding AD mechanisms and risk factors, they are limited in the degree of characteristics displayed in comparison with AD in humans, and the full spectrum of AD effects has yet to be recapitulated in a single mouse model. The Model Organism Development and Evaluation for Late-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease (MODEL-AD) consortium was assembled by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) to develop more robust animal models of AD with increased relevance to human disease, standardize the characterization of AD mouse models, improve preclinical testing in animals, and establish clinically relevant AD biomarkers, among other aims toward enhancing the translational value of AD models in clinical drug design and treatment development. Here we have conducted a detailed characterization of the 5XFAD mouse, including transcriptomics, electroencephalogram, in vivo imaging, biochemical characterization, and behavioral assessments. The data from this study is publicly available through the AD Knowledge Portal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.711579</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Identifying biomarkers that can assess the risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) remains a significant challenge. In this study, we investigated the integrity levels of brain white matter in 34 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who later converted to AD and 53 stable MCI patients. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and automated fiber quantification to obtain the diffusion properties of 20 major white matter tracts. To identify which tracts and diffusion measures are most relevant to AD conversion, we used support vector machines (SVMs) to classify the AD conversion and non-conversion MCI patients based on the diffusion properties of each tract individually. We found that diffusivity measures from seven white matter tracts were predictive of AD conversion with axial diffusivity being the most predictive diffusion measure. Additional analyses revealed that white matter changes in the central and parahippocampal terminal regions of the right cingulate hippocampal bundle, central regions of the right inferior frontal occipital fasciculus, and posterior and anterior regions of the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus were the best predictors of conversion from MCI to AD. An SVM based on these white matter tract regions achieved an accuracy of 0.75. These findings provide additional potential biomarkers of AD risk in MCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Repression of CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 prevents epigenetic collateral damage in Arabidopsis</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69396</link>
	<content:encoded>DNA methylation has evolved to silence mutagenic transposable elements (TEs) while typically avoiding the targeting of endogenous genes. Mechanisms that prevent DNA methyltransferases from ectopically methylating genes are expected to be of prime importance during periods of dynamic cell cycle activities including plant embryogenesis. However, virtually nothing is known regarding how DNA methyltransferase activities are precisely regulated during embryogenesis to prevent the induction of potentially deleterious and mitotically stable genic epimutations. Here, we report that microRNA-mediated repression of CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) and the chromatin features that CMT3 prefers help prevent ectopic methylation of thousands of genes during embryogenesis that can persist for weeks afterwards. Our results are also consistent with CMT3-induced ectopic methylation of promoters or bodies of genes undergoing transcriptional activation reducing their expression. Therefore, the repression of CMT3 prevents epigenetic collateral damage on endogenous genes. We also provide a model that may help reconcile conflicting viewpoints regarding the functions of gene-body methylation that occurs in nearly all flowering plants.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69011</link>
	<content:encoded>Mature neural networks synchronize and integrate spatiotemporal activity patterns to support cognition. Emergence of these activity patterns and functions is believed to be developmentally regulated, but the postnatal time course for neural networks to perform complex computations remains unknown. We investigate the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns across development using high spatiotemporal resolution &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiology in immature mice. We reveal that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. The transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence, after which spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity occurs. We demonstrate a similar developmental trajectory in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could facilitate a transition in network operation. We hypothesize that this transient quiescent period is a requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Parkinsons disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra results in a clinically heterogeneous group with variable motor and non-motor symptoms with a degree of misdiagnosis. Only 3-5% of sporadic Parkinsons patients present with genetic abnormalities, thus environmental, metabolic, and other unknown causes contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease, which highlights the critical need for biomarkers. There could be a significant clinical benefit to treating Parkinsons disease at the earliest stage and identify at-risk populations once disease-modifying treatments are available. In the present study, we prospectively collected and analyzed plasma samples from 201 Parkinsons disease patients and 199 age-matched non-diseased controls. Multiomic and Bayesian artificial intelligence analysis of molecular and clinical data identified the diagnostic utility of N-acetyl putrescine (NAP) in combination with smell (B-SIT), depression/anxiety (HADS), and acting out dreams (RBD1Q) clinical measurements. The clinical and biomarker panel demonstrated an area under the curve, AUC = 0.9, positive predictive value, PPV = 0.91, and negative predictive value, NPV = 0.66 utilizing all four variables. The assessed diagnostic panel demonstrates combinatorial utility in diagnosing Parkinsons disease, allowing for an integrated interpretation of disease pathophysiology and highlighting the use of multi-tiered panels in neurological disease diagnosis.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Automated identification of piglet brain tissue from MRI images using Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.23.453526v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Magnetic Resonance Imaging is an important tool for characterizing volumetric changes of the piglet brain during development. These analyses have been aided by the development of piglet brain atlases which are based on averages drawn from multiple piglets. Because these atlases typically contain only brain tissue, their use is limited to &quot;brain extracted&quot; images from which the surrounding tissues have been removed. Brain extractions, or segmentations, are typically performed manually. This approach is time-intensive and can lead to variation between segmentations when multiple raters are used. Automated segmentations processes are important for reducing the time required for analyses and improving the uniformity of the segmentations. Here we demonstrate the use of region-based recurrent convolutional neural networks (RCNNs) on a dataset consisting of 32 piglet brains. The RCNNs are trained from manual segmentations of sets of 27 piglets and then applied to sets of the remaining 5 piglets. The volumes of the machine-generated brain masks are highly correlated with those of the manually generated masks, and visual inspection of the segmentations show acceptable accuracy. These results demonstrate that neural networks provide a viable tool for the segmentation of piglet brains.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The dopamine dip amplitude is a quantitative measure of disappointment</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.23.453499v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Great expectations can lead to greater disappointment when the desired results are not achieved. Although it is well-documented that a better-than-expected reward is encoded quantitatively via midbrain dopaminergic (DA) activity, it has been less addressed experimentally whether disappointment, a worse-than-expected outcome is also expressed quantitatively by the DA signal. We show that the degree of disappointment is quantified by the magnitude of a transient decrease in the extracellular DA concentration (DA dip) in the ventral striatum of mice. We set up a lever press task on a fixed ratio (FR) schedule requiring five lever presses as an effort for a food reward (FR5). Mice occasionally checked the food magazine without a reward before completing the task. The percentage of this premature magazine entry (PME) increased as the number of lever presses approached five. This behavioral readout shows rising expectations with increasing proximity to task completion, leading to greater disappointment in the mice. Fiber photometry of the extracellular DA dynamics in the ventral striatum using a fluorescent protein (genetically encoded GPCR-activation-based-DA sensor: GRABDA2m) revealed that the amplitude of the DA dip following a PME was correlated with the percentage of the PME, demonstrating a monotonic relationship between the DA dip amplitude and the degree of disappointment. Computational modeling of the lever press task implementing temporal difference errors and state transitions replicated the positive correlation between the PME frequency and DA dip amplitude during improvement of the FR5 task. We propose that the degree of disappointment during making an effort for a goal is represented monotonically by the magnitude of the DA dip in the ventral striatum, which may guide behavioral adjustment.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.23.453491v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Sleep quality changes dramatically from young to old age, but its effects on brain dynamics and cognitive functions are not yet fully specified. We applied Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to resting-state MEG data from a large cohort (N=564) of population-based adults (aged 18-88), in order to characterize transient neural networks and to relate their temporal dynamics to sleep quality and to cognitive performance. Using multivariate analyses of brain-sleep profiles and of brain-cognition profiles, we found that an age-related &quot;neural shift&quot;, expressed as decreased occurrence of &quot;lower-order&quot; brain networks, coupled with increased occurrence of &quot;higher-order&quot; networks, was associated with both increased sleep dysfunction and decreased fluid intelligence above and beyond age. These results suggest that poor sleep quality, as evident in ageing, may lead to a behavior-related shift in neural dynamics.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.22.453451v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Rapidly detecting salient information in our environments is critical for survival. Visual processing in subcortical areas like the pulvinar and amygdala have been shown to facilitate unconscious processing of salient stimuli. It is unknown, however, if and how these areas might interact with cortical networks to facilitate faster conscious perception of salient stimuli. Here we investigated these neural processes using 7T functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in concert with computational modelling while participants (n = 32) engaged in a breaking continuous flash suppression paradigm (bCFS) in which fearful and neutral faces are initially suppressed from conscious perception but then eventually &quot;breakthrough&quot; into awareness. We found that participants reported faster breakthrough times for fearful faces compared to neutral faces. Drift-diffusion modelling suggested that perceptual evidence was accumulated at a faster rate for fearful faces compared to neutral faces. For both neutral and fearful faces, faster response times coincided with greater activity in the amygdala (specifically within its subregions, including superficial, basolateral and amygdalo-striatal transition area) and the insula. Faster rates of evidence accumulation coincided with greater activity in frontoparietal regions and the occipital lobe, as well as the amygdala. Overall, our findings suggest that hastened perceptual awareness of salient stimuli recruits the amygdala and, more specifically, is driven by accelerated evidence accumulation in fronto-parietal and visual areas. In sum, we have uncovered and mapped distinct neural computations that accelerate perceptual awareness of visually suppressed faces.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.22.453410v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Twin studies suggest that approximately 50% of the vulnerability to cocaine use disorder is determined by genetic factors, but genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans have only begun to identify specific genes that confer this risk. The identification of a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with increased vulnerability to develop compulsive cocaine use represents a major goal for understanding of the genetic risk factors to cocaine use disorder and facilitating the identification of novel druggable targets.

Here we characterized addiction-like behaviors in heterogeneous stock (HS) rats, a unique outbred strain of rats characterized by high genetic variability that has been developed to mimic genetic variability in humans. HS rats were allowed to self-administer cocaine 6h/daily for 14 days. Animals were also screened for compulsive cocaine use, using progressive-ratio (PR) and responding despite adverse consequences (contingent foot shocks). To minimize cohort-specific effects, we used large cohorts (n = 46-60) and normalized the level of responding within cohorts using a Z-score. To take advantage of the three behaviors related to compulsive intake and further identify subjects that are consistently vulnerable vs. resilient to compulsive cocaine use we computed an Addiction index by averaging normalized responding (Z-scores) for the three behavioral tests. Results showed high individual variability between vulnerable and resilient rats that is likely to facilitate detection of gene variants associated with vulnerable vs. resilient individuals. Such data will have considerable translational value for designing pharmacogenetic studies in humans.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>IntroductionThe portfolio of novel targets to treat Alzheimers disease (AD) has been enriched by the AMP-AD program.

MethodsA cheminformatics-driven effort enabled identification of existing small molecule modulators for many protein targets nominated by AMP-AD and suitable positive control compounds to be included in the set.

ResultsWe have built an annotated set of 171 small molecule modulators, including mostly inhibitors, targeting 98 unique proteins that have been nominated by AMP-AD consortium members as novel targets for AD treatment. These small molecules vary in their quality and should be considered chemical tools that can be used in efforts to validate therapeutic hypotheses, but which would require further optimization. A physical copy of the AD Informer Set can be ordered via the AD Knowledge Portal.

DiscussionSmall molecule tools that enable target validation are important tools for the translation of novel hypotheses into viable therapeutic strategies for AD.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Effects of reward history on decision-making and movement vigor</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.22.453376v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>During foraging, animals decide how long to stay and harvest reward, and then abandon that site and travel with a certain speed to the next reward opportunity. One aspect of this behavior involves decision-making, while the other involves motor-control. A recent theory posits that control of decision-making and movements may be linked via a desire to maximize a single normative utility: the sum of all rewards acquired, minus all efforts expended, divided by time. If this is the case, then the history of rewards, and not just its immediate availability, should dictate how long one decides to stay and harvest reward, and how slowly one travels to the next opportunity. We tested this theory in a series of experiments in which humans used their hand to harvest tokens at a reward patch, and then used their arm to reach toward a subsequent opportunity. Following a history of poor rewards, people not only foraged for a longer period, but also moved slower to the next reward site. Thus, reward history had a consistent effect on both the decision-making process regarding when to abandon a reward site, and the motor control process regarding how fast to move to the next opportunity.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Cell assemblies are thought to be the substrate of memory in the brain. Theoretical studies have previously shown that assemblies can be formed in networks with multiple types of plasticity. But how exactly they are formed and how they encode information is yet to be fully understood. One possibility is that memories are stored in silent assemblies. Here we used a computational model to study the formation of silent assemblies in a network of spiking neurons with excitatory and inhibitory plasticity. We found that even though the formed assemblies were silent in terms of mean firing rate, they had an increased coefficient of variation of inter-spike intervals. We also found that this spiking irregularity could be readout with support of short-term plasticity, and that it could contribute to the longevity of memories.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Bassoon controls synaptic vesicle pools via regulation of presynaptic phosphorylation and cAMP homeostasis</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.22.453360v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuronal presynaptic terminals contain hundreds of neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles (SVs). The morphologically uniform SVs differ in their release competence segregating into functional pools that differentially contribute to neurotransmission. The presynaptic scaffold bassoon is required for neurotransmission, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. We report that glutamatergic synapses lacking bassoon featured a decreased SV release competence and increased resting pool of SV as observed by imaging of SV release in cultured neurons. Further analyses in vitro and in vivo revealed a dysregulation of CDK5/calcineurin and cAMP/PKA presynaptic signalling resulting in an aberrant phosphorylation of their downstream effectors synapsin 1 and SNAP25, which are well-known regulators of SV release competence. An acute pharmacological restoration of physiological CDK5 and cAMP/PKA activity fully normalised the SV pools in neurons lacking bassoon. Finally, we demonstrated that CDK5-dependent regulation of PDE4 activity controls SV release competence by interaction with cAMP/PKA signalling. These data reveal that bassoon organises SV pools via regulation of presynaptic phosphorylation and indicate an involvement of PDE4 in the control of neurotransmitter release.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Inside compound eyes, photoreceptors contract to light changes1-3, sharpening retinal images of the moving world in time2. Current methods to measure these so-called photoreceptor microsaccades in living insects are spatially limited and technically challenging1, 2. Here, we present goniometric high-speed deep pseudopupil (GHS-DPP) microscopy to assess how the rhabdomeric insect photoreceptors and their microsaccades are organised across the compound eyes. This method enables non-invasive rhabdomere orientation mapping, whilst their microsaccades can be locally light-activated, revealing the eyes underlying active sampling motifs. By comparing the microsaccades in wild-type Drosophilas open rhabdom eyes4 to spam-mutant eyes, reverted to an ancestral fused rhabdom state5, 6, we show how two different eye types sample light information. These results show different ways how vision converts space into time2, 3, 7-11, and highlight how compound eyes and their active sampling can evolve with insects visual needs.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Dissection of brain-wide spontaneous and functional somatosensory circuits by fMRI with optogenetic silencing</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.22.453311v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>To further advance functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based brain science, it is critical to dissect fMRI activities at a circuit level. To solve this issue, we propose to combine brain-wide fMRI with neuronal silencing in well-defined regions via temporally specific optogenetic stimulation. Since focal inactivation suppresses excitatory output to downstream pathways, intact input and downregulated output circuits can be separated. Highly specific cerebral blood volume-weighted fMRI was performed with optogenetic simulation of local GABAergic neurons in mouse somatosensory regions at 15.2 T. Brain-wide spontaneous somatosensory networks were found mostly in ipsilateral cortical and subcortical areas, which differ from the bilateral homotopic connections commonly observed in resting-state fMRI. Evoked fMRI response to somatosensory stimulation were dissected to spinothalamic, thalamocortical (TC), corticothalamic (CT), corticocortical (CC) inputs and local intracortical circuits. The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) receives TC inputs from the ventral posterior thalamic nucleus with spinothalamic inputs. The primary motor cortex (M1) has feedforward CC inputs from S1, and the posterior medial thalamic nucleus also receives CT inputs from S1. The secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) receives mostly direct CC inputs from S1 and a small amount of TC inputs. The TC and CC input layers in cortical regions were identified by laminar-specific fMRI responses. The long-range synaptic input in cortical areas is amplified approximately 2-fold by local intracortical circuits, which is consistent with electrophysiological recordings. Overall, whole-brain fMRI with optogenetic inactivation provides brain-wide, population-based long-range circuits, which will complement conventional microscopic functional circuit studies.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Prolonged Pain Reliably Slows Peak Alpha Frequency by Reducing Fast Alpha Power</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.22.453260v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The relationship between the 8-12 Hz &quot;alpha: rhythm, the predominant oscillatory activity of the brain, and pain remains unclear. In healthy individuals, acute, noxious stimuli suppress alpha power while patients with chronic pain demonstrate both enhanced alpha power and slowing of the peak alpha frequency (PAF). To investigate these apparent differences, EEG was recorded from healthy individuals while they completed two models of prolonged pain, Phasic Heat Pain and Capsaicin Heat Pain, at two testing visits occurring roughly 8 weeks apart. We report that PAF is reliably slowed and that alpha power is reliably decreased in response to prolonged pain. Furthermore, we show that alpha power changes, but not PAF changes, are fully reversed with stimulus removal suggesting that PAF slowing reflects pain associated states such as sensitization rather than the presence of ongoing pain. Finally, we provide evidence that changes to alpha power and PAF are due to power decreases in the &quot;fast&quot; (10-12 Hz) range of the alpha rhythm. This frequency dependent pain response aligns with the hypothesis that the alpha rhythm is composed of multiple, independent oscillators, and suggest that modulation of a putative &quot;fast&quot; oscillator may represent a promising therapeutic target for treating ongoing pain. In sum, we provide strong evidence that PAF is reliably slowed during prolonged pain and additionally identify a mechanism, &quot;fast&quot; alpha Power, which is responsible for these PAF changes.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Not all smokers are alike: The hidden cost of sustained attention during nicotine abstinence</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.22.453142v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>BackgroundNicotine Withdrawal Syndrome (NWS)-associated cognitive deficits are heterogeneous, suggesting underlying endophenotypic subgroups. We identified smoker subgroups based on response accuracy during a cognitively demanding Parametric Flanker Task (PFT) and characterized their distinct neuroimaging endophenotypes using a nicotine state manipulation (sated, abstinent).

MethodsForty-five smokers completed the 25-min PFT in two fMRI sessions (nicotine sated, abstinent). Task-evoked NWS-associated errors of omission (EOm), brain activity, underlying functional connectivity (FC), and brain-behavior correlations between subgroups were assessed.

ResultsBased on their response accuracy in the high demand PFT condition, smokers split into high (HTP, n=21) and low task performer (LTP, n=24) subgroups. Behaviorally, HTPs showed greater response accuracy independent of nicotine state and greater vulnerability to abstinence-induced EOm. HTPs showed greater BOLD responses in attentional control brain regions for the [correct responses (-) errors of commission] PFT contrast across states. A whole-brain FC analysis with these subgroup-derived regions as seeds revealed two circuits: L Precentral : R Insula and L Insula : R Occipital, with abstinence-induced FC strength increases only in HTPs. Finally, abstinence-induced brain (FC) and behavior (EOm) differences were positively correlated for HTPs in a L Precentral : R Orbitofrontal cortical circuit.

ConclusionWe used a cognitive stressor (PFT) to fractionate smokers into two subgroups (HTP/LTP). Only the HTPs demonstrated sustained attention deficits during nicotine abstinence, a stressor in dependent smokers. Unpacking underlying smoker heterogeneity with this  dual stressor approach revealed distinct smoker subgroups with differential attention deficit responses to withdrawal that could be novel targets for therapeutic interventions to improve cessation outcomes.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.22.451589v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>BackgroundInteroception refers to an individuals ability to sense their internal bodily sensations. Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a common feature of ascent to high altitude that is only partially explained by measures of peripheral physiology. We hypothesised that interoceptive ability may explain the disconnect between measures of physiology and symptom experience in AMS.

Methods and MaterialTwo groups of 18 participants were recruited to complete a respiratory interoceptive task three times at two-week intervals. The control group remained in Birmingham (140m altitude) for all three tests. The altitude group completed test 1 in Birmingham, test 2 the day after arrival at 2624m, and test 3 at 2728m after an 11-day trek at high altitude (up to 4800m).

ResultsBy measuring changes to metacognitive performance, we showed that acute ascent to altitude neither presented an interoceptive challenge, nor acted as interoceptive training. However, AMS symptom burden throughout the trek was found to relate to sea-level measures of anxiety, agoraphobia, and neuroticism.

ConclusionsThis suggests that the Lake Louise AMS score is not solely a reflection of physiological changes on ascent to high altitude, despite often being used as such by researchers and commercial trekking companies alike.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The precedence effect in spatial hearing emerges only late in the auditory pathway</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.21.453295v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>BackgroundTo localize sound sources accurately in a reverberant environment, human binaural hearing strongly favors analyzing the initial wave front of sounds. Behavioral studies of this &quot;precedence effect&quot; have so far largely been confined to human subjects, limiting the scope of complementary physiological approaches. Similarly, physiological studies have mostly looked at neural responses in the inferior colliculus, or used modeling of cochlear mechanics in an attempt to identify likely underlying mechanisms. Studies capable of providing a direct comparison of neural coding and behavioral measures of sound localization under the precedence effect are lacking.

ResultsWe adapted a &quot;temporal weighting function&quot; paradigm for use in laboratory rats. The animals learned to lateralize click trains in which each click in the train had a different interaural time difference. Computing the &quot;perceptual weight&quot; of each click in the train revealed a strong onset bias, very similar to that reported for humans. Follow-on electrocorticographic recording experiments revealed that onset weighting of ITDs is a robust feature of the cortical population response, but interestingly it often fails to manifest at individual cortical recording sites.

ConclusionWhile previous studies suggested that the precedence effect may be caused by cochlear mechanics or inhibitory circuitry in the brainstem and midbrain, our results indicate that the precedence effect is not fully developed at the level of individual recording sites in auditory cortex, but robust and consistent precedence effects are observable at the level of cortical population responses. This indicates that the precedence effect is significantly &quot;higher order&quot; than has hitherto been assumed.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Current theory divides the human mechanical sense into discriminative and affective systems. A discriminative system supports tactile exploration and manipulation via fast A{beta} signaling, whereas an affective system supports the pleasure of friendly interpersonal touch via slow CT signaling. To probe this system segregation, we recorded the electroencephalogram from participants being stroked and reporting stroke pleasantness. We observed a somatosensory negativity that was maximal for CT optimal as compared with sub-optimal velocities, that predicted subjective pleasantness, and showed only for stroking of hairy skin known to be CT innervated. Importantly, the latency of this negativity preceded C fiber input to the brain by several hundred milliseconds and is best explained by interactions between CT and A{beta} processes in the spinal cord. Our data challenge the divide between discriminative and affective touch implying instead that both fast A{beta} and slow CT signaling play an important role in tactile pleasure.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Meaningful and simplified representations of neural activity can yield insights into how and what information is being processed within a neural circuit. However, without labels, finding representations that reveal the link between the brain and behavior can be challenging. Here, we introduce a novel unsupervised approach for learning disentangled representations of neural activity called Swap-VAE. Our approach combines a generative modeling framework with an instance-specific alignment loss that tries to maximize the representational similarity between transformed views of the input (brain state). These transformed (or augmented) views are created by dropping out neurons and jittering samples in time, which intuitively should lead the network to a representation that maintains both temporal consistency and invariance to the specific neurons used to represent the neural state. Through evaluations on both synthetic data and neural recordings from hundreds of neurons in different primate brains, we show that it is possible to build representations that disentangle neural datasets along relevant latent dimensions linked to behavior.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: ChIP-GSM: Inferring active transcription factor modules to predict functional regulatory elements</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/k1Vb2v7ZNXk/article</link>

Transcription factors (TFs) often function as a module including both master factors and mediators binding at cis-regulatory regions to modulate nearby gene transcription. ChIP-seq profiling of multiple TFs makes it feasible to infer functional TF modules. However, when inferring TF modules based on co-localization of ChIP-seq peaks, often many weak binding events are missed, especially for mediators, resulting in incomplete identification of modules. To address this problem, we develop a ChIP-seq data-driven Gibbs Sampler to infer Modules (ChIP-GSM) using a Bayesian framework that integrates ChIP-seq profiles of multiple TFs. ChIP-GSM samples read counts of module TFs iteratively to estimate the binding potential of a module to each region and, across all regions, estimates the module abundance. Using inferred module-region probabilistic bindings as feature units, ChIP-GSM then employs logistic regression to predict active regulatory elements. Validation of ChIP-GSM predicted regulatory regions on multiple independent datasets sharing the same context confirms the advantage of using TF modules for predicting regulatory activity. In a case study of K562 cells, we demonstrate that the ChIP-GSM inferred modules form as groups, activate gene expression at different time points, and mediate diverse functional cellular processes. Hence, ChIP-GSM infers biologically meaningful TF modules and improves the prediction accuracy of regulatory region activities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k1Vb2v7ZNXk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The influence of the crowding assumptions in biofilm simulations</title>

Microorganisms are frequently organized into crowded structures that affect the nutrients diffusion. This reduction in metabolite diffusion could modify the microbial dynamics, meaning that computational methods for studying microbial systems need accurate ways to model the crowding conditions. We previously developed a computational framework, termed CROMICS, that incorporates the effect of the (time-dependent) crowding conditions on the spatio-temporal modeling of microbial communities, and we used it to demonstrate the crowding influence on the community dynamics. To further identify scenarios where crowding should be considered in microbial modeling, we herein applied and extended CROMICS to simulate several environmental conditions that could potentially boost or dampen the crowding influence in biofilms. We explore whether the nutrient supply (rich- or low-nutrient media), the cell-packing configuration (square or hexagonal spherical cell arrangement), or the cell growing conditions (planktonic state or biofilm) modify the crowding influence on the growth of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. Our results indicate that the growth rate, the abundance and appearance time of different cell phenotypes as well as the amount of by-products secreted to the medium are sensitive to some extent to the local crowding conditions in all scenarios tested, except in rich-nutrient media. Crowding conditions enhance the formation of nutrient gradient in biofilms, but its effect is only appreciated when cell metabolism is controlled by the nutrient limitation. Thus, as soon as biomass (and/or any other extracellular macromolecule) accumulates in a region, and cells occupy more than 14% of the volume fraction, the crowding effect must not be underestimated, as the microbial dynamics start to deviate from the &lt;i&gt;ideal/expected&lt;/i&gt; behaviour that assumes volumeless cells or when a homogeneous (reduced) diffusion is applied in the simulation. The modeling and simulation of the interplay between the species diversity (cell shape and metabolism) and the environmental conditions (nutrient quality, crowding conditions) can help to design effective strategies for the optimization and control of microbial systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fNE1DgMkiek&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The metabolic capabilities of the species and the local environment shape the microbial interactions in a community either through the exchange of metabolic products or the competition for the resources. Cells are often arranged in close proximity to each other, creating a crowded environment that unevenly reduce the diffusion of nutrients. Herein, we investigated how the crowding conditions and metabolic variability among cells shape the dynamics of microbial communities. For this, we developed CROMICS, a spatio-temporal framework that combines techniques such as individual-based modeling, scaled particle theory, and thermodynamic flux analysis to explicitly incorporate the cell metabolism and the impact of the presence of macromolecular components on the nutrients diffusion. This framework was used to study two archetypical microbial communities (i) &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; that cooperate with each other by exchanging metabolites, and (ii) two &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; with different production level of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that compete for the same nutrients. In the mutualistic community, our results demonstrate that crowding enhanced the fitness of cooperative mutants by reducing the leakage of metabolites from the region where they are produced, avoiding the resource competition with non-cooperative cells. Moreover, we also show that &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; EPS-secreting mutants won the competition against the non-secreting cells by creating less dense structures (i.e. increasing the spacing among the cells) that allow mutants to expand and reach regions closer to the nutrient supply point. A modest enhancement of the relative fitness of EPS-secreting cells over the non-secreting ones were found when the crowding effect was taken into account in the simulations. The emergence of cell-cell interactions and the intracellular conflicts arising from the trade-off between growth and the secretion of metabolites or EPS could provide a &lt;i&gt;local&lt;/i&gt; competitive advantage to one species, either by supplying more cross-feeding metabolites or by creating a less dense neighborhood.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7naC1ZWBv7k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

COVID-19 testing across India uses a mix of two types of tests. Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) are relatively inexpensive point-of-care lateral-flow-assay tests, but they are also less sensitive. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test has close to 100% sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting, but delays in returning results, as well as increased costs relative to RATs, may vitiate this advantage. India-wide, about 49% of COVID-19 tests are RATs, but some Indian states, including the large states of Uttar Pradesh (pop. 227.9 million) and Bihar (pop. 121.3 million) use a much higher proportion of such tests. Here we show, using simulations based on epidemiological network models, that the judicious use of RATs can yield epidemiological outcomes comparable to those obtained through RT-PCR-based testing and isolation of positives, provided a few conditions are met. These are (a) that RAT test sensitivity is not too low, (b) that a reasonably large fraction of the population, of order 0.5% per day, can be tested, (c) that those testing positive are isolated for a sufficient duration, and that (d) testing is accompanied by other non-pharmaceutical interventions for increased effectiveness. We assess optimal testing regimes, taking into account test sensitivity and specificity, background seroprevalence and current test pricing. We find, surprisingly, that even 100% RAT test regimes should be acceptable, from both an epidemiological as well as a economic standpoint, provided the conditions outlined above are met.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VxcsueVjMgs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Peripheral nerve injury–induced mechanical allodynia is often accompanied by abnormalities in the higher cortical regions, yet the mechanisms underlying such maladaptive cortical plasticity remain unclear. Here, we show that in male mice, structural and functional changes in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) caused by peripheral nerve injury require neuron-microglial signaling within the local circuit. Following peripheral nerve injury, microglia in the S1 maintain ramified morphology and normal density but up-regulate the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Using in vivo two-photon imaging and &lt;i&gt;Cx3cr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;CreER&lt;/sup&gt;;&lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;flox&lt;/sup&gt; mice, we show that conditional knockout of BDNF from microglia prevents nerve injury–induced synaptic remodeling and pyramidal neuron hyperactivity in the S1, as well as pain hypersensitivity in mice. Importantly, S1-targeted removal of microglial BDNF largely recapitulates the beneficial effects of systemic BDNF depletion on cortical plasticity and allodynia. Together, these findings reveal a pivotal role of cerebral microglial BDNF in somatosensory cortical plasticity and pain hypersensitivity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/r-HJn4QUO0Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Previous research has highlighted the role of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in learning and plasticity. What is currently unknown is how this knowledge translates to real-life complex cognitive abilities that emerge slowly and how the link between these neurotransmitters and human learning and plasticity is shaped by development. While some have suggested a generic role of glutamate and GABA in learning and plasticity, others have hypothesized that their involvement shapes sensitive periods during development. Here we used a cross-sectional longitudinal design with 255 individuals (spanning primary school to university) to show that glutamate and GABA in the intraparietal sulcus explain unique variance both in current and future mathematical achievement (approximately 1.5 years). Furthermore, our findings reveal a dynamic and dissociable role of GABA and glutamate in predicting learning, which is reversed during development, and therefore provide novel implications for models of learning and plasticity during childhood and adulthood.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qgkU0L_CvHA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We have employed α‐syn oligomer proximity ligation assay to detect early changes in α‐syn aggregation in the (Thy‐1)‐h[A30P] α‐syn transgenic mouse model of Parkinson's disease.

Abstract
Aggregation of alpha‐synuclein (α‐syn) into Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites is a pathological hallmark in the Parkinson´s disease (PD) brain. The formation of α‐syn oligomers is believed to be an early pathogenic event and the A30P mutation in the gene encoding α‐syn, causing familial PD, has been shown to cause an accelerated oligomerization. Due to the problem of preserving antigen conformation on tissue surfaces, α‐syn oligomers are difficult to detect ex vivo using conventional immunohistochemistry with oligomer‐selective antibodies. Herein, we have instead employed the previously reported α‐syn oligomer proximity ligation assay (ASO‐PLA), along with a wide variety of biochemical assays, to discern the pathological progression of α‐syn oligomers and their impact on the dopaminergic system in male and female (Thy‐1)‐h[A30P]α‐syn transgenic (A30P‐tg) mice. Our results reveal a previously undetected abundance of α‐syn oligomers in midbrain of young mice, whereas phosphorylated (pS129) and proteinase k‐resistant α‐syn species were observed to a larger extent in aged mice. Although we did not detect loss of dopaminergic neurons in A30P‐tg mice, a dysregulation in the monoaminergic system was recorded in older mice. Taken together, ASO‐PLA should be a useful method for the detection of early changes in α‐syn aggregation on brain tissue, from experimental mouse models in addition to post mortem PD cases.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Characterizing the Genetic Architecture of Parkinson's Disease in Latinos</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26153?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
This work was undertaken in order to identify Parkinson's disease (PD) risk variants in a Latino cohort, to describe the overlap in the genetic architecture of PD in Latinos compared to European‐ancestry subjects, and to increase the diversity in PD genome‐wide association (GWAS) data.


Methods
We genotyped and imputed 1,497 PD cases and controls recruited from nine clinical sites across South America. We performed a GWAS using logistic mixed models; variants with a p‐value &amp;lt;1 × 10−5 were tested in a replication cohort of 1,234 self‐reported Latino PD cases and 439,522 Latino controls from 23andMe, Inc. We also performed an admixture mapping analysis where local ancestry blocks were tested for association with PD status.


Results
One locus, SNCA, achieved genome‐wide significance (p‐value &amp;lt;5 × 10−8); rs356182 achieved genome‐wide significance in both the discovery and the replication cohorts (discovery, G allele: 1.58 OR, 95% CI 1.35–1.86, p‐value 2.48 × 10−8; 23andMe, G allele: 1.26 OR, 95% CI 1.16–1.37, p‐value 4.55 × 10−8). In our admixture mapping analysis, a locus on chromosome 14, containing the gene STXBP6, achieved significance in a joint test of ancestries and in the Native American single‐ancestry test (p‐value &amp;lt;5 × 10−5). A second locus on chromosome 6, containing the gene RPS6KA2, achieved significance in the African single‐ancestry test (p‐value &amp;lt;5 × 10−5).


Interpretation
This study demonstrated the importance of the SNCA locus for the etiology of PD in Latinos. By leveraging the demographic history of our cohort via admixture mapping, we identified two potential PD risk loci that merit further study. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Different generalization of fast and slow visuomotor adaptation across locomotion and pointing tasks</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06112-w</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Sensorimotor adaptation can involve multiple learning processes with different time courses, and these processes may have different patterns of transfer. In this study, we tested how slow learning and fast learning transfer across tasks, and the specificity of transfer. We tested two natural goal-directed tasks: pointing and walking toward a visible target. We also tested a novel “hand locomotion” task in which subjects used pointing movements to cause simulated self-motion in virtual reality. The hand locomotion task used the same physical movement as pointing, but performed the same function as stepping. During an experimental block, subjects performed alternating training trials with perturbed visual feedback and test trials with no feedback. The test trials were either the same task to measure adaptation, or a different task to measure transfer. Perturbations on adaptation trials varied over time as a sum of sinusoids with different frequencies. Fast learning would be expected to produce equal responses to fast and slow perturbations, while slower learning would dampen responses to higher frequency perturbations. Subjects were generally not aware of the smoothly varying perturbations, but showed detectable adaptation for all three tasks. Only pointing produced significantly different responses to high- and low-frequency perturbations, consistent with slow learning. Adaptation of pointing produced more transfer to the hand locomotion task, which shared the same effector and motor actions, than to the stepping task. The other tasks showed fast learning but little or no slow learning, and equal transfer to tasks with different effector or function. Our results suggest that the slower components of sensorimotor adaptation are more movement specific, while faster learning is more generalizable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Driving Oscillatory Dynamics: Neuromodulation for Recovery After Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.712664</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with limited treatments being available. However, advances in optic methods in neuroscience are providing new insights into the damaged brain and potential avenues for recovery. Direct brain stimulation has revealed close associations between mental states and neuroprotective processes in health and disease, and activity-dependent calcium indicators are being used to decode brain dynamics to understand the mechanisms underlying these associations. Evoked neural oscillations have recently shown the ability to restore and maintain intrinsic homeostatic processes in the brain and could be rapidly deployed during emergency care or shortly after admission into the clinic, making them a promising, non-invasive therapeutic option. We present an overview of the most relevant descriptions of brain injury after stroke, with a focus on disruptions to neural oscillations. We discuss the optical technologies that are currently used and lay out a roadmap for future studies needed to inform the next generation of strategies to promote functional recovery after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Perineuronal Net Receptor PTPσ Regulates Retention of Memories</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.672475</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Perineuronal nets (PNNs) have an important physiological role in the retention of learning by restricting cognitive flexibility. Their deposition peaks after developmental periods of intensive learning, usually in late childhood, and they help in long-term preservation of newly acquired skills and information. Modulation of PNN function by various techniques enhances plasticity and regulates the retention of memories, which may be beneficial when memory persistence entails negative symptoms such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this study, we investigated the role of PTPσ [receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase S, a phosphatase that is activated by binding of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) from PNNs] in retention of memories using Novel Object Recognition and Fear Conditioning models. We observed that mice haploinsufficient for PTPRS gene (PTPσ&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;), although having improved short-term object recognition memory, display impaired long-term memory in both Novel Object Recognition and Fear Conditioning paradigm, as compared to WT littermates. However, PTPσ&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice did not show any differences in behavioral tests that do not heavily rely on cognitive flexibility, such as Elevated Plus Maze, Open Field, Marble Burying, and Forced Swimming Test. Since PTPσ has been shown to interact with and dephosphorylate TRKB, we investigated activation of this receptor and its downstream pathways in limbic areas known to be associated with memory. We found that phosphorylation of TRKB and PLCγ are increased in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdaloid complex of PTPσ&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, but other TRKB-mediated signaling pathways are not affected. Our data suggest that PTPσ downregulation promotes TRKB phosphorylation in different brain areas, improves short-term memory performance but disrupts long-term memory retention in the tested animal models. Inhibition of PTPσ or disruption of PNN-PTPσ-TRKB complex might be a potential target for disorders where negative modulation of the acquired memories can be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Neonatal Maternal Separation Modifies Proteostasis Marker Expression in the Adult Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.661993</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to early-life stress (ELS) can persistently modify neuronal circuits and functions, and contribute to the expression of misfolded and aggregated proteins that are hallmarks of several neurodegenerative diseases. The healthy brain is able to clear dysfunctional proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). Accumulating evidence indicates that impairment of these pathways contributes to enhanced protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. While stress is a known precipitant of neurological decline, few specific mechanistic links underlying this relationship have been identified. We hypothesized that neonatal maternal separation (MatSep), a well-established model of ELS, has the ability to alter the levels of UPS and ALP components in the brain, and thus has the potential to disrupt proteostasis. The expression of proteostasis-associated protein markers was evaluated by immunoblotting in the hippocampus and cortex of adult Wistar rats that were previously subjected to MatSep. We observed multiple sex- and MatSep-specific changes in the expression of proteins in the ALP, mitophagy, and UPS pathways, particularly in the hippocampus of adult animals. In contrast, MatSep had limited influence on proteostasis marker expression in the cortex of adult animals. Our results indicate that MatSep can selectively modify the intracellular protein degradation machinery in ways that may impact the development and progression of neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.681021</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This article presents a versatile neurostimulation platform featuring a fully implantable multi-channel neural stimulator for chronic experimental studies with freely moving large animal models involving peripheral nerves. The implant is hermetically sealed in a ceramic enclosure and encapsulated in medical grade silicone rubber, and then underwent active tests at accelerated aging conditions at 100°C for 15 consecutive days. The stimulator microelectronics are implemented in a 0.6-μm CMOS technology, with a crosstalk reduction scheme to minimize cross-channel interference, and high-speed power and data telemetry for battery-less operation. A wearable transmitter equipped with a Bluetooth Low Energy radio link, and a custom graphical user interface provide real-time, remotely controlled stimulation. Three parallel stimulators provide independent stimulation on three channels, where each stimulator supports six stimulating sites and two return sites through multiplexing, hence the implant can facilitate stimulation at up to 36 different electrode pairs. The design of the electronics, method of hermetic packaging and electrical performance as well as in vitro testing with electrodes in saline are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Motor Responses of Lumbar Erector Spinae Induced by Electrical Vestibular Stimulation in Seated Participants</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.690433</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The study of motor responses induced by electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) may help clarify the role of the vestibular system in postural control. Although back muscles have an important role in postural control, their EVS-induced motor responses were rarely studied. Moreover, the effects of EVS parameters, head position, and vision on EVS-induced back muscles responses remain little explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To explore the effects of EVS parameters, head position, and vision on lumbar erector spinae muscles EVS-induced responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design: Exploratory, cross-sectional study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: Ten healthy participants were recruited. Three head positions (right, left and no head rotation), 4 intensities (2, 3, 4, 5 mA), and 4 EVS durations (5, 20, 100, 200 ms) were tested in sitting position with eyes open or closed. EVS usually induced a body sway toward the anode (placed on the right mastoid). EMG activity of the right lumbar erector spinae was recorded. Variables of interest were amplitude, occurrence, and latency of the EVS-induced modulation of the EMG activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The short-latency response was inhibitory and the medium-latency response was excitatory. Increased EVS current intensity augmented the occurrence and the amplitude of the short- and medium-latency responses (more inhibition and more excitation, respectively). EVS duration influenced the medium-latency response differently depending on the position of the head. Right head rotation produced larger responses amplitude and occurrence than left head rotation. Opposite head rotation (left vs. right) did not induce a reversal of the short- and medium-latency responses (i.e., the inhibition did not become an excitation), as typically reported in lower legs muscles. The eyes open condition did not modulate muscle responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Modulation of EVS parameters (current intensity and duration of EVS) affects the amplitude and occurrence of the lumbar erector spinae responses. In contrast, vision did not influence the responses, suggesting its minimal contribution to vestibulomotor control in sitting. The lack of response reversal in sagittal plane may reflect the biomechanical role of lumbar erector spinae to fine-tune the lumbar lordosis during the induced body sway. This hypothesis remains to be further tested.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Framework for Sensor-Based Assessment of Upper-Limb Functioning in Hemiparesis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.667509</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal of any upper-limb neurorehabilitation procedure is to improve upper-limb functioning in daily life. While clinic-based assessments provide an assessment of what a patient can do, they do not completely reflect what a patient does in his/her daily life. The use of compensatory strategies such as the use of the less affected upper-limb or excessive use of trunk in daily life is a common behavioral pattern seen in patients with hemiparesis. To this end, there has been an increasing interest in the use of wearable sensors to objectively assess upper-limb functioning. This paper presents a framework for assessing upper-limb functioning using sensors by providing: (a) a set of definitions of important constructs associated with upper-limb functioning; (b) different visualization methods for evaluating upper-limb functioning; and (c) two new measures for quantifying how much an upper-limb is used and the relative bias in their use. The demonstration of some of these components is presented using data collected from inertial measurement units from a previous study. The proposed framework can help guide the future technical and clinical work in this area to realize valid, objective, and robust tools for assessing upper-limb functioning. This will in turn drive the refinement and standardization of the assessment of upper-limb functioning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Gated Recurrent Units Viewed Through the Lens of Continuous Time Dynamical Systems</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.678158</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gated recurrent units (GRUs) are specialized memory elements for building recurrent neural networks. Despite their incredible success on various tasks, including extracting dynamics underlying neural data, little is understood about the specific dynamics representable in a GRU network. As a result, it is both difficult to know a priori how successful a GRU network will perform on a given task, and also their capacity to mimic the underlying behavior of their biological counterparts. Using a continuous time analysis, we gain intuition on the inner workings of GRU networks. We restrict our presentation to low dimensions, allowing for a comprehensive visualization. We found a surprisingly rich repertoire of dynamical features that includes stable limit cycles (nonlinear oscillations), multi-stable dynamics with various topologies, and homoclinic bifurcations. At the same time we were unable to train GRU networks to produce continuous attractors, which are hypothesized to exist in biological neural networks. We contextualize the usefulness of different kinds of observed dynamics and support our claims experimentally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Medial Septum and diagonal Band of Broca (MSDB) was initially studied for its role in locomotion. However, the last several decades were focussed on its intriguing function in theta rhythm generation. Early studies relied on electrical stimulation, lesions and pharmacological manipulation, and reported an inconclusive picture regarding the role of the MSDB circuits. Recent studies using more specific methodologies have started to elucidate the differential role of the MSDB’s specific cell populations in controlling both theta rhythm and behaviour. In particular, a novel theory is emerging showing that different MSDB’s cell populations project to different brain regions and control distinct aspects of behaviour. While the majority of these behaviours involve movement, increasing evidence suggests that MSDB-related networks govern the motivational aspect of actions, rather than locomotion per se. Here, we review the literature that links MSDB, theta activity, and locomotion and propose open questions, future directions, and methods that could be employed to elucidate the diverse roles of the MSDB-associated networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Membrane Resonance in Pyramidal and GABAergic Neurons of the Mouse Perirhinal Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.703407</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The perirhinal cortex (PRC) is a polymodal associative region of the temporal lobe that works as a gateway between cortical areas and hippocampus. In recent years, an increasing interest arose in the role played by the PRC in learning and memory processes, such as object recognition memory, in contrast with certain forms of hippocampus-dependent spatial and episodic memory. The integrative properties of the PRC should provide all necessary resources to select and enhance the information to be propagated to and from the hippocampus. Among these properties, we explore in this paper the ability of the PRC neurons to amplify the output voltage to current input at selected frequencies, known as membrane resonance. Within cerebral circuits the resonance of a neuron operates as a filter toward inputs signals at certain frequencies to coordinate network activity in the brain by affecting the rate of neuronal firing and the precision of spike timing. Furthermore, the ability of the PRC neurons to resonate could have a fundamental role in generating subthreshold oscillations and in the selection of cortical inputs directed to the hippocampus. Here, performing whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from perirhinal pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons of GAD67-GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mice, we found, for the first time, that the majority of PRC neurons are resonant at their resting potential, with a resonance frequency of 0.5–1.5 Hz at 23°C and of 1.5–2.8 Hz at 36°C. In the presence of ZD7288 (blocker of HCN channels) resonance was abolished in both pyramidal neurons and interneurons, suggesting that I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; current is critically involved in resonance generation. Otherwise, application of TTx (voltage-dependent Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel blocker) attenuates the resonance in pyramidal neurons but not in interneurons, suggesting that only in pyramidal neurons the persistent sodium current has an amplifying effect. These experimental results have also been confirmed by a computational model. From a functional point of view, the resonance in the PRC would affect the reverberating activity between neocortex and hippocampus, especially during slow wave sleep, and could be involved in the redistribution and strengthening of memory representation in cortical regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Inhibitory Effects of Palmatine on P2X7 Receptor Expression in Trigeminal Ganglion and Facial Pain in Trigeminal Neuralgia Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.672022</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN) refers to recurrent severe paroxysmal pain in the distribution area of the trigeminal nerve, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients. This research applied the chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerve (CCI—ION) approach to induce an animal model of TN in rats. The mechanical pain threshold of each group of rats was determined postoperatively; the expression of P2X7 receptor in trigeminal ganglion (TG) was assessed by qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence and Western blot; and the changes of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α in serum of rats were detected by ELISA. The results showed that the administration of palmatine in the TN rats could reduce the mechanical pain threshold, significantly decrease the expression of P2X7 receptor in TG, and lower the serum concentrations of IL-1β and TNF-α, compared to the sham group. In addition, the phosphorylation level of p38 in TG of TN rats was significantly decreased after treatment with palmatine. Likewise, inhibition of P2X7 expression by shRNA treatment could effectively counteract the adversary changes of pain sensitivity, IL-1β and TNF-α production, and p38 phosphorylation in TN rats. Our data suggest that palmatine may alleviate mechanical facial pain in TN rats possibly by reducing the expression of P2X7 receptor in TG of TN rats, which may be attributable to inhibiting p38 phosphorylation and reducing the release of IL-1β and TNF-α.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Progress of Label-Free Optical Imaging in Alzheimer’s Disease Screening and Diagnosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.699024</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the major neurodegenerative disease of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has caused an enormous social and economic burden on society. Currently, AD has neither clear pathogenesis nor effective treatments. Positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been verified as potential tools for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer’s disease. However, the high costs, low spatial resolution, and long acquisition time limit their broad clinical utilization. The gold standard of AD diagnosis routinely used in research is imaging AD biomarkers with dyes or other reagents, which are unsuitable for in vivo studies owing to their potential toxicity and prolonged and costly process of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for human use. Furthermore, these exogenous reagents might bring unwarranted interference to mechanistic studies, causing unreliable results. Several label-free optical imaging techniques, such as infrared spectroscopic imaging (IRSI), Raman spectroscopic imaging (RSI), optical coherence tomography (OCT), autofluorescence imaging (AFI), optical harmonic generation imaging (OHGI), etc., have been developed to circumvent this issue and made it possible to offer an accurate and detailed analysis of AD biomarkers. In this review, we present the emerging label-free optical imaging techniques and their applications in AD, along with their potential and challenges in AD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Can Control Infections Slow Down the Progression of Alzheimer’s Disease? Talking About the Role of Infections in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.685863</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease as the most common age-related dementia affects more than 40 million people in the world, representing a global public health priority. However, the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is complex, and it remains unclear. Over the past decades, all efforts made in the treatments of AD, with targeting the pathogenic amyloid β (Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles, and misfolded tau protein, were failed. Recently, many studies have hinted that infection, and chronic inflammation that caused by infection are crucial risk factors for AD development and progress. In the review, we analyzed the role of infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens in the pathogenesis of AD and its animal models, and explored the therapeutic possibility with anti-infections for AD. However, based on the published data, it is still difficult to determine their causal relationship between infection and AD due to contradictory results. We think that the role of infection in the pathogenesis of AD should not be ignored, even though infection does not necessarily cause AD, it may act as an accelerator in AD at least. It is essential to conduct the longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials in humans, which can determine the role of infection in AD and clarify the links between infection and the pathological features of AD. Finding targeting infection drugs and identifying the time window for applying antibacterial or antiviral intervention may be more promising for future clinical therapeutic strategies in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Visual Effect on Brain Connectome That Scales Feedforward and Feedback Processes of Aged Postural System During Unstable Stance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.679412</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Older adults with degenerative declines in sensory systems depend strongly on visual input for postural control. By connecting advanced neural imaging and a postural control model, this study investigated the visual effect on the brain functional network that regulates feedback and feedforward processes of the postural system in older adults under somatosensory perturbations. Thirty-six older adults conducted bilateral stance on a foam surface in the eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) conditions while their center of pressure (COP) and scalp EEG were recorded. The stochastic COP trajectory was modeled with non-linear stabilogram diffusion analysis (SDA) to characterize shifts in postural control in a continuum of feedback and feedforward processes. The EEG network was analyzed with the phase-lag index (PLI) and minimum spanning tree (MST). The results indicated that visual input rebalanced feedforward and feedback processes for postural sway, resulting in a greater critical point of displacement (CD), short-term effective diffusion coefficients (D&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) and short-term exponent (H&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;), but the smaller critical point of time (CT) and long-term exponent (H&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;) for the EC state. The EC network demonstrated stronger frontoparietal-occipital connectivity but weaker fronto-tempo-motor connectivity of the theta (4–7 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), and beta (13–35 Hz) bands than did the EO network. MST analysis revealed generally greater leaf fraction and maximal betweenness centrality (BC&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) and kappa of the EC network, as compared with those of the EO network. In contrast, the EC network exhibited a smaller diameter and average eccentricity than those of the EO network. The modulation of long-term negative feedback gain of the aged postural system with visual occlusion was positively correlated with leaf fraction, BC&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, and kappa, but negatively correlated with the diameter and average eccentricity for all EEG sub-bands. In conclusion, the aged brain functional network in older adults is tuned to visual information for modulating long-term negative feedback of the postural system under somatosensory perturbations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Dynamic Motor Control Index as a Marker of Age-Related Neuromuscular Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.678525</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Biomarkers that can identify age-related decline in walking function have potential to promote healthier aging by triggering timely interventions that can mitigate or reverse impairments. Recent evidence suggests that changes in neuromuscular control precede changes in walking function; however, it is unclear which measures are best suited for identifying age-related changes. In this study, non-negative matrix factorization of electromyography data collected during treadmill walking was used to calculate two measures of the complexity of muscle co-activations during walking for 36 adults: (1) the number of muscle synergies and (2) the dynamic motor control index. Study participants were grouped into young (18–35 years old), young-old (65–74 years old), and old–old (75+ years old) subsets. We found that the dynamic motor control index [χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(2) = 9.41, p = 0.009], and not the number of muscle synergies [χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(2) = 5.42, p = 0.067], differentiates between age groups [χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(4) = 10.62, p = 0.031, Nagelkerke R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.297]. Moreover, an impairment threshold set at a dynamic motor control index of 90 (i.e., one standard deviation below the young adults) was able to differentiate between age groups [χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(2) = 9.351, p = 0.009]. The dynamic motor control index identifies age-related differences in neuromuscular complexity not measured by the number of muscle synergies and may have clinical utility as a marker of neuromotor impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/71744</link>
	<content:encoded>Morphogen signaling proteins disperse across tissues to activate signal transduction in target cells. We investigated dispersion of Hedgehog (Hh), Wnt homolog Wingless (Wg), and Bone morphogenic protein homolog Decapentaplegic (Dpp) in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. We discovered that delivery of Hh, Wg, and Dpp to their respective targets is regulated. We found that &amp;lt;5% of Hh and &amp;lt;25% of Wg are taken up by disc cells and activate signaling. The amount of morphogen that is taken up and initiates signaling did not change when the level of morphogen expression was varied between 50-200% (Hh) or 50-350% (Wg). Similar properties were observed for Dpp. We analyzed an area of 150 mm x 150 mm that includes Hh-responding cells of the disc as well as overlying tracheal cells and myoblasts that are also activated by disc-produced Hh. We found that the extent of signaling in the disc was unaffected by the presence or absence of the tracheal and myoblast cells, suggesting that the mechanism that disperses Hh specifies its destinations to particular cells, and that target cells do not take up Hh from a common pool.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68955</link>
	<content:encoded>Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are trimeric cation-selective channels activated by decreases in extracellular pH. The intracellular N and C terminal tails of ASIC1 influence channel gating, trafficking, and signaling in ischemic cell death. Despite several x-ray and cryo-EM structures of the extracellular and transmembrane segments of ASIC1, these important intracellular tails remain unresolved. Here we describe the coarse topography of the chicken ASIC1 intracellular domains determined by FRET, measured using either fluorescent lifetime imaging or patch clamp fluorometry. We find the C terminal tail projects into the cytosol by approximately 35 Å and that the N and C tail from the same subunits are closer than adjacent subunits. Using pH-insensitive fluorescent proteins, we fail to detect any relative movement between the N and C tails upon extracellular acidification but do observe axial motions of the membrane proximal segments towards the plasma membrane. Taken together, our study furnishes a coarse topographic map of the ASIC intracellular domains while providing directionality and context to intracellular conformational changes induced by extracellular acidification.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68205</link>
	<content:encoded>GnRH neurons are the final central neural output regulating fertility. Kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (KNDy neurons) are considered the main regulator of GnRH output. GnRH and KNDy neurons are surrounded by astrocytes, which can modulate neuronal activity and communicate over distances. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), synthesized primarily by astrocytes, increases GnRH neuron activity and downstream pituitary release of luteinizing hormone (LH). We hypothesized GFAP-expressing astrocytes play a role regulating GnRH and/or KNDy neuron activity and LH release. We used adenoassociated viruses to target designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to GFAP-expressing cells to activate Gq or Gi-mediated signaling. Activating Gq signaling in the preoptic area, near GnRH neurons, but not in the arcuate, increases LH release &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and GnRH firing&lt;i&gt; in vitro&lt;/i&gt; via a mechanism in part dependent upon PGE2. These data suggest astrocytes can activate GnRH/LH release in a manner independent of KNDy neurons.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67158</link>
	<content:encoded>Immune challenges demand the gearing up of basal hematopoiesis to combat infection. Little is known about how during development, this switch is achieved to take care of the insult. Here, we show that the hematopoietic niche of the larval lymph gland of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; senses immune challenge and reacts to it quickly through the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), Relish, a component of the immune deficiency (Imd) pathway. During development, Relish is triggered by ecdysone signaling in the hematopoietic niche to maintain the blood progenitors. Loss of Relish causes an alteration in the cytoskeletal architecture of the niche cells in a Jun Kinase dependent manner, resulting in the trapping of Hh implicated in progenitor maintenance. Notably, during infection, downregulation of Relish in the niche tilts the maintenance program towards precocious differentiation, thereby bolstering the cellular arm of the immune response.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66186</link>
	<content:encoded>The ratio of microbial population size relative to the amount of host tissue, or 'microbial load', is a fundamental metric of colonization and infection, but it cannot be directly deduced from microbial amplicon data such as 16S rRNA gene counts. Because existing methods to determine load, such as serial dilution plating, quantitative PCR, and whole metagenome sequencing, add substantial cost and/or experimental burden, they are only rarely paired with amplicon sequencing. We introduce host-associated microbe PCR (hamPCR), a robust strategy to both quantify microbial load and describe interkingdom microbial community composition in a single amplicon library. We demonstrate its accuracy across multiple study systems, including nematodes and major crops, and further present a cost-saving technique to reduce host overrepresentation in the library prior to sequencing. Because hamPCR provides an accessible experimental solution to the well-known limitations and statistical challenges of compositional data, it has far-reaching potential in culture-independent microbiology.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Price equation captures the role of drug interactions and collateral effects in the evolution of multidrug resistance</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64851</link>
	<content:encoded>Bacterial adaptation to antibiotic combinations depends on the joint inhibitory effects of the two drugs (drug interaction, DI) and how resistance to one drug impacts resistance to the other (collateral effects, CE). Here we model these evolutionary dynamics on two-dimensional phenotype spaces that leverage scaling relations between the drug-response surfaces of drug sensitive (ancestral) and drug resistant (mutant) populations. We show that evolved resistance to the component drugs-and in turn, the adaptation of growth rate-is governed by a Price equation whose covariance terms encode geometric features of both the two-drug response surface (DI) in ancestral cells and the correlations between resistance levels to those drugs (CE). Within this framework, mean evolutionary trajectories reduce to a type of weighted gradient dynamics, with the drug interaction dictating the shape of the underlying landscape and the collateral effects constraining the motion on those landscapes. We also demonstrate how constraints on available mutational pathways can be incorporated into the framework, adding a third key driver of evolution. Our results clarify the complex relationship between drug interactions and collateral effects in multi-drug environments and illustrate how specific dosage combinations can shift the weighting of these two effects, leading to different and temporally-explicit selective outcomes.</content:encoded>

Biomarkers predict World Trade Center-Lung Injury (WTC-LI); however, there remains unaddressed multicollinearity in our serum cytokines, chemokines, and high-throughput platform datasets used to phenotype WTC-disease. To address this concern, we used automated, machine-learning, high-dimensional data pruning, and validated identified biomarkers. The parent cohort consisted of male, never-smoking firefighters with WTC-LI (FEV&lt;sub&gt;1, %Pred&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt; lower limit of normal (LLN); n = 100) and controls (n = 127) and had their biomarkers assessed. Cases and controls (n = 15/group) underwent untargeted metabolomics, then feature selection performed on metabolites, cytokines, chemokines, and clinical data. Cytokines, chemokines, and clinical biomarkers were validated in the non-overlapping parent-cohort via binary logistic regression with 5-fold cross validation. Random forests of metabolites (n = 580), clinical biomarkers (n = 5), and previously assayed cytokines, chemokines (n = 106) identified that the top 5% of biomarkers important to class separation included pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), macrophage derived chemokine (MDC), systolic blood pressure, macrophage inflammatory protein-4 (MIP-4), growth-regulated oncogene protein (GRO), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), apolipoprotein-AII (Apo-AII), cell membrane metabolites (sphingolipids, phospholipids), and branched-chain amino acids. Validated models via confounder-adjusted (age on 9/11, BMI, exposure, and pre-9/11 FEV&lt;sub&gt;1, %Pred&lt;/sub&gt;) binary logistic regression had AUC&lt;sub&gt;ROC&lt;/sub&gt; [0.90(0.84–0.96)]. Decreased PEDF and MIP-4, and increased Apo-AII were associated with increased odds of WTC-LI. Increased GRO, MCP-1, and simultaneously decreased MDC were associated with decreased odds of WTC-LI. In conclusion, automated data pruning identified novel WTC-LI biomarkers; performance was validated in an independent cohort. One biomarker—PEDF, an antiangiogenic agent—is a novel, predictive biomarker of particulate-matter-related lung disease.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Subicular caspase‐1 contributes to pharmacoresistance in temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26173?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Unidentified mechanisms largely restrict the viability of effective therapies in pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Our previous study revealed that hyperactivity of the subiculum is crucial for the genesis of pharmacoresistance in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but the underlying molecular mechanism is not clear.


Methods
Here, we examined the role of subicular caspase‐1, a key neural pro‐inflammatory enzyme, in pharmacoresistant TLE.


Results
We found that the expression of activated caspase‐1 in the subiculum, but not the CA1, was upregulated in pharmacoresistant amygdaloid‐kindled rats. Early overexpression of caspase‐1 in the subiculum was sufficient to induce pharmacoresistant TLE in rats, whereas genetic ablation of caspase‐1 interfered with the genesis of pharmacoresistant TLE in both kindled rats and kainic acid‐treated mice. The pro‐pharmacoresistance effect of subicular caspase‐1 was mediated by its downstream inflammasome‐dependent interleukin‐1β. Further electrophysiological results showed that inhibiting caspase‐1 decreased the excitability of subicular pyramidal neurons through influencing the excitation/inhibition balance of pre‐synaptic input. Importantly, a small‐molecular caspase‐1 inhibitor CZL80 attenuated seizures in pharmacoresistant TLE models, and decreased the neural excitability in the brain slices obtained from pharmacoresistant TLE patients.


Interpretation
These results support the subicular caspase‐1‐interleukin‐1β inflammatory pathway as a novel alternative mechanism hypothesis for pharmacoresistant TLE, and present caspase‐1 as a potential target.

In the current study, we investigated the transcriptome profile of CD4&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in patients with relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) at the relapse phase. We performed RNA sequencing of CD4&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells isolated from four relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) patients at the relapse phase and four age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The edgeR statistical method was employed to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene set enrichment analysis was subsequently performed. Applying a physical interaction network, genes with higher degrees were selected as hub genes. A total of 1278 and 1034 genes were defined at significantly higher or lower levels, respectively, in CD4&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells of RRMS patients at the relapse phase as compared with healthy controls. The top up- and downregulated genes were &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;JAML&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KDM3A.&lt;/em&gt; The detected DEGs were remarkable on chromosomes 1 and 2, respectively. The DEGs were mainly enriched in the pathways “regulation of transcription, DNA-templated,” “regulation of B cell receptor signaling pathway,” “protein phosphorylation,” “epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway,” and “positive regulation of neurogenesis.” Moreover, 16 KEGG pathways mostly associated with the immune system and viral infections were enriched. In the constructed physical interaction networks, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;UBA52&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TP53&lt;/em&gt; were shown to be the most highly ranked hub genes among upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively. By applying global transcriptome profiling of CD4&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, we deciphered the involvement of several novel genes and pathways in MS pathogenesis. The present results must be confirmed by in vivo and in vitro studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Encompassing live cell imaging and morphometrics at the microscopical level, we showed here, for the first time, protection of neuronal-like cells by the novel drug candidate, SKIP, against the Parkinson’s disease-related neurotoxin, rotenone. Mechanistically, rotenone disrupted microtubule dynamics, which SKIP partially repaired through microtubule end-binding proteins, coupled with increasing neurite branch length. Given the previous association of rotenone toxicity with increased dopaminergic cell death hallmarking Parkinson’s disease, we chose an established rat model of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) toxicity to initially evaluate SKIP in vivo. SKIP pretreatment showed protection against nigral dopaminergic cell degeneration and improved motor behavior in the forelimb asymmetry test. With Parkinson’s disease being a major neurodegenerative disorder, afflicting millions of people globally, and with disease modification challenges, SKIP may hold promise for future therapeutic development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Brain activity in the prefrontal cortex during a cancellation task: effects of the target-to-distractor ratio</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cancellation tasks have been widely used to neurologically assess selective attention and visual search in various clinical and research settings. However, there is still a lack of evidence regarding the effect of the level of task difficulty on brain activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This study implemented cancellation tasks to investigate the effects of varying task difficulty on oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentrations. Data from 21 healthy adults were analyzed based on performance during three-block-design types of cancellation tasks with different T/D ratios (i.e., 1/9, 2/8, and 3/7). Performance was assessed via the number of correct responses, incorrect responses, hit ratios, achievement ratios, and performance scores (PS), while PFC activity was examined using near-infrared spectroscopy. Both the numbers of correct responses and PS were the lowest for the smallest &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;D&lt;/em&gt; ratio. Similarly, we observed that the oxy-Hb concentration in the PFC was significantly increased during the task. Our results support the findings of previous studies that used conventional cancellation tasks, thus suggesting that block design types are suitable for examinations in the same contexts. Regarding the above-mentioned changes in the oxy-Hb concentration, the findings suggest that the PFC region is involved in selective attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Differences in Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Pathology Among African American and Hispanic Women: A Qualitative Literature Review of Biomarker Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.685957</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;The population of older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) is growing larger and more diverse. Prevalence of ADRD is higher in African American (AA) and Hispanic populations relative to non-Hispanic whites (nHW), with larger differences for women compared to men of the same race. Given the public health importance of this issue, we sought to determine if AA and Hispanic women exhibit worse ADRD pathology compared to men of the same race and nHW women. We hypothesized that such differences may explain the discrepancy in ADRD prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We evaluated 932 articles that measured at least one of the following biomarkers of ADRD pathology in vivo and/or post-mortem: beta-amyloid (Aß), tau, neurodegeneration, and cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). Criteria for inclusion were: (1) mean age of participants &amp;gt;65 years; (2) inclusion of nHW participants and either AA or Hispanics or both; (3) direct comparison of ADRD pathology between racial groups.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We included 26 articles (Aß = 9, tau = 6, neurodegeneration = 16, cSVD = 18), with seven including sex-by-race comparisons. Studies differed by sampling source (e.g., clinic or population), multivariable analytical approach (e.g., adjusted for risk factors for AD), and cognitive status of participants. Aß burden did not differ by race or sex. Tau differed by race (AA &amp;lt; nHW), and by sex (women &amp;gt; men). Both severity of neurodegeneration and cSVD differed by race (AA &amp;gt; nHW; Hispanics &amp;lt; nHW) and sex (women &amp;lt; men). Among the studies that tested sex-by-race interactions, results were not significant.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Few studies have examined the burden of ADRD pathology by both race and sex. The higher prevalence of ADRD in women compared to men of the same race may be due to both higher tau load and more vulnerability to cognitive decline in the presence of similar Aß and cSVD burden. AA women may also exhibit more neurodegeneration and cSVD relative to nHW populations. Studies suggest that between-group differences in ADRD pathology are complex, but they are too sparse to completely explain why minority women have the highest ADRD prevalence. Future work should recruit diverse cohorts, compare ADRD biomarkers by both race and sex, and collect relevant risk factor and cognitive data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Presence of Vessel Wall Hyperintensity in Unruptured Arteriovenous Malformations on Vessel Wall Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Pilot Study of AVM Vessel Wall “Enhancement”</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.697432</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: High-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (VW-MRI) could provide a way to identify high risk arteriovenous malformation (AVM) features. We present the first pilot study of clinically unruptured AVMs evaluated by high-resolution VW-MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A retrospective review of clinically unruptured AVMs with VW-MRI between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018 was performed documenting the presence or absence of vessel wall “hyperintensity,” or enhancement, within the nidus as well as perivascular enhancement and evidence of old hemorrhage (EOOH). The extent of nidal vessel wall “hyperintensity” was approximated into five groups: 0, 1–25, 26–50, 51–75, and 76–100%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Of the nine cases, eight demonstrated at least some degree of vessel wall nidus “hyperintensity.” Of those eight cases, four demonstrated greater than 50% of the nidus with hyperintensity at the vessel wall, and three cases had perivascular enhancement adjacent to nidal vessels. Although none of the subjects had prior clinical hemorrhage/AVM rupture, of the six patients with available susceptibility weighted imaging to assess for remote hemorrhage, only two had subtle siderosis to suggest prior sub-clinical bleeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Vessel wall “enhancement” occurs in AVMs with no prior clinical rupture. Additional studies are needed to further investigate the implication of these findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effect of Social Distance on Intertemporal Choice of Reward Processing: An Event-Related Potentials Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.712194</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social factors can affect the processing of intertemporal choice, but the influence of social distance on the rewarding process of intertemporal choice is unclear. Therefore, by designing a novel cognitive resource competition paradigm for undifferentiated intertemporal choice, this article aims to explore the influence of social distance on intertemporal choice reward processing at the electrophysiological level. It was found that compared with the stranger condition, P3a is greater in the friend condition, which means social distance is evaluated in the early stage. In addition, different brain regions in the early stages are taking charge of processing the soon-but-small (SS) and later-but-lager (LL) reward in intertemporal choice. There is an interaction effect between social distance (friend vs. stranger) and intertemporal choice (SS reward vs. LL reward) on P3b. Under friend conditions, the P3b induced by LL reward is more positive than SS reward. Under the condition of choosing the LL reward, the P3b induced by friend is more positive than stranger. This result shows that in the latter stage of reward processing, the evaluation process of time discounting is less sensitive in LL reward for friend caused by lack of cognitive resources which is occupied when dealing with social distance in advance, and thus the degree of time discount was reduced. These findings demonstrate that P3b is the key index of time discounting and immediate and delayed rewards are valued in different brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: In Patients With Parkinson’s Disease in an OFF-Medication State, Does Bilateral Electrostimulation of Tibialis Anterior Improve Anticipatory Postural Adjustments During Gait Initiation?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.692651</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A complete lack of bilateral activation of tibialis anterior (TA) during gait initiation (GI), along with bradykinetic anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs), often occurs in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) in their OFF-medication state. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a non-pharmacological method frequently used in neurorehabilitation to optimize the effect of L-DOPA on locomotor function in this population. The present study tested the potential of bilateral application of FES on TA to improve GI in PD patients. Fourteen PD patients (OFF-medication state, Hoehn and Yahr state 2-3) participated in this study. They performed series of 10 GI trials on a force-plate under the following experimental conditions: (1) GI without FES (control group), (2) GI with 2Hz-FES (considered as a very low FES frequency condition without biomechanical effect; placebo group) and (3) GI with 40Hz-FES (test group). In (2) and (3), FES was applied bilaterally to the TA during APAs (300 mA intensity/300 μs pulse width). Main results showed that the peak of anticipatory backward center of pressure shift, the forward center of mass (COM) velocity and shift at foot off were significantly larger in the 40 Hz FES condition than in the control condition, while the duration of step execution was significantly shorter. In contrast, the capacity of participants to brake the fall of their COM remained unchanged across conditions. Globally taken, these results suggest that acute application of 40-Hz FES to the TA may improve the capacity of PD patients to generate APAs during GI, without altering their balance capacity. Future studies are required before considering that TA FES application might be a valuable tool to improve GI in PD patients and be relevant to optimize the effects of L-DOPA medication on locomotor function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Real-time gaze tracking provides crucial input to psychophysics studies and neuromarketing applications. Many of the modern eye-tracking solutions are expensive mainly due to the high-end processing hardware specialized for processing infrared-camera pictures. Here, we introduce a deep learning-based approach which uses the video frames of low-cost web cameras. Using DeepLabCut (DLC), an open-source toolbox for extracting points of interest from videos, we obtained facial landmarks critical to gaze location and estimated the point of gaze on a computer screen via a shallow neural network. Tested for three extreme poses, this architecture reached a median error of about one degree of visual angle. Our results contribute to the growing field of deep-learning approaches to eye-tracking, laying the foundation for further investigation by researchers in psychophysics or neuromarketing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: From Visual Perception to Aesthetic Appeal: Brain Responses to Aesthetically Appealing Natural Landscape Movies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.676032</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;During aesthetically appealing visual experiences, visual content provides a basis for computation of affectively tinged representations of aesthetic value. How this happens in the brain is largely unexplored. Using engaging video clips of natural landscapes, we tested whether cortical regions that respond to perceptual aspects of an environment (e.g., spatial layout, object content and motion) were directly modulated by rated aesthetic appeal. Twenty-four participants watched a series of videos of natural landscapes while being scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and reported both continuous ratings of enjoyment (during the videos) and overall aesthetic judgments (after each video). Although landscape videos engaged a greater expanse of high-level visual cortex compared to that observed for images of landscapes, independently localized category-selective visual regions (e.g., scene-selective parahippocampal place area and motion-selective hMT+) were not significantly modulated by aesthetic appeal. Rather, a whole-brain analysis revealed modulations by aesthetic appeal in ventral (collateral sulcus) and lateral (middle occipital sulcus, posterior middle temporal gyrus) clusters that were adjacent to scene and motion selective regions. These findings suggest that aesthetic appeal per se is not represented in well-characterized feature- and category-selective regions of visual cortex. Rather, we propose that the observed activations reflect a local transformation from a feature-based visual representation to a representation of “elemental affect,” computed through information-processing mechanisms that detect deviations from an observer’s expectations. Furthermore, we found modulation by aesthetic appeal in subcortical reward structures but not in regions of the default-mode network (DMN) nor orbitofrontal cortex, and only weak evidence for associated changes in functional connectivity. In contrast to other visual aesthetic domains, aesthetically appealing interactions with natural landscapes may rely more heavily on comparisons between ongoing stimulation and well-formed representations of the natural world, and less on top-down processes for resolving ambiguities or assessing self-relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Learning Invariant Object and Spatial View Representations in the Brain Using Slow Unsupervised Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.686239</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;First, neurophysiological evidence for the learning of invariant representations in the inferior temporal visual cortex is described. This includes object and face representations with invariance for position, size, lighting, view and morphological transforms in the temporal lobe visual cortex; global object motion in the cortex in the superior temporal sulcus; and spatial view representations in the hippocampus that are invariant with respect to eye position, head direction, and place. Second, computational mechanisms that enable the brain to learn these invariant representations are proposed. For the ventral visual system, one key adaptation is the use of information available in the statistics of the environment in slow unsupervised learning to learn transform-invariant representations of objects. This contrasts with deep supervised learning in artificial neural networks, which uses training with thousands of exemplars forced into different categories by neuronal teachers. Similar slow learning principles apply to the learning of global object motion in the dorsal visual system leading to the cortex in the superior temporal sulcus. The learning rule that has been explored in VisNet is an associative rule with a short-term memory trace. The feed-forward architecture has four stages, with convergence from stage to stage. This type of slow learning is implemented in the brain in hierarchically organized competitive neuronal networks with convergence from stage to stage, with only 4-5 stages in the hierarchy. Slow learning is also shown to help the learning of coordinate transforms using gain modulation in the dorsal visual system extending into the parietal cortex and retrosplenial cortex. Representations are learned that are in allocentric spatial view coordinates of locations in the world and that are independent of eye position, head direction, and the place where the individual is located. This enables hippocampal spatial view cells to use idiothetic, self-motion, signals for navigation when the view details are obscured for short periods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Circuit Organization Underlying Optic Flow Processing in Zebrafish</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.709048</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animals’ self-motion generates a drifting movement of the visual scene in the entire field of view called optic flow. Animals use the sensation of optic flow to estimate their own movements and accordingly adjust their body posture and position and stabilize the direction of gaze. In zebrafish and other vertebrates, optic flow typically drives the optokinetic response (OKR) and optomotor response (OMR). Recent functional imaging studies in larval zebrafish have identified the pretectum as a primary center for optic flow processing. In contrast to the view that the pretectum acts as a relay station of direction-selective retinal inputs, pretectal neurons respond to much more complex visual features relevant to behavior, such as spatially and temporally integrated optic flow information. Furthermore, optic flow signals, as well as motor signals, are represented in the cerebellum in a region-specific manner. Here we review recent findings on the circuit organization that underlies the optic flow processing driving OKR and OMR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.696060</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) extends the duration over which information is available for processing. Given its importance in supporting a wide-array of high level cognitive abilities, uncovering the neural mechanisms that underlie WM has been a primary goal of neuroscience research over the past century. Here, we critically review what we consider the two major “arcs” of inquiry, with a specific focus on findings that were theoretically transformative. For the first arc, we briefly review classic studies that led to the canonical WM theory that cast the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as a central player utilizing persistent activity of neurons as a mechanism for memory storage. We then consider recent challenges to the theory regarding the role of persistent neural activity. The second arc, which evolved over the last decade, stemmed from sophisticated computational neuroimaging approaches enabling researchers to decode the contents of WM from the patterns of neural activity in many parts of the brain including early visual cortex. We summarize key findings from these studies, their implications for WM theory, and finally the challenges these findings pose. Our goal in doing so is to identify barriers to developing a comprehensive theory of WM that will require a unification of these two “arcs” of research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Murine GRXCR1 Has a Different Function Than GRXCR2 in the Morphogenesis of Stereocilia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.714070</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in human glutaredoxin domain-containing cysteine-rich protein 1 (GRXCR1) and its paralog GRXCR2 have been linked to hearing loss in humans. Although both GRXCR1 and GRXCR2 are required for the morphogenesis of stereocilia in cochlear hair cells, a fundamental question that remains unclear is whether GRXCR1 and GRXCR2 have similar functions in hair cells. Previously, we found that GRXCR2 is critical for the stereocilia morphogenesis by regulating taperin localization at the base of stereocilia. Reducing taperin expression level rescues the morphological defects of stereocilia and hearing loss in Grxcr2-deficient mice. So far, functions of GRXCR1 in mammalian hair cells are still unclear. Grxcr1-deficient hair cells have very thin stereocilia with less F-actin content inside, which is different from Grxcr2-deficient hair cells. In contrast to GRXCR2, which is concentrated at the base of stereocilia, GRXCR1 is diffusely distributed throughout the stereocilia. Notably, GRXCR1 interacts with GRXCR2. In Grxcr1-deficient hair cells, the expression level of GRXCR2 and taperin is reduced. Remarkably, different from that in Grxcr2-deficient mice, reducing taperin expression level does not rescue the morphological defects of stereocilia or hearing loss in Grxcr1-deficient mice. Thus, our findings suggest that GRXCR1 has different functions than GRXCR2 during the morphogenesis of stereocilia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.712545</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background and Objective: Plasma biomarkers for the diagnosis and stratification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are intensively sought. However, no plasma markers are well established so far for AD diagnosis. Our group has identified and validated various blood-based proteomic biomarkers relating to AD pathology in multiple cohorts. The study aims to conduct a meta-analysis based on our own studies to systematically assess the diagnostic performance of our previously identified blood biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: To do this, we included seven studies that our group has conducted during the last decade. These studies used either Luminex xMAP or ELISA to measure proteomic biomarkers. As proteins measured in these studies differed, we selected protein based on the criteria that it must be measured in at least four studies. We then examined biomarker performance using random-effect meta-analyses based on the mean difference between biomarker concentrations in AD and controls (CTL), AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), MCI, and CTL as well as MCI converted to dementia (MCIc) and non-converted (MCInc) individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: An overall of 2,879 subjects were retrieved for meta-analysis including 1,053 CTL, 895 MCI, 882 AD, and 49 frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients. Six proteins were measured in at least four studies and were chosen for meta-analyses for AD diagnosis. Of them, three proteins had significant difference between AD and controls, among which alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) and ficolin-2 (FCN2) increased in AD while fibrinogen gamma chain (FGG) decreased in AD compared to CTL. Furthermore, FGG significantly increased in FTD compared to AD. None of the proteins passed the significance between AD and MCI, or MCI and CTL, or MCIc and MCInc, although complement component 4 (CC4) tended to increase in MCIc individuals compared to MCInc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The results suggest that A2M, FCN2, and FGG are promising biomarkers to discriminate AD patients from controls, which are worthy of further validation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: A Novel Probable Pathogenic PSEN2 Mutation p.Phe369Ser Associated With Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease in a Chinese Han Family: A Case Report</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.710075</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is complex, and early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) is mostly influenced by genetic factors. Presenilin-1, presenilin-2 (PSEN2), and amyloid precursor protein are currently known as the three main causative genes for autosomal dominant EOAD, with the PSEN2 mutation being the rarest. In this study, we reported a 56-year-old Chinese Han proband who presented with prominent progressive amnesia, aphasia, executive function impairment, and depression 5 years ago. The 3-year follow-up showed that the patient experienced progressive brain atrophy displayed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dramatic cognitive decline assessed by neuropsychological evaluation. This patient was clinically diagnosed as EOAD based on established criteria. A heterozygous variant (NM_000447.2: c.1106T&amp;gt;C) of PSEN2 was identified for the first time in this patient and her two daughters. This mutation causing a novel missense mutation (p.Phe369Ser) in transmembrane domain 7 encoded by exon 11 had not been reported previously in 1000Genomes, ExAC, or ClinVar databases. This mutation was predicted by four in silico prediction programs, which all strongly suggested that it was damaging. Our results suggest that this novel PSEN2 Phe369Ser mutation may alter PSEN2 protein function and associate with EOAD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: WS635 Attenuates the Anesthesia/Surgery-Induced Cognitive Impairment in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.688587</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anesthesia/surgery has been reported to be associated with perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) in patients and induces cognitive impairment in mice. Previous studies demonstrate cyclosporine A (CsA) attenuates the anesthesia/surgery-induced cognitive impairment in mice. However, CsA has immunosuppressive effects and may not be routinely used to prevent or treat PND in patients. WS635 is a nonimmunosuppressive CsA analog. We, therefore, set out to determine whether WS635 could mitigate the anesthesia/surgery-induced cognitive impairment in mice. We performed abdominal surgery under 1.4% isoflurane anesthesia (anesthesia/surgery) for 2 h in 9 month-old wild-type (WT) mice. We treated the mice with CsA (10 mg/kg) or different doses (13.2 mg/kg, 26.4 mg/kg and 52.8 mg/kg) of WS635 before and after the anesthesia/surgery. Barnes maze and fear conditioning system (FCS) were employed to evaluate the cognitive function in mice. We measured the amounts of postsynaptic density (PSD)-95, synaptophysin, and ATP in the hippocampus and cortex of the mice using western blot and ATP Colorimetric/Fluorometric Assay, respectively. We found that the treatment with 52.8 mg/kg, but not 13.2 mg/kg or 26.4 mg/kg, of WS635 attenuated the anesthesia/surgery-induced cognitive impairment in mice and the reductions in the amounts of PSD-95, synaptophysin, and ATP in the mice brain tissues. These results have established a system to study WS635 further and suggest that we need to perform more experiments to determine whether WS635 can ultimately be used as one of the interventions for PND in patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Alterations of Regional Homogeneity in the Mild and Moderate Stages of Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.676899</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: This study aimed to investigate alterations in regional homogeneity (ReHo) in early Parkinson’s disease (PD) at different Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stages and to demonstrate the relationships between altered brain regions and clinical scale scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We recruited 75 PD patients, including 43 with mild PD (PD-mild; HY stage: 1.0–1.5) and 32 with moderate PD (PD-moderate; HY stage: 2.0–2.5). We also recruited 37 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects as healthy controls (HC). All subjects underwent neuropsychological assessments and a 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance scanning. Regional homogeneity of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals was used to characterize regional cerebral function. Correlative relationships between mean ReHo values and clinical data were then explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared to the HC group, the PD-mild group exhibited increased ReHo values in the right cerebellum, while the PD-moderate group exhibited increased ReHo values in the bilateral cerebellum, and decreased ReHo values in the right superior temporal gyrus, the right Rolandic operculum, the right postcentral gyrus, and the right precentral gyrus. Reho value of right Pre/Postcentral was negatively correlated with HY stage. Compared to the PD-moderate group, the PD-mild group showed reduced ReHo values in the right superior orbital gyrus and the right rectus, in which the ReHo value was negatively correlated with cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The right superior orbital gyrus and right rectus may serve as a differential indicator for mild and moderate PD. Subjects with moderate PD had a greater scope for ReHo alterations in the cortex and compensation in the cerebellum than those with mild PD. PD at HY stages of 2.0–2.5 may already be classified as Braak stages 5 and 6 in terms of pathology. Our study revealed the different patterns of brain function in a resting state in PD at different HY stages and may help to elucidate the neural function and early diagnosis of patients with PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Effect of malaria parasite shape on its alignment at erythrocyte membrane</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68818</link>
	<content:encoded>During the blood stage of malaria pathogenesis, parasites invade healthy red blood cells (RBC) to multiply inside the host and evade the immune response. When attached to RBC, the parasite first has to align its apex with the membrane for a successful invasion. Since the parasite's apex sits at the pointed end of an oval (egg-like) shape with a large local curvature, apical alignment is in general an energetically un-favorable process. Previously, using coarse-grained mesoscopic simulations, we have shown that optimal alignment time is achieved due to RBC membrane deformation and the stochastic nature of bond-based interactions between the parasite and RBC membrane (&lt;i&gt;Hillringhaus et al., 2020&lt;/i&gt;). Here, we demonstrate that the parasite's shape has a prominent effect on the alignment process. The alignment times of spherical parasites for intermediate and large bond off-rates (or weak membrane-parasite interactions) are found to be close to those of an egg-like shape. However, for small bond off-rates (or strong adhesion and large membrane deformations), the alignment time for a spherical shape increases drastically. Parasite shapes with large aspect ratios such as oblate and long prolate ellipsoids are found to exhibit very long alignment times in comparison to the egg-like shape. At a stiffened RBC, spherical parasite aligns faster than any other investigated shapes. This study shows that the original egg-like shape performs not worse for parasite alignment than other considered shapes, but is more robust with respect to different adhesion interactions and RBC membrane rigidities.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Pioneer neutrophils release chromatin within in vivo swarms</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68755</link>
	<content:encoded>Neutrophils are rapidly recruited to inflammatory sites where their coordinated migration forms clusters, a process termed neutrophil swarming. The factors that modulate early stages of neutrophil swarming are not fully understood, requiring the development of new in vivo models. Using transgenic zebrafish larvae to study endogenous neutrophil migration in a tissue damage model, we demonstrate that neutrophil swarming is a conserved process in zebrafish immunity, sharing essential features with mammalian systems. We show that neutrophil swarms initially develop around an individual pioneer neutrophil. We observed the violent release of extracellular cytoplasmic and nuclear fragments by the pioneer and early swarming neutrophils. By combining in vitro and in vivo approaches to study essential components of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), we provide in-depth characterisation and high-resolution imaging of the composition and morphology of these release events. Using a photoconversion approach to track neutrophils within developing swarms, we identify that the fate of swarm-initiating pioneer neutrophils involves extracellular chromatin release and that the key NET components gasdermin, neutrophil elastase, and myeloperoxidase are required for the swarming process. Together our findings demonstrate that release of cellular components by pioneer neutrophils is an initial step in neutrophil swarming at sites of tissue injury.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Two NLR immune receptors acquired high-affinity binding to a fungal effector through convergent evolution of their integrated domain</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66961</link>
	<content:encoded>A subset of plant NLR immune receptors carry unconventional integrated domains in addition to their canonical domain architecture. One example is rice Pik-1 that comprises an integrated heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain. Here, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of Pik-1 and its NLR partner, Pik-2, and tested hypotheses about adaptive evolution of the HMA domain. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the HMA domain integrated into Pik-1 before Oryzinae speciation over 15 million years ago and has been under diversifying selection. Ancestral sequence reconstruction coupled with functional studies showed that two Pik-1 allelic variants independently evolved from a weakly binding ancestral state to high-affinity binding of the blast fungus effector AVR-PikD. We conclude that for most of its evolutionary history the Pik-1 HMA domain did not sense AVR-PikD, and that different Pik-1 receptors have recently evolved through distinct biochemical paths to produce similar phenotypic outcomes. These findings highlight the dynamic nature of the evolutionary mechanisms underpinning NLR adaptation to plant pathogens.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Image-based cell classification has become a common tool to identify phenotypic changes in cell populations. However, this methodology is limited to organisms possessing well characterized species-specific reagents (e.g., antibodies) that allow cell identification, clustering and convolutional neural network (CNN) training. In the absence of such reagents, the power of image-based classification has remained mostly off-limits to many research organisms. We have developed an image-based classification methodology we named Image3C (Image-Cytometry Cell Classification) that does not require species-specific reagents nor pre-existing knowledge about the sample. Image3C combines image-based flow cytometry with an unbiased, high-throughput cell cluster pipeline and CNN integration. Image3C exploits intrinsic cellular features and non-species-specific dyes to perform &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; cell composition analysis and to detect changes in cellular composition between different conditions. Therefore, Image3C expands the use of imaged-based analyses of cell population composition to research organisms in which detailed cellular phenotypes are unknown or for which species-specific reagents are not available.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Spinal Fluid Myeloid Microvesicles Predict Disease Course in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26154?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
In vivo measures of myeloid activity are promising biomarkers in multiple sclerosis. We previously demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) myeloid microvesicles are markers of microglial/macrophage activity and neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis. Here, we aimed at investigating the diagnostic and prognostic value of myeloid microvesicles in a clinical setting.


Methods
Six hundred one patients discharged with a diagnosis of neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, or no neurological disease were enrolled. Myeloid microvesicles were measured with flow cytometry as isolectin B4–positive events in fresh CSF. Clinical, demographical, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected at diagnosis (all patients) and during follow‐up (n = 176).


Results
CSF myeloid microvesicles were elevated in neuroinflammatory patients compared to the neurodegenerative and control groups. In multiple sclerosis, microvesicles were higher in patients with MRI disease activity and their concentration increased along with the number of enhancing lesions (p &amp;lt; 0.0001, Jonckheere–Terpstra test). CSF myeloid microvesicles were also higher in patients with higher disease activity in the month and year preceding diagnosis. Microvesicles excellently discriminated between the relapsing–remitting and control groups (receiver operator characteristic curve, area under the curve = 0.939, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and between radiologically isolated syndrome and unspecific brain lesions (0.942, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, microvesicles were independent predictors of prognosis for both the relapsing–remitting and progressive groups. Microvesicles independently predicted future disease activity in relapsing–remitting patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.967, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.147–3.372), correcting for prognostic factors of standard clinical use. In the progressive group, microvesicles were independent predictors of disability accrual (HR = 10.767, 95% CI = 1.335–86.812).


Interpretation
Our results confirm that CSF myeloid microvesicles are a clinically meaningful biomarker of neuroinflammation and microglial/macrophage activity in vivo. These findings may support a possible use in clinical practice during diagnostic workup and prognostic assessment. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

The large amount of biological data available in the current times, makes it necessary to use tools and applications based on sophisticated and efficient algorithms, developed in the area of bioinformatics. Further, access to high performance computing resources is necessary, to achieve results in reasonable time. To speed up applications and utilize available compute resources as efficient as possible, software developers make use of parallelization mechanisms, like multithreading. Many of the available tools in bioinformatics offer multithreading capabilities, but more compute power is not always helpful. In this study we investigated the behavior of well-known applications in bioinformatics, regarding their performance in the terms of scaling, different virtual environments and different datasets with our benchmarking tool suite &lt;i&gt;BOOTABLE&lt;/i&gt;. The tool suite includes the tools BBMap, Bowtie2, BWA, Velvet, IDBA, SPAdes, Clustal Omega, MAFFT, SINA and GROMACS. In addition we added an application using the machine learning framework TensorFlow. Machine learning is not directly part of bioinformatics but applied to many biological problems, especially in the context of medical images (X-ray photographs). The mentioned tools have been analyzed in two different virtual environments, a virtual machine environment based on the OpenStack cloud software and in a Docker environment. The gained performance values were compared to a bare-metal setup and among each other. The study reveals, that the used virtual environments produce an overhead in the range of seven to twenty-five percent compared to the bare-metal environment. The scaling measurements showed, that some of the analyzed tools do not benefit from using larger amounts of computing resources, whereas others showed an almost linear scaling behavior. The findings of this study have been generalized as far as possible and should help users to find the best amount of resources for their analysis. Further, the results provide valuable information for resource providers to handle their resources as efficiently as possible and raise the user community’s awareness of the efficient usage of computing resources.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_4bSupx46co&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

During the last ten years, many research results have been referring to a particular type of cancer-associated fibroblasts associated with poor prognosis, invasiveness, metastasis and resistance to therapy in multiple cancer types, characterized by a gene expression signature with prominent presence of genes &lt;i&gt;COL11A1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;THBS2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;INHBA&lt;/i&gt;. Identifying the underlying biological mechanisms responsible for their creation may facilitate the discovery of targets for potential pan-cancer therapeutics. Using a novel computational approach for single-cell gene expression data analysis identifying the dominant cell populations in a sequence of samples from patients at various stages, we conclude that these fibroblasts are produced by a pan-cancer cellular transition originating from a particular type of adipose-derived stromal cells naturally present in the stromal vascular fraction of normal adipose tissue, having a characteristic gene expression signature. Focusing on a rich pancreatic cancer dataset, we provide a detailed description of the continuous modification of the gene expression profiles of cells as they transition from &lt;i&gt;APOD&lt;/i&gt;-expressing adipose-derived stromal cells to &lt;i&gt;COL11A1&lt;/i&gt;-expressing cancer-associated fibroblasts, identifying the key genes that participate in this transition. These results also provide an explanation to the well-known fact that the adipose microenvironment contributes to cancer progression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VhUzYU5cl9M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Rigid-body fitting to atomic force microscopy images for inferring probe shape and biomolecular structure</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Tj9nVviV8-Q/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Toru Niina, Yasuhiro Matsunaga, Shoji Takada&lt;/p&gt;

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) can visualize functional biomolecules near the physiological condition, but the observed data are limited to the surface height of specimens. Since the AFM images highly depend on the probe tip shape, for successful inference of molecular structures from the measurement, the knowledge of the probe shape is required, but is often missing. Here, we developed a method of the rigid-body fitting to AFM images, which simultaneously finds the shape of the probe tip and the placement of the molecular structure via an exhaustive search. First, we examined four similarity scores via twin-experiments for four test proteins, finding that the cosine similarity score generally worked best, whereas the pixel-RMSD and the correlation coefficient were also useful. We then applied the method to two experimental high-speed-AFM images inferring the probe shape and the molecular placement. The results suggest that the appropriate similarity score can differ between target systems. For an actin filament image, the cosine similarity apparently worked best. For an image of the flagellar protein FlhA&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;, we found the correlation coefficient gave better results. This difference may partly be attributed to the flexibility in the target molecule, ignored in the rigid-body fitting. The inferred tip shape and placement results can be further refined by other methods, such as the flexible fitting molecular dynamics simulations. The developed software is publicly available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Tj9nVviV8-Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We explore the spatial and temporal spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus under containment measures in three European countries based on fits to data of the early outbreak. Using data from Spain and Italy, we estimate an age dependent infection fatality ratio for SARS-CoV-2, as well as risks of hospitalization and intensive care admission. We use them in a model that simulates the dynamics of the virus using an age structured, spatially detailed agent based approach, that explicitly incorporates governmental interventions and changes in mobility and contact patterns occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak in each country. Our simulations reproduce several of the features of its spatio-temporal spread in the three countries studied. They show that containment measures combined with high density are responsible for the containment of cases within densely populated areas, and that spread to less densely populated areas occurred during the late stages of the first wave. The capability to reproduce observed features of the spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 makes this model a potential candidate for forecasting the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in other settings, and we recommend its application in low and lower-middle income countries which remain understudied.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SmEVa-s5yXI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Victor I. Band, David S. Weiss&lt;/p&gt;

Antibiotic resistance is a growing crisis that threatens many aspects of modern healthcare. Dogma is that resistance often develops due to acquisition of a resistance gene or mutation and that when this occurs, all the cells in the bacterial population are phenotypically resistant. In contrast, heteroresistance (HR) is a form of antibiotic resistance where only a subset of cells within a bacterial population are resistant to a given drug. These resistant cells can rapidly replicate in the presence of the antibiotic and cause treatment failures. If and how HR and resistance are related is unclear. Using carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), we provide evidence that HR to beta-lactams develops over years of antibiotic usage and that it is gradually supplanted by resistance. This suggests the possibility that HR may often develop before resistance and frequently be a stage in its progression, potentially representing a major shift in our understanding of the evolution of antibiotic resistance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6z0B-q9se4s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in specific brain regions is a hallmark of synucleinopathies including Parkinson disease (PD). α-Syn aggregates propagate in a “prion-like” manner and can be transferred inside lysosomes to recipient cells through tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). However, how lysosomes participate in the spreading of α-syn aggregates is unclear. Here, by using super-resolution (SR) and electron microscopy (EM), we find that α-syn fibrils affect the morphology of lysosomes and impair their function in neuronal cells. In addition, we demonstrate that α-syn fibrils induce peripheral redistribution of lysosomes, likely mediated by transcription factor EB (TFEB), increasing the efficiency of α-syn fibrils’ transfer to neighboring cells. We also show that lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) allows the seeding of soluble α-syn in cells that have taken up α-syn fibrils from the culture medium, and, more importantly, in healthy cells in coculture, following lysosome-mediated transfer of the fibrils. Moreover, we demonstrate that seeding occurs mainly at lysosomes in both donor and acceptor cells, after uptake of α-syn fibrils from the medium and following their transfer, respectively. Finally, by using a heterotypic coculture system, we determine the origin and nature of the lysosomes transferred between cells, and we show that donor cells bearing α-syn fibrils transfer damaged lysosomes to acceptor cells, while also receiving healthy lysosomes from them. These findings thus contribute to the elucidation of the mechanism by which α-syn fibrils spread through TNTs, while also revealing the crucial role of lysosomes, working as a Trojan horse for both seeding and propagation of disease pathology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/HCdDmPK5RrI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Automated Annotation of Epileptiform Burden and Its Association with Outcomes</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26161?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
This study was undertaken to determine the dose–response relation between epileptiform activity burden and outcomes in acutely ill patients.


Methods
A single center retrospective analysis was made of 1,967 neurologic, medical, and surgical patients who underwent &amp;gt;16 hours of continuous electroencephalography (EEG) between 2011 and 2017. We developed an artificial intelligence algorithm to annotate 11.02 terabytes of EEG and quantify epileptiform activity burden within 72 hours of recording. We evaluated burden (1) in the first 24 hours of recording, (2) in the 12‐hours epoch with highest burden (peak burden), and (3) cumulatively through the first 72 hours of monitoring. Machine learning was applied to estimate the effect of epileptiform burden on outcome. Outcome measure was discharge modified Rankin Scale, dichotomized as good (0–4) versus poor (5–6).


Results
Peak epileptiform burden was independently associated with poor outcomes (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Other independent associations included age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, seizure on presentation, and diagnosis of hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy. Model calibration error was calculated across 3 strata based on the time interval between last EEG measurement (up to 72 hours of monitoring) and discharge: (1) &amp;lt;5 days between last measurement and discharge, 0.0941 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.0706–0.1191); 5 to 10 days between last measurement and discharge, 0.0946 (95% CI = 0.0631–0.1290); &amp;gt;10 days between last measurement and discharge, 0.0998 (95% CI = 0.0698–0.1335). After adjusting for covariates, increase in peak epileptiform activity burden from 0 to 100% increased the probability of poor outcome by 35%.


Interpretation
Automated measurement of peak epileptiform activity burden affords a convenient, consistent, and quantifiable target for future multicenter randomized trials investigating whether suppressing epileptiform activity improves outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Aerobic exercise, cardiorespiratory fitness, and the human hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23337?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The hippocampus is particularly susceptible to neurodegeneration. Physical activity, specifically increasing cardiorespiratory fitness via aerobic exercise, shows promise as a potential method for mitigating hippocampal decline in humans. Numerous studies have now investigated associations between the structure and function of the hippocampus and engagement in physical activity. Still, there remains continued debate and confusion about the relationship between physical activity and the human hippocampus. In this review, we describe the current state of the physical activity and exercise literature as it pertains to the structure and function of the human hippocampus, focusing on four magnetic resonance imaging measures: volume, diffusion tensor imaging, resting‐state functional connectivity, and perfusion. We conclude that, despite significant heterogeneity in study methods, populations of interest, and scope, there are consistent positive findings, suggesting a promising role for physical activity in promoting hippocampal structure and function throughout the lifespan.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Neural evidence for recognition of naturalistic videos in monkey hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23335?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The role of the hippocampus in recognition memory has long been a source of debate. Tasks used to study recognition that typically require an explicit probe, where the participant must make a response to prove they remember, yield mixed results on hippocampal involvement. Here, we tasked monkeys to freely view naturalistic videos, and only tested their memory via looking times for two separate novel versus repeat video conditions on each trial. Notably, a large proportion (&amp;gt;30%) of hippocampal neurons differentiated these videos via changes in firing rates time‐locked to the duration of their presentation on screen, and not during the delay period between them as would be expected for working memory. Many of these single neurons (&amp;gt;15%) contributed to both retrieval conditions, and differentiated novel from repeat videos across trials with trial‐unique content, suggesting they detect familiarity. The majority of neurons contributing to the classifier showed an enhancement in firing rate on repeat compared with novel videos, a pattern which has not previously been shown in hippocampus. These results suggest the hippocampus contributes to recognition memory via familiarity during free‐viewing.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Hippocampal subfield‐specific Homer1a expression is triggered by learning‐facilitated long‐term potentiation and long‐term depression at medial perforant path synapses</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23333?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Learning about general aspects, or content details, of space results in differentiated neuronal information encoding within the proximodistal axis of the hippocampus. These processes are tightly linked to long‐term potentiation (LTP) and long‐term depression (LTD). Here, we explored the precise sites of encoding of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus that are mediated by information throughput from the perforant path. We assessed nuclear Homer1a‐expression that was triggered by electrophysiological induction of short and long forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and compared it to Homer1a‐expression that was triggered by LTP and LTD enabled by different forms of spatial learning. Plasticity responses were induced by patterned stimulation of the perforant path and were recorded in the dentate gyrus (DG) of freely behaving rats. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect experience‐dependent nuclear encoding of Homer1a in proximodistal hippocampal subfields. Induction of neither STP nor STD resulted in immediate early gene (IEG) encoding. Electrophysiological induction of robust LTP, or LTD, resulted in highly significant and widespread induction of nuclear Homer1a in all hippocampal subfields. LTP that was facilitated by novel spatial exploration triggered similar widespread Homer1a‐expression. The coupling of synaptic depression with the exploration of a novel configuration of landmarks resulted in localized IEG expression in the proximal CA3 region and the lower (infrapyramidal) blade of the DG. Our findings support that synaptic plasticity induction via perforant path inputs promotes widespread hippocampal information encoding. Furthermore, novel spatial exploration promotes the selection of a hippocampal neuronal network by means of LTP that is distributed in an experience‐dependent manner across all hippocampus subfields. This network may be modified during spatial content learning by LTD in specific hippocampal subfields. Thus, long‐term plasticity‐inducing events result in IEG expression that supports establishment and/or restructuring of neuronal networks that are necessary for long‐term information storage.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Object and object‐memory representations across the proximodistal axis of CA1</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23331?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Episodic memory requires information about objects to be integrated into a spatial framework. Place cells in the hippocampus encode spatial representations of objects that could be generated through signaling from the entorhinal cortex. Projections from lateral (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) to the hippocampus terminate in distal and proximal CA1, respectively. We recorded place cells in distal and proximal CA1 as rats explored an environment that contained objects. Place cells in distal CA1 demonstrated higher measures of spatial tuning, stability, and closer proximity of place fields to objects. Furthermore, remapping to object displacement was modulated by place field proximity to objects in distal, but not proximal CA1. Finally, representations of previous object locations were closer to those locations in distal CA1 than proximal CA1. Our data suggest that in cue‐rich environments, LEC inputs to the hippocampus support spatial representations with higher spatial tuning, closer proximity to objects, and greater stability than those receiving inputs from MEC. This is consistent with functional segregation in the entorhinal–hippocampal circuits underlying object‐place memory.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Reduced anterior hippocampal and ventromedial prefrontal activity when repeatedly retrieving autobiographical memories</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23330?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Research has reported that repeatedly retrieving a novel or imagined event representation reduces activity within brain regions critical for constructing mental scenarios, namely the anterior hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). The primary aim of this investigation was to test if this pattern reported for imagined events would be found when repeatedly recollecting autobiographical memories. Twenty‐four participants retrieved 12 pre‐selected autobiographical memories four times while undergoing an fMRI scan. We used a region of interest approach to investigate how the anterior and posterior hippocampus as well as cortical regions critical for memory retrieval—the vmPFC and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)—are affected by repeated retrievals. This analysis revealed an effect in the bilateral anterior hippocampi and vmPFC, but not the posterior hippocampus nor the PCC, with activity decreasing in these regions as a function of repeated retrievals. A multivariate analytic approach (Partial Least Squares) was used to assess whole‐brain patterns of neural activity associated with repeated retrievals. This analysis revealed one pattern of neural activity associated with the initial retrieval of a memory (e.g., inferior frontal and temporal lobe regions) and a separate pattern of activity associated with later retrievals that was distributed primarily across the lateral parietal cortices. These findings suggest that the anterior hippocampus and the vmPFC support the episodic construction of an autobiographical memory the first time it is retrieved and that alternate nonconstructive processes support its subsequent retrieval shortly thereafter.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Structural differences in the hippocampus and amygdala of behaviorally inhibited macaque monkeys</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23329?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Behavioral inhibition is a temperamental disposition to react warily when confronted by unfamiliar people, objects, or events. Behaviorally inhibited children are at greater risk of developing anxiety disorders later in life. Previous studies reported that individuals with a history of childhood behavioral inhibition exhibit abnormal activity in the hippocampus and amygdala. However, few studies have investigated the structural differences that may underlie these functional abnormalities. In this exploratory study, we evaluated rhesus monkeys exhibiting a phenotype consistent with human behavioral inhibition. We performed quantitative neuroanatomical analyses that cannot be performed in humans including estimates of the volume and neuron number of distinct hippocampal regions and amygdala nuclei in behaviorally inhibited and control rhesus monkeys. Behaviorally inhibited monkeys had larger volumes of the rostral third of the hippocampal field CA3, smaller volumes of the rostral third of CA2, and smaller volumes of the accessory basal nucleus of the amygdala. Furthermore, behaviorally inhibited monkeys had fewer neurons in the rostral third of CA2. These structural differences may contribute to the functional abnormalities in the hippocampus and amygdala of behaviorally inhibited individuals. These structural findings in monkeys are consistent with a reduced modulation of amygdala activity via prefrontal cortex projections to the accessory basal nucleus. Given the putative roles of the amygdala in affective processing, CA3 in associative learning and CA2 in social memory, increased amygdala and CA3 activity, and diminished CA2 structure and function, may be associated with increased social anxiety and the heritability of behavioral inhibition. The findings from this exploratory study compel follow‐up investigations with larger sample sizes and additional analyses to provide greater insight and more definitive answers regarding the neurobiological bases of behavioral inhibition.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: APOE moderates the effect of hippocampal blood flow on memory pattern separation in clinically normal older adults</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23327?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Pattern separation, the ability to differentiate new information from previously experienced similar information, is highly sensitive to hippocampal structure and function and declines with age. Functional MRI studies have demonstrated hippocampal hyperactivation in older adults compared to young, with greater task‐related activation associated with worse pattern separation performance. The current study was designed to determine whether pattern separation was sensitive to differences in task‐free hippocampal cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 130 functionally intact older adults. Given prior evidence that apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE e4) status moderates the relationship between CBF and episodic memory, we predicted a stronger negative relationship between hippocampal CBF and pattern separation in APOE e4 carriers. An interaction between APOE group and right hippocampal CBF was present, such that greater right hippocampal CBF was related to better lure discrimination in noncarriers, whereas the effect reversed directionality in e4 carriers. These findings suggest that neurovascular changes in the medial temporal lobe may underlie memory deficits in cognitively normal older adults who are APOE e4 carriers.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: The ependymal cell cytoskeleton in the normal and injured spinal cord of mice</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24918?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The cytoskeleton of the cells lining the central canal of the mouse spinal cord undergoes important modifications following injury. Ependymal cells change their pronounced apicobasal polarity with a striking rearrangement of key cytoskeletal proteins (F‐actin, vimentin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein) that may be key events in the response of these progenitor‐like cells.

Abstract
The cytoskeleton of ependymal cells is fundamental to organize and maintain the normal architecture of the central canal (CC). However, little is known about the plasticity of cytoskeletal components after spinal cord injury. Here, we focus on the structural organization of the cytoskeleton of ependymal cells in the normal and injured spinal cord of mice (both females and males) using immunohistochemical and electron microscopy techniques. We found that in uninjured animals, the actin cytoskeleton (as revealed by phalloidin staining) was arranged following the typical pattern of polarized epithelial cells with conspicuous actin pools located in the apical domain of ependymal cells. Transmission electron microscopy images showed microvilli tufts, long cilia, and characteristic intercellular membrane specializations. After spinal cord injury, F‐actin rearrangements paralleled by fine structural modifications of the apical domain of ependymal cells were observed. These changes involved disruptions of the apical actin pools as well as fine structural modifications of the microvilli tufts. When comparing the control and injured spinal cords, we also found modifications in the expression of vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). After injury, vimentin expression disappeared from the most apical domains of ependymal cells but the number of GFAP‐expressing cells within the CC increased. As in other polarized epithelia, the plastic changes in the cytoskeleton may be critically involved in the reaction of ependymal cells following a traumatic injury of the spinal cord.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Lewy‐body Like Inclusions in Human Midbrain Organoid Carrying Glucocerebrosidase and Alpha Synuclein Mutations</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26166?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
We utilized human midbrain‐like organoids (hMLOs) generated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) carrying glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1) and α‐synuclein (SNCA) perturbations to investigate genotype‐to‐phenotype relationships in Parkinson’s disease, with the particular aim of recapitulating α‐syn and Lewy body‐related pathologies and the process of neurodegeneration in the hMLO model.


Method
We generated and characterized hMLOs from GBA1‐/‐ and SNCA O/E isogenic embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and also generated Lewy body‐like inclusions (LBLIs) in GBA1/SNCA dual perturbation hMLOs and conduritol‐b‐epoxide‐treated SNCA triplication hMLOs.


Results
We identified for the first time that the loss of glucocerebrosidase, coupled with wild‐type α‐synuclein overexpression, results in a substantial accumulation of detergent‐resistant, β‐sheet‐rich α‐synuclein aggregates and Lewy body‐like inclusions in human midbrain‐like organoids. These Lewy body‐like inclusions exhibit a spherically symmetric morphology with an eosinophilic core, containing α‐synuclein with ubiquitin and can also be formed in Parkinson’s disease patient‐derived midbrain‐like organoids. We also demonstrate that impaired glucocerebrosidase function promotes the formation of Lewy body‐like inclusions in human midbrain‐like organoids derived from patients carrying the SNCA triplication.


Interpretation
Taken together, the data indicate that our midbrain‐like organoids harboring two major risk factors (GCase deficiency and wild‐type α‐synuclein overproduction) of Parkinson’s disease provides a tractable model to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms for progressive Lewy body formation.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Post‐ictal psychosis in epilepsy: A clinico‐genetic study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26174?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Psychoses affecting people with epilepsy increase disease burden and diminish quality of life. We characterised post‐ictal psychosis, which comprises about one‐quarter of epilepsy‐related psychoses, and has unknown causation.


Methods
We conducted a case‐control cohort study including patients diagnosed with post‐ictal psychosis, confirmed by psychiatric assessment, with available data regarding epilepsy, treatment, psychiatric history, psychosis profile and outcomes. After screening 3,288 epilepsy patients, we identified 83 with psychosis: 49 had post‐ictal psychosis. Controls were 98 adults, matched by age and epilepsy type, with no history of psychosis. Logistic regression was used to investigate clinical factors associated with post‐ictal psychosis; univariate associations with a P‐value&amp;lt;0.20 were used to build a multivariate model. Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia were calculated.


Results
Cases were more likely to have seizure clustering (OR 7.59, P&amp;lt;0.001), seizures with a recollected aura (OR 2.49, P=0.013) and a family history of psychiatric disease (OR 5.17, P=0.022). Cases showed predominance of right temporal epileptiform discharges (OR 4.87, P=0.007). There was no difference in epilepsy duration, neuroimaging findings or anti‐seizure treatment between cases and controls. Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia in an extended cohort of post‐ictal psychosis cases (58) were significantly higher than in 1,366 epilepsy controls (R2=3%, P=6x10‐3), but not significantly different from 945 independent patients with schizophrenia (R2=0.1%, P=0.775).


Interpretation
Post‐ictal psychosis occurs under particular circumstances in people with epilepsy with a heightened genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, illustrating how disease biology (seizures) and trait susceptibility (schizophrenia) may interact to produce particular outcomes (post‐ictal psychosis) in a common disease.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Changing Gears – DBS For Dopaminergic Desensitization in Parkinson's Disease?</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26164?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>In Parkinson's disease, both motor and neuropsychiatric complications unfold as a consequence of both incremental striatal dopaminergic denervation and intensifying long‐term dopaminergic treatment. Together, this leads to ‘dopaminergic sensitization’ steadily increasing motor and behavioral responses to dopaminergic medication that result in the detrimental sequalae of long‐term dopaminergic treatment. We review the clinical presentations of ‘dopaminergic sensitization’, including rebound off and dyskinesia in the motor domain, and neuropsychiatric fluctuations and behavioral addictions with impulse control disorders and dopamine dysregulation syndrome in the neuropsychiatric domain. We summarize state‐of‐the‐art deep brain stimulation, and show that STN‐DBS allows dopaminergic medication to be tapered, thus supporting dopaminergic desensitization. In this framework, we develop our integrated debatable viewpoint of “changing gears”, that is we suggest rethinking earlier use of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation, when the first clinical signs of dopaminergic motor or neuropsychiatric complications emerge over the steadily progressive disease course. In this sense, subthalamic deep brain stimulation may help reduce longitudinal motor and neuropsychiatric symptom expression – importantly, not by neuroprotection but by supporting dopaminergic desensitization through postoperative medication reduction. Therefore, we suggest considering STN‐DBS early enough before patients encounter potentially irreversible psychosocial consequences of dopaminergic complications, but importantly not before a patient shows first clinical signs of dopaminergic complications. We propose to consider neuropsychiatric dopaminergic complications as a new inclusion criterion in addition to established motor criteria, but this concept will require validation in future clinical trials.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Increasing Serotonin to Reduce Parkinsonian Tremor</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.682990</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While current dopamine-based drugs seem to be effective for most Parkinson's disease (PD) motor dysfunctions, they produce variable responsiveness for resting tremor. This lack of consistency could be explained by considering recent evidence suggesting that PD resting tremor can be divided into different partially overlapping phenotypes based on the dopamine response. These phenotypes may be associated with different pathophysiological mechanisms produced by a cortical-subcortical network involving even non-dopaminergic areas traditionally not directly related to PD. In this study, we propose a bio-constrained computational model to study the neural mechanisms underlying a possible type of PD tremor: the one mainly involving the serotoninergic system. The simulations run with the model demonstrate that a physiological serotonin increase can partially recover dopamine levels at the early stages of the disease before the manifestation of overt tremor. This result suggests that monitoring serotonin concentration changes could be critical for early diagnosis. The simulations also show the effectiveness of a new pharmacological treatment for tremor that acts on serotonin to recover dopamine levels. This latter result has been validated by reproducing existing data collected with human patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurogenesis is a complex process that depends on the delicate regulation of spatial and temporal gene expression. In our previous study, we found that transcribed ultra-conserved regions (T-UCRs), a class of long non-coding RNAs that contain UCRs, are expressed in the developing nervous systems of mice, rhesus monkeys, and humans. In this study, we first detected the full-length sequence of T-uc.189, revealing that it was mainly concentrated in the ventricular zone (VZ) and that its expression decreased as the brain matured. Moreover, we demonstrated that knockdown of T-uc.189 inhibited neurogenesis. In addition, we found that T-uc.189 positively regulated the expression of serine-arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (Srsf3). Taken together, our results are the first to demonstrate that T-uc.189 regulates the expression of Srsf3 to maintain normal neurogenesis during cortical development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Parietal Lobe Reorganization and Widespread Functional Connectivity Integration in Upper-Limb Amputees: A rs-fMRI Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.704079</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The right parietal lobe plays an important role in body image, and disorders of body image emerge after lesions in the parietal lobe or with parietal lobe epilepsy. Body image disorder also often accompanies upper-limb amputation, in which the patient misperceives that their missing limb is still part of their body. Cortical reorganization is known to occur after upper-limb amputation, but it is not clear how widespread and to what degree functional connectivity (FC) is reorganized post-amputation, nor whether such changes might be related to misperceptions of body image. Twenty-four subjects who had a traumatically upper-limb amputees (ULAs) and 24 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scans. Regions of interest (ROIs) in the right superior parietal gyrus (SPG_R) and right inferior parietal lobule (IPL_R) were defined using BrainNet Viewer. We calculated the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in ROIs and correlated the ROI mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (mALFF) and mean scores on the phantom limb sensation (PLS) scale and beck depression index (BDI). We also calculated ROIs and whole-brain FC. Compared to the HC group, we observed significantly increased activation (mALFF) in ROIs of the ULA group. Moreover, correlation analyses revealed a significant positive correlation between ROI mALFF and scores on the PLS. There was a significant negative correlation between the SPG_R mALFF and BDI scores. Seed-based, whole-brain FC analysis revealed that FC in the ULA group significantly decreased in many brain regions across the entire brain. The right parietal lobe appears to be involved in some aspect of body awareness and depression in amputation patients. Upper-limb amputation results not only in reorganization in the local brain area formerly representing the missing limb, but also results in more widespread reorganization through FC changes in whole brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Altered Spontaneous Neural Activity and Functional Connectivity in Parkinson’s Disease With Subthalamic Microlesion</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.699010</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Transient improvement in motor symptoms are immediately observed in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) after an electrode has been implanted into the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for deep brain stimulation (DBS). This phenomenon is known as the microlesion effect (MLE). However, the underlying mechanisms of MLE is poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;Purpose&lt;p&gt;We utilized resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to evaluate changes in spontaneous brain activity and networks in PD patients during the microlesion period after DBS.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;Overall, 37 PD patients and 13 gender- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited for this study. Rs-MRI information was collected from PD patients three days before DBS and one day after DBS, whereas the HCs group was scanned once. We utilized the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) method in order to analyze differences in spontaneous whole-brain activity among all subjects. Furthermore, functional connectivity (FC) was applied to investigate connections between other brain regions and brain areas with significantly different ALFF before and after surgery in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Result&lt;p&gt;Relative to the PD-Pre-DBS group, the PD-Post-DBS group had higher ALFF in the right putamen, right inferior frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus and lower ALFF in right angular gyrus, right precuneus, right posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC), left insula, left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), bilateral middle frontal gyrus and bilateral superior frontal gyrus (dorsolateral). Functional connectivity analysis revealed that these brain regions with significantly different ALFF scores demonstrated abnormal FC, largely in the temporal, prefrontal cortices and default mode network (DMN).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The subthalamic microlesion caused by DBS in PD was found to not only improve the activity of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit, but also reduce the activity of the DMN and executive control network (ECN) related brain regions. Results from this study provide new insights into the mechanism of MLE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Dysfunctional Brain Dynamics of Parkinson's Disease and the Effect of Acute Deep Brain Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.697909</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease, and deep brain stimulation (DBS) can effectively alleviate PD symptoms. Although previous studies have detected network features of PD and DBS, few studies have considered their dynamic characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: We tested two hypotheses. (1) Reduced brain dynamics, as evidenced by slowed microstate dynamic change, is a characteristic of PD and is related to the movement disorders of patients with PD. (2) Therapeutic acute DBS can partially reverse slow brain dynamics in PD to healthy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We used electroencephalography (EEG) microstate analysis based on high density (256-channel) EEG to detect the effects of PD and DBS on brain dynamic changes on a sub-second timescale. We compared 21 healthy controls (HCs) with 20 patients with PD who were in either DBS-OFF or DBS-ON states. Assessment of movement disorder using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III was correlated with microstate parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with HCs, patients with PD displayed a longer mean microstate duration with reduced occurrence per second, which were significantly associated with movement disorders. In patients with PD, some parameters of microstate analysis were restored toward healthy levels after DBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Resting-state EEG microstate analysis is an important tool for investigating brain dynamic changes in PD and DBS. PD can slow down brain dynamic change, and therapeutic acute DBS can partially reverse this change toward a healthy level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Squamous and Respiratory Metaplasia After Olfactory Mucosal Resection</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.695653</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Resection of the olfactory mucosa (OM) is sometimes unavoidable during surgery; however, it is not known whether the OM can completely recover thereafter. The aim of this study was to uncover whether the OM fully recovers after mucosal resection and describe the process of OM regeneration. 8-week-old male Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 18) were subjected to OM resection at the nasal septum; six rats were euthanized for histological examination 0, 30, and 90 days after surgery. Immunohistochemistry was performed to identify olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) lineage cells [mature and immature ORNs and ORN progenitors, and olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs)], as well as dividing and apoptotic cells. Squamous and respiratory metaplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration were also assessed. On day 30 after resection, the mucosa had regenerated, and mainly contained thin nerve bundles, basal cells, and immature ORNs, with a few mature ORNs and OECs. On day 90, the repaired nasal mucosa had degenerated into stratified squamous or ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelia, with reducing ORNs. The lamina propria contained numerous macrophages. Partial regeneration was observed within 1 month after OM resection, whereas subsequent degeneration into squamous and respiratory epithelia occurred within 3 months. Given the poor persistence of ORNs and OECs, OM resection is likely to result in olfactory impairment. Overall, surgeons should be cautious not to injure the OM during surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Emotional Modulation of Frontal Alpha Asymmetry - a Novel Biomarker of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.699947</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective findings of brain injury or dysfunction are typically lacking in mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) despite prolonged post-concussion symptoms in some patients. Thus, there is a need for objective biomarkers of MTBI that reflect altered brain physiology underlying subjective symptoms. We have previously reported increased attention to threat-related stimuli in subjects with MTBI, suggesting a physiological vulnerability to depression. Vulnerability to depression has been linked with relatively greater activity of the right than left frontal cortex reflected in inverse pattern in frontal alpha with greater power on the left than right. We investigated whether patients with previous MTBI show this pattern of frontal activity reflected in more negative frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) scores. Furthermore, in search for potential biomarkers of MTBI, we created a novel index, emotional modulation of FAA (eFAA) and investigated whether it correlates with subjective symptoms. EEG was recorded while subjects with previous MTBI and controls performed a computer-based reaction time task integrating different cognitive executive functions and containing either threat-related or emotionally neutral visual stimuli. Post-concussion symptoms and depression were assessed using the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) and Beck’s depression inventory (BDI). Task-induced FAA was assessed and eFAA calculated by subtracting FAA in the context of neutral stimuli from FAA in the context of emotional stimuli. The MTBI group showed FAA scores reflecting relatively greater right-sided frontal activity compared to healthy controls. eFAA differentiated the symptomatic MTBI from non-symptomatic MTBI group and from healthy controls. eFAA also correlated with RPQ and BDI scores. In conclusion, FAA pattern previously linked with vulnerability to depression, was observed in patients with previous MTBI. Furthermore, eFAA has potential as a biomarker of altered affective brain functions in MTBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Striatal Control of Movement: A Role for New Neuronal (Sub-) Populations?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.697284</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The striatum is a very heterogenous brain area, composed of different domains and compartments, albeit lacking visible anatomical demarcations. Two populations of striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) build the so-called direct and indirect pathway of the basal ganglia, whose coordinated activity is essential to control locomotion. Dysfunction of striatal SPNs is part of many movement disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. In this mini review article, I will highlight recent studies utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the transcriptional profiles of striatal neurons. These studies discover that SPNs carry a transcriptional signature, indicating both their anatomical location and compartmental identity. Furthermore, the transcriptional profiles reveal the existence of additional distinct neuronal populations and previously unknown SPN sub-populations. In a parallel development, studies in rodent models of PD and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) report that direct pathway SPNs do not react uniformly to L-DOPA therapy, and that only a subset of these neurons is underlying the development of abnormal movements. Together, these studies demonstrate a new level of cellular complexity for striatal (dys-) function and locomotor control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Children With Dyscalculia Show Hippocampal Hyperactivity During Symbolic Number Perception</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.687476</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dyscalculia is a learning disability affecting the acquisition of arithmetical skills in children with normal intelligence and age-appropriate education. Two hypotheses attempt to explain the main cause of dyscalculia. The first hypothesis suggests that a problem with the core mechanisms of perceiving (non-symbolic) quantities is the cause of dyscalculia (core deficit hypothesis), while the alternative hypothesis suggests that dyscalculics have problems only with the processing of numerical symbols (access deficit hypothesis). In the present study, the symbolic and non-symbolic numerosity processing of typically developing children and children with dyscalculia were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Control (n = 15, mean age: 11.26) and dyscalculia (n = 12, mean age: 11.25) groups were determined using a wide-scale screening process. Participants performed a quantity comparison paradigm in the fMRI with two number conditions (dot and symbol comparison) and two difficulty levels (0.5 and 0.7 ratio). The results showed that the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left fusiform gyrus (so-called “number form area”) were activated for number perception as well as bilateral occipital and supplementary motor areas. The task difficulty engaged bilateral insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, IPS, and DLPFC activation. The dyscalculia group showed more activation in the left orbitofrontal cortex, left medial prefrontal cortex, and right anterior cingulate cortex than the control group. The dyscalculia group showed left hippocampus activation specifically for the symbolic condition. Increased left hippocampal and left-lateralized frontal network activation suggest increased executive and memory-based compensation mechanisms during symbolic processing for dyscalculics. Overall, our findings support the access deficit hypothesis as a neural basis for dyscalculia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Visuospatial Attention Allocation as an Indicator of Cognitive Deficit in Traumatic Brain Injury: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.675376</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is defined by changes in brain function resulting from external forces acting on the brain and is typically characterized by a host of physiological and functional changes such as cognitive deficits including attention problems. In the present study, we focused on the effect of TBI on the ability to allocate attention in vision (i.e., the use of endogenous and exogenous visual cues) by systematically reviewing previous literature on the topic. We conducted quantitative synthesis of 16 selected studies of visual attention following TBI, calculating 80 effect size estimates. The combined effect size was large (g = 0.79, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) with medium heterogeneity (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 68.39%). Subgroup analyses revealed an increase in deficit with moderate-to-severe and severe TBI as compared to mild TBI [F&lt;sub&gt;(2, 76)&lt;/sub&gt; = 24.14, p &amp;lt; 0.0001]. Task type was another key source of variability and subgroup analyses indicated that higher order attention processes were severely affected by TBI [F&lt;sub&gt;(2, 77)&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.66, p = 0.0051). Meta-regression analyses revealed significant improvement in visual attention deficit with time [p(mild) = 0.031, p(moderate-to-severe) = 0.002, p(severe) &amp;lt; 0.0001]. Taken together, these results demonstrate that visual attention is affected by TBI and that regular assessment of visual attention, using a systematic attention allocation task, may provide a useful clinical measure of cognitive impairment and change after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: SyNC, a Computationally Extensive and Realistic Neural Net to Identify Relative Impacts of Synaptopathy Mechanisms on Glutamatergic Neurons and Their Networks in Autism and Complex Neurological Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.674030</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic function and experience-dependent plasticity across multiple synapses are dependent on the types of neurons interacting as well as the intricate mechanisms that operate at the molecular level of the synapse. To understand the complexity of information processing at synaptic networks will rely in part on effective computational models. Such models should also evaluate disruptions to synaptic function by multiple mechanisms. By co-development of algorithms alongside hardware, real time analysis metrics can be co-prioritized along with biological complexity. The hippocampus is implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and within this region glutamatergic neurons constitute 90% of the neurons integral to the functioning of neuronal networks. Here we generate a computational model referred to as ASD interrogator (ASDint) and corresponding hardware to enable in silicon analysis of multiple ASD mechanisms affecting glutamatergic neuron synapses. The hardware architecture Synaptic Neuronal Circuit, SyNC, is a novel GPU accelerator or neural net, that extends discovery by acting as a biologically relevant realistic neuron synapse in real time. Co-developed ASDint and SyNC expand spiking neural network models of plasticity to comparative analysis of retrograde messengers. The SyNC model is realized in an ASIC architecture, which enables the ability to compute increasingly complex scenarios without sacrificing area efficiency of the model. Here we apply the ASDint model to analyse neuronal circuitry dysfunctions associated with autism spectral disorder (ASD) synaptopathies and their effects on the synaptic learning parameter and demonstrate SyNC on an ideal ASDint scenario. Our work highlights the value of secondary pathways in regard to evaluating complex ASD synaptopathy mechanisms. By comparing the degree of variation in the synaptic learning parameter to the response obtained from simulations of the ideal scenario we determine the potency and time of the effect of a particular evaluated mechanism. Hence simulations of such scenarios in even a small neuronal network now allows us to identify relative impacts of changed parameters and their effect on synaptic function. Based on this, we can estimate the minimum fraction of a neuron exhibiting a particular dysfunction scenario required to lead to complete failure of a neural network to coordinate pre-synaptic and post-synaptic outputs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Preserved Thermal Pain in 3xTg-AD Mice With Increased Sensory-Discriminative Pain Sensitivity in Females but Affective-Emotional Dimension in Males as Early Sex-Specific AD-Phenotype Biomarkers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.683412</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The increase of the aging population, where quite chronic comorbid conditions are associated with pain, draws growing interest across its investigation and the underlying nociceptive mechanisms. Burn injuries associated problems might be of relevance in the older adult’s daily life, but in people with dementia, exposure to high temperatures and heat sources poses a significantly increased risk of burns. In this brief report, the hind paws and tail pain withdrawal reflexes and the emotional responses to thermal nociception in 3xTg-AD mice were characterized for the first time in the plantar test and compared to their non-transgenic (NTg) counterparts. We studied a cohort of male and female 3xTg-AD mice at asymptomatic (2 months), early (6 months), middle (9 months), and advanced (12 and 15 months) stages of the disease and as compared to sex- and age-matched NTg control mice with normal aging. At 20 and 40W intensities, the sensorial-discriminative thresholds eliciting the withdrawal responses were preserved from asymptomatic to advanced stages of the disease compared to NTg counterparts. Moreover, 3xTg-AD females consistently showed a greater sensory-discriminative sensitivity already at premorbid ages, whereas increased emotionality was shown in males. False-negative results were found in “blind to sex and age” analysis, warning about the need to study sexes independently. The current results and previous report in cold thermal stimulation provide two paradigms unveiling sex-specific early AD-phenotype nociceptive biomarkers to study the mechanistic underpinnings of sex-, age- and AD-disease-dependent thermal pain sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: A role for T‐cell exhaustion in Long COVID‐19 and severe outcomes for several categories of COVID‐19 patients</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24917?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Unusual mortality rate differences and symptoms have been experienced by COVID‐19 patients, and the postinfection symptoms called Long COVID‐19 have also been widely experienced. A substantial percentage of COVID‐19‐infected individuals in specific health categories have been virtually asymptomatic, several other individuals in the same health categories have exhibited several unusual symptoms, and yet other individuals in the same health categories have fatal outcomes. It is now hypothesized that these differences in mortality rates and symptoms could be caused by a SARS‐CoV‐2 virus infection acting together with one or more latent pathogen infections in certain patients, through mutually beneficial induced immune cell dysfunctions, including T‐cell exhaustion. A latent pathogen infection likely to be involved is the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which infects approximately one third of the global human population. Furthermore, certain infections and cancers that cause T‐cell exhaustion can also explain the more severe outcomes of other COVID‐19 patients having several disease and cancer comorbidities.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>At present, resilience refers to a highly heterogeneous concept with ill‐defined determinants, mechanisms, and outcomes. This call for action argues for the need to define resilience as a person‐centered multidimensional metric, informed by a dynamic lifespan perspective and combining observational and interventional experimental studies to identify specific neural markers and correlated behavioral measures. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic highlights the urgent need of such an effort with the ultimate goal of defining a new vital sign, an individual index of resilience, as a life‐long metric with the capacity to predict an individual's risk for disability in the face of a stressor, insult, injury, or disease.

The T cell receptor (TCR-CD3) initiates T cell activation by binding to peptides of Major Histocompatibility Complexes (pMHC). The TCR-CD3 topology is well understood but the arrangement and dynamics of its cytoplasmic tails remains unknown, limiting our grasp of the signalling mechanism. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations and modelling to investigate the entire TCR-CD3 embedded in a model membrane. Our study demonstrates conformational changes in the extracellular and transmembrane domains, and the arrangement of the TCR-CD3 cytoplasmic tails. The cytoplasmic tails formed highly interlaced structures while some tyrosines within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) penetrated the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Interactions between the cytoplasmic tails and phosphatidylinositol phosphate lipids in the inner membrane leaflet led to the formation of a distinct anionic lipid fingerprint around the TCR-CD3. These results increase our understanding of the TCR-CD3 dynamics and the importance of membrane lipids in regulating T cell activation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-2qYGaVMD8Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

This work studies another important problem in the field: how graphs can be used for high-performance compression of the large-scale sequencing data. We present a novel graph definition named Hamming-Shifting graph to address this problem. The definition originates from the technological characteristics of next-generation sequencing machines, aiming to link all pairs of distinct reads that have a small Hamming distance or a small shifting offset or both. We compute multiple lexicographically minimal &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mers to index the reads for an efficient search of the weight-lightest edges, and we prove a very high probability of successfully detecting these edges. The resulted graph creates a full mutual reference of the reads to cascade a code-minimized transfer of every child-read for an optimal compression. We conducted compression experiments on the minimum spanning forest of this extremely sparse graph, and achieved a 10 − 30% more file size reduction compared to the best compression results using existing algorithms. As future work, the separation and connectivity degrees of these giant graphs can be used as economical measurements or protocols for quick quality assessment of wet-lab machines, for sufficiency control of genomic library preparation, and for accurate de novo genome assembly.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/g7qspdQGlRA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The effect of natural selection on the propagation of protein expression noise to bacterial growth</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Laurens H. J. Krah, Rutger Hermsen&lt;/p&gt;

In bacterial cells, protein expression is a highly stochastic process. Gene expression noise moreover propagates through the cell and adds to fluctuations in the cellular growth rate. A common intuition is that, due to their relatively high noise amplitudes, proteins with a low mean expression level are the most important drivers of fluctuations in physiological variables. In this work, we challenge this intuition by considering the effect of natural selection on noise propagation. Mathematically, the contribution of each protein species to the noise in the growth rate depends on two factors: the noise amplitude of the protein’s expression level, and the sensitivity of the growth rate to fluctuations in that protein’s concentration. We argue that natural selection, while shaping mean abundances to increase the mean growth rate, also affects cellular sensitivities. In the limit in which cells grow optimally fast, the growth rate becomes most sensitive to fluctuations in highly abundant proteins. This causes abundant proteins to overall contribute strongly to the noise in the growth rate, despite their low noise levels. We further explore this result in an experimental data set of protein abundances, and test key assumptions in an evolving, stochastic toy model of cellular growth.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v5_3LM0wo3E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Complex dendritic trees are a distinctive feature of neurons. Alterations to dendritic morphology are associated with developmental, behavioral and neurodegenerative changes. The highly-arborized PVD neuron of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; serves as a model to study dendritic patterning; however, quantitative, objective and automated analyses of PVD morphology are missing. Here, we present a method for neuronal feature extraction, based on deep-learning and fitting algorithms. The extracted neuronal architecture is represented by a database of structural elements for abstracted analysis. We obtain excellent automatic tracing of PVD trees and uncover that dendritic junctions are unevenly distributed. Surprisingly, these junctions are three-way-symmetrical on average, while dendritic processes are arranged orthogonally. We quantify the effect of mutation in &lt;i&gt;git-1&lt;/i&gt;, a regulator of dendritic spine formation, on PVD morphology and discover a localized reduction in junctions. Our findings shed new light on PVD architecture, demonstrating the effectiveness of our objective analyses of dendritic morphology and suggest molecular control mechanisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jnUiVyH0d0U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Oligomers of the amyloid &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-protein (A&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) through their toxicity towards neurons. Understanding the process of oligomerization may contribute to the development of therapeutic agents, but this has been difficult due to the complexity of oligomerization and the metastability of the oligomers thus formed. To understand the kinetics of oligomer formation, and how that relates to the progression of AD, we developed models of the oligomerization process. Here, we use experimental data from cell viability assays and proxies for rate constants involved in monomer-dimer-trimer kinetics to develop a simple mathematical model linking A&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; assembly to oligomer-induced neuronal degeneration. This model recapitulates the rapid growth of disease incidence with age. It does so through incorporation of age-dependent changes in rates of A&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; monomer production and elimination. The model also describes clinical progression in genetic forms of AD (e.g., Down’s syndrome), changes in hippocampal volume, AD risk after traumatic brain injury, and spatial spreading of the disease due to foci in which A&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; production is elevated. Continued incorporation of clinical and basic science data into the current model will make it an increasingly relevant model system for doing theoretical calculations that are not feasible in biological systems. In addition, terms in the model that have particularly large effects are likely to be especially useful therapeutic targets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pDgzlEOvp0o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Immune selection suppresses the emergence of drug resistance in malaria parasites but facilitates its spread</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/89yNGIjXRys/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Alexander O. B. Whitlock, Jonathan J. Juliano, Nicole Mideo&lt;/p&gt;

Although drug resistance in &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; typically evolves in regions of low transmission, resistance spreads readily following introduction to regions with a heavier disease burden. This suggests that the origin and the spread of resistance are governed by different processes, and that high transmission intensity specifically impedes the origin. Factors associated with high transmission, such as highly immune hosts and competition within genetically diverse infections, are associated with suppression of resistant lineages within hosts. However, interactions between these factors have rarely been investigated and the specific relationship between adaptive immunity and selection for resistance has not been explored. Here, we developed a multiscale, agent-based model of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; parasites, hosts, and vectors to examine how host and parasite dynamics shape the evolution of resistance in populations with different transmission intensities. We found that selection for antigenic novelty (“immune selection”) suppressed the evolution of resistance in high transmission settings. We show that high levels of population immunity increased the strength of immune selection relative to selection for resistance. As a result, immune selection delayed the evolution of resistance in high transmission populations by allowing novel, sensitive lineages to remain in circulation at the expense of the spread of a resistant lineage.
In contrast, in low transmission settings, we observed that resistant strains were able to sweep to high population prevalence without interference. Additionally, we found that the relationship between immune selection and resistance changed when resistance was widespread. Once resistance was common enough to be found on many antigenic backgrounds, immune selection stably maintained resistant parasites in the population by allowing them to proliferate, even in untreated hosts, when resistance was linked to a novel epitope. Our results suggest that immune selection plays a role in the global pattern of resistance evolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/89yNGIjXRys&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Do psychiatric diseases follow annual cyclic seasonality?</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/U9ZJHlAGrPY/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Hanxin Zhang, Atif Khan, Qi Chen, Henrik Larsson, Andrey Rzhetsky&lt;/p&gt;

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) famously follows annual cycles, with incidence elevation in the fall and spring. Should some version of cyclic annual pattern be expected from other psychiatric disorders? Would annual cycles be similar for distinct psychiatric conditions? This study probes these questions using 2 very large datasets describing the health histories of 150 million unique U.S. citizens and the entire Swedish population. We performed 2 types of analysis, using “uncorrected” and “corrected” observations. The former analysis focused on counts of daily patient visits associated with each disease. The latter analysis instead looked at the proportion of disease-specific visits within the total volume of visits for a time interval. In the uncorrected analysis, we found that psychiatric disorders’ annual patterns were remarkably similar across the studied diseases in both countries, with the magnitude of annual variation significantly higher in Sweden than in the United States for psychiatric, but not infectious diseases. In the corrected analysis, only 1 group of patients—11 to 20 years old—reproduced all regularities we observed for psychiatric disorders in the uncorrected analysis; the annual healthcare-seeking visit patterns associated with other age-groups changed drastically. Analogous analyses over infectious diseases were less divergent over these 2 types of computation. Comparing these 2 sets of results in the context of published psychiatric disorder seasonality studies, we tend to believe that our uncorrected results are more likely to capture the real trends, while the corrected results perhaps reflect mostly artifacts determined by dominantly fluctuating, health-seeking visits across a given year. However, the divergent results are ultimately inconclusive; thus, we present both sets of results unredacted, and, in the spirit of full disclosure, leave the verdict to the reader.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/U9ZJHlAGrPY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Assessing the replicability of spatial gene expression using atlas data from the adult mouse brain</title>

High-throughput, spatially resolved gene expression techniques are poised to be transformative across biology by overcoming a central limitation in single-cell biology: the lack of information on relationships that organize the cells into the functional groupings characteristic of tissues in complex multicellular organisms. Spatial expression is particularly interesting in the mammalian brain, which has a highly defined structure, strong spatial constraint in its organization, and detailed multimodal phenotypes for cells and ensembles of cells that can be linked to mesoscale properties such as projection patterns, and from there, to circuits generating behavior. However, as with any type of expression data, cross-dataset benchmarking of spatial data is a crucial first step. Here, we assess the replicability, with reference to canonical brain subdivisions, between the Allen Institute’s in situ hybridization data from the adult mouse brain (Allen Brain Atlas (ABA)) and a similar dataset collected using spatial transcriptomics (ST). With the advent of tractable spatial techniques, for the first time, we are able to benchmark the Allen Institute’s whole-brain, whole-transcriptome spatial expression dataset with a second independent dataset that similarly spans the whole brain and transcriptome. We use regularized linear regression (LASSO), linear regression, and correlation-based feature selection in a supervised learning framework to classify expression samples relative to their assayed location. We show that Allen Reference Atlas labels are classifiable using transcription in both data sets, but that performance is higher in the ABA than in ST. Furthermore, models trained in one dataset and tested in the opposite dataset do not reproduce classification performance bidirectionally. While an identifying expression profile can be found for a given brain area, it does not generalize to the opposite dataset. In general, we found that canonical brain area labels are classifiable in gene expression space within dataset and that our observed performance is not merely reflecting physical distance in the brain. However, we also show that cross-platform classification is not robust. Emerging spatial datasets from the mouse brain will allow further characterization of cross-dataset replicability ultimately providing a valuable reference set for understanding the cell biology of the brain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/BK14-kDlgKE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Correlates of Multiple Sclerosis Immunopathological Patterns</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26163?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Histology reveals that early active multiple sclerosis lesions can be classified into 3 main interindividually heterogeneous but intraindividually stable immunopathological patterns of active demyelination (patterns I–III). In patterns I and II, a T‐cell‐ and macrophage‐associated demyelination is suggested, with pattern II only showing signs of a humoral immune response. Pattern III is characterized by inflammatory lesions with an oligodendrocyte degeneration. Patterns suggest pathogenic heterogeneity, and we postulated that they have distinct magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlates that may serve as biomarkers.


Methods
We evaluated in an international collaborative retrospective cohort study the MRI lesion characteristics of 789 conventional prebiopsy and follow‐up MRIs in relation to their histopathologically classified immunopathological patterns (n = 161 subjects) and lesion edge features (n = 112).


Results
A strong association of a ringlike enhancement and a hypointense T2‐weighted (T2w) rim with patterns I and II, but not pattern III, was observed. Only a fraction of pattern III patients showed a ringlike enhancement, and this was always atypical. Ringlike enhancement and T2w rims colocalized, and ringlike enhancement showed a strong association with macrophage rims as shown by histology. A strong concordance of MRI lesion characteristics, meaning that different lesions showed the same features, was found when comparing biopsied and nonbiopsied lesions at a given time point, indicating lesion homogeneity within individual patients.


Interpretation
We provide robust evidence that MRI characteristics reflect specific morphological features of multiple sclerosis immunopatterns and that ringlike enhancement and T2w hypointense rims might serve as a valuable noninvasive biomarker to differentiate pathological patterns of demyelination.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Longitudinal changes in hippocampal network connectivity in Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26168?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The hippocampus is connected to two distinct cortical brain networks, the posterior‐medial and the anterior‐temporal networks, involving different medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. The aim of this study was to assess the functional alterations of these two networks, their changes over time and links to cognition in Alzheimer’s disease.


Methods
We assessed MTL connectivity in 53 amyloid‐β positive patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer dementia and 68 healthy elderly controls, using resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging, cross‐sectionally and longitudinally. First, we compared the functional connectivity of the posterior‐medial and anterior‐temporal networks within the control group to highlight their specificities. Second, we compared the connectivity of these networks between groups, and between baseline and 18‐months follow‐up in patients. Third, we assessed the association in the connectivity changes between the two networks, and with cognitive performance.


Results
We found decreased connectivity in patients specifically between the hippocampus and the posterior‐medial network, together with increased connectivity between several MTL subregions and the anterior‐temporal network. Moreover, changes in the posterior‐medial and anterior‐temporal networks were interrelated such that decrease MTL‐posterior‐medial connectivity was associated with increased MTL‐anterior‐temporal connectivity. Finally, both MTL‐posterior‐medial decrease and MTL‐anterior‐temporal increase predicted cognitive decline.


Interpretation
Our findings demonstrate that longitudinal connectivity changes in the posterior‐medial and anterior‐temporal hippocampal networks are linked together and that they both contribute to cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease. These results shed light on the critical role of the posterior‐medial and anterior‐temporal networks in Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology and clinical symptoms.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: COVID‐19 vaccine‐associated cerebral venous thrombosis in Germany</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26172?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
We aimed to estimate the incidence of cerebral sinus and venous thrombosis (CVT) within one month from first‐dose administration and the frequency of vaccine‐induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) as the underlying mechanism after vaccination with BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, and mRNA‐1273, in Germany.


Methods
A web‐based questionnaire was e‐mailed to all Departments of Neurology. We asked to report cases of CVT within one month of a COVID‐19 vaccination. Other cerebral events could also be reported. Incidence rates of CVT were calculated by using official statistics of nine German States.


Results
A total of 45 CVT cases were reported. In addition, 9 primary ischemic strokes, 4 primary intracerebral hemorrhages, and 4 other neurological events were recorded. Of the CVT patients, 35 (77.8%) were female, and 36 (80.0%) were below the age of 60 years. Fifty‐three events were observed after vaccination with ChAdOx1 (85.5%), 9 after BNT162b2 (14.5%), and none after mRNA‐1273 vaccination. After 7,126,434 first vaccine doses, the incidence rate of CVT within one month from first dose administration was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.38‐0.78) per 100,000 person‐months (which corresponds to a risk of CVT within the first 31 days of 0.55 per 100,000 individuals) for all vaccines and 1.52 (1.00‐2.21) for ChAdOx1 (after 2,320,535 ChAdOx1 first doses). The adjusted incidence rate ratio was 9.68 (3.46‐34.98) for ChAdOx1 compared to mRNA‐based vaccines and 3.14 (1.22‐10.65) for women compared to non‐women. In 26/45 patients with CVT (57.8%), VITT was graded highly probable.


Interpretation
Given an incidence of 0.02–0.15 per 100,000 person‐months for CVT in the general population, these findings point towards a higher risk for CVT after ChAdOx1 vaccination, especially for women.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genomic insights into myasthenia gravis identify distinct immunological mechanisms in early and late onset disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26169?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
To identify disease relevant genes and explore underlying immunological mechanisms that contribute to early and late onset forms of myasthenia gravis.


Methods
We used a novel genomic methodology to integrate genome wide association study (GWAS) findings in myasthenia gravis with cell‐type specific information such as gene expression patterns and promotor‐enhancer interactions, in order to identify disease relevant genes. Subsequently, we conducted additional genomic investigations including an expression quantitative analysis of 313 healthy people to provide mechanistic insights.


Results
We identified genes that were specifically linked to early onset myasthenia gravis based on GWAS associated risk variants including TNIP1, ORMDL3, GSDMB and TRAF3. We showed that regulators of toll‐like receptor 4 signalling were enriched only among the early onset disease genes (fold enrichment = 3.85, p = 6.4 x 10‐3). In contrast, T‐cell regulators CD28 and CTLA4 were exclusively linked to late onset disease. We identified two causal genetic variants (rs231770 and rs231735; posterior probability= 0.98 and 0.91) near the CTLA4 gene. Subsequently, we demonstrated that these causal variants result in low expression of CTLA4 (rho =‐0.66, p = 1.28 x 10‐38 and rho = ‐0.52, p = 7.01 x 10‐22, for rs231735 and rs231770 respectively).


Interpretation
The disease relevant genes identified in this study are a unique resource for many disciplines including clinicians, scientists and the pharmaceutical industry. The distinct immunological pathways linked to early and late onset myasthenia gravis carry important implications for drug repurposing opportunities and for future studies of drug development.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Shifts in Estimated Preferred Directions During Simulated BMI Experiments With No Adaptation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.677688</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Experiments with brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) reveal that the estimated preferred direction (EPD) of cortical motor units may shift following the transition to brain control. However, the cause of those shifts, and in particular, whether they imply neural adaptation, is an open issue. Here we address this question in simulations and theoretical analysis. Simulations are based on the assumption that the brain implements optimal state estimation and feedback control and that cortical motor neurons encode the estimated state and control vector. Our simulations successfully reproduce apparent shifts in EPDs observed in BMI experiments with different BMI filters, including linear, Kalman and re-calibrated Kalman filters, even with no neural adaptation. Theoretical analysis identifies the conditions for reducing those shifts. We demonstrate that simulations that better satisfy those conditions result in smaller shifts in EPDs. We conclude that the observed shifts in EPDs may result from experimental conditions, and in particular correlated velocities or tuning weights, even with no adaptation. Under the above assumptions, we show that if neurons are tuned differently to the estimated velocity, estimated position and control signal, the EPD with respect to actual velocity may not capture the real PD in which the neuron encodes the estimated velocity. Our investigation provides theoretical and simulation tools for better understanding shifts in EPD and BMI experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: From Junk to Function: LncRNAs in CNS Health and Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.714768</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in RNA sequencing technologies helped to uncover the existence of tens of thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that arise from the dark matter of the genome. These lncRNAs were originally thought to be transcriptional noise but an increasing number of studies demonstrate that these transcripts can modulate protein-coding gene expression by a wide variety of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. The spatiotemporal regulation of lncRNA expression is particularly evident in the central nervous system, suggesting that they may directly contribute to specific brain processes, including neurogenesis and cellular homeostasis. Not surprisingly, lncRNAs are therefore gaining attention as putative novel therapeutic targets for disorders of the brain. In this review, we summarize the recent insights into the functions of lncRNAs in the brain, their role in neuronal maintenance, and their potential contribution to disease. We conclude this review by postulating how these RNA molecules can be targeted for the treatment of yet incurable neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.701977</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder that involves social interaction defects, impairment of non-verbal and verbal interactions, and limited interests along with stereotypic activities. Its incidence has been increasing rapidly in recent decades. Despite numerous attempts to understand the pathophysiology of ASD, its exact etiology is still unclear. Recent data shows the role of accurate myelination and translational regulation in ASD’s pathogenesis. In this study, we assessed Ermin (ERMN) and Listerin E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase 1 (LTN1) genes expression in Iranian ASD patients and age- and gender-matched healthy subjects’ peripheral blood using quantitative real-time PCR to recognize any probable dysregulation in the expression of these genes and propose this disorder’s mechanisms. Analysis of the expression demonstrated a significant ERMN downregulation in total ASD patients compared to the healthy individuals (posterior beta = −0.794, adjusted P-value = 0.025). LTN1 expression was suggestively higher in ASD patients in comparison with the corresponding control individuals. Considering the gender of study participants, the analysis showed that the mentioned genes’ different expression levels were significant only in male subjects. Besides, a significant correlation was found between expression of the mentioned genes (r = −0.49, P &amp;lt; 0.0001). The present study provides further supports for the contribution of ERMN and LTN1 in ASD’s pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Surface-Based Falff: A Potential Novel Biomarker for Prediction of Radiation Encephalopathy in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.692575</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Radiation encephalopathy (RE) is an important potential complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who undergo radiotherapy (RT) that can affect the quality of life. However, a functional imaging biomarker of pre-symptomatic RE has not yet been established. This study aimed to assess radiation-induced gray matter functional alterations and explore fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) as an imaging biomarker for predicting or diagnosing RE in patients with NPC. A total of 60 patients with NPC were examined, 21 in the pre-RT cohort and 39 in the post-RT cohort. Patients in the post-RT cohort were further divided into two subgroups according to the occurrence of RE in follow-up: post-RT &lt;sub&gt;non−RE&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 21) and post-RT &lt;sub&gt;REproved&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;infollow−up&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 18). Surface-based and volume-based fALFF were used to detect radiation-induced functional alterations. Functional derived features were then adopted to construct a predictive model for the diagnosis of RE. We observed that surface-based fALFF could sensitively detect radiation-induced functional alterations in the intratemporal brain regions (such as the hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus), as well as the extratemporal regions (such as the insula and prefrontal lobe); however, no significant intergroup differences were observed using volume-based fALFF. No significant correlation between fALFF and radiation dose to the ipsilateral temporal lobe was observed. Support vector machine (SVM) analysis revealed that surface-based fALFF in the bilateral superior temporal gyri and left insula exhibited impressive performance (accuracy = 80.49%) in identifying patients likely to develop RE. We conclude that surface-based fALFF may serve as a sensitive imaging biomarker in the prediction of RE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Insulin Resistance Exacerbates Alzheimer Disease via Multiple Mechanisms</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.687157</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that accounts for 60–70% of dementia and is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The pathogenesis of this debilitating disorder is still not completely understood. New insights into the pathogenesis of AD are needed in order to develop novel pharmacologic approaches. In recent years, numerous studies have shown that insulin resistance plays a significant role in the development of AD. Over 80% of patients with AD have type II diabetes (T2DM) or abnormal serum glucose, suggesting that the pathogenic mechanisms of insulin resistance and AD likely overlap. Insulin resistance increases neuroinflammation, which promotes both amyloid β-protein deposition and aberrant tau phosphorylation. By increasing production of reactive oxygen species, insulin resistance triggers amyloid β-protein accumulation. Oxidative stress associated with insulin resistance also dysregulates glycogen synthase kinase 3-β (GSK-3β), which leads to increased tau phosphorylation. Both insulin and amyloid β-protein are metabolized by insulin degrading enzyme (IDE). Defects in this enzyme are the basis for a strong association between T2DM and AD. This review highlights multiple pathogenic mechanisms induced by insulin resistance that are implicated in AD. Several pharmacologic approaches to AD associated with insulin resistance are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bilingualism and multilingualism are highly prevalent. Non-invasive brain imaging has been used to study the neural correlates of native and non-native speech and language production, mainly on the lexical and syntactic level. Here, we acquired continuous fast event-related FMRI during visually cued overt production of exclusively German and English vowels and syllables. We analyzed data from 13 university students, native speakers of German and sequential English bilinguals. The production of non-native English sounds was associated with increased activity of the left primary sensorimotor cortex, bilateral cerebellar hemispheres (lobule VI), left inferior frontal gyrus, and left anterior insula compared to native German sounds. The contrast German &amp;gt; English sounds was not statistically significant. Our results emphasize that the production of non-native speech requires additional neural resources already on a basic phonological level in sequential bilinguals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.675433</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) measurements and models provide information about brain connectivity and are sensitive to the physical properties of tissue microstructure. Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) quantifies the degree of non-Gaussian diffusion in biological tissue from dMRI. These estimates are of interest because they were shown to be more sensitive to microstructural alterations in health and diseases than measures based on the total anisotropy of diffusion which are highly confounded by tissue dispersion and fiber crossings. In this work, we implemented DKI in the Diffusion in Python (DIPY) project—a large collaborative open-source project which aims to provide well-tested, well-documented and comprehensive implementation of different dMRI techniques. We demonstrate the functionality of our methods in numerical simulations with known ground truth parameters and in openly available datasets. A particular strength of our DKI implementations is that it pursues several extensions of the model that connect it explicitly with microstructural models and the reconstruction of 3D white matter fiber bundles (tractography). For instance, our implementations include DKI-based microstructural models that allow the estimation of biophysical parameters, such as axonal water fraction. Moreover, we illustrate how DKI provides more general characterization of non-Gaussian diffusion compatible with complex white matter fiber architectures and gray matter, and we include a novel mean kurtosis index that is invariant to the confounding effects due to tissue dispersion. In summary, DKI in DIPY provides a well-tested, well-documented and comprehensive reference implementation for DKI. It provides a platform for wider use of DKI in research on brain disorders and in cognitive neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain–computer interfaces can provide a new communication channel and control functions to people with restricted movements. Recent studies have indicated the effectiveness of brain–computer interface (BCI) applications. Various types of applications have been introduced so far in this field, but the number of those available to the public is still insufficient. Thus, there is a need to expand the usability and accessibility of BCI applications. In this study, we introduce a BCI application for users to experience a virtual world tour. This software was built on three open-source environments and is publicly available through the GitHub repository. For a usability test, 10 healthy subjects participated in an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment and evaluated the system through a questionnaire. As a result, all the participants successfully played the BCI application with 96.6% accuracy with 20 blinks from two sessions and gave opinions on its usability (e.g., controllability, completeness, comfort, and enjoyment) through the questionnaire. We believe that this open-source BCI world tour system can be used in both research and entertainment settings and hopefully contribute to open science in the BCI field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Mood Regulatory Actions of Active and Sham Nucleus Accumbens Deep Brain Stimulation in Antidepressant Resistant Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.644921</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The antidepressant actions of deep brain stimulation (DBS) are associated with progressive neuroadaptations within the mood network, modulated in part, by neurotrophic mechanisms. We investigated the antidepressant-like effects of chronic nucleus accumbens (NAc) DBS and its association with change in glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) expression in the infralimbic cortex (IL), and the dorsal (dHIP) and ventral (vHIP) subregions of the hippocampus of antidepressant resistant rats. Antidepressant resistance was induced via daily injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 100 μg/day; 15 days) and confirmed by non-response to tricyclic antidepressant treatment (imipramine, 10 mg/kg). Portable microdevices provided continuous bilateral NAc DBS (130 Hz, 200 μA, 90 μs) for 7 days. A control sham electrode group was included, together with ACTH- and saline-treated control groups. Home cage monitoring, open field, sucrose preference, and, forced swim behavioral tests were performed. Post-mortem levels of GSK3 and mTOR, total and phosphorylated, were determined with Western blot. As previously reported, ACTH treatment blocked the immobility-reducing effects of imipramine in the forced swim test. In contrast, treatment with either active DBS or sham electrode placement in the NAc significantly reduced forced swim immobility time in ACTH-treated animals. This was associated with increased homecage activity in the DBS and sham groups relative to ACTH and saline groups, however, no differences in locomotor activity were observed in the open field test, nor were any group differences seen for sucrose consumption across groups. The antidepressant-like actions of NAc DBS and sham electrode placements were associated with an increase in levels of IL and vHIP phospho-GSK3β and phospho-mTOR, however, no differences in these protein levels were observed in the dHIP region. These data suggest that early response to electrode placement in the NAc, irrespective of whether active DBS or sham, has antidepressant-like effects in the ACTH-model of antidepressant resistance associated with distal upregulation of phospho-GSK3β and phospho-mTOR in the IL and vHIP regions of the mood network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.708181</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects upper and lower motor neurons. Familial ALS accounts for a small subset of cases (&amp;lt;10–15%) and is caused by dominant mutations in one of more than 10 known genes. Multiple genes have been causally or pathologically linked to both ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Many of these genes encode RNA-binding proteins, so the role of dysregulated RNA metabolism in neurodegeneration is being actively investigated. In addition to defects in RNA metabolism, recent studies provide emerging evidence into how RNA itself can contribute to the degeneration of both motor and cortical neurons. In this review, we discuss the roles of altered RNA metabolism and RNA-mediated toxicity in the context of TARDBP, FUS, and C9ORF72 mutations. Specifically, we focus on recent studies that describe toxic RNA as the potential initiator of disease, disease-associated defects in specific RNA metabolism pathways, as well as how RNA-based approaches can be used as potential therapies. Altogether, we highlight the importance of RNA-based investigations into the molecular progression of ALS, as well as the need for RNA-dependent structural studies of disease-linked RNA-binding proteins to identify clear therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Structural E/I Balance Constrains the Early Development of Cortical Network Activity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.687306</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neocortical networks have a characteristic constant ratio in the number of glutamatergic projection neurons (PN) and GABAergic interneurons (IN), and deviations in this ratio are often associated with developmental neuropathologies. Cultured networks with defined cellular content allowed us to ask if initial PN/IN ratios change the developmental population dynamics, and how different ratios impact the physiological excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance and the network activity development. During the first week in vitro, the IN content modulated PN numbers, increasing their proliferation in networks with higher IN proportions. The proportion of INs in each network set remained similar to the initial plating ratio during the 4 weeks cultivation period. Results from additional networks generated with more diverse cellular composition, including early-born GABA neurons, suggest that a GABA-dependent mechanism may decrease the survival of additional INs. A large variation of the PN/IN ratio did not change the balance between isolated spontaneous glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic currents charge transfer (E/I balance) measured in PNs or INs. In contrast, the E/I balance of multisynaptic bursts reflected differences in IN content. Additionally, the spontaneous activity recorded by calcium imaging showed that higher IN ratios were associated with increased frequency of network bursts combined with a decrease of participating neurons per event. In the 4th week in vitro, bursting activity was stereotypically synchronized in networks with very few INs but was more desynchronized in networks with higher IN proportions. These results suggest that the E/I balance of isolated postsynaptic currents in single cells may be regulated independently of PN/IN proportions, but the network bursts E/I balance and the maturation of spontaneous network activity critically depends upon the structural PN/IN ratio.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of acupuncture on peripheral immune function, inflammation, and cognitive impairment in vascular dementia (VD) rats.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In this study, 2-month-old healthy male Wistar rats (260–280 g) were assigned to the groups as follows: normal group (Gn, n = 10), sham-operated group (Gs, n = 10), and operated group (Go, n = 45). The Go group was established by permanent, bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). Two months after operation, the operated rats were screened by hidden platform trial and the rats with cognitive dysfunction were further randomly divided into impaired group (Gi), acupoint group (Ga), and non-acupoint group (Gna) with 10 rats in each group. The Ga group was given acupuncture treatment for 14 days with a rest for every 7 days. After treatment, the Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed to evaluate the spatial learning and memory abilities of rats. The lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood and spleen of rats were measured by flow cytometry. The levels of cytokines [i.e., interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interferon-γ (INF-γ)], chemokines (i.e., macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2)), and other inflammatory mediators (i.e., cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)) in peripheral blood and hippocampus were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with the Gn group, the Gi rats presented long escape latencies to find the platform. After acupuncture treatment, the escape latencies of the Ga group were rescued markedly when compared with the Gi group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The proportion of CD4 + T lymphocytes in both spleen and peripheral blood in the Ga group increased (P &amp;lt; 0.05) in comparison with the Gi group. There is an obvious reduction in IL-1β (P &amp;lt; 0.05), IL-2 (P &amp;lt; 0.05), TNF-α (P &amp;lt; 0.01), INF-γ (P &amp;lt; 0.01), MIP-2 (P &amp;lt; 0.05), and iNOS (P &amp;lt; 0.01), coming along with the increased levels of IL-4 and IL-10 (P &amp;lt; 0.01) in the Ga group when compared with the Gi group. In addition, the hippocampus proinflammatory factors IL-1β (P &amp;lt; 0.01), IL-2 (P &amp;lt; 0.01), TNF-α (P &amp;lt; 0.05), INF-γ (P &amp;lt; 0.05), MIP-2 (P &amp;lt; 0.05), iNOS (P &amp;lt; 0.01), and COX-2 decreased in the Ga group, whereas the anti-inflammatory factors IL-4 and IL-10 (P &amp;lt; 0.01) increased.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;There are abnormal immune function and peripheral inflammation in VD rats.

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Influence of Demographics and Vascular Risk Factors on Glymphatic Function Measured by Diffusion Along Perivascular Space</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.693787</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Assessing glymphatic function using in-vivo imaging method is of great value for understanding its contribution to major brain diseases. In the present study, we aim to validate the association between a variety of risk factors and a potential index of glymphatic function—Diffusion Tensor Image Analysis Along the Perivascular Space (ALPS index). We enrolled 142 subjects from communities and performed multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging scans. The ALPS index was calculated from diffusion tensor imaging data, and its associations with demographic factors, vascular factors were investigated using regression analyses. We found that the ALPS index was negatively associated with age (β = −0.284, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Compared to males, females had significantly higher ALPS index (β = −0.243, p = 0.001). Hypertensive subjects had significantly lower ALPS index compared to non-hypertensive subjects (β = −0.189, p = 0.013). Furthermore, venous disruption could decrease ALPS index (β = −0.215, p = 0.003). In general, our results are in consistent with previous conceptions and results from animal studies about the pathophysiology of glymphatic dysfunction. Future studies utilizing this method should consider introducing the above-mentioned factors as important covariates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.691230</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases are a class of slow-progressing terminal illnesses characterized by neuronal lesions, such as multiple sclerosis [MS, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]. Their incidence increases with age, and the associated burden on families and society will become increasingly more prominent with aging of the general population. In recent years, there is growing studies have shown that lactosylceramide (LacCer) plays a crucial role in the progression of neurodegeneration, although these diseases have different pathogenic mechanisms and etiological characteristics. Based on latest research progress, this study expounds the pathogenic role of LacCer in driving central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, as well as the role of membrane microstructure domain (lipid rafts) and metabolite gangliosides, and discusses in detail their links with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, with a view to providing new strategies and ideas for the study of pathological mechanisms and drug development for neurodegenerative diseases in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background/Objectives&lt;p&gt;Little is known regarding the prevalence and predictors of prolonged cognitive and psychological symptoms of COVID-19 among community-dwellers. We aimed to quantitatively measure self-reported metrics of fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and sleep and identify factors associated with these metrics among United States residents with or without COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We solicited 1000 adult United States residents for an online survey conducted February 3–5, 2021 utilizing a commercial crowdsourcing community research platform. The platform curates eligible participants to approximate United States demographics by age, sex, and race proportions. COVID-19 was diagnosed by laboratory testing and/or by exposure to a known positive contact with subsequent typical symptoms. Prolonged COVID-19 was self-reported and coded for those with symptoms ≥ 1 month following initial diagnosis. The primary outcomes were NIH PROMIS/Neuro-QoL short-form T-scores for fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and sleep compared among those with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms, COVID-19 without prolonged symptoms and COVID-19 negative subjects. Multivariable backwards step-wise logistic regression models were constructed to predict abnormal Neuro-QoL metrics.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Among 999 respondents, the average age was 45 years (range 18–84), 49% were male, 76 (7.6%) had a history of COVID-19 and 19/76 (25%) COVID-19 positive participants reported prolonged symptoms lasting a median of 4 months (range 1–13). Prolonged COVID-19 participants were more often younger, female, Hispanic, and had a history of depression/mood/thought disorder (all P &amp;lt; 0.05). They experienced significantly higher rates of unemployment and financial insecurity, and their symptoms created greater interference with work and household activities compared to other COVID-19 status groups (all P &amp;lt; 0.05). After adjusting for demographics, past medical history and stressor covariates in multivariable logistic regression analysis, COVID-19 status was independently predictive of worse Neuro-QoL cognitive dysfunction scores (adjusted OR 11.52, 95% CI 1.01–2.28, P = 0.047), but there were no significant differences in quantitative measures of anxiety, depression, fatigue, or sleep.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Prolonged symptoms occurred in 25% of COVID-19 positive participants, and NeuroQoL cognitive dysfunction scores were significantly worse among COVID-19 positive subjects, even after accounting for demographic and stressor covariates. Fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep scores did not differ between COVID-19 positive and negative respondents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Language Disorder in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and Corticobasal Syndrome: Neural Correlates and Detection by the MLSE Screening Tool</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.675739</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) affect speech and language as well as motor functions. Clinical and neuropathological data indicate a close relationship between these two disorders and the non-fluent variant of primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA). We use the recently developed Mini Linguistic State Examination tool (MLSE) to study speech and language disorders in patients with PSP, CBS, and nfvPPA, in combination with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Fifty-one patients (PSP N = 13, CBS N = 19, nfvPPA N = 19) and 30 age-matched controls completed the MLSE, the short form of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE), and the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination III. Thirty-eight patients and all controls underwent structural MRI at 3 Tesla, with T1 and T2-weighted images processed by surface-based and subcortical segmentation within FreeSurfer 6.0.0 to extract cortical thickness and subcortical volumes. Morphometric differences were compared between groups and correlated with the severity of speech and language impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: CBS and PSP patients showed impaired MLSE performance, compared to controls, with a similar language profile to nfvPPA, albeit less severe. All patient groups showed reduced cortical thickness in bilateral frontal regions and striatal volume. PSP and nfvPPA patients also showed reduced superior temporal cortical thickness, with additional thalamic and amygdalo-hippocampal volume reductions in nfvPPA. Multivariate analysis of brain-wide cortical thickness and subcortical volumes with MLSE domain scores revealed associations between performance on multiple speech and language domains with atrophy of left-lateralised fronto-temporal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, putamen, and caudate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The effect of PSP and CBS on speech and language overlaps with nfvPPA. These three disorders cause a common anatomical pattern of atrophy in the left frontotemporal language network and striatum. The MLSE is a short clinical screening tool that can identify the language disorder of PSP and CBS, facilitating clinical management and patient access to future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Targeted tDCS Mitigates Dual‐Task Costs to Gait and Balance in Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26156?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Among older adults, the ability to stand or walk while performing cognitive tasks (ie, dual‐tasking) requires coordinated activation of several brain networks. In this multicenter, double‐blinded, randomized, and sham‐controlled study, we examined the effects of modulating the excitability of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L‐DLPFC) and the primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) on dual‐task performance “costs” to standing and walking.


Methods
Fifty‐seven older adults without overt illness or disease completed 4 separate study visits during which they received 20 minutes of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) optimized to facilitate the excitability of the L‐DLPFC and SM1 simultaneously, or each region separately, or neither region (sham). Before and immediately after stimulation, participants completed a dual‐task paradigm in which they were asked to stand and walk with and without concurrent performance of a serial‐subtraction task.


Results
tDCS simultaneously targeting the L‐DLPFC and SM1, as well as tDCS targeting the L‐DLPFC alone, mitigated dual‐task costs to standing and walking to a greater extent than tDCS targeting SM1 alone or sham (p &amp;lt; 0.02). Blinding efficacy was excellent and participant subjective belief in the type of stimulation received (real or sham) did not contribute to the observed functional benefits of tDCS.


Interpretation
These results demonstrate that in older adults, dual‐task decrements may be amenable to change and implicate L‐DPFC excitability as a modifiable component of the control system that enables dual‐task standing and walking. tDCS may be used to improve resilience and the ability of older results to walk and stand under challenging conditions, potentially enhancing everyday functioning and reducing fall risks.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Targeting Inflammasomes to Treat Neurological Diseases</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26158?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Inflammasomes are multimeric protein complexes that can sense a plethora of microbe‐ and damage‐associated molecular signals. They play important roles in innate immunity and are key regulators of inflammation in health and disease. Inflammasome‐mediated processing and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 1β and IL‐18 and induction of pyroptosis, a proinflammatory form of cell death, have been associated with the development and progression of common immune‐mediated and degenerative central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis, brain injury, stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A growing number of pharmacological compounds inhibiting inflammasome activation and signaling show therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of the aforementioned disease conditions. Here, we illustrate regulatory mechanisms of inflammasome activation during CNS homeostasis and tissue injury. We highlight the evidence for inflammasome activation as a mechanistic underpinning in a wide range of CNS diseases and critically discuss the promise and potential limitations of therapeutic strategies that aim to inhibit the inflammasome components in neurological disorders.

Reward prediction errors (RPEs) and risk preferences have two things in common: both can shape decision making behavior, and both are commonly associated with dopamine. RPEs drive value learning and are thought to be represented in the phasic release of striatal dopamine. Risk preferences bias choices towards or away from uncertainty; they can be manipulated with drugs that target the dopaminergic system. Based on the common neural substrate, we hypothesize that RPEs and risk preferences are linked on the level of behavior as well. Here, we develop this hypothesis theoretically and test it empirically. First, we apply a recent theory of learning in the basal ganglia to predict how RPEs influence risk preferences. We find that positive RPEs should cause increased risk-seeking, while negative RPEs should cause risk-aversion. We then test our behavioral predictions using a novel bandit task in which value and risk vary independently across options. Critically, conditions are included where options vary in risk but are matched for value. We find that our prediction was correct: participants become more risk-seeking if choices are preceded by positive RPEs, and more risk-averse if choices are preceded by negative RPEs. These findings cannot be explained by other known effects, such as nonlinear utility curves or dynamic learning rates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ryRvhlwNm14&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Knowledge of genes that are critical to a tissue’s function remains difficult to ascertain and presents a major bottleneck toward a mechanistic understanding of genotype-phenotype links. Here, we present the first machine learning model–FUGUE–combining transcriptional and network features, to predict tissue-relevant genes across 30 human tissues. FUGUE achieves an average cross-validation auROC of 0.86 and auPRC of 0.50 (expected 0.09). In independent datasets, FUGUE accurately distinguishes tissue or cell type-specific genes, significantly outperforming the conventional metric based on tissue-specific expression alone. Comparison of tissue-relevant transcription factors across tissue recapitulate their developmental relationships. Interestingly, the tissue-relevant genes cluster on the genome within topologically associated domains and furthermore, are highly enriched for differentially expressed genes in the corresponding cancer type. We provide the prioritized gene lists in 30 human tissues and an open-source software to prioritize genes in a novel context given multi-sample transcriptomic data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Q0Vq1zoQvX4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Within the computational neuroscience community, there has been a focus on simulating the electrical activity of neurons, while other components of brain tissue, such as glia cells and the extracellular space, are often neglected. Standard models of extracellular potentials are based on a combination of multicompartmental models describing neural electrodynamics and volume conductor theory. Such models cannot be used to simulate the slow components of extracellular potentials, which depend on ion concentration dynamics, and the effect that this has on extracellular diffusion potentials and glial buffering currents. We here present the electrodiffusive neuron-extracellular-glia (edNEG) model, which we believe is the first model to combine compartmental neuron modeling with an electrodiffusive framework for intra- and extracellular ion concentration dynamics in a local piece of neuro-glial brain tissue. The edNEG model (i) keeps track of all intraneuronal, intraglial, and extracellular ion concentrations and electrical potentials, (ii) accounts for action potentials and dendritic calcium spikes in neurons, (iii) contains a neuronal and glial homeostatic machinery that gives physiologically realistic ion concentration dynamics, (iv) accounts for electrodiffusive transmembrane, intracellular, and extracellular ionic movements, and (v) accounts for glial and neuronal swelling caused by osmotic transmembrane pressure gradients. The edNEG model accounts for the concentration-dependent effects on ECS potentials that the standard models neglect. Using the edNEG model, we analyze these effects by splitting the extracellular potential into three components: one due to neural sink/source configurations, one due to glial sink/source configurations, and one due to extracellular diffusive currents. Through a series of simulations, we analyze the roles played by the various components and how they interact in generating the total slow potential. We conclude that the three components are of comparable magnitude and that the stimulus conditions determine which of the components that dominate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Qd30fYcDUCM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Determinants of cognition in autoimmune limbic encephalitis—A retrospective cohort study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23375?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Autoimmune limbic encephalitis (ALE) is the most common type of autoimmune encephalitis (AIE). Subacute memory disturbance, temporal lobe seizures, and psychiatric symptoms are clinical hallmarks of the disease. However, little is known on the factors contributing to cognitive functioning in ALE. Hence, we here investigate major determinants of cognitive functioning in ALE. In a retrospective analysis of 102 patients with ALE, we first compared verbal learning capacity, nonverbal learning capacity, and attentional and executive functioning by absence or presence of different types of neural autoantibodies (AABs). Subsequently we established three linear regression models including 63, 38, and 61 patients, respectively to investigate how cognitive functioning in these domains may depend on common markers of ALE such as intrathecal inflammation, blood‐cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)‐barrier function, mesiotemporal epileptiform discharges and slowing, determined by electroencephalography (EEG) and structural mesiotemporal changes, measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We also accounted for possible effects of cancer‐ and immunotherapy and other centrally effective medication. There was no effect of AAB status on cognitive functioning. Although the regression models could not predict verbal and nonverbal learning capacity, structural mesiotemporal neural network alterations on T2‐/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)‐signal‐weighted MRI and mesiotemporal epileptiform discharges or slowing on EEG exerted a significant impact on memory functions. In contrast, the regression model significantly predicted attentional and executive functioning with CSF white blood cell count and centrally effective medication being significant determinants. In this cohort, cognitive functioning in ALE does not depend on the AAB status. Common markers of ALE cannot predict memory functioning that only partially depends on structural and functional alterations of mesiotemporal neural networks. Common markers of ALE significantly predict attentional and executive functioning that is significantly related to centrally effective medication and CSF white blood cell count, which may point toward inflammation affecting brain regions beyond the limbic system.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Compared with healthy controls, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy patients with a shorter duration of disease showed differences in static and dynamic functional network connectivity (sFNC and dFNC). Compared with sFNC, dFNC analysis showed more and inconsistent inter‐network functional connectivity abnormalities. At the same time, the variability of inter‐network dFNC is correlated with orienting function.

Abstract
The brain network alterations associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) progression are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate altered patterns of static and dynamic functional network connectivity (sFNC and dFNC) in TLE with different durations of disease. In this study, 19 TLE patients with a disease duration of ≤5 years (TLE‐SD), 24 TLE patients with a disease duration of &amp;gt;5 years (TLE‐LD), and 21 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging and attention network test. We used group independent component analysis to determine the target resting‐state networks. Sliding window correlation and k‐means clustering analysis methods were used to obtain different dFNC states, temporal properties, and temporal variability. We then compared sFNC and dFNC between groups and found that compared with HCs, TLE‐SD patients had increased sFNC between the dorsal attention network and sensorimotor network/visual network (VN), but decreased sFNC between the inferior–posterior default mode network and VN. In the strongly connected dFNC state, TLE‐SD patients spent more time, had greater mean dwell time, and showed greater inconsistent abnormal network connectivity. There was a significant negative correlation between the temporal variability of auditory network‐ left fronto‐parietal network connectivity and orienting effect. No significant differences in sFNC and dFNC were detected between TLE‐LD and HC groups. These findings suggest that the damage and functional brain network abnormalities gradually occur in TLE patients after the onset of epilepsy, which might lead to functional network reorganization and compensatory remodeling as the disease progresses.</content:encoded>

Abstract
The dorsolateral striatum (DLS) of rodents is functionally subdivided into somatotopic subregions that represent each body part along both the dorsoventral and anteroposterior (A‐P) axes and play crucial roles in sensorimotor functions via corticostriatal pathways. However, little is known about the spatial gene expression patterns and heterogeneity of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) within somatotopic subregions. Here, we show that the cell adhesion molecule gene Cdh20, which encodes a Type II cadherin, is expressed in discrete subregions covering the inner orofacial area and part of the forelimb area in the ventral domain of the DLS (v‐DLS) in rats. Cdh20‐expressing cells were localized in the v‐DLS at the intermediate level of the striatum along the A‐P axis and could be classified as direct‐pathway SPNs or indirect‐pathway SPNs. Unexpectedly, comprehensive analysis revealed that Cdh20 is expressed in SPNs in the rat DLS but not in the mouse DLS or the ferret putamen (Pu). Our observations reveal that Cdh20 expression demarcates somatotopic subregions and subpopulations of SPNs specifically in the rat DLS and suggest divergent regulation of genes differentially expressed in the v‐DLS and Pu among mammals.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Ephrin‐A3 is required for tonotopic map precision and auditory functions in the mouse auditory brainstem</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25213?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We investigated the molecular basis of tonotopic map formation in the mouse auditory brainstem. We found that the axon guidance cue ephrin‐A3 is differentially expressed along the tonotopic map in the mouse auditory brainstem. Ephrin‐A3 is sufficient to repel growing auditory nerve fibers in vitro. In mice lacking ephrin‐A3, the tonotopic map is degraded in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus, and auditory activation patterns and the ability to discriminate sound frequency changes are also impaired.







Abstract
Tonotopy is a prominent feature of the vertebrate auditory system and forms the basis for sound discrimination, but the molecular mechanism that underlies its formation remains largely elusive. Ephrin/Eph signaling is known to play important roles in axon guidance during topographic mapping in other sensory systems, so we investigated its possible role in the establishment of tonotopy in the mouse cochlear nucleus. We found that ephrin‐A3 molecules are differentially expressed along the tonotopic axis in the cochlear nucleus during innervation. Ephrin‐A3 forward signaling is sufficient to repel auditory nerve fibers in a developmental stage‐dependent manner. In mice lacking ephrin‐A3, the tonotopic map is degraded and isofrequency bands of neuronal activation upon pure tone exposure become imprecise in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus. Ephrin‐A3 mutant mice also exhibit a delayed second wave in auditory brainstem responses upon sound stimuli and impaired detection of sound frequency changes. Our findings establish an essential role for ephrin‐A3 in forming precise tonotopy in the auditory brainstem to ensure accurate sound discrimination.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Characterization of Tbr2‐expressing retinal ganglion cells</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25208?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Using genetic sparse labeling and recording on a newly engineered T‐brain 2 (Tbr2)CreERT2 mouse line paired with various reporter lines, we identified seven types of Tbr2‐expressing retina ganglion cells, including M1–M6 types of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and a Pou4f1+ RGC with bushy and small dendritic arbors stratifying into the OFF sublaminae (in red). Additionally, we identified three types of Tbr2‐expressing amacrine cells, including two widefield and a mediumfield displaced amacrine cell (AC) types, all with dendritic arbors stratifying into the ON sublaminae (in black). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Tbr2 is essential for the survival of these RGCs and displaced ACs, as well as maintaining the expression of Opn4.







Abstract
The mammalian retina contains more than 40 retinal ganglion cell (RGC) subtypes based on their unique morphologies, functions, and molecular profiles. Among them, intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) are the first specified RGC type emerging from a common retinal progenitor pool during development. Previous work has shown that T‐box transcription factor T‐brain 2 (Tbr2) is essential for the formation and maintenance of ipRGCs, and that Tbr2‐expressing RGCs activate Opn4 expression upon native ipRGC ablation, suggesting that Tbr2+ RGCs contain a reservoir for ipRGCs. However, the identity of Tbr2+ RGCs has not been fully vetted. Here, using genetic sparse labeling and single cell recording, we showed that Tbr2‐expressing retinal neurons include RGCs and a subset of GABAergic displaced amacrine cells (dACs). Most Tbr2+ RGCs are intrinsically photosensitive and morphologically resemble native ipRGCs with identical retinofugal projections. Tbr2+ RGCs also include a unique and rare Pou4f1‐expressing OFF RGC subtype. Using a loss‐of‐function strategy, we have further demonstrated that Tbr2 is essential for the survival of these RGCs and dACs, as well as maintaining the expression of Opn4. These data set a strong foundation to study how Tbr2 regulates ipRGC development and survival, as well as the expression of molecular machinery regulating intrinsic photosensitivity.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Axonal injury alters the extracellular glial environment of the axon initial segment and allows substantial mitochondrial influx into axon initial segment</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25212?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Our present focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy analysis demonstrates marked mitochondrial influx into the axon initial segment (AIS) in response to axonal injury. In the healthy (control) AIS, few mitochondria were observed, whereas mitochondria were abundantly localized in the cell body, axon hillock, and axon. On the other hand, after injury, numerous mitochondria were observed throughout the AIS (scale bar 5 μm).







Abstract
The axon initial segment (AIS) is structurally and functionally distinct from other regions of the axon, yet alterations in the milieu of the AIS after brain injury have not been well characterized. In this study, we have examined extracellular and intracellular changes in the AIS after hypoglossal nerve injury. Microglial adhesions to the AIS were rarely observed in healthy controls, whereas microglial adhesions to the AIS became apparent in the axonal injury model. Regarding intra‐AIS morphology, we focused on mitochondria because mitochondrial flow into the injured axon appears critical for axonal regeneration. To visualize mitochondria specifically in injured axons, we used Atf3:BAC transgenic mice whose mitochondria were labeled with GFP in response to nerve injury. These mice clearly showed mitochondrial localization in the AIS after nerve injury. To precisely confirm the light microscopic observations, we performed three‐dimensional ultrastructural analysis using focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM). Although the healthy AIS was not surrounded by microglia, tight microglial adhesions with thick processes adhering to the AIS were observed after injury. FIB/SEM simultaneously allowed the observation of mitochondrial localization in the AIS. In the AIS of non‐injured neurons, few mitochondria were observed, whereas mitochondria were abundantly localized in the cell body, axon hillock, and axon. Intriguingly, in the injured AIS, numerous mitochondria were observed throughout the AIS. Taken together, axonal injury changes the extracellular glial environment surrounding the AIS and intracellular mitochondrial localization in the AIS. These changes would be crucial responses, perhaps for injured neurons to regenerate after axonal injury.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Gut Microbiome Signatures of Risk and Prodromal Markers of Parkinson Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26128?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Alterations of the gut microbiome in Parkinson disease (PD) have been repeatedly demonstrated. However, little is known about whether such alterations precede disease onset and how they relate to risk and prodromal markers of PD. We investigated associations of these features with gut microbiome composition.


Methods
Established risk and prodromal markers of PD as well as factors related to diet/lifestyle, bowel function, and medication were studied in relation to bacterial α‐/β‐diversity, enterotypes, and differential abundance in stool samples of 666 elderly TREND (Tübingen Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration) study participants.


Results
Among risk and prodromal markers, physical inactivity, occupational solvent exposure, and constipation showed associations with α‐diversity. Physical inactivity, sex, constipation, possible rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and smoking were associated with β‐diversity. Subthreshold parkinsonism and physical inactivity showed an interaction effect. Among other factors, age and urate‐lowering medication were associated with α‐ and β‐diversity. Constipation was highest in individuals with the Firmicutes‐enriched enterotype, and physical inactivity was most frequent in the Bacteroides‐enriched enterotype. Constipation was lowest and subthreshold parkinsonism least frequent in individuals with the Prevotella‐enriched enterotype. Differentially abundant taxa were linked to constipation, physical inactivity, possible RBD, smoking, and subthreshold parkinsonism. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, olfactory loss, depression, orthostatic hypotension, urinary/erectile dysfunction, PD family history, and the prodromal PD probability showed no significant microbiome associations.


Interpretation
Several risk and prodromal markers of PD are associated with gut microbiome composition. However, the impact of the gut microbiome on PD risk and potential microbiome‐dependent subtypes in the prodrome of PD need further investigation based on prospective clinical and (multi)omics data in incident PD cases.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Non–Cell Autonomous Epileptogenesis in Focal Cortical Dysplasia</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26149?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Low‐level somatic mosaicism in the brain has been shown to be a major genetic cause of intractable focal epilepsy. However, how a relatively few mutation‐carrying neurons are able to induce epileptogenesis at the local network level remains poorly understood.


Methods
To probe the origin of epileptogenesis, we measured the excitability of neurons with MTOR mutation and nearby nonmutated neurons recorded by whole‐cell patch‐clamp and array‐based electrodes comparing the topographic distribution of mutation. Computational simulation is used to understand neural network‐level changes based on electrophysiological properties. To examine the underlying mechanism, we measured inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs in mutated neurons and nearby neurons by electrophysiological and histological methods using the mouse model and postoperative human brain tissue for cortical dysplasia. To explain non–cell‐autonomous hyperexcitability, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase was injected into mice to enhance adenosine signaling and to mitigate hyperactivity of nearby nonmutated neurons.


Results
We generated mice with a low‐level somatic mutation in MTOR presenting spontaneous seizures. The seizure‐triggering hyperexcitability originated from nonmutated neurons near mutation‐carrying neurons, which proved to be less excitable than nonmutated neurons. Interestingly, the net balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto mutated neurons remained unchanged. Additionally, we found that inhibition of adenosine kinase, which affects adenosine metabolism and neuronal excitability, reduced the hyperexcitability of nonmutated neurons.


Interpretation
This study shows that neurons carrying somatic mutations in MTOR lead to focal epileptogenesis via non–cell‐autonomous hyperexcitability of nearby nonmutated neurons. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Organization and neural connections of the lateral complex in the brain of the desert locust</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25209?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Single cell tracer injections suggest that the lateral complex in the brain of the desert locust integrates sensory signals with internal compass information to drive descending and premotor neurons that are likely involved in steering of the animal during locomotion. Overlap of inputs and outputs of the central complex in the gall and ovoid body of the lateral complex suggest feedback loops in the sky compass system.







Abstract
The lateral complexes (LXs) are bilaterally paired neuropils in the insect brain that mediate communication between the central complex (CX), a brain center controlling spatial orientation, various sensory processing areas, and thoracic motor centers that execute locomotion. The LX of the desert locust consists of the lateral accessory lobe (LAL), and the medial and lateral bulb. We have analyzed the anatomical organization and the neuronal connections of the LX in the locust, to provide a basis for future functional studies. Reanalyzing the morphology of neurons connecting the CX and the LX revealed likely feedback loops in the sky compass network of the CX via connections in the gall of the LAL and a newly identified neuropil termed ovoid body. In addition, we characterized 16 different types of neuron that connect the LAL with other areas in the brain. Eight types of neuron provide information flow between both LALs, five types are LAL input neurons, and three types are LAL output neurons. Among these are neurons providing input from sensory brain areas such as the lobula and antennal neuropils. Brain regions most often targeted by LAL neurons are the posterior slope, the wedge, and the crepine. Two descending neurons with dendrites in the LAL were identified. Our data support and complement existing knowledge about how the LAL is embedded in the neuronal network involved in processing of sensory information and generation of appropriate behavioral output for goal‐directed locomotion.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.647877</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite advancements in the development of cell-based in-vitro neuronal network models, the lack of appropriate computational tools limits their analyses. Methods aimed at deciphering the effective connections between neurons from extracellular spike recordings would increase utility of in vitro local neural circuits, especially for studies of human neural development and disease based on induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). Current techniques allow statistical inference of functional couplings in the network but are fundamentally unable to correctly identify indirect and apparent connections between neurons, generating redundant maps with limited ability to model the causal dynamics of the network. In this paper, we describe a novel mathematically rigorous, model-free method to map effective—direct and causal—connectivity of neuronal networks from multi-electrode array data. The inference algorithm uses a combination of statistical and deterministic indicators which, first, enables identification of all existing functional links in the network and then reconstructs the directed and causal connection diagram via a super-selective rule enabling highly accurate classification of direct, indirect, and apparent links. Our method can be generally applied to the functional characterization of any in vitro neuronal networks. Here, we show that, given its accuracy, it can offer important insights into the functional development of in vitro hiPSC-derived neuronal cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Early Blindness Limits the Head-Trunk Coordination Development for Horizontal Reorientation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.699312</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;During locomotion, goal-directed orientation movements in the horizontal plane require a high degree of head-trunk coordination. This coordination is acquired during childhood. Since early visual loss is linked to motor control deficits, we hypothesize that it may also affect the development of head-trunk coordination for horizontal rotations. However, no direct evidence exists about such a deficit. To assess this hypothesis, we tested early blind and sighted individuals on dynamic sound alignment through a head-pointing task with sounds delivered in acoustic virtual reality. Participants could perform the head-pointing with no constraints, or they were asked to immobilize their trunk voluntarily. Kinematics of head and trunk were assessed individually and with respect to each other, together with spatial task performance. Results indicated a head-trunk coordination deficit in the early blind group; yet, they could dampen their trunk movements so as not to let their coordination deficit affect spatial performance. This result highlights the role of vision in the development of head-trunk coordination for goal-directed horizontal rotations. It also calls for clarification on the impact of the blindness-related head-trunk coordination deficit on the performance of more complex tasks akin to daily life activities such as steering during locomotion or reaching to targets placed sideways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Functional Changes in Stroke Following Rehabilitation Using Brain-Computer Interface-Assisted Motor Imagery With and Without tDCS: A Pilot Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.692304</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interface-assisted motor imagery (MI-BCI) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been proven effective in post-stroke motor function enhancement, yet whether the combination of MI-BCI and tDCS may further benefit the rehabilitation of motor functions remains unknown. This study investigated brain functional activity and connectivity changes after a 2 week MI-BCI and tDCS combined intervention in 19 chronic subcortical stroke patients. Patients were randomized into MI-BCI with tDCS group and MI-BCI only group who underwent 10 sessions of 20 min real or sham tDCS followed by 1 h MI-BCI training with robotic feedback. We derived amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity (FC) from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data pre- and post-intervention. At baseline, stroke patients had lower ALFF in the ipsilesional somatomotor network (SMN), lower ReHo in the contralesional insula, and higher ALFF/Reho in the bilateral posterior default mode network (DMN) compared to age-matched healthy controls. After the intervention, the MI-BCI only group showed increased ALFF in contralesional SMN and decreased ALFF/Reho in the posterior DMN. In contrast, no post-intervention changes were detected in the MI-BCI + tDCS group. Furthermore, higher increases in ALFF/ReHo/FC measures were related to better motor function recovery (measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment scores) in the MI-BCI group while the opposite association was detected in the MI-BCI + tDCS group. Taken together, our findings suggest that brain functional re-normalization and network-specific compensation were found in the MI-BCI only group but not in the MI-BCI + tDCS group although both groups gained significant motor function improvement post-intervention with no group difference. MI-BCI and tDCS may exert differential or even opposing impact on brain functional reorganization during post-stroke motor rehabilitation; therefore, the integration of the two strategies requires further refinement to improve efficacy and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.665809</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study had two goals: to clarify the relationship between electroencephalographic (EEG) features estimated while non-native speakers listened to a second language (L2) and their proficiency in L2 determined by a conventional paper test and to provide a predictive model for L2 proficiency based on EEG features. We measured EEG signals from 205 native Japanese speakers, who varied widely in English proficiency while they listened to natural speech in English. Following the EEG measurement, they completed a conventional English listening test for Japanese speakers. We estimated multivariate temporal response functions separately for word class, speech rate, word position, and parts of speech. We found significant negative correlations between listening score and 17 EEG features, which included peak latency of early components (corresponding to N1 and P2) for both open and closed class words and peak latency and amplitude of a late component (corresponding to N400) for open class words. On the basis of the EEG features, we generated a predictive model for Japanese speakers’ English listening proficiency. The correlation coefficient between the true and predicted listening scores was 0.51. Our results suggest that L2 or foreign language ability can be assessed using neural signatures measured while listening to natural speech, without the need of a conventional paper test.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Determination of Dynamic Brain Connectivity via Spectral Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.655576</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spectral analysis based on neural field theory is used to analyze dynamic connectivity via methods based on the physical eigenmodes that are the building blocks of brain dynamics. These approaches integrate over space instead of averaging over time and thereby greatly reduce or remove the temporal averaging effects, windowing artifacts, and noise at fine spatial scales that have bedeviled the analysis of dynamical functional connectivity (FC). The dependences of FC on dynamics at various timescales, and on windowing, are clarified and the results are demonstrated on simple test cases, demonstrating how modes provide directly interpretable insights that can be related to brain structure and function. It is shown that FC is dynamic even when the brain structure and effective connectivity are fixed, and that the observed patterns of FC are dominated by relatively few eigenmodes. Common artifacts introduced by statistical analyses that do not incorporate the physical nature of the brain are discussed and it is shown that these are avoided by spectral analysis using eigenmodes. Unlike most published artificially discretized “resting state networks” and other statistically-derived patterns, eigenmodes overlap, with every mode extending across the whole brain and every region participating in every mode—just like the vibrations that give rise to notes of a musical instrument. Despite this, modes are independent and do not interact in the linear limit. It is argued that for many purposes the intrinsic limitations of covariance-based FC instead favor the alternative of tracking eigenmode coefficients vs. time, which provide a compact representation that is directly related to biophysical brain dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neurobehavioral, Neuromotor, and Neurocognitive Effects in Agricultural Workers and Their Children Exposed to Pyrethroid Pesticides: A Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.648171</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, pyrethroids have emerged as a less toxic alternative to eliminate insect pests. However, some animal studies and studies with children show that these pesticides are toxic and lead to neurobehavioral effects similar to other pesticides, such as organophosphates. The purpose of this review was to systematize the epidemiological scientific evidence about the neurobehavioral, neuromotor, and neurocognitive effects in agricultural workers and their children exposed to pyrethroid pesticides. We conducted two searches (with different terms) in PubMed and Scopus databases, including articles in Spanish and English language on the effects of occupational exposure to pyrethroid pesticides associated with neurobehavioral, neuromotor, and neurocognitive functioning of agricultural workers and their children. There were no filters by year, and the search included studies till march 2021. To develop the search, we followed the recommendations contained in the PRISMA guidelines and the PICO strategy. The results show that in 66.6% of the studies reviewed (8 of 12 studies), agricultural workers or their children occupationally exposed to pyrethroid pesticides have a higher risk of presenting difficulties in their neurocognitive, neuromotor, or neurobehavioral performance, mainly associated with attention, processing speed (linked to hand-eye coordination), and motor coordination. There are still few studies that address this issue. However, the quality of most of the research conducted (83% intermediate or high quality) confirms the risk for neurobehavioral health in agricultural workers due to occupational exposure to pyrethroids. More research is required evaluating the exposure to pyrethroids, including biomarkers and validated neurobehavioral and neuromotor tests, in addition to evaluating the effect of simultaneous exposure to other hazardous pesticides. Assuming that the use of pyrethroids is increasing considerably and faster than the scientific evidence, it is suggested as a precautionary principle to regulate, more strictly, the sale of pyrethroids and other pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Effects of 1p/19q Codeletion on Immune Phenotype in Low Grade Glioma</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.704344</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Chromosome 1p/19q codeletion is one of the most important genetic alterations for low grade gliomas (LGGs), and patients with 1p/19q codeletion have significantly prolonged survival compared to those without the codeletion. And the tumor immune microenvironment also plays a vital role in the tumor progression and prognosis. However, the effect of 1p/19q codeletion on the tumor immune microenvironment in LGGs is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Immune cell infiltration of 281 LGGs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 543 LGGs from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) were analyzed for immune cell infiltration through three bioinformatics tools: ESTIMATE algorithm, TIMER, and xCell. The infiltrating level of immune cells and expression of immune checkpoint genes were compared between different groups classified by 1p/19q codeletion and IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase) mutation status. The differential biological processes and signaling pathways were evaluated through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Correlations were analyzed using Spearman correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: 1p/19q codeletion was associated with immune-related biological processes in LGGs. The infiltrating level of multiple kinds of immune cells and expression of immune checkpoint genes were significantly lower in 1p/19q codeletion LGGs compared to 1p/19q non-codeletion cohorts. There are 127 immune-related genes on chromosome 1p or 19q, such as TGFB1, JAK1, and CSF1. The mRNA expression of these genes was positively correlated with their DNA copy number. These genes are distributed in multiple immune categories, such as chemokines/cytokines, TGF-β family members, and TNF family members, regulating immune cell infiltration and expression of the immune checkpoint genes in tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results indicated that 1p/19q codeletion status is closely associated with the immunosuppressive microenvironment in LGGs. LGGs with 1p/19q codeletion display less immune cell infiltration and lower expression of immune checkpoint genes than 1p/19q non-codeletion cases. Mechanistically, this may be, at least in part, due to the deletion of copy number of immune-related genes in LGGs with 1p/19q codeletion. Our findings may be relevant to investigate immune evasion in LGGs and contribute to the design of immunotherapeutic strategies for patients with LGGs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: A Large-Scale Open Motion Dataset (KFall) and Benchmark Algorithms for Detecting Pre-impact Fall of the Elderly Using Wearable Inertial Sensors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.692865</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Research on pre-impact fall detection with wearable inertial sensors (detecting fall accidents prior to body-ground impacts) has grown rapidly in the past decade due to its great potential for developing an on-demand fall-related injury prevention system. However, most researchers use their own datasets to develop fall detection algorithms and rarely make these datasets publicly available, which poses a challenge to fairly evaluate the performance of different algorithms on a common basis. Even though some open datasets have been established recently, most of them are impractical for pre-impact fall detection due to the lack of temporal labels for fall time and limited types of motions. In order to overcome these limitations, in this study, we proposed and publicly provided a large-scale motion dataset called “KFall,” which was developed from 32 Korean participants while wearing an inertial sensor on the low back and performing 21 types of activities of daily living and 15 types of simulated falls. In addition, ready-to-use temporal labels of the fall time based on synchronized motion videos were published along with the dataset. Those enhancements make KFall the first public dataset suitable for pre-impact fall detection, not just for post-fall detection. Importantly, we have also developed three different types of latest algorithms (threshold based, support-vector machine, and deep learning), using the KFall dataset for pre-impact fall detection so that researchers and practitioners can flexibly choose the corresponding algorithm. Deep learning algorithm achieved both high overall accuracy and balanced sensitivity (99.32%) and specificity (99.01%) for pre-impact fall detection. Support vector machine also demonstrated a good performance with a sensitivity of 99.77% and specificity of 94.87%. However, the threshold-based algorithm showed relatively poor results, especially the specificity (83.43%) was much lower than the sensitivity (95.50%). The performance of these algorithms could be regarded as a benchmark for further development of better algorithms with this new dataset. This large-scale motion dataset and benchmark algorithms could provide researchers and practitioners with valuable data and references to develop new technologies and strategies for pre-impact fall detection and proactive injury prevention for the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Adaptation of Melodic Intonation Therapy to Greek: A Clinical Study in Broca’s Aphasia With Brain Perfusion SPECT Validation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.664581</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Melodic intonation therapy (MIT) is one of the most well-known treatment methods which is based on pitch and rhythm and was developed to increase verbal output in adults with non-fluent aphasia. Although MIT has been adapted to several languages, in Greece it is almost unknown. The aim of the proposed study is twofold: (1) to translate and adapt the MIT to the Greek language, and (2) to conduct an experimental study in order to examine the effect of MIT on Greek patients with Broca’s aphasia. To this aim, a 64-year-old, right-handed male who had a 6-year primary school education level, no musical abilities and poor performance on the recognition of prosody attended the MIT intervention program almost two and a half years after the event of suffering an ischemic stroke. The MIT intervention was administered three times per week for a 12-week period, in which each session lasted from 30 to 40 min. The patient underwent three assessments all using both the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination–Short Form (BDAE-SF) and brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT); (1) before the MIT, (2) immediately after, and (3) 3 months after the completion of MIT. The results from the BDAE-SF revealed an impressive improvement on both trained and prepositional speech production, immediately after the completion of the MIT, and a stable improved performance 3 months after MIT. The SPECT scan revealed reactivation of the perilesional areas of the left hemisphere, and considerably improved perfusion of the frontal lobe, the anterior temporal lobe, and the upper part of the parietal lobe of the right hemisphere. The improvement persisted and even expanded 3 months after MIT. Therefore, MIT is a promising intervention program and its positive effects last for at least 3 months after the completion of the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

What humans do when exposed to uncertainty, incomplete information, and a dynamic environment influenced by other agents remains an open scientific challenge with important implications in both science and engineering applications. In these contexts, humans handle social situations by employing elaborate cognitive mechanisms such as theory of mind and risk sensitivity. Here we resort to a novel theoretical model, showing that both mechanisms leverage coordinated behaviors among self-regarding individuals. Particularly, we resort to cumulative prospect theory and level-&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; recursions to show how biases towards optimism and the capacity of planning ahead significantly increase coordinated, cooperative action. These results suggest that the reason why humans are good at coordination may stem from the fact that we are cognitively biased to do so.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zFZqp0O5tk8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Origins of 1/f-like tissue oxygenation fluctuations in the murine cortex</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/4DhxNkqSHqE/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Qingguang Zhang, Kyle W. Gheres, Patrick J. Drew&lt;/p&gt;

The concentration of oxygen in the brain spontaneously fluctuates, and the distribution of power in these fluctuations has a 1/f-like spectra, where the power present at low frequencies of the power spectrum is orders of magnitude higher than at higher frequencies. Though these oscillations have been interpreted as being driven by neural activity, the origin of these 1/f-like oscillations is not well understood. Here, to gain insight of the origin of the 1/f-like oxygen fluctuations, we investigated the dynamics of tissue oxygenation and neural activity in awake behaving mice. We found that oxygen signal recorded from the cortex of mice had 1/f-like spectra. However, band-limited power in the local field potential did not show corresponding 1/f-like fluctuations. When local neural activity was suppressed, the 1/f-like fluctuations in oxygen concentration persisted. Two-photon measurements of erythrocyte spacing fluctuations and mathematical modeling show that stochastic fluctuations in erythrocyte flow could underlie 1/f-like dynamics in oxygenation. These results suggest that the discrete nature of erythrocytes and their irregular flow, rather than fluctuations in neural activity, could drive 1/f-like fluctuations in tissue oxygenation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4DhxNkqSHqE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Perception of biological motion by jumping spiders</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Massimo De Agrò, Daniela C. Rößler, Kris Kim, Paul S. Shamble&lt;/p&gt;

The body of most creatures is composed of interconnected joints. During motion, the spatial location of these joints changes, but they must maintain their distances to one another, effectively moving semirigidly. This pattern, termed “biological motion” in the literature, can be used as a visual cue, enabling many animals (including humans) to distinguish animate from inanimate objects. Crucially, even artificially created scrambled stimuli, with no recognizable structure but that maintains semirigid movement patterns, are perceived as animated. However, to date, biological motion perception has only been reported in vertebrates. Due to their highly developed visual system and complex visual behaviors, we investigated the capability of jumping spiders to discriminate biological from nonbiological motion using point-light display stimuli. These kinds of stimuli maintain motion information while being devoid of structure. By constraining spiders on a spherical treadmill, we simultaneously presented 2 point-light displays with specific dynamic traits and registered their preference by observing which pattern they turned toward. Spiders clearly demonstrated the ability to discriminate between biological motion and random stimuli, but curiously turned preferentially toward the latter. However, they showed no preference between biological and scrambled displays, results that match responses produced by vertebrates. Crucially, spiders turned toward the stimuli when these were only visible by the lateral eyes, evidence that this task may be eye specific. This represents the first demonstration of biological motion recognition in an invertebrate, posing crucial questions about the evolutionary history of this ability and complex visual processing in nonvertebrate systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jQzDXvO9mUw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

PhD-trained scientists are essential contributors to the workforce in diverse employment sectors that include academia, industry, government, and nonprofit organizations. Hence, best practices for training the future biomedical workforce are of national concern. Complementing coursework and laboratory research training, many institutions now offer professional training that enables career exploration and develops a broad set of skills critical to various career paths. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded academic institutions to design innovative programming to enable this professional development through a mechanism known as Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training (BEST). Programming at the NIH BEST awardee institutions included career panels, skill-building workshops, job search workshops, site visits, and internships. Because doctoral training is lengthy and requires focused attention on dissertation research, an initial concern was that students participating in additional complementary training activities might exhibit an increased time to degree or diminished research productivity. Metrics were analyzed from 10 NIH BEST awardee institutions to address this concern, using time to degree and publication records as measures of efficiency and productivity. Comparing doctoral students who participated to those who did not, results revealed that across these diverse academic institutions, there were no differences in time to degree or manuscript output. Our findings support the policy that doctoral students should participate in career and professional development opportunities that are intended to prepare them for a variety of diverse and important careers in the workforce.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/SSF8SOyNgz4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Orexin (hypocretin) mediates light‐dependent fluctuation of hippocampal function in a diurnal rodent</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23376?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Environmental lighting conditions play a central role in cognitive function, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Utilizing a diurnal rodent model, the Nile grass rat (Arvicanthis niloticus), we previously found that daytime light intensity affects hippocampal function in this species in a manner similar to its effects in humans. Compared to animals housed in a 12:12 h bright light–dark (brLD) cycle, grass rats kept in a 12:12 h dim light–dark (dimLD) cycle showed impaired spatial memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) and reduced CA1 apical dendritic spine density. The present study explored the neural substrates mediating the effects of daylight intensity on hippocampal function focusing on the hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin) system. First, animals housed in dimLD were treated with daily intranasal administration of orexin A peptide over five training days of the MWM task. Compared to vehicle controls, this treatment led to superior spatial memory accompanied by increased phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase II α and glutamate receptor 1 within the CA1. To assess the role of hippocampal orexinergic signaling, an adeno‐associated viral vector (AAV) expressing an orexin receptor 1 (OX1R) shRNA was injected into the dorsal hippocampus targeting the CA1 of animals housed in brLD. AAV‐mediated knockdown of OX1R within the hippocampus resulted in deficits in MWM performance and reduced CA1 apical dendritic spine density. These results are consistent with the view that the hypothalamic orexinergic system underlies the modulatory role of daytime illumination on hippocampal function in diurnal mammals.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Thalamo-Nucleus Accumbens Projections in Motivated Behaviors and Addiction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.711350</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ventral striatum, also called nucleus accumbens (NAc), has long been known to integrate information from cortical, thalamic, midbrain and limbic nuclei to mediate goal-directed behaviors. Until recently thalamic afferents have been overlooked when studying the functions and connectivity of the NAc. However, findings from recent studies have shed light on the importance and roles of precise Thalamus to NAc connections in motivated behaviors and in addiction. In this review, we summarize studies using techniques such as chemo- and optogenetics, electrophysiology and in vivo calcium imaging to elucidate the complex functioning of the thalamo-NAc afferents, with a particular highlight on the projections from the Paraventricular Thalamus (PVT) to the NAc. We will focus on the recent advances in the understanding of the roles of these neuronal connections in motivated behaviors, with a special emphasis on their implications in addiction, from cue-reward association to the mechanisms driving relapse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Plasticity of GluN1 at Ventral Hippocampal Synapses in the Infralimbic Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.695964</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although the infralimbic cortex (IL) is not thought to play a role in fear acquisition, recent experiments found evidence that synaptic plasticity is occurring at ventral hippocampal (vHPC) synapses in IL during auditory fear acquisition as measured by changes in the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated currents in male rats. These electrophysiological data suggest that fear conditioning changes the expression of NMDA receptors on vHPC-to-IL synapses. To further evaluate the plasticity of NMDA receptors at this specific synapse, we injected AAV particles expressing channelrhodopsin-EYFP into the vHPC of male and female rats to label vHPC projections with EYFP. To test for NMDA receptor changes in vHPC-to-IL synapses after fear learning, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to quantify synaptosomes isolated from IL tissue punches that were positive for EYFP and the obligatory GluN1 subunit. More EYFP+/GluN1+ synaptosomes with greater average expression of GluN1 were isolated from male rats exposed to auditory fear conditioning (AFC) than those exposed to context and tones only or to contextual fear conditioning (CFC), suggesting that AFC increased NMDA receptor expression in males. In a second experiment, we found that pairing the tones and shocks was required to induce the molecular changes and that fear extinction did not reverse the changes. In contrast, females showed similar levels of EYFP+/GluN1+ synaptosomes in all behavioral groups. These findings suggest that AFC induces synaptic plasticity of NMDA receptors in the vHPC-to-IL projection in males, while female rats rely on different synaptic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Neuromodulation and Behavioral Flexibility in Larval Zebrafish: From Neurotransmitters to Circuits</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.718951</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animals adapt their behaviors to their ever-changing needs. Internal states, such as hunger, fear, stress, and arousal are important behavioral modulators controlling the way an organism perceives sensory stimuli and reacts to them. The translucent zebrafish larva is an ideal model organism for studying neuronal circuits regulating brain states, owning to the possibility of easy imaging and manipulating activity of genetically identified neurons while the animal performs stereotyped and well-characterized behaviors. The main neuromodulatory circuits present in mammals can also be found in the larval zebrafish brain, with the advantage that they contain small numbers of neurons. Importantly, imaging and behavioral techniques can be combined with methods for generating targeted genetic modifications to reveal the molecular underpinnings mediating the functions of such circuits. In this review we discuss how studying the larval zebrafish brain has contributed to advance our understanding of circuits and molecular mechanisms regulating neuromodulation and behavioral flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Cell-Type-Specific High Throughput Toxicity Testing in Human Midbrain Organoids</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.715054</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Toxicity testing is a crucial step in the development and approval of chemical compounds for human contact and consumption. However, existing model systems often fall short in their prediction of human toxicity in vivo because they may not sufficiently recapitulate human physiology. The complexity of three-dimensional (3D) human organ-like cell culture systems (“organoids”) can generate potentially more relevant models of human physiology and disease, including toxicity predictions. However, so far, the inherent biological heterogeneity and cumbersome generation and analysis of organoids has rendered efficient, unbiased, high throughput evaluation of toxic effects in these systems challenging. Recent advances in both standardization and quantitative fluorescent imaging enabled us to dissect the toxicities of compound exposure to separate cellular subpopulations within human organoids at the single-cell level in a framework that is compatible with high throughput approaches. Screening a library of 84 compounds in standardized human automated midbrain organoids (AMOs) generated from two independent cell lines correctly recognized known nigrostriatal toxicants. This approach further identified the flame retardant 3,3′,5,5′-tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) as a selective toxicant for dopaminergic neurons in the context of human midbrain-like tissues for the first time. Results were verified with high reproducibility in more detailed dose-response experiments. Further, we demonstrate higher sensitivity in 3D AMOs than in 2D cultures to the known neurotoxic effects of the pesticide lindane. Overall, the automated nature of our workflow is freely scalable and demonstrates the feasibility of quantitatively assessing cell-type-specific toxicity in human organoids in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: How to Arrange Follow-Up Time-Intervals for Longitudinal Brain MRI Studies in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682812</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal brain MRI monitoring in neurodegeneration potentially provides substantial insights into the temporal dynamics of the underlying biological process, but is time- and cost-intensive and may be a burden to patients with disabling neurological diseases. Thus, the conceptualization of follow-up time-intervals in longitudinal MRI studies is an essential challenge and substantial for the results. The objective of this work is to discuss the association of time-intervals and the results of longitudinal trends in the frequently used design of one baseline and two follow-up scans.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Different analytical approaches for calculating the linear trend of longitudinal parameters were studied in simulations including their performance of dealing with outliers; these simulations were based on the longitudinal striatum atrophy in MRI data of Huntington’s disease patients, detected by atlas-based volumetry (ABV).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;For the design of one baseline and two follow-up visits, the simulations with outliers revealed optimum results for identical time-intervals between baseline and follow-up scans. However, identical time-intervals between the three acquisitions lead to the paradox that, depending on the fit method, the first follow-up scan results do not influence the final results of a linear trend analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;This theoretical study analyses how the design of longitudinal imaging studies with one baseline and two follow-up visits influences the results. Suggestions for the analysis of longitudinal trends are provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Evaluation of Multilevel Surgeries in Children With Spastic Cerebral Palsy Based on Surface Electromyography</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.680645</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The root mean square (RMS) of the surface electromyography (sEMG) signal can respond to neuromuscular function, which displays a positive correlation with muscle force and muscle tension under positive and passive conditions, respectively. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in muscle force and tension after multilevel surgical treatments, functional selective posterior rhizotomy (FSPR) and tibial anterior muscle transfer surgery, and evaluate their clinical effect in children with spastic cerebral palsy (SCP) during walking. Children with diplegia (n = 13) and hemiplegia (n = 3) with ages from 4 to 18 years participated in this study. They were requested to walk barefoot at a self-selected speed on a 15-m-long lane. The patient's joints' range of motion (ROM) and sEMG signal of six major muscles were assessed before and after the multilevel surgeries. The gait cycle was divided into seven phases, and muscle activation state can be divided into positive and passive conditions during gait cycle. For each phase, the RMS of the sEMG signal amplitude was calculated and also normalized by a linear envelope (10-ms running RMS window). The muscle tension of the gastrocnemius decreased significantly during the loading response, initial swing, and terminal swing (p &amp;lt; 0.05), which helped the knee joint to get the maximum extension when the heel is on the ground and made the heel land smoothly. The muscle force of the gastrocnemius increased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) during the mid-stance, terminal stance, and pre-swing, which could generate the driving force for the human body to move forward. The muscle tension of the biceps femoris and semitendinosus decreased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) during the terminal stance, pre-swing, and initial swing. The decreased muscle tension could relieve the burden of the knee flexion when the knee joint was passively flexed. At the terminal swing, the muscle force of the tibial anterior increased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05), which could improve the ankle dorsiflexion ability and prevent foot drop and push forward. Thus, the neuromuscular function of cerebral palsy during walking can be evaluated by the muscle activation state and the RMS of the sEMG signal, which showed that multilevel surgical treatments are feasible and effective to treat SCP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Multiple Sources of Cholinergic Input to the Superior Olivary Complex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.715369</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The superior olivary complex (SOC) is a major computation center in the brainstem auditory system. Despite previous reports of high expression levels of cholinergic receptors in the SOC, few studies have addressed the functional role of acetylcholine in the region. The source of the cholinergic innervation is unknown for all but one of the nuclei of the SOC, limiting our understanding of cholinergic modulation. The medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, a key inhibitory link in monaural and binaural circuits, receives cholinergic input from other SOC nuclei and also from the pontomesencephalic tegmentum. Here, we investigate whether these same regions are sources of cholinergic input to other SOC nuclei. We also investigate whether individual cholinergic cells can send collateral projections bilaterally (i.e., into both SOCs), as has been shown at other levels of the subcortical auditory system. We injected retrograde tract tracers into the SOC in gerbils, then identified retrogradely-labeled cells that were also immunolabeled for choline acetyltransferase, a marker for cholinergic cells. We found that both the SOC and the pontomesencephalic tegmentum (PMT) send cholinergic projections into the SOC, and these projections appear to innervate all major SOC nuclei. We also observed a small cholinergic projection into the SOC from the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus of the reticular formation. These various sources likely serve different functions; e.g., the PMT has been associated with things such as arousal and sensory gating whereas the SOC may provide feedback more closely tuned to specific auditory stimuli. Further, individual cholinergic neurons in each of these regions can send branching projections into both SOCs. Such projections present an opportunity for cholinergic modulation to be coordinated across the auditory brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Single Cell Transcriptomics of Ependymal Cells Across Age, Region and Species Reveals Cilia-Related and Metal Ion Regulatory Roles as Major Conserved Ependymal Cell Functions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.703951</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ependymal cells are ciliated-epithelial glial cells that develop from radial glia along the surface of the ventricles of the brain and the spinal canal. They play a critical role in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) homeostasis, brain metabolism, and the clearance of waste from the brain. These cells have been implicated in disease across the lifespan including developmental disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease. Despite this, ependymal cells remain largely understudied. Using single-cell RNA sequencing data extracted from publicly available datasets, we make key findings regarding the remarkable conservation of ependymal cell gene signatures across age, region, and species. Through this unbiased analysis, we have discovered that one of the most overrepresented ependymal cell functions that we observed relates to a critically understudied role in metal ion homeostasis. Our analysis also revealed distinct subtypes and states of ependymal cells across regions and ages of the nervous system. For example, neonatal ependymal cells maintained a gene signature consistent with developmental processes such as determination of left/right symmetry; while adult ventricular ependymal cells, not spinal canal ependymal cells, appeared to express genes involved in regulating cellular transport and inflammation. Together, these findings highlight underappreciated functions of ependymal cells, which will be important to investigate in order to better understand these cells in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A Temporal Activity of CA1 Neurons Underlying Short-Term Memory for Social Recognition Altered in PTEN Mouse Models of Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.699315</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Memory-guided social recognition identifies someone from previous encounters or experiences, but the mechanisms of social memory remain unclear. Here, we find that a short-term memory from experiencing a stranger mouse lasting under 30 min interval is essential for subsequent social recognition in mice, but that interval prolonged to hours by replacing the stranger mouse with a familiar littermate. Optogenetic silencing of dorsal CA1 neuronal activity during trials or inter-trial intervals disrupted short-term memory-guided social recognition, without affecting the ability of being sociable or long-term memory-guided social recognition. Postnatal knockdown or knockout of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-associated phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene in dorsal hippocampal CA1 similarly impaired neuronal firing rate in vitro and altered firing pattern during social recognition. These PTEN mice showed deficits in social recognition with stranger mouse rather than littermate and exhibited impairment in T-maze spontaneous alternation task for testing short-term spatial memory. Thus, we suggest that a temporal activity of dorsal CA1 neurons may underlie formation of short-term memory to be critical for organizing subsequent social recognition but that is possibly disrupted in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.698172</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the past decades, microbiome research has evolved rapidly and became a hot topic in basic, preclinical and clinical research, for the pharmaceutical industry and for the general public. With the help of new high-throughput sequencing technologies tremendous progress has been made in the characterization of host-microbiota interactions identifying the microbiome as a major factor shaping mammalian physiology. This development also led to the discovery of the gut-brain axis as the crucial connection between gut microbiota and the nervous system. Consequently, a rapidly growing body of evidence emerged suggesting that the commensal gut microbiota plays a vital role in brain physiology. Moreover, it became evident that the communication along this microbiota-gut-brain axis is bidirectional and primarily mediated by biologically active microbial molecules and metabolites. Further, intestinal dysbiosis leading to changes in the bidirectional relationship between gut microbiota and the nervous system was linked to the pathogenesis of several psychiatric and neurological disorders. Here, we discuss the impact of the gut microbiota on the brain in health and disease, specifically as regards to neuronal homeostasis, development and normal aging as well as their role in neurological diseases of the highest socioeconomic burden such as Alzheimer’s disease and stroke. Subsequently, we utilize Alzheimer’s disease and stroke to examine the translational research value of current mouse models in the spotlight of microbiome research. Finally, we propose future strategies on how we could conduct translational microbiome research in the field of neuroscience that may lead to the identification of novel treatments for human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is one of the most common symptoms of many neurological disorders. The typical excessive, synchronous and aberrant firing of neurons originating from different cerebral areas cause spontaneous recurrent epileptic seizures. Prolonged epilepsy can lead to neuronal damage and cell death. The mechanisms underlying epileptic pathogenesis and neuronal death remain unclear. Ferroptosis is a newly defined form of regulated cell death that is characterized by the overload of intracellular iron ions, leading to the accumulation of lethal lipid-based reactive oxygen species (ROS). To date, studies have mainly focused on its role in tumors and various neurological disorders, including epilepsy. Current research shows that inhibition of ferroptosis is likely to be an effective therapeutic approach for epilepsy. In this review, we outline the pathogenesis of ferroptosis, regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis, related regulatory molecules, and their effects on epilepsy, providing a new direction for discovering new therapeutic targets in epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.695380</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders – estimated to affect at least 65 million worldwide. Most of the epilepsy research has so far focused on how to dampen neuronal discharges and to explain how changes in intrinsic neuronal activity or network function cause seizures. As a result, pharmacological therapy has largely been limited to symptomatic treatment targeted at neurons. Given the expanding spectrum of functions ascribed to the non-neuronal constituents of the brain, in both physiological brain function and in brain disorders, it is natural to closely consider the roles of astrocytes in epilepsy. It is now widely accepted that astrocytes are key controllers of the composition of the extracellular fluids, and may directly interact with neurons by releasing gliotransmitters. A central tenet is that astrocytic intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals promote release of such signaling substances, either through synaptic or non-synaptic mechanisms. Accruing evidence suggests that astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals play important roles in both seizures and epilepsy, and this review aims to highlight the current knowledge of the roles of this central astrocytic signaling mechanism in ictogenesis and epileptogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.689611</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with a range of abnormalities pertaining to socialization, communication, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests. Owing to its complexity, the etiology of ASD remains incompletely understood. The presynaptic G protein-coupled glutamate receptor metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGluR7) is known to be essential for synaptic transmission and is also tightly linked with ASD incidence. Herein, we report that prefrontal cortex (PFC) mGluR7 protein levels were decreased in C57BL/6J mice exposed to valproic acid (VPA) and BTBR T&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Itpr3&lt;sup&gt;tf&lt;/sup&gt;/J mice. The overexpression of mGluR7 in the PFC of these mice using a lentiviral vector was sufficient to reduce the severity of ASD-like behavioral patterns such that animals exhibited decreases in abnormal social interactions and communication, anxiety-like, and stereotyped/repetitive behaviors. Intriguingly, patch-clamp recordings revealed that the overexpression of mGluR7 suppressed neuronal excitability by inhibiting action potential discharge frequencies, together with enhanced action potential threshold and increased rheobase. These data offer a scientific basis for the additional study of mGluR7 as a promising therapeutic target in ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A Novel Small Molecule Neurotrophin-3 Analogue Promotes Inner Ear Neurite Outgrowth and Synaptogenesis In vitro</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.666706</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensorineural hearing loss is irreversible and is associated with the loss of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and sensory hair cells within the inner ear. Improving spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) survival, neurite outgrowth, and synaptogenesis could lead to significant gains for hearing-impaired patients. There has therefore been intense interest in the use of neurotrophic factors in the inner ear to promote both survival of SGNs and re-wiring of sensory hair cells by surviving SGNs. Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) represent the primary neurotrophins in the inner ear during development and throughout adulthood, and have demonstrated potential for SGN survival and neurite outgrowth. We have pioneered a hybrid molecule approach to maximize SGN stimulation in vivo, in which small molecule analogues of neurotrophins are linked to bisphosphonates, which in turn bind to cochlear bone. We have previously shown that a small molecule BDNF analogue coupled to risedronate binds to bone matrix and promotes SGN neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis in vitro. Because NT-3 has been shown in a variety of contexts to have a greater regenerative capacity in the cochlea than BDNF, we sought to develop a similar approach for NT-3. 1Aa is a small molecule analogue of NT-3 that has been shown to activate cells through TrkC, the NT-3 receptor, although its activity on SGNs has not previously been described. Herein we describe the design and synthesis of 1Aa and a covalent conjugate of 1Aa with risedronate, Ris-1Aa. We demonstrate that both 1Aa and Ris-1Aa stimulate neurite outgrowth in SGN cultures at a significantly higher level compared to controls. Ris-1Aa maintained its neurotrophic activity when bound to hydroxyapatite, the primary mineral component of bone. Both 1Aa and Ris-1Aa promote significant synaptic regeneration in cochlear explant cultures, and both 1Aa and Ris-1Aa appear to act at least partly through TrkC. Our results provide the first evidence that a small molecule analogue of NT-3 can stimulate SGNs and promote regeneration of synapses between SGNs and inner hair cells. Our findings support the promise of hydroxyapatite-targeting bisphosphonate conjugation as a novel strategy to deliver neurotrophic agents to SGNs encased within cochlear bone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.698601</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial autophagy is an early defense and protection process that selectively clears dysfunctional or excessive mitochondria through a distinctive mechanism to maintain intracellular homeostasis. Mitochondrial dysfunction during cerebral stroke involves metabolic disbalance, oxidative stress, apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and abnormal mitochondrial autophagy. This article reviews the research progress on the mechanism of mitochondrial autophagy in ischemic stroke to provide a theoretical basis for further research on mitochondrial autophagy and the treatment of ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Toll‐like receptor 10 controls TLR2‐induced cytokine production in monocytes from patients with Parkinson's disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24916?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Parkinson's disease (PD) patients present higher frequency of intermediate monocytes expressing TLR10. The expression of TLR10 on monocytes can protect against PD by controlling TLR2‐induced cytokine production.

Abstract
Peripheral inflammation, particularly mediated by monocytes, can cause neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the mechanism of TLR2‐induced cytokine impairment in peripheral monocytes from PD patients and the association between the presence of CD14+TLR10+ monocytes and PD severity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PD patients and healthy individuals were evaluated for TLR expression on monocyte subsets (CD14 and CD16 expression) using flow cytometry. Moreover, cytokines were evaluated using flow cytometry after stimulation with Pam3Cys (TLR2/TLR1 agonist) in the absence or presence of neutralizing antibodies to TLR10. The severity of PD was assessed using the unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) and motor activity, anxiety (BAI), depression (BDI), and fatigue (PD Fatigue Scale‐16) scales. The frequency of CD14+TLR10+ monocytes and expression intensity of TLR2 and TLR10 were higher in patients with PD than healthy individuals. The frequency of intermediate monocytes (CD14++CD16+) was not significantly increased in patients with PD, but was the main monocyte subset expressing TLR10. The TLR2/TLR1‐impaired cytokine production (IL‐6, TNFα, IL‐8, and IL‐10) in PD patients was reversed by neutralizing TLR10. The high frequency of total CD14+TLR10+ monocytes was associated with a reduction in the severity of PD according to the evaluation of motor and nonmotor symptoms. Peripheral monocytes from patients with PD showed phenotypic and functional alterations. The expression of TLR10 on monocytes can protect against PD by controlling TLR2‐induced cytokine production. Furthermore, data suggested that a low frequency of CD14+TLR10+ monocytes indicates the severity of PD. The results identified new opportunities for the development of novel PD neuroprotective therapies.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genome‐Wide Association Study Identifies Risk Loci for Cluster Headache</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26150?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
This study was undertaken to identify susceptibility loci for cluster headache and obtain insights into relevant disease pathways.


Methods
We carried out a genome‐wide association study, where 852 UK and 591 Swedish cluster headache cases were compared with 5,614 and 1,134 controls, respectively. Following quality control and imputation, single variant association testing was conducted using a logistic mixed model for each cohort. The 2 cohorts were subsequently combined in a merged analysis. Downstream analyses, such as gene‐set enrichment, functional variant annotation, prediction and pathway analyses, were performed.


Results
Initial independent analysis identified 2 replicable cluster headache susceptibility loci on chromosome 2. A merged analysis identified an additional locus on chromosome 1 and confirmed a locus significant in the UK analysis on chromosome 6, which overlaps with a previously known migraine locus. The lead single nucleotide polymorphisms were rs113658130 (p = 1.92 × 10−17, odds ratio [OR] = 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.37–1.66) and rs4519530 (p = 6.98 × 10−17, OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.34–1.61) on chromosome 2, rs12121134 on chromosome 1 (p = 1.66 × 10−8, OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.22–1.52), and rs11153082 (p = 1.85 × 10−8, OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.19–1.42) on chromosome 6. Downstream analyses implicated immunological processes in the pathogenesis of cluster headache.


Interpretation
We identified and replicated several genome‐wide significant associations supporting a genetic predisposition in cluster headache in a genome‐wide association study involving 1,443 cases. Replication in larger independent cohorts combined with comprehensive phenotyping, in relation to, for example, treatment response and cluster headache subtypes, could provide unprecedented insights into genotype–phenotype correlations and the pathophysiological pathways underlying cluster headache.

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/4_Ck3iMJ2Do/article</link>

Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) are mutualistic interactions formed between soil fungi and plant roots. AM symbiosis is a fundamental and widespread trait in plants with the potential to sustainably enhance future crop yields. However, improving AM fungal association in crop species requires a fundamental understanding of host colonisation dynamics across varying agronomic and ecological contexts. To this end, we demonstrate the use of betalain pigments as in vivo visual markers for the occurrence and distribution of AM fungal colonisation by &lt;i&gt;Rhizophagus irregularis&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Medicago truncatula&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana benthamiana&lt;/i&gt; roots. Using established and novel AM-responsive promoters, we assembled multigene reporter constructs that enable the AM-controlled expression of the core betalain synthesis genes. We show that betalain colouration is specifically induced in root tissues and cells where fungal colonisation has occurred. In a rhizotron setup, we also demonstrate that betalain staining allows for the noninvasive tracing of fungal colonisation along the root system over time. We present MycoRed, a useful innovative method that will expand and complement currently used fungal visualisation techniques to advance knowledge in the field of AM symbiosis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4_Ck3iMJ2Do&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
The events of 2020, including the pandemic which highlighted the extent of health disparities in the United States, combined with the Black Lives Matter protests, have focused public attention on the systemic inequities that continue to afflict our nation. Publicly available data from the National Center for Education Statistics show that our discipline of neuroscience shows the same types of disparities, particularly for African‐American students. I have drawn on data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data Survey of U.S. colleges and universities to show that while the number of graduates from neuroscience undergraduate and graduate degree programs has grown dramatically in this century, only a small percentage of those graduates are African American, and the numbers are growing very slowly. I also present data on the neuroscience PhD program at my institution, Delaware State University, the only Historically Black University in the United States to offer a PhD in neuroscience. Because a high percentage of our students and graduates are African American, our small, young program has the potential for great impact in diversifying our discipline of neuroscience. While elite colleges and research‐intensive universities have been engaged for decades in efforts to increase diversity in their academic programs, change is slow, and large inequities remain. With Delaware State University's neuroscience PhD program as an example, I hope to convince readers that it is time for our nation to recognize the institutions that are best positioned to serve students from communities of color, and direct resources to support their growth and success.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Recent insights on astrocyte mechanisms in CNS homeostasis, pathology, and repair</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24922?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Astrocytes play essential roles in development, homeostasis, injury, and repair of the central nervous system (CNS). Their development is tightly regulated by distinct spatial and temporal cues during embryogenesis and into adulthood throughout the CNS. Astrocytes have several important responsibilities such as regulating blood flow and permeability of the blood‐CNS barrier, glucose metabolism and storage, synapse formation and function, and axon myelination. In CNS pathologies, astrocytes also play critical parts in both injury and repair mechanisms. Upon injury, they undergo a robust phenotypic shift known as “reactive astrogliosis,” which results in both constructive and deleterious outcomes. Astrocyte activation and migration at the site of injury provides an early defense mechanism to minimize the extent of injury by enveloping the lesion area. However, astrogliosis also contributes to the inhibitory microenvironment of CNS injury and potentiate secondary injury mechanisms, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and glutamate excitotoxicity, which facilitate neurodegeneration in CNS pathologies. Intriguingly, reactive astrocytes are increasingly a focus in current therapeutic strategies as their activation can be modulated toward a neuroprotective and reparative phenotype. This review will discuss recent advancements in knowledge regarding the development and role of astrocytes in the healthy and pathological CNS. We will also review how astrocytes have been genetically modified to optimize their reparative potential after injury, and how they may be transdifferentiated into neurons and oligodendrocytes to promote repair after CNS injury and neurodegeneration.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Anatomy and function of retinorecipient arborization fields in zebrafish</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25204?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
In 1994, Burrill and Easter described the retinal projections in embryonic and larval zebrafish, introducing the term “arborization fields” (AFs) for the retinorecipient areas. AFs were numbered from 1 to 10 according to their positions along the optic tract. With the exception of AF10 (neuropil of the optic tectum), annotations of AFs remained tentative. Here we offer an update on the likely identities and functions of zebrafish AFs after successfully matching classical neuroanatomy to the digital Max Planck Zebrafish Brain Atlas. In our system, individual AFs are neuropil areas associated with the following nuclei: AF1 with the suprachiasmatic nucleus; AF2 with the posterior parvocellular preoptic nucleus; AF3 and AF4 with the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus; AF4 with the anterior and intermediate thalamic nuclei; AF5 with the dorsal accessory optic nucleus; AF7 with the parvocellular superficial pretectal nucleus; AF8 with the central pretectal nucleus; and AF9d and AF9v with the dorsal and ventral periventricular pretectal nuclei. AF6 is probably part of the accessory optic system. Imaging, ablation, and activation experiments showed contributions of AF5 and potentially AF6 to optokinetic and optomotor reflexes, AF4 to phototaxis, and AF7 to prey detection. AF6, AF8 and AF9v respond to dimming, and AF4 and AF9d to brightening. While few annotations remain tentative, it is apparent that the larval zebrafish visual system is anatomically and functionally continuous with its adult successor and fits the general cyprinid pattern. This study illustrates the synergy created by merging classical neuroanatomy with a cellular‐resolution digital brain atlas resource and functional imaging in larval zebrafish.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective
Identifying common genetic variants that confer genetic risk for cluster headache.


Methods
We conducted a case–control study in the Dutch Leiden University Cluster headache neuro‐Analysis program (LUCA) study population (n = 840) and unselected controls from the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity Study (NEO; n = 1,457). Replication was performed in a Norwegian sample of 144 cases from the Trondheim Cluster headache sample and 1,800 controls from the Nord‐Trøndelag Health Survey (HUNT). Gene set and tissue enrichment analyses, blood cell‐derived RNA‐sequencing of genes around the risk loci and linkage disequilibrium score regression were part of the downstream analyses.


Results
An association was found with cluster headache for 4 independent loci (r2 &amp;lt; 0.1) with genomewide significance (p &amp;lt; 5 × 10−8), rs11579212 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.33–1.72 near RP11‐815 M8.1), rs6541998 (OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.37–1.74 near MERTK), rs10184573 (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.26–1.61 near AC093590.1), and rs2499799 (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.54–0.73 near UFL1/FHL5), collectively explaining 7.2% of the variance of cluster headache. SNPs rs11579212, rs10184573, and rs976357, as proxy SNP for rs2499799 (r2 = 1.0), replicated in the Norwegian sample (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Gene‐based mapping yielded ASZ1 as possible fifth locus. RNA‐sequencing indicated differential expression of POLR1B and TMEM87B in cluster headache patients.


Interpretation
This genomewide association study (GWAS) identified and replicated genetic risk loci for cluster headaches with effect sizes larger than those typically seen in complex genetic disorders. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Sex Differences in the Ventral Tegmental Area and Nucleus Accumbens Proteome at Baseline and Following Nicotine Exposure</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.657064</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sex differences in behaviors relevant to nicotine addiction have been observed in rodent models and human subjects. Behavioral, imaging, and epidemiological studies also suggest underlying sex differences in mesolimbic dopamine signaling pathways. In this study we evaluated the proteome in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell in male and female mice. Experimental groups included two mouse strains (C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6J) at baseline, a sub-chronic, rewarding regimen of nicotine in C3H/HeJ mice, and chronic nicotine administration and withdrawal in C57BL/6J mice. Isobaric labeling with a TMT 10-plex system, sample fractionation, and tandem mass spectrometry were used to quantify changes in protein abundance. In C3H/HeJ mice, similar numbers of proteins were differentially regulated between sexes at baseline compared with within each sex after sub-chronic nicotine administration. In C57BL/6J mice, there were significantly greater numbers of proteins differentially regulated between sexes at baseline compared with within each sex after chronic nicotine administration and withdrawal. Despite differences by sex, strain, and nicotine exposure parameters, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32, Ppp1r1b) were repeatedly identified as significantly altered proteins, especially in the VTA. Further, network analyses showed sex- and nicotine-dependent regulation of a number of signaling pathways, including dopaminergic signaling. Sub-chronic nicotine exposure in female mice increased proteins related to dopaminergic signaling in the NAc shell but decreased them in the VTA, whereas the opposite pattern was observed in male mice. In contrast, dopaminergic signaling pathways were similarly upregulated in both male and female VTA after chronic nicotine and withdrawal. Overall, this study identifies significant sex differences in the proteome of the mesolimbic system, at baseline and after nicotine reward or withdrawal, which may help explain differential trajectories and susceptibility to nicotine addiction in males and females.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.706786</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The protective effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on myelin integrity have been extensively studied, and growing evidence suggests that rTMS is beneficial in improving cognitive functions and promoting myelin repair. However, the association between cognitive improvement due to rTMS and changes in brain lipids remains elusive. In this study, we used the Y-maze and 3-chamber tests, as well as a mass spectrometry-based lipidomic approach in a CPZ-induced demyelination model in mice to assess the protective effects of rTMS on cuprizone (CPZ)-induced cognitive impairment and evaluate changes in lipid composition in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and striatum. We found that CPZ induced cognitive impairment and remarkable changes in brain lipids, specifically in glycerophospholipids. Moreover, the changes in lipids within the prefrontal cortex were more extensive, compared to those observed in the hippocampus and striatum. Notably, rTMS ameliorated CPZ-induced cognitive impairment and partially normalized CPZ-induced lipid changes. Taken together, our data suggest that rTMS may reverse cognitive behavioral changes caused by CPZ-induced demyelination by modulating the brain lipidome, providing new insights into the therapeutic mechanism of rTMS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Mapping Knowledge Structure and Research Frontiers of Ultrasound-Induced Blood-Brain Barrier Opening: A Scientometric Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.706105</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Among the effective approaches developed for blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening, ultrasound is recognized as a non-invasive technique that can induce localized BBB opening transiently and repeatedly. This technique has aroused broad attention from researchers worldwide, and numerous articles have been published recently. However, no existing study has systematically examined this field from a scientometric perspective. The aim of this study was to summarize the knowledge structure and identify emerging trends and potential hotspots in this field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Publications related to ultrasound-induced BBB opening published from 1998 to 2020 were retrieved from Web of Science Core Collection. The search strategies were as follows: topic: (“blood brain barrier” OR “BBB”) AND topic: (ultrasound OR ultrason* OR acoustic* OR sonopora*). The document type was set to articles or reviews with language restriction to English. Three different analysis tools including one online platform, VOS viewer1.6.16, and CiteSpace V5.7.R2 software were used to conduct this scientometric study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 1,201 valid records were included in the final analysis. The majority of scientific publication was produced by authors from North America, Eastern Asia, and Western Europe. Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology was the most prominent journal. The USA, China, and Canada were the most productive countries. Hynynen K, and Mcdannold N were key researchers with considerable academic influence. According to analysis of keywords, four main research directions were identified: cluster 1 (microbubbles study), cluster 2 (management of intracranial tumors), cluster 3 (ultrasound parameters and mechanisms study), and cluster 4 (treatment of neurodegenerative diseases). The current research hotspot has shifted from the basic research of ultrasound and microbubbles to management of intracranial tumors and neurodegenerative diseases. Burst detection analysis showed that Parkinson's disease, doxorubicin, gold nanoparticle, glioblastoma, gene therapy, and Alzheimer's disease may continue to be the research frontiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Ultrasound-induced BBB opening research is in a period of robust development. This study is a starting point, providing a comprehensive overview, development landscape, and future opportunities of this technology, which standout as a useful reference for researchers and decision makers interested in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Changes in Resting-State Spontaneous Brain Activity in Patients With Allergic Rhinitis: A Pilot Neuroimaging Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.697299</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an inflammatory disorder of the nose caused by immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated immune response to allergens. Apart from the typical symptoms of sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion, behavioral complications were also reported to be associated with the progression of AR, such as cognitive deficits, mood changes, memory decline, attention deficiency, poor school performance, anxiety, and depression. Recent human studies have suggested that alterations in brain function caused by allergen exposure may precipitate high levels of anxiety and emotional reactivity in asthma patients. But until now, there is no direct evidence of the relationship between brain activity and allergic rhinitis.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to excavate whether there remain functional changes of brain activity in AR patients. We measured the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and the z conversion of ALFF (zALFF) in 20 patients with AR and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) using the rs-fMRI data.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with healthy controls, AR patients exhibited lower ALFF values in the precuneus (PCUN) and higher ALFF values in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ALFF values of these features were significantly correlated with the visual analog scale (VAS) scores, the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) scores, the subscales of RQLQ, and specific IgE, partly.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We found changes in resting-state spontaneous brain activity in AR patients with hypoactivity in the PCUN and hyperactivity of the ACC. The brain-related symptoms of AR might be another potential clinical intervention target for improving the life quality of AR patients. Further attention to brain activity is essential for a deeper understanding of AR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.690743</link>
	<content:encoded>Objectives&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to (1) explore the changes in topological properties of static and dynamic brain functional networks after nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) radiotherapy (RT) using rs-fMRI and graph theoretical analysis, (2) explore the correlation between cognitive function and changes in brain function, and (3) add to the understanding of the pathogenesis of radiation brain injury (RBI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifty-four patients were divided into 3 groups according to time after RT: PT1 (0–6 months); PT2 (&amp;gt;6 to ≤12 months); and PT3 (&amp;gt;12 months). 29 normal controls (NCs) were included. The subjects’ topological properties were evaluated by graph-theoretic network analysis, the functional connectivity of static functional networks was calculated using network-based statistics, and the dynamic functional network matrix was subjected to cluster analysis. Finally, correlation analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between the altered network parameters and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Assortativity, hierarchy, and network efficiency were significantly abnormal in the PT1 group compared with the NC or PT3 group. The small-world variance in the PT3 group was smaller than that in NCs. The Nodal ClustCoeff of Postcentral_R in the PT2 group was significantly smaller than that in PT3 and NC groups. Functional connectivities were significantly reduced in the patient groups. Most of the functional connectivities of the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) were shown to be significantly reduced in all three patient groups. Most of the functional connectivities of the insula showed significantly reduced in the PT1 and PT3 groups, and most of the functional connectivities in brain regions such as frontal and parietal lobes showed significantly reduced in the PT2 and PT3 groups. These abnormal functional connectivities were correlated with scores on multiple scales that primarily assessed memory, executive ability, and overall cognitive function. The frequency F of occurrence of various states in each subject differed significantly, and the interaction effect of group and state was significant.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The disruption of static and dynamic functional network stability, reduced network efficiency and reduced functional connectivity may be potential biomarkers of RBI. Our findings may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of RBI from the perspective of functional networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Study of Human Tacit Knowledge Based on Electroencephalogram Signal Characteristics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.690633</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tacit knowledge is the kind of knowledge that is difficult to transfer to another person by means of writing it down or verbalizing it. In the mineral grinding process, the proficiency of the operators depends on the tacit knowledge gained from their experience and training rather than on knowledge learned from a handbook. This article proposed a method combining the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and the industrial process to detect the proficiency of the operators in the mineral grinding process to reveal the effect of tacit knowledge on the functional cortical connection. The functional brain networks of operators were established based on partial direct coherence and directed transfer function of EEG, and the multi-classifiers were used with the graph-theoretic indexes of the FBNs as input to distinguish the trained operators (Hps) from the non-trained operators (Lps). The results showed that the brain networks of Hps had a better connectivity than those of Lps (p &amp;lt; 0.01), and the accuracy of classification was up to 94.2%. Our studies confirm that based on the performance of EEG features and the combination of industrial operational operation and cognitive processes, the proficiency of the operators can be detected.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Dual-Threshold-Based Microstate Analysis on Characterizing Temporal Dynamics of Affective Process and Emotion Recognition From EEG Signals</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.689791</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, emotion classification from electroencephalogram (EEG) data has attracted much attention. As EEG is an unsteady and rapidly changing voltage signal, the features extracted from EEG usually change dramatically, whereas emotion states change gradually. Most existing feature extraction approaches do not consider these differences between EEG and emotion. Microstate analysis could capture important spatio-temporal properties of EEG signals. At the same time, it could reduce the fast-changing EEG signals to a sequence of prototypical topographical maps. While microstate analysis has been widely used to study brain function, few studies have used this method to analyze how brain responds to emotional auditory stimuli. In this study, the authors proposed a novel feature extraction method based on EEG microstates for emotion recognition. Determining the optimal number of microstates automatically is a challenge for applying microstate analysis to emotion. This research proposed dual-threshold-based atomize and agglomerate hierarchical clustering (DTAAHC) to determine the optimal number of microstate classes automatically. By using the proposed method to model the temporal dynamics of auditory emotion process, we extracted microstate characteristics as novel temporospatial features to improve the performance of emotion recognition from EEG signals. We evaluated the proposed method on two datasets. For public music-evoked EEG Dataset for Emotion Analysis using Physiological signals, the microstate analysis identified 10 microstates which together explained around 86% of the data in global field power peaks. The accuracy of emotion recognition achieved 75.8% in valence and 77.1% in arousal using microstate sequence characteristics as features. Compared to previous studies, the proposed method outperformed the current feature sets. For the speech-evoked EEG dataset, the microstate analysis identified nine microstates which together explained around 85% of the data. The accuracy of emotion recognition achieved 74.2% in valence and 72.3% in arousal using microstate sequence characteristics as features. The experimental results indicated that microstate characteristics can effectively improve the performance of emotion recognition from EEG signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Synaptic Plasticity in Memristive Artificial Synapses and Their Robustness Against Noisy Inputs</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.660894</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emerging brain-inspired neuromorphic computing paradigms require devices that can emulate the complete functionality of biological synapses upon different neuronal activities in order to process big data flows in an efficient and cognitive manner while being robust against any noisy input. The memristive device has been proposed as a promising candidate for emulating artificial synapses due to their complex multilevel and dynamical plastic behaviors. In this work, we exploit ultrastable analog BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (BFO)-based memristive devices for experimentally demonstrating that BFO artificial synapses support various long-term plastic functions, i.e., spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), cycle number-dependent plasticity (CNDP), and spiking rate-dependent plasticity (SRDP). The study on the impact of electrical stimuli in terms of pulse width and amplitude on STDP behaviors shows that their learning windows possess a wide range of timescale configurability, which can be a function of applied waveform. Moreover, beyond SRDP, the systematical and comparative study on generalized frequency-dependent plasticity (FDP) is carried out, which reveals for the first time that the ratio modulation between pulse width and pulse interval time within one spike cycle can result in both synaptic potentiation and depression effect within the same firing frequency. The impact of intrinsic neuronal noise on the STDP function of a single BFO artificial synapse can be neglected because thermal noise is two orders of magnitude smaller than the writing voltage and because the cycle-to-cycle variation of the current–voltage characteristics of a single BFO artificial synapses is small. However, extrinsic voltage fluctuations, e.g., in neural networks, cause a noisy input into the artificial synapses of the neural network. Here, the impact of extrinsic neuronal noise on the STDP function of a single BFO artificial synapse is analyzed in order to understand the robustness of plastic behavior in memristive artificial synapses against extrinsic noisy input.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: NIRS-ICA: A MATLAB Toolbox for Independent Component Analysis Applied in fNIRS Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.683735</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Independent component analysis (ICA) is a multivariate approach that has been widely used in analyzing brain imaging data. In the field of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), its promising effectiveness has been shown in both removing noise and extracting neuronal activity-related sources. The application of ICA remains challenging due to its complexity in usage, and an easy-to-use toolbox dedicated to ICA processing is still lacking in the fNIRS community. In this study, we propose NIRS-ICA, an open-source MATLAB toolbox to ease the difficulty of ICA application for fNIRS studies. NIRS-ICA incorporates commonly used ICA algorithms for source separation, user-friendly GUI, and quantitative evaluation metrics assisting source selection, which facilitate both removing noise and extracting neuronal activity-related sources. The options used in the processing can also be reported easily, which promotes using ICA in a more reproducible way. The proposed toolbox is validated and demonstrated based on both simulative and real fNIRS datasets. We expect the release of the toolbox will extent the application for ICA in the fNIRS community.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Structural Features of the Human Connectome That Facilitate the Switching of Brain Dynamics via Noradrenergic Neuromodulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.687075</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The structural connectivity of human brain allows the coexistence of segregated and integrated states of activity. Neuromodulatory systems facilitate the transition between these functional states and recent computational studies have shown how an interplay between the noradrenergic and cholinergic systems define these transitions. However, there is still much to be known about the interaction between the structural connectivity and the effect of neuromodulation, and to what extent the connectome facilitates dynamic transitions. In this work, we use a whole brain model, based on the Jasen and Rit equations plus a human structural connectivity matrix, to find out which structural features of the human connectome network define the optimal neuromodulatory effects. We simulated the effect of the noradrenergic system as changes in filter gain, and studied its effects related to the global-, local-, and meso-scale features of the connectome. At the global-scale, we found that the ability of the network of transiting through a variety of dynamical states is disrupted by randomization of the connection weights. By simulating neuromodulation of partial subsets of nodes, we found that transitions between integrated and segregated states are more easily achieved when targeting nodes with greater connection strengths—local feature—or belonging to the rich club—meso-scale feature. Overall, our findings clarify how the network spatial features, at different levels, interact with neuromodulation to facilitate the switching between segregated and integrated brain states and to sustain a richer brain dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Quantitative Assessment of Stress Through EEG During a Virtual Reality Stress-Relax Session</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.684423</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have addressed stress level classification via electroencephalography (EEG) and machine learning. These works typically use EEG-based features, like power spectral density (PSD), to develop stress classifiers. Nonetheless, these classifiers are usually limited to the discrimination of two (stress and no stress) or three (low, medium, and high) stress levels. In this study we propose an alternative for quantitative stress assessment based on EEG and regression algorithms. To this aim, we conducted a group of 23 participants (mean age 22.65 ± 5.48) over a stress-relax experience while monitoring their EEG. First, we stressed the participants via the Montreal imaging stress task (MIST), and then we led them through a 360-degree virtual reality (VR) relaxation experience. Throughout the session, the participants reported their self-perceived stress level (SPSL) via surveys. Subsequently, we extracted spectral features from the EEG of the participants and we developed individual models based on regression algorithms to predict their SPSL. We evaluated stress regression performance in terms of the mean squared percentage error (MSPE) and the correlation coefficient (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The results yielded from this evaluation (MSPE = 10.62 ± 2.12, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.92 ± 0.02) suggest that our approach predicted the stress level of the participants with remarkable performance. These results may have a positive impact in diverse areas that could benefit from stress level quantitative prediction. These areas include research fields like neuromarketing, and training of professionals such as surgeons, industrial workers, or firefighters, that often face stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Unconventional animal models for traumatic brain injury and chronic traumatic encephalopathy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24920?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the main causes of death worldwide. It is a complex injury that influences cellular physiology, causes neuronal cell death, and affects molecular pathways in the brain. This in turn can result in sensory, motor, and behavioral alterations that deeply impact the quality of life. Repetitive mild TBI can progress into chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative condition linked to severe behavioral changes. While current animal models of TBI and CTE such as rodents, are useful to explore affected pathways, clinical findings therein have rarely translated into clinical applications, possibly because of the many morphofunctional differences between the model animals and humans. It is therefore important to complement these studies with alternative animal models that may better replicate the individuality of human TBI. Comparative studies in animals with naturally evolved brain protection such as bighorn sheep, woodpeckers, and whales, may provide preventive applications in humans. The advantages of an in‐depth study of these unconventional animals are threefold. First, to increase knowledge of the often‐understudied species in question; second, to improve common animal models based on the study of their extreme counterparts; and finally, to tap into a source of biological inspiration for comparative studies and translational applications in humans.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pathogenic MAST3 Variants in the STK Domain Are Associated with Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26147?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The MAST family of microtubule‐associated serine–threonine kinases (STKs) have distinct expression patterns in the developing and mature human and mouse brain. To date, only MAST1 has been conclusively associated with neurological disease, with de novo variants in individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder, including a mega corpus callosum.


Methods
Using exome sequencing, we identify MAST3 missense variants in individuals with epilepsy. We also assess the effect of these variants on the ability of MAST3 to phosphorylate the target gene product ARPP‐16 in HEK293T cells.


Results
We identify de novo missense variants in the STK domain in 11 individuals, including 2 recurrent variants p.G510S (n = 5) and p.G515S (n = 3). All 11 individuals had developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, with 8 having normal development prior to seizure onset at &amp;lt;2 years of age. All patients developed multiple seizure types, 9 of 11 patients had seizures triggered by fever and 9 of 11 patients had drug‐resistant seizures. In vitro analysis of HEK293T cells transfected with MAST3 cDNA carrying a subset of these patient‐specific missense variants demonstrated variable but generally lower expression, with concomitant increased phosphorylation of the MAST3 target, ARPP‐16, compared to wild‐type. These findings suggest the patient‐specific variants may confer MAST3 gain‐of‐function. Moreover, single‐nuclei RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry shows that MAST3 expression is restricted to excitatory neurons in the cortex late in prenatal development and postnatally.


Interpretation
In summary, we describe MAST3 as a novel epilepsy‐associated gene with a potential gain‐of‐function pathogenic mechanism that may be primarily restricted to excitatory neurons in the cortex. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: A β-Wrapin Targeting the N-Terminus of α-Synuclein Monomers Reduces Fibril-Induced Aggregation in Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.696440</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reducing α-synuclein pathology constitutes a plausible strategy against Parkinson’s disease. As we recently demonstrated, the β-wrapin protein AS69 binds an N-terminal region in monomeric α-synuclein, interferes with fibril nucleation, and reduces α-synuclein aggregation in vitro and in a fruit fly model of α-synuclein toxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether AS69 also reduces α-synuclein pathology in mammalian neurons. To induce α-synuclein pathology, primary mouse neurons were exposed to pre-formed fibrils (PFF) of human α-synuclein. PFF were also injected into the striatum of A30P-α-synuclein transgenic mice. The extent of α-synuclein pathology was determined by phospho-α-synuclein staining and by Triton X-100 solubility. The degeneration of neuronal somata, dendrites, and axon terminals was determined by immunohistochemistry. AS69 and PFF were taken up by primary neurons. AS69 did not alter PFF uptake, but AS69 did reduce PFF-induced α-synuclein pathology. PFF injection into mouse striatum led to α-synuclein pathology and dystrophic neurites. Co-injection of AS69 abrogated PFF-induced pathology. AS69 also reduced the PFF-induced degeneration of dopaminergic axon terminals in the striatum and the degeneration of dopaminergic dendrites in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. AS69 reduced the activation of astroglia but not microglia in response to PFF injection. Collectively, AS69 reduced PFF-induced α-synuclein pathology and the associated neurodegeneration in primary neurons and in mouse brain. Our data therefore suggest that small proteins binding the N-terminus of α-synuclein monomers are promising strategies to modify disease progression in Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Recording Strategies for High Channel Count, Densely Spaced Microelectrode Arrays</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.681085</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience research into how complex brain functions are implemented at an extra-cellular level requires in vivo neural recording interfaces, including microelectrodes and read-out circuitry, with increased observability and spatial resolution. The trend in neural recording interfaces toward employing high-channel-count probes or 2D microelectrodes arrays with densely spaced recording sites for recording large neuronal populations makes it harder to save on resources. The low-noise, low-power requirement specifications of the analog front-end usually requires large silicon occupation, making the problem even more challenging. One common approach to alleviating this consumption area burden relies on time-division multiplexing techniques in which read-out electronics are shared, either partially or totally, between channels while preserving the spatial and temporal resolution of the recordings. In this approach, shared elements have to operate over a shorter time slot per channel and active area is thus traded off against larger operating frequencies and signal bandwidths. As a result, power consumption is only mildly affected, although other performance metrics such as in-band noise or crosstalk may be degraded, particularly if the whole read-out circuit is multiplexed at the analog front-end input. In this article, we review the different implementation alternatives reported for time-division multiplexing neural recording systems, analyze their advantages and drawbacks, and suggest strategies for improving performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Understanding the origins of biodiversity has been an aspiration since the days of early naturalists. The immense complexity of ecological, evolutionary, and spatial processes, however, has made this goal elusive to this day. Computer models serve progress in many scientific fields, but in the fields of macroecology and macroevolution, eco-evolutionary models are comparatively less developed. We present a general, spatially explicit, eco-evolutionary engine with a modular implementation that enables the modeling of multiple macroecological and macroevolutionary processes and feedbacks across representative spatiotemporally dynamic landscapes. Modeled processes can include species’ abiotic tolerances, biotic interactions, dispersal, speciation, and evolution of ecological traits. Commonly observed biodiversity patterns, such as α, β, and γ diversity, species ranges, ecological traits, and phylogenies, emerge as simulations proceed. As an illustration, we examine alternative hypotheses expected to have shaped the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) during the Earth’s Cenozoic era. Our exploratory simulations simultaneously produce multiple realistic biodiversity patterns, such as the LDG, current species richness, and range size frequencies, as well as phylogenetic metrics. The model engine is open source and available as an R package, enabling future exploration of various landscapes and biological processes, while outputs can be linked with a variety of empirical biodiversity patterns. This work represents a key toward a numeric, interdisciplinary, and mechanistic understanding of the physical and biological processes that shape Earth’s biodiversity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ULZUEnUzPIg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by viral proliferation and clearance phases and can be followed by low-level persistent viral RNA shedding. The dynamics of viral RNA concentration, particularly in the early stages of infection, can inform clinical measures and interventions such as test-based screening. We used prospective longitudinal quantitative reverse transcription PCR testing to measure the viral RNA trajectories for 68 individuals during the resumption of the 2019–2020 National Basketball Association season. For 46 individuals with acute infections, we inferred the peak viral concentration and the duration of the viral proliferation and clearance phases. According to our mathematical model, we found that viral RNA concentrations peaked an average of 3.3 days (95% credible interval [CI] 2.5, 4.2) after first possible detectability at a cycle threshold value of 22.3 (95% CI 20.5, 23.9). The viral clearance phase lasted longer for symptomatic individuals (10.9 days [95% CI 7.9, 14.4]) than for asymptomatic individuals (7.8 days [95% CI 6.1, 9.7]). A second test within 2 days after an initial positive PCR test substantially improves certainty about a patient’s infection stage. The effective sensitivity of a test intended to identify infectious individuals declines substantially with test turnaround time. These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 viral concentrations peak rapidly regardless of symptoms. Sequential tests can help reveal a patient’s progress through infection stages. Frequent, rapid-turnaround testing is needed to effectively screen individuals before they become infectious.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/H6EMenEDFn0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Proteasome activity contributes to pro-survival response upon mild mitochondrial stress in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;</title>

Defects in mitochondrial function activate compensatory responses in the cell. Mitochondrial stress that is caused by unfolded proteins inside the organelle induces a transcriptional response (termed the “mitochondrial unfolded protein response” [UPRmt]) that is mediated by activating transcription factor associated with stress 1 (ATFS-1). The UPRmt increases mitochondrial protein quality control. Mitochondrial dysfunction frequently causes defects in the import of proteins, resulting in the accumulation of mitochondrial proteins outside the organelle. In yeast, cells respond to mistargeted mitochondrial proteins by increasing activity of the proteasome in the cytosol (termed the “unfolded protein response activated by mistargeting of proteins” [UPRam]). The presence and relevance of this response in higher eukaryotes is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that defects in mitochondrial protein import in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; lead to proteasome activation and life span extension. Both proteasome activation and life span prolongation partially depend on ATFS-1, despite its lack of influence on proteasomal gene transcription. Importantly, life span prolongation depends on the fully assembled proteasome. Our data provide a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and proteasomal activity and demonstrate its direct relevance to mechanisms that promote longevity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/sjzJcaVE5Lo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: ANXA1 with Anti‐Inflammatory Properties Might Contribute to Parkinsonism</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26148?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We here describe the identification of a novel variant in the anti‐inflammatory Annexin A1 protein likely to be the cause of disease in two siblings with autosomal recessive parkinsonism. The disease‐segregating variant was ascertained through a combination of homozygosity mapping and whole genome sequencing and was shown to impair phagocytosis in zebrafish mutant embryos. The highly conserved variant, absent in healthy individuals and public SNP databases, affected a functional domain of the protein with neuroprotective properties. This study supports the hypothesis that damaged microglia might lead to impairments in the clearance of accumulated and aggregated proteins resulting in parkinsonism.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Cell-Type-Specific Gene Expression in Developing Mouse Neocortex: Intermediate Progenitors Implicated in Axon Development</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.686034</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral cortex projection neurons (PNs) are generated from intermediate progenitors (IPs), which are in turn derived from radial glial progenitors (RGPs). To investigate developmental processes in IPs, we profiled IP transcriptomes in embryonic mouse neocortex, using transgenic Tbr2-GFP mice, cell sorting, and microarrays. These data were used in combination with in situ hybridization to ascertain gene sets specific for IPs, RGPs, PNs, interneurons, and other neural and non-neural cell types. RGP-selective transcripts (n = 419) included molecules for Notch receptor signaling, proliferation, neural stem cell identity, apical junctions, necroptosis, hippo pathway, and NF-κB pathway. RGPs also expressed specific genes for critical interactions with meningeal and vascular cells. In contrast, IP-selective genes (n = 136) encoded molecules for activated Delta ligand presentation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, core planar cell polarity (PCP), axon genesis, and intrinsic excitability. Interestingly, IPs expressed several “dependence receptors” (Unc5d, Dcc, Ntrk3, and Epha4) that induce apoptosis in the absence of ligand, suggesting a competitive mechanism for IPs and new PNs to detect key environmental cues or die. Overall, our results imply a novel role for IPs in the patterning of neuronal polarization, axon differentiation, and intrinsic excitability prior to mitosis. Significantly, IPs highly express Wnt-PCP, netrin, and semaphorin pathway molecules known to regulate axon polarization in other systems. In sum, IPs not only amplify neurogenesis quantitatively, but also molecularly “prime” new PNs for axogenesis, guidance, and excitability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Foveal Remodeling of Retinal Microvasculature in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.708700</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Retinal microvascular alterations have been previously described in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). However, an extensive description of retinal vascular morphological features, their association with PD-related clinical variables and their potential use as diagnostic biomarkers has not been explored.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We performed a cross-sectional study including 49 PD patients (87 eyes) and 40 controls (73 eyes). Retinal microvasculature was evaluated with Spectralis OCT-A and cognitive status with Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Unified PD Rating Scale and disease duration were recorded in patients. We extracted microvascular parameters from superficial and deep vascular plexuses of the macula, including the area and circularity of foveal avascular zone (FAZ), skeleton density, perfusion density, vessel perimeter index, vessel mean diameter, fractal dimension (FD) and lacunarity using Python and MATLAB. We compared the microvascular parameters between groups and explored their association with thickness of macular layers and clinical outcomes. Data were analyzed with General Estimating Equations (GEE) and adjusted for age, sex, and hypertension. Logistic regression GEE models were fitted to predict diagnosis of PD versus controls from microvascular, demographic, and clinical data. The discrimination ability of models was tested with receiver operating characteristic curves.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;FAZ area was significantly smaller in patients compared to controls in superficial and deep plexuses, whereas perfusion density, skeleton density, FD and lacunarity of capillaries were increased in the foveal zone of PD. In the parafovea, microvascular parameters of superficial plexus were associated with ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness, but this was mainly driven by PD with mild cognitive impairment. No such associations were observed in controls. FAZ area was negatively associated with cognition in PD (non-adjusted models). Foveal lacunarity, combined with demographic and clinical confounding factors, yielded an outstanding diagnostic accuracy for discriminating PD patients from controls.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease patients displayed foveal microvascular alterations causing an enlargement of the vascular bed surrounding FAZ. Parafoveal microvascular alterations were less pronounced but were related to inner retinal layer thinning. Retinal microvascular abnormalities helped discriminating PD from controls. All this supports OCT-A as a potential non-invasive biomarker to reveal vascular pathophysiology and improve diagnostic accuracy in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: MRI Radiomic Signature of White Matter Hyperintensities Is Associated With Clinical Phenotypes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.691244</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging measurements of brain structural integrity are thought to be surrogates for brain health, but precise assessments require dedicated advanced image acquisitions. By means of quantitatively describing conventional images, radiomic analyses hold potential for evaluating brain health. We sought to: (1) evaluate radiomics to assess brain structural integrity by predicting white matter hyperintensities burdens (WMH) and (2) uncover associations between predictive radiomic features and clinical phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We analyzed a multi-site cohort of 4,163 acute ischemic strokes (AIS) patients with T2-FLAIR MR images with total brain and WMH segmentations. Radiomic features were extracted from normal-appearing brain tissue (brain mask–WMH mask). Radiomics-based prediction of personalized WMH burden was done using ElasticNet linear regression. We built a radiomic signature of WMH with stable selected features predictive of WMH burden and then related this signature to clinical variables using canonical correlation analysis (CCA).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Radiomic features were predictive of WMH burden (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.855 ± 0.011). Seven pairs of canonical variates (CV) significantly correlated the radiomics signature of WMH and clinical traits with respective canonical correlations of 0.81, 0.65, 0.42, 0.24, 0.20, 0.15, and 0.15 (FDR-corrected p-values&lt;sub&gt;CV&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, p-value&lt;sub&gt;CV&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.012). The clinical CV1 was mainly influenced by age, CV2 by sex, CV3 by history of smoking and diabetes, CV4 by hypertension, CV5 by atrial fibrillation (AF) and diabetes, CV6 by coronary artery disease (CAD), and CV7 by CAD and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Radiomics extracted from T2-FLAIR images of AIS patients capture microstructural damage of the cerebral parenchyma and correlate with clinical phenotypes, suggesting different radiographical textural abnormalities per cardiovascular risk profile. Further research could evaluate radiomics to predict the progression of WMH and for the follow-up of stroke patients’ brain health.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: The Evoked Compound Action Potential as a Predictor for Perception in Chronic Pain Patients: Tools for Automatic Spinal Cord Stimulator Programming and Control</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.673998</link>
	<content:encoded>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a drug free treatment for chronic pain. Recent technological advances have enabled sensing of the evoked compound action potential (ECAP), a biopotential that represents neural activity elicited from SCS. The amplitudes of many SCS paradigms – both sub- and supra-threshold – are programmed relative to the patient’s perception of SCS. The objective of this study, then, is to elucidate relationships between the ECAP and perception thresholds across posture and SCS pulse width. These relationships may be used for the automatic control and perceptually referenced programming of SCS systems.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;ECAPs were acquired from 14 subjects across a range of postures and pulse widths with swept amplitude stimulation. Perception (PT) and discomfort (DT) thresholds were recorded. A stimulation artifact reduction scheme was employed, and growth curves were constructed from the sweeps. An estimate of the ECAP threshold (ET), was calculated from the growth curves using a novel approach. Relationships between ET, PT, and DT were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;ETs were estimated from 112 separate growth curves. For the postures and pulse widths assessed, the ET tightly correlated with both PT (r = 0.93; p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and DT (r = 0.93; p &amp;lt; 0.0001). The median accuracy of ET as a predictor for PT across both posture and pulse width was 0.5 dB. Intra-subject, ECAP amplitudes at DT varied up to threefold across posture.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We provide evidence that the ET varies across both different positions and varying pulse widths and suggest that this variance may be the result of postural dependence of the recording electrode-tissue spacing. ET-informed SCS holds promise as a tool for SCS parameter configuration and may offer more accuracy over alternative approaches for neural and perceptual control in closed loop SCS systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.666020</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a safe method to examine human brain. However, a typical MR scan is very sensitive to motion, and it requires the subject to lie still during the acquisition, which is a major challenge for pediatric scans. Consequently, in a clinical setting, sedation or general anesthesia is often used. In the research setting including healthy subjects anesthetics are not recommended for ethical reasons and potential longer-term harm. Here we review the methods used to prepare a child for an MRI scan, but also on the techniques and tools used during the scanning to enable a successful scan. Additionally, we critically evaluate how studies have reported the scanning procedure and success of scanning. We searched articles based on special subject headings from PubMed and identified 86 studies using brain MRI in healthy subjects between 0 and 6 years of age. Scan preparations expectedly depended on subject’s age; infants and young children were scanned asleep after feeding and swaddling and older children were scanned awake. Comparing the efficiency of different procedures was difficult because of the heterogeneous reporting of the used methods and the success rates. Based on this review, we recommend more detailed reporting of scanning procedure to help find out which are the factors affecting the success of scanning. In the long term, this could help the research field to get high quality data, but also the clinical field to reduce the use of anesthetics. Finally, we introduce the protocol used in scanning 2 to 5-week-old infants in the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study, and tips for calming neonates during the scans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Prefrontal GABAergic Interneurons Gate Long-Range Afferents to Regulate Prefrontal Cortex-Associated Complex Behaviors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.716408</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prefrontal cortical GABAergic interneurons (INs) and their innervations are essential for the execution of complex behaviors such as working memory, social behavior, and fear expression. These behavior regulations are highly dependent on primary long-range afferents originating from the subcortical structures such as mediodorsal thalamus (MD), ventral hippocampus (vHPC), and basolateral amygdala (BLA). In turn, the regulatory effects of these inputs are mediated by activation of parvalbumin-expressing (PV) and/or somatostatin expressing (SST) INs within the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here we review how each of these long-range afferents from the MD, vHPC, or BLA recruits a subset of the prefrontal interneuron population to exert precise control of specific PFC-dependent behaviors. Specifically, we first summarize the anatomical connections of different long-range inputs formed on prefrontal GABAergic INs, focusing on PV versus SST cells. Next, we elaborate on the role of prefrontal PV- and SST- INs in regulating MD afferents-mediated cognitive behaviors. We also examine how prefrontal PV- and SST- INs gate vHPC afferents in spatial working memory and fear expression. Finally, we discuss the possibility that prefrontal PV-INs mediate fear conditioning, predominantly driven by the BLA-mPFC pathway. This review will provide a broad view of how multiple long-range inputs converge on prefrontal interneurons to regulate complex behaviors and novel future directions to understand how PFC controls different behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Laser-Induced Apoptosis of Corticothalamic Neurons in Layer VI of Auditory Cortex Impact on Cortical Frequency Processing</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.659280</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Corticofugal projections outnumber subcortical input projections by far. However, the specific role for signal processing of corticofugal feedback is still less well understood in comparisonto the feedforward projection. Here, we lesioned corticothalamic (CT) neurons in layers V and/or VI of the auditory cortex of Mongolian gerbils by laser-induced photolysis to investigate their contribution to cortical activation patterns. We have used laminar current-source density (CSD) recordings of tone-evoked responses and could show that, particularly, lesion of CT neurons in layer VI affected cortical frequency processing. Specifically, we found a decreased gain of best-frequency input in thalamocortical (TC)-recipient input layers that correlated with the relative lesion of layer VI neurons, but not layer V neurons. Using cortical silencing with the GABA&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-agonist muscimol and layer-specific intracortical microstimulation (ICMS), we found that direct activation of infragranular layers recruited a local recurrent cortico-thalamo-cortical loop of synaptic input. This recurrent feedback was also only interrupted when lesioning layer VI neurons, but not cells in layer V. Our study thereby shows distinct roles of these two types of CT neurons suggesting a particular impact of CT feedback from layer VI to affect the local feedforward frequency processing in auditory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
